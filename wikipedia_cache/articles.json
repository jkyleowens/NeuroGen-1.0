    "text": "Lois Cleveland Chiles (born April 15, 1947) is an American actress and former fashion model known for her role as Holly Goodhead in the James Bond film Moonraker (1979), and as a hit-and-run driver in Creepshow 2 (1987). Other screen credits include The Way We Were (1973), The Great Gatsby (1974), Death on the Nile (1978), Broadcast News (1987), and the television role of Holly Harwood on Dallas (1982–1983).\n\n\nEarly and personal life\nChiles was born in Houston, the daughter of Marion Clay Chiles and Barbara Wayne Kirkland Chiles. Her paternal uncle was oil tycoon and Texas Rangers owner Eddie Chiles. She had two brothers: Clay Kirkland Chiles (died 1979), and William Edmonds Chiles, president and CEO of Bristow Group, Inc. She was raised in Alice, Texas.\nChiles studied at the University of Texas at Austin and the former Finch College in New York City, where she was discovered by a Glamour editor looking for a young woman to feature on the cover of the magazine's annual college issue. She landed the job and soon had contracts with Wilhelmina Models in New York and Elite Models in Paris. Later, she studied acting under Roy London and Sandy Meisner, among many others. In her New York years, she befriended among others, Tennessee Williams, as well as Andy Warhol, Maureen Stapleton, and models Patty Hanson and Grace Jones.\nChiles moved from New York to Los Angeles around 1978 when she felt she no longer wanted to pursue modeling and focus on acting only.  It was also around this time that she lost her younger brother to cancer. Clay Chiles was 25 when he died in 1978 at M.D. Anderson of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which affected her deeply.\nShe dated Don Henley but the relationship ended, and later for a time, dated William S. Paley.  In 2005, she married money manager Richard Gilder. They were both honorary co-chairs of Northfield Mount Hermon, a school in Massachusetts. Gilder donated money to the school and they named the Chiles Theater after her.  Gilder died in 2020.\n\n\nCareer\nChiles enjoyed a successful modeling career in the early 1970s. After her role in the` 1972 blaxploitation film Together for Days opposite Clifton Davis, Chiles appeared in supporting roles in some of the biggest films of the 1970s.  She played the college girlfriend of Robert Redford in the successful 1973 studio release The Way We Were.  She was then cast as Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby (1974) alongside Mia Farrow and, once again, Redford. She again shared the screen with Farrow in the Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile (1978). She also appeared in a small but key role in the thriller Coma (1978).\nIn her most famous role as NASA astronaut, scientist, and Bond girl Dr. Holly Goodhead, Chiles appeared opposite Roger Moore in Moonraker (1979). Chiles had initially been approached to star in the previous Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, but she declined the role because she was taking a break from acting at the time. \nShe appeared in the music video for the Tony Powers song Odyssey in 1982.\nChiles lost her youngest brother to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1978, which contributed to her decision to take a three-year hiatus from acting. The time away took a toll on her film career, and she struggled to find roles of the caliber she previously enjoyed.  Still, she appeared as a season-long guest star in the 1982–1983 season of television's Dallas, playing independent oil heiress Holly Harwood who becomes entangled with Bobby and J.R. Ewing.  Her film roles were smaller, though film critic Pauline Kael gave her good notices for her performances in Alan Alda's Sweet Liberty (1986) and her portrayal of reporter Jennifer Mack in James L. Brooks' Broadcast News (1987) was also well received, as was her turn in George A. Romero's horror flick Creepshow 2 in 1987, as a hit-and-run driver. In 1989, she appeared uncredited in a cameo as the estranged mother of Ione Skye's character in Say Anything... (1989).\nIn 1985, she appeared as \"Maggie\" in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in Los Angeles opposite Terence Knox and directed by Jose Ferrer. She stated that it was a major personal triumph to play the demanding role for her as she was not stage-trained.\nShe has since appeared as a stuffy high-school principal in the 1996 Disney film Wish Upon a Star, and as a frightened cruise passenger in the critically panned Speed 2: Cruise Control in 1997. She made a cameo appearance in the international release of the 1997 Bond spoof Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, though her scene was cut from the United States release.\nOther episodic television work included guest appearances in series such as Hart to Hart (as a psychotic split-personality model), In the Heat of the Night, Murder, She Wrote, and The Nanny. Later career high points included the indie films Diary of a Hitman (1991) and Curdled (1996). In 2005, friend Quentin Tarantino, with whom she had previously worked on the set of Curdled, recruited her to appear in the two-episode finale of season five of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which he wrote and directed.\nIn the spring of 2002, she taught a course in film acting at the University of Houston. Unlike some \"Bond girls\", Chiles has said that \"being a Bond girl is a fun way to be remembered\", although she jokes that being asked to sigh \"Oh, James\" is annoying because \"you can't live up to people's fantasies\". On other occasions, she stated \"I'm proud I'm a Bond Girl. It's not bad at all.\"\nMostly retired from film, she has spent her later years focusing on art and dividing her time between Houston and New York. She returned to film for the first time in 14 years in Guns & Moses in 2024.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nLois Chiles at IMDb\nLois Chiles at Turner Classic Movies\nInterview with Lois Chiles focusing on her role on \"Dallas\"",

The most common surname in Finland was Virtanen before 2009, when the number of people with the surname Korhonen exceeded the number of people with the surname Virtanen for the first time.\nThe word korho is not used in standard Finnish, but it and words derived from it are used in some dialects, and there are also related words both in standard Finnish and in closely related languages. In Karelian korhottoa means 'to be or move upright', 'to have one's head up high', 'to raise', 'to shake threateningly', 'to brandish', and 'to perk up one's ears', and korhota means 'to rise', 'to move up or upwards', 'to get up', 'to go up', 'to become wealthy', and 'to become rich'. Kohottaa, korottaa, and kohota are the most similar words in standard Finnish.\nKorho has meant 'proud', 'rich', and 'boastful' in the southern parts of Finnish Lapland, and in Satakunta and Pirkanmaa it has meant 'large man'. In some dialects it has meant 'hearing-impaired', and it seems that this meaning was most likely derived from the 'to perk up one's ears' sense of korhottaa. In some places it has meant 'slightly stupid', 'inattentive', and 'clumsy': it appears likely that these meanings were derived from the 'hearing-impaired' sense. Dialectal nouns derived from korho are, for example, korhopää from Pöytyä meaning roughly 'one with a head of upright hair', and korholaiho from Ylistaro meaning 'a crop of cereal growing upright'.\nThe name originates from eastern Finland and is much older than its closest competitor for the title of the most common Finnish surname, Virtanen.\n\n\nPeople with the surname\nAki Korhonen (born 1969), Finnish ice hockey player\nAku Korhonen (1892−1960), Finnish actor\nAnna-Reeta Korhonen\nCassandra Korhonen, Swedish footballer\nEmilia Korhonen\nErkki Korhonen (born 1956), Finnish director of opera, pianist\nGunnar Korhonen (1918–2001), Finnish politician\nJanne Korhonen (taekwondo) (born 1970), Finnish taekwondoin\nJanne Korhonen (footballer) (born 1979), Finnish footballer\nJoni Korhonen, footballer\nJorma Korhonen,  Finnish judoka\nJuha Korhonen\nKaisa Korhonen,  Finnish theatre director, actor, singer and dramaturge\nKalle Korhonen (1878–1938), Finnish politician\nKari Korhonen (born 1973), Finnish cartoonist\nKari Korhonen (biologist)\nKeijo Korhonen (politician) (1934–2022), Finnish politician (foreign minister) and professor\nKeijo Korhonen (ski jumper) (born 1956), Finnish ski jumper\nKlaus Korhonen\nLasse Korhonen\nMarko Korhonen\nMarkus Korhonen (born 1975), Finnish ice hockey player\nMartti Korhonen (born 1953), Finnish member of parliament\nMikko Korhonen, golfer\nPaavo Korhonen (1928–2019), Finnish Nordic combined skier\nPekka Korhonen (born 1955), Finnish political scientist and professor\nPentti Korhonen (born 1951), Finnish motorcycle racer\nRachna Korhonen, American diplomat\nRasmus Korhonen\nRiku Korhonen\nRiku Korhonen (gymnast)\nRisto Korhonen\nRoope Korhonen\nTimo Korhonen\nTina Korhonen\nUnto Korhonen\nUrpo Korhonen (1923–2009), Finnish cross-country skier\nVille Korhonen\nVille Korhonen (politician)\nWäinö Korhonen, Finnish modern pentathlete and épée fencer\n\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Korhonen\n2988 Korhonen, minor planet\n\n\nReferences",

He was active in the family business in Kassel and served as captain of the Maggia Valley and Lavizzara Valley.\n\n\nEarly life and family\nMichele Pedrazzini was born in 1712 in Campo, Vallemaggia, the fifth of ten children of Giovanni Battista Pedrazzini, a merchant, and Marta Camani. Despite not being the eldest son, his father chose him as heir over his older brother Giovanni Pietro Pedrazzini, who was probably excluded from the succession due to a disability and received land in compensation for this exclusion.\nIn 1737, Giovanni Battista Pedrazzini transferred his shares in the Kassel store to Michele. The same year, Michele married Giovanna Fantina, with whom he had four daughters. After becoming a widower, he remarried in 1753 to Maria Justa Camani, daughter of Carlo Antonio Camani, a merchant from Cimalmotto established in Parma. The couple had no children together. For his two daughters who reached adulthood and whom he designated as heirs to his substantial patrimony, Michele Pedrazzini arranged marriages with the sons of his cousin Giovanni Battista Pedrazzini, thus avoiding the extinction of his lineage.\n\n\nCareer\nMichele Pedrazzini, a reputed and competent entrepreneur, is documented from 1727 in the Kassel business. He dedicated himself tirelessly to its management, giving it a personal touch. Active in the Hessian city until around the late 1750s, he served as tribune (1750) and then as standard-bearer (1758). His successful merchant career allowed him to increase his patrimony consisting of lands and buildings located between the Maggia Valley and Gambarogno, as well as several credits, which he managed with particular skill.\nIn 1759, he was appointed captain of the Maggia Valley and Lavizzara Valley, a title that honored the reputation he had also acquired with the authorities of the bailiwick.\n\n\nPatronage and cultural activities\nIn his homeland, Michele Pedrazzini promoted and financed numerous initiatives. These included the construction and decoration of the oratory of Saint John the Baptist in Campo, commissioned by his father, the creation of the fresco cycle in the parish church of Saint Bernard, and the production of precious sacred ornaments for local churches. His reputation, refinement, and prosperity were also manifested in his extensive collection of paintings and numerous valuable objects that he had brought from abroad to embellish his house in Campo.\n\n\nDeath\nMichele Pedrazzini died in 1763 at his home in Campo, where he had spent his final years after retiring from active business in Kassel.\n\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text from a free content work.

    "text": "The blackstart (Oenanthe melanura) is a chat found in desert regions in North Africa, the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. It is resident throughout its range.\nThe blackstart is 14 cm (5.5 in) long and is named for its black tail, which is frequently fanned; the rest of its plumage is bluish-grey or grey-brown (North African races being browner, Middle Eastern races bluer). The sexes are similar. The song is a clear melancholy whistle: CHURlee...TRUloo...CHURlee...TRUlur..., with short phrases from the song used as a call.\nThe habitats of blackstarts are rocky deserts and mountain slopes; they nest in rock crevices lay 3–4 eggs. They feed on insects, taken mainly on the ground. The blackstart is a confident species, unafraid of people.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe first formal description of the blackstart was by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824 under the binomial name Saxicola melanura. The blackstart was included as the type species in the genus Cercomela introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2010 and 2012 found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the blackstart, phylogenetically nested within the genus Oenanthe. As part of a reorganization of the species to create monotypic genera, the blackstart was assigned to the genus Oenanthe. The specific epithet melanura is from the classical Greek melanouros meaning \"with a black tail\" from melas \"black\" and oura \"tail\".\nSix subspecies are recognised:\n\nO. m. melanura (Temminck, 1824) – northeast Egypt to Israel, Jordan and central Saudi Arabia\nO. m. neumanni (Ripley, 1952) – southwest Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman\nO. m. lypura (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833) – north-central Sudan to Eritrea\nO. m. aussae (Thesiger & Meynell, 1934) – northeast Ethiopia, Djibouti and north Somalia\nO. m. airensis (Hartert, 1921) – north Niger to central Sudan\nO. m. ultima (Bates, 1933) – east Mali and west Niger\nThe subspecies differ slightly in the colour of their plumage.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe blackstart is around 14 cm (5.5 in) in length with a wingspan of 23–27 cm (9.1–10.6 in) and a weight of around 15 g (0.53 oz).  The nominate race O. m. melanura has blueish ash-grey upperparts with darker wings and a black rump and tail. The belly and under-wings are greyish white; the bill and legs are black. The sexes are similar. The North African subspecies O. m. lypura and O. m. airensis are browner than the nominate.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nIn Egypt, the blackstart is common in the Sinai Peninsula\nIn Israel the species is primarily found in the Negev Desert, Arava Valley and Dead Sea areas; it is present in areas of the Jordan River valley further north, but is scarcer there.\nIn Jordan, the species is only found in western parts of the country, in areas from the Jordan River valley south through the Dead Sea region to the Arava Valley and Aqaba Mountains.\n\n\nBreeding\nThe blackstart is monogamous and pairs remain on their breeding territory throughout the year. The nest is built entirely by the female and can be placed between boulders, in a rock crevice or in a disused burrow. The nest is a shallow cup of grass and leaves lined with hair and fine plant material. The female usually places small pebbles around the entrance of the nest. The 3 or 4 pale blue eggs with fine red-brown speckles are laid at daily intervals. They measure 19.6 mm × 14.7 mm (0.77 in × 0.58 in) and weigh 2.26 g (0.080 oz). They are incubated by the female and hatch after 13–14 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge after around 14 days. Up to three broods can be raised in a year.\nA study conducted in Israel on the west shore of the Dead Sea found that a major cause of nest failure was the predation of the eggs by Golden and Cairo spiny mice.\n\n\nStatus\nThe species has a wide distribution range, stable population trends, and is presumed to have a large population, although precise estimates have not been conducted. As a result, it is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAndrews, Ian J.

    "text": "Team Thor is a series of American direct-to-video mockumentary short films produced by Marvel Studios, featuring characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Initially released from 2016 to 2018, they were included as special features in the MCU films' Blu-ray and digital distribution releases and are the sixth through eighth Marvel One-Shot short films. The series consists of Team Thor, Team Thor: Part 2, and Team Darryl, all written and directed by Taika Waititi.\nChris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor in the first two films, in which he moves in with a new roommate, Darryl Jacobson (Daley Pearson), during the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016). Mark Ruffalo also appears in the first film as Bruce Banner, while Jeff Goldblum appears in the third as the Grandmaster, whom Darryl lives with after moving to Los Angeles. Filming for Team Thor occurred one month before the start of filming on Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and was done to introduce MCU fans to the irreverent tone of Ragnarok.\nThe shorts were praised for their humor and Hemsworth's performance. They were made available on Disney+ in January 2022, at which point Marvel classified them as One-Shots.\n\n\nDevelopment\nTeam Thor was filmed one month before Thor: Ragnarok (2017) began filming in July 2016. It is a mockumentary, similar to director Taika Waititi's film What We Do in the Shadows (2014). Before Team Thor was released, many fans were unsure of Waititi's new tonal approach for Ragnarok. Waititi felt Team Thor \"helped us a lot\" by giving fans the opportunity to see \"just how irreverent we were gonna be, and just how different we were making Thor, and [Bruce] Banner as well\". In September 2016, Waititi said Darryl Jacobson would probably be seen again, adding that there may be \"other little pieces of [Team Thor] that may just be a small part of a bigger thing\".\nIn October 2017, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige stated that he saw the shorts as a \"doable\" version of their previous Marvel One-Shots shorts series, and felt that they \"in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in Ragnarok in a fun way.\" As well, Jeff Goldblum, who portrays the Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok, stated he had shot footage with Waititi for another short, which became Team Darryl. The three shorts were made available on Disney+ in January 2022, at which point Marvel classified them as One-Shots.\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nTeam Thor (2016)\nAfter saving Earth with the Avengers, Thor takes a short break in Australia where he lives with a local office worker, Darryl Jacobson. As he does this, he is interviewed by a film crew and talks about his daily life in Australia. Thor is seen visiting a kindergarten classroom, attempting to send emails with Darryl's help to Tony Stark and Steve Rogers concerning their conflict, and revealing his investigative board concerning the connections between the Infinity Stones, the Avengers, Nick Fury, and Thanos. Later, Thor meets Bruce Banner at a café regarding not being contacted by Stark and Rogers. Banner receives a phone call from Stark, who does not appear to want to reach out or talk to Thor. As such, Thor decides to start his own team, Team Thor, with him and Darryl.\nTeam Thor was first screened at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, before being released online on August 28, 2016. It was also released on the digital home media of Captain America: Civil War (2016) in September 2016. The film is also known as While You Were Fighting: A Thor Mockumentary. The mockumentary was said to have been produced by the \"New Zealand Film Board\", and its title card features a grainy, VHS-style logo of Captain America: Civil War with \"Team Thor\" \"crudely put over it\". Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo reprise their Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) roles as Thor and Bruce Banner, respectively, with Daley Pearson appearing as Thor's Australian flatmate Darryl Jacobson. The film was referred to as Team Thor: Part 1 with its release on Disney+ in January 2022.\n\n\nTeam Thor: Part 2 (2017)\nContinuing from the first mockumentary, Thor and his roommate Darryl discuss their domestic responsibilities at their apartment, with Darryl being stuck with most of the cleaning. Darryl then proceeds to state how Thor is a nice person but out of touch with time, and becomes frustrated with Thor's attempts to pay rent with Asgardian currency. He suggests Thor look for a job, which Thor laughs at and counters by suggesting they get a servant. Additional footage from Thor's visit to the kindergarten classroom is shown. The interview ends with Thor feeling he does not need anyone else in his life besides Darryl, and suggests that Darryl get a superhero outfit.\nTeam Thor: Part 2 was released on the home media of Doctor Strange (2016) in February 2017, with Hemsworth and Pearson both returning. The film is also known as Team Thor: Part 2, Where Are They Now?\n\n\nTeam Darryl (2018)\nAfter Thor moved out of Darryl's apartment, Darryl moves to Los Angeles and becomes roommates with the Grandmaster, the only person who responded to his ads. The Grandmaster believes Darryl would be a good replacement assistant and various clips are shown of Darryl performing menial tasks for the Grandmaster, such as taking out the trash and driving him around. Darryl goes on to describe how the Grandmaster seems like a good person but has issues understanding Darryl's personal space and has his own anger issues. The Grandmaster states he has grown accustomed to Earth and plans to take it over, with Darryl standing at his side. He creates a video explaining his plan and posts it to the internet. However, after receiving no views, he plans to advertise the first video by posting a second video with a musical guest. He hires Darryl's friends to help him but melts one of them when his expectations are not met. Darryl confesses he is unsure if the Grandmaster also wants to melt him, and admits he misses Thor as his roommate.\nTeam Darryl was released on digital download for Thor: Ragnarok on February 20, 2018, and on Blu-ray on March 6. Pearson reprises his role as Darryl and is joined by Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster. It is set after the events of Thor: Ragnarok and is a continuation from the film's post-credits scene.\n\n\nCast and characters\n\n\nReception\n\nDespite being \"a silly little short\", Ethan Anderton of /Film found Team Thor to be hilarious, as did Germain Lussier at io9, who felt Ragnarok would be amazing if it had \"an iota of this humor\". Anderton later added that similar short films like Team Thor would be a great replacement for the Marvel One-Shots. Collider's Tommy Cook and Adam Chitwood also enjoyed the short, with Cook feeling it \"perfectly captured Waititi's irreverent sense of humor\" and praised Hemsworth's comedic abilities, while Chitwood said there were \"a number of really funny touches\" and noted Hemsworth and Waititi were a good comedic fit. Ross A. Lincoln of Deadline Hollywood enjoyed the film and Hemsworth's comedy as well, calling it one of the biggest highlights from Marvel's Comic-Con panel and hoping that it served as a good indication for how Ragnarok would turn out. Don Kaye at Syfy Wire called Team Thor \"one of the best movies Marvel has ever made\".\nIn anticipation of Part 2 releasing, Nathalie Caron from Syfy Wire noted by its teaser that it was \"using the same brand of humor that made the first... such a massive hit with fans everywhere\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Aaron Couch called Part 2 \"the sequel no one could accuse of suffering from sequelitis\". Alexandra August at Comic Book Resources called Team Darryl \"just as hilarious as the Team Thor installments before it, if a little (way) more disturbing\".\n\n\nRelated content and future\nIn August 2018, Daley Pearson released a video reprising his role as Darryl to state he survived the Blip, as seen in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and is forced to work weekends since many of his co-workers did not survive. He also wishes Thor a happy birthday and asks him if he can transfer any money, as Darryl is now in debt. In April 2019, Hemsworth expressed interest in doing more Team Thor short films, with the possibility of doing a television series. Pearson appears as Darryl in Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) as a New Asgard tour guide.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nTeam Thor on YouTube\nTeam Thor at IMDb\nTeam Thor: Part 2 at IMDb\nTeam Darryl at IMDb",

She later became a member of the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic religious order, and taught at the Sacred Heart College in her hometown of Ballarat, Victoria.\n\n\nMusical career\nHealy was born in Ballarat East, Victoria, Australia, the daughter of Michael John and Mary Helena Healy. She attended a Catholic secondary school, Sacred Heart College, in Ballarat. At an early age, Healy showed great talent as a violinist. She began performing at age ten in Royal South Street Society competitions, winning several awards. She won the first place for solo violin at the First Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in 1907 in Melbourne. As a result of her successful performances, she earned a scholarship to the Albert Street Conservatorium of Music in Melbourne. In 1914, she travelled to Europe, where she studied with German violinist Siegfried Eberhardt, in Berlin. Her sister Kathleen travelled with her. In the summer of 1914, Healy travelled to England.

The Japanese Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) supported the design and fabrication of the satellites. The constellation was launched by a Falcon 9 rocket to the International Space Station on 3 June 2017, as part of CRS-11, where it was released from the Kibō module into space. Japan, Ghana, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh participated in the Birds-1 program, all building identical satellites for the constellation.\nAll of the Birds-1 satellites were deorbited in May 2019.\n\n\nBackground\nThe Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) in Japan supports non-spacefaring countries to build their first satellite through a program called The Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Satellite project (BIRDS). Five countries participated in the first Bird program: Japan, Ghana, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. The Birds project logo was designed by Ghanaian student Ernest Teye Matey.\nThe Nigerian government had a background with satellites but had never built one before Birds-1. Sometimes Mazaalai was referred to as Mongolia's first satellite, but it was launched by Bermuda-based company ABS and built by U.S. company Boeing. It was co-branded as MongolSat-1 after launch. Birds-1 successfully launched the first satellite for Bangladesh, Ghana, Mongolia, and Nigeria.\n\n\nDevelopment and design\n\nFive countries built identical satellites: Bangladesh (BRAC Onnesha), Japan (Toki), Mongolia (Mazaalai), Ghana (GhanaSat-1), and Nigeria (Nigeria EduSat-1). Each satellite cost about US$500,000 to manufacture and launch. The satellites were 10 centimetres (3.9 in) cubes in the 1U CubeSat class, weighing around 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) each. Power was generated from solar cells and stored in batteries. They carried 0.3 megapixel and 5 megapixel cameras to image the Earth. The constellation could also transmit music and other sounds back to Earth. The satellites also contained provisions to measure the effects of solar radiation on commercial microprocessors and could measure air density. The satellites were expected to remain in orbit for 1.1 years.\n\n\nMission\n\n\nLaunch\n\nSpaceX launched the constellation on its CRS-11 mission to the International Space Station on 3 June 2017. Birds-1 was carried in a Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon 9 rocket, launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center Pad LC-39A, the 100th launch from that pad. This was the first time SpaceX had reused one of its Dragon capsules.\nThe satellites were ejected from the Kibō module of the International Space Station on 7 July 2017. On ejection, astronaut Jack Fischer said on Twitter, \"Another great example of International Cooperation today on @Space_Station -- launched 5 micro-satellites from 5 countries off the JAXA arm!\"\nThe constellation orbited the Earth at an altitude of 400 kilometres (250 mi) and at an inclination of 51.61°. The satellites travelled around the Earth every 91 minutes at a velocity of 7.67 kilometres per second (4.77 mi/s).\n\n\nOperations\nThe satellites communicated with seven ground stations: one in each of the countries participating in the Birds-1 program, and one each in Thailand and Taiwan. The same radio frequency was used for all of the satellites. The constellation could have music uploaded via a digi-singer. It was processed on the satellite, then transmitted to Earth with an ultra high frequency (UHF) antenna as voice FM data.\nGhana intended to use the data to help monitor illegal mining and map the coastline. BRAC Onnesha's purpose was to image and analyze vegetation and forestry, urbanisation, flood, water resources, and urbanization. The purpose of Nigeria EduSat-1 was more educational in nature; it was planned to be a technology demonstrator and to familiarize Nigerians with spacecraft design. Mazaalai's intended use was to conduct independent space studies and help mitigate natural disasters.\nThe five satellites deorbited in May 2019.\n\n\nFuture work\nJapan's work with non-spacefaring countries continued with Birds-2 in 2018 with the Philippines, Bhutan, and Malaysia. Mongolia planned to launch a second satellite in 2019. Ghana planned to build GhanaSat-2 and GhanaSat-3, with GhanaSat-2 focusing on water pollution, illegal mining, and deforestation.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "title": "HP Time-Shared BASIC",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1887719",
    "text": "HP Time-Shared BASIC (HP TSB) is a BASIC programming language interpreter for  Hewlett-Packard's HP 2000 line of minicomputer-based time-sharing computer systems. TSB is historically notable as the platform that released the first public versions of the game Star Trek.\nThe system implements a dialect of BASIC as well as a rudimentary user account and program library that allows multiple people to use the system at once. The systems were a major force in the early-to-mid 1970s and generated a large number of programs. HP maintained a database of contributed-programs and customers could order them on punched tape for a nominal fee.\nMost BASICs of the 1970s trace their history to the original Dartmouth BASIC of the 1960s, but early versions of Dartmouth did not handle string variables or offer string manipulation features. Vendors added their own solutions; HP used a system similar to Fortran and other languages with array slicing, while DEC later introduced the MID/LEFT/RIGHT functions.\nAs microcomputers began to enter the market in the mid-1970s, many new BASICs appeared that based their parsers on DEC's or HP's syntax. Altair BASIC, the original version of what became Microsoft BASIC, was patterned on DEC's BASIC-PLUS. Others, including Apple's Integer BASIC, Atari BASIC and North Star BASIC were patterned on the HP style. This made conversions between these platforms somewhat difficult if string handling was encountered.\n\n\nNomenclature\nThe software was also known by its versioned name, tied to the hardware version on which it ran, such as HP 2000C Time-Shared BASIC and the operating system came in different varieties — 2000A, 2000B, 2000C, High-Speed 2000C, 2000E, and 2000F.\nHP also referred to the language as \"Access BASIC\" in some publications. This matched the naming of the machines on which it ran, known as the \"2000/Access\" in some publications. This terminology appears to have been used only briefly when the platform was first launched.\n\n\nPlatform details\nExcept for the 2000A and 2000E systems, the system is implemented using a dual-processor architecture. One fully configured HP 2100-series processor is used for the execution of most of the system code and all of the user code, while a second, smaller HP 2100-series processor is used to handle the RS-232 serial lines through which the time-sharing users connected. Depending on the hardware configuration, the system supports up to 16 or up to 32 simultaneous remote users.\nThe usual terminal for a TSB system was a Teletype Model 33 ASR and connected directly to the I/O processor or through a modem or acoustic coupler. Account names are a combination of one alphabetic character, followed by three decimal digits, e.g., B001. Privileged accounts started with the letter \"A\" and had some additional command and program storage capabilities. The superuser account is A000. This scheme allows up to 26,000 user accounts.\nDuring execution, user programs are swapped to a fixed head drive — physically a disk, but operating like a magnetic drum. When not executing, user programs are stored on moving-head cartridge- or pack-loaded disk storage. Privileged users can also store programs on the much-faster drum. The hard drive was backed up to magnetic tape.\nProgram and file names consist of a mix of up to six alphabetic characters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9). Programs are stored in a tokenized format, using the SAVE command. They can also be stored in a semi-compiled format, using the CSAVE command, which allows them to start quicker. Since the system was closely tied to the use of commonly available teleprinters, line endings in files consisted of the carriage return character (ASCII CR, 0D hexadecimal), followed by the linefeed character (ASCII LF, 0A hexadecimal).\n\n\nSyntax\nThe language is a fairly standard implementation of BASIC, providing an integrated editing and runtime environment. Statements are analyzed for correct syntax as they are entered and then stored in tokenized form. Each BASIC statement has to be on a uniquely numbered line, e.g.\n\nLine numbers are mandatory, and statements are automatically placed in ascending numeric sequence. TSB lines can contain one statement; chaining multiple statements with the colon as in MS BASIC is not supported. Multiple variable assignments are allowed, e.g., 20 LET A=B=C=42. As in most versions of BASIC, use of the word \"LET\" was optional.\nIn the earliest version (2000A), the language supported the following features. Later versions added many more features.\n\nUnconditional program flow-control via GOTO statements, and subroutines via the GOSUB and RETURN statements\nConditional flow-control via IF/THEN statement\nCalculated flow-control via the GOTO/OF and GOSUB/OF statements\nVariable-based block loop FOR and NEXT statements\nIn-code data storage via DATA, READ, and RESTORE statements\nInput from and output to the user or a disc file via INPUT, READ #, PRINT, PRINT #, and IF END # statements\nNumeric variables of the form \"A\" or \"An\" (where A is a single letter and n is a single, optional digit).\nString variables of the form \"A$\" (where A is a single letter), storing from 1 to 255 characters as-dimensioned. (See below.) (Or: variable-names \"A0$\" or \"A1$,\" but never more than these two digits.)\nOne- or two-dimensional matrix (array) variables of the form \"A[x]\" or \"A[x,y]\"\nMatrix operations via statements (MAT READ, MAT INPUT, MAT PRINT, MAT=) and operations (+, -, *, ZER, CON, IDN, INV, TRN)\nBoolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and relational operators (<, <=, =, #, <>, >=, and >)\nBuilt-in mathematical functions including trigonometric (SIN, COS, TAN, ATN), logarithms (LOG, EXP), square root (SQR), random number generator (RND), others (ABS, INT, SGN, MIN, MAX), and user-defined functions\nPunched tape operations using Teletype Model 33 electromechanical teleprinter remote terminals\n\n\nString handling\nStrings in TSB are treated as an array of characters, rather than a single multi-character object. By default, they are allocated one character in memory, and if a string of longer length is needed, they have to be mentioned before use. For instance, DIM A$[10] will set up a string that can hold a maximum of 10 characters. The maximum length of a string in TSB is 255 characters.\nSubstrings within strings are accessed using a \"slicing\" notation: A$(L,R) or A$[L,R], where the substring begins with the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the rightmost character specified by the index R, or the A$[L] form where the substring starts at the leftmost character specified by the index L and continues to the end of the string. TSB accepts () or [] interchangeably. Array and substring indices start with 1.\nThis is in sharp contrast to BASICs following the DEC pattern that use functions such as LEFT$(), MID$(), and RIGHT$() to access substrings, although ANSI BASIC continues to use a similar substring syntax to that introduced by Hewlett-Packard. HP's notation can also be used on the destination side of a LET or INPUT statement to modify part of an existing string value, for example 100 A$[3,5]=\"XYZ\" or 120 B$[3]=\"CHANGE ALL BUT FIRST TWO CHARS\", which cannot be done with early implementations of LEFT/MID/RIGHT.\nThe main advantage to this style of string access is that it eliminates the need for complex memory management that is otherwise required when string lengths change. MS BASIC had a lengthy library to handle the compression of memory by removing dead space in the string heap when the system ran out of memory. It was also notoriously slow, and was modified several times over its lifetime in order to improve performance or fix bugs. The downside to the TSB style is that the string always takes up the full amount of DIMed space even if the string inside is empty, and simple tasks like concatenation can potentially overflow the string unless it was set to a large size to begin with.\nLater versions of Dartmouth BASIC did include string variables, based on the same pattern found in BASIC-PLUS and MS BASIC. However, this version did not use the LEFT/MID/RIGHT functions for manipulating strings, but instead used the CHANGE command which converted the string to and from equivalent ASCII values. HP included identical functionality, changing only the name to CONVERT. Additionally, one could use the single-quote to convert a numeric constant to an ASCII character, allowing one to build up a string in parts; A$='23 '64 '49 \"DEF\" produced the string \"ABCDEF\", without the need for the CHR$() function.\n\n\nMAT commands\nLater versions of Dartmouth BASIC included a suite of MAT commands that allowed operations on entire arrays (matrices) with a single statement. These were also available in later versions of TSB. In their simplest form, the MAT is used like an alternate form of LET, applying an expression to all the elements in an array. For instance:\n\nWill add the value of every value in B to every entry in A, in the same fashion as:\n\nAs well as making the code shorter and more obvious, these commands also have the advantage of being highly optimized, easily outperforming the use of FOR/NEXT. Additional functions and statements modify PRINT and INPUT, invert arrays, and build identity matrixes and such in a single statement.\n\n\nOther differences\nTSB also includes a number of more minor differences with other dialects. Among the most important are:\n\n# is an optional form of the not-equal comparison, identical to <>\ncomputed-goto using the ON...GOTO/GOSUB syntax is not supported. Instead, the GOTO expression OF 1,2,3... performs the same function by picking a line number from the list based on its ordinal position. For instance, GOTO 1 OF 10,20,30 will always go to line 10, whereas GOTO A OF 100,200,300 will branch to different lines if the value of A is 1, 2 or 3.\nBoolean and relational operators can be used in any mathematical expression, returning 0 for false or 1 for true, which was unusual for BASIC languages of that time, but popular in languages like C. For instance, IF C+D THEN 1600 will branch to line 1600 if either C or D are greater than zero, because the expression C+D will evaluate to 'true' in the IF. If C and D are both zero, the IF will evaluate it to 'false' and the branch will not be taken.\nTSB includes ENTER, a variation on the standard INPUT statement that continues after a time limit is reached. ENTER has three inputs, a time limit in seconds, a return variable containing the actual time elapsed (or a status code), and then finally the user input. For instance, ENTER 15,T,A$[1,1] will wait 15 seconds for the user to type in a single character. T will contain the actual time they took, -256 if the timer expired, or -257 or -258 to indicate problems with the terminal.\nWhen printing string constants (literals), semicolons are not needed within the line. For instance, PRINT \"THE NUMBER IS\"A\", TRY A LARGER VALUE.\" does not require semicolons between the string constants and the variable A. Some other BASICs, including MS, also supported this syntax. Others, like Atari or Integer, did not.\nCommas in PRINT use tab stops every 15 characters, leaving 12 at the end of the line to total 72.\nThe LIN function operates as a vertical counterpart to TAB. LIN(3) will insert three carriage returns, potentially on the existing line if a trailing semicolon or comma was active, while the special-case LIN(-1) will always advance to the next line. Integer BASIC had a similar feature, called VTAB.\n\n\nSee also\nRocky Mountain BASIC, another but very different dialect of BASIC created at Hewlett-Packard\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\nwww.bitsavers.org — Archived HP documentation (scanned into PDF)\nHP 2000 compatible Basic Interpreter\nHP Computer Museum\nBTI Computer Systems History",
    "summary": "HP Time-Shared BASIC (HP TSB) is a BASIC programming language interpreter for  Hewlett-Packard's HP 2000 line of minicomputer-based time-sharing computer systems. TSB is historically notable as the platform that released the first public versions of the game Star Trek.\nThe system implements a dialect of BASIC as well as a rudimentary user account and program library that allows multiple people to use the system at once. The systems were a major force in the early-to-mid 1970s and generated a large number of programs. HP maintained a database of contributed-programs and customers could order them on punched tape for a nominal fee.\nMost BASICs of the 1970s trace their history to the original Dartmouth BASIC of the 1960s, but early versions of Dartmouth did not handle string variables or offer string manipulation features. Vendors added their own solutions; HP used a system similar to Fortran and other languages with array slicing, while DEC later introduced the MID/LEFT/RIGHT functions.\nAs microcomputers began to enter the market in the mid-1970s, many new BASICs appeared that based their parsers on DEC's or HP's syntax. Altair BASIC, the original version of what became Microsoft BASIC, was patterned on DEC's BASIC-PLUS. Others, including Apple's Integer BASIC, Atari BASIC and North Star BASIC were patterned on the HP style. This made conversions between these platforms somewhat difficult if string handling was encountered.",

    "text": "De-hyphenation is a form of foreign policy where a country keeps diplomatic ties with two or more countries with conflicting interests, without letting the conflicts prioritize one country over another. The policy allows countries to hold independent relations with countries otherwise distrustful or hostile towards each other while treating each country as a single entity rather than as a part of a conflict with the other countries.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe term de-hyphenation refers to removing the \"hyphen\" that links two entities. In the context of foreign policy, it signifies the act of untangling or disentangling the relationships between two countries or regions that were previously considered together or linked in some way. By using the term \"de-hyphenation,\" it emphasizes the need to treat each entity independently and distinctly, rather than as a combined or interconnected unit. The word effectively captures the concept of breaking apart the previously linked foreign policy approach to allow for more tailored and individualized strategies towards each entity.\n\n\nExamples of de-hyphenation\n\n\nIndian de-hyphenation policy on Israel and Palestine\nIn 2014, the then newly elected Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, instituted the de-hyphenation policy towards Israel. The aim behind the policy was to form diplomatic ties with Israel independent from the diplomatic ties India shall have with Palestine.\nOn 15 January 2018, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited New Delhi to sign agreements on cooperation in the areas of cyber-defence, security and science. The visit took place one month after India had voted in favor of a resolution brought by Turkey and Yemen in the United Nations to oppose a decision made by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision that was strongly against Palestinian interests. Addressing the resolution, Netanyahu stated, \"I don't think one vote affects the general trend and you can see it in many other votes that we have had here. Naturally, I'm disappointed but I think this visit is a testament to the fact that [India and Israel's] relationship is moving forward on so many fronts.\"\nLater, in the beginning of February 2018, Modi became the first Prime Minister of India to visit Palestine. On visiting Ramallah stating, \"[The] Friendship between India and Palestine has stood the test of time. The people of Palestine have shown remarkable courage in the face of several challenges. India will always support Palestine's development.\" In the same visit, the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, granted Modi the Grand Collar of the State of Palestine, the highest honor for a foreign dignitary in the nation.\n\n\nIndian de-hyphenation policy on Russia and Ukraine\nSince the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, India has maintained a diplomatically neutral stance on the issue, providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine at a time of the crisis, while also abstaining to vote in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1, a resolution condemning Russia over the invasion, demanding a complete withdrawal of the Russian troops from Ukraine and reversing the declaration of Luhansk and Donetsk republics.\nOn 20 March 2024, Modi spoke with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on strengthening the ties between India and Ukraine and to reiterate India's position on diplomacy and dialogue being the only means to end the war in Ukraine. The same day, Modi also contacted the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, to congratulate him on his victory in the presidential elections that took place on 17 March.\nOn 28 March, the Foreign Minister of India, Subramaniam Jaishankar met his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba in New Delhi to discuss India's role in helping to end the invasion. India has traditionally been an ally of Russia, which prompted Ukraine to approach India to mediate between the west and Russia. The meeting was also conducted to restore the level of cooperation between the two sides that existed before the invasion took place.\n\n\nSee also\nForeign policy of the Narendra Modi government\n\n\nReferences",

There is a large interest for the interviews with the world leaders and influencers, which have been, for years, ignored in Serbia. Nedeljnik has published interviews with Lech Walesa, Noam Chomsky, Steve Forbes, Michael Bloomberg, Carla del Ponte, and Romano Prodi. It has also interviewed the most prominent Serbian politicians and intellectuals, and has published reports such as the in-depth interview with Boris Tadić and the first national interview of the then newly appointed President of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić.\nOne of the most popular columns in the magazine is \"Otvoreno\" (\"Open\"), which invites intellectuals and politicians to write their views and commentaries.\nNedeljnik has published many interviews with influential people from Serbia and the region, as well as world-wide famous people, such as Noam Chomsky, Julian Assange, Toni Morrison, Francis Fukuyama, Khaled Hosseini, Morrissey., Yuval Noah Harari\nOne of the prominent interviews was with famous former NBA all-star Vlade Divac, in which declared he was leaving Serbia with a great deal of disappointment.\nIn December 2016, designer Mirko Ilić designed the newspaper's cover, accompanied by an interview.\nNedeljnik has also published interviews with many world-famous basketball players and coaches, including Željko Obradović, Dušan Ivković, Božidar Maljković, Igor Kokoškov, Predrag Danilović, Saša Đorđević, and Žarko Paspalj.\nIn 2017, Nedeljnik's reporter Dragan Krsnik uncovered the illegal practices of employing Serbian workers in the factories in Slovakia, with false employment contracts and no social security or health insurance.\nIn 2019, Belgrade-born artist Marina Abramović wrote a deeply personal letter to Serbia ahead of her retrospective.\nIn 2020, cover of Nedeljnik issue with US 2020 Presidential elections coverage was selected by Poynter among most illustrative covers from around the world. Cover features Donald Trump and Joe Biden, with Trump's message \"You are fired\", and Biden's reply \"No, you are fired\".\n\n\nSupplements\nNew York Times International Report, Serbian edition\nNedeljnik is the publisher of the first monthly publication of The New York Times International Report. Once a month it comes as a gift to readers of Nedeljnik. On 24 pages Nedeljnik presents the best current articles from The New York Times, including special pages dedicated to business, science, arts, politics, and lifestyle. Serbian language is only the third language in which an edition of The New York Times International is printed, after Spanish and Portuguese.\nSince January 2018, the digital edition of The New York Times International Report has been available on Nedeljnik's website.\nOriginal magazine\nNedeljnik created a magazine designed for young people and students, published with Novak Djokovic Foundation. The Original magazine was a concept to bring back young readers and to try to persuade them to read a quality mainstream magazine. This luxury glossy 96-page magazine is distributed to the students of Serbian universities, and the rest are distributed with some copies of Nedeljnik.\nLe Monde diplomatique, Serbian edition\n\nEvery third week in the month, readers of Nedeljnik get the Serbian edition of le Monde diplomatique for free. This most prestigious publication in the French-speaking world is written by philosophers, analysts and sociologists.\nOn the occasion of launching this edition, Noam Chomsky said: \"I wish to congratulate Nedeljnik on starting the Serbian edition of Le Monde Diplomatique. It is, indeed, one of the few pillars of free thinking in today's world. Unique, invaluable, reliable, LMD is wonderful news for those who hope to understand the world or change it for the better.\"\n\n\nAwards\nVeljko Lalic (editor-in-chief of Nedeljnik) is one of the most awarded Serbian journalists. He was the youngest winner of a journalist award, \"Dimitrije Davidović\" for editors (Dimitrije Davidovic is considered to be the pioneer of Serbian journalism) from the Journalists Association of Serbia, in 2015.\nHe also received the \"Laza Kostic\" for feuilleton in 2004, also as the youngest; gold medal \"Misa Anastasijevic\" in 2010 for the best manager from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry; \"The man of the year\" award for the best columnist in 2010, elected by all his colleagues and prominent persons; and \"Dragisa Kasikovic\" for his expending of freedom in 2015 and many other awards and recognitions.\nIn 2018 Lalic received the \"Aleksandar Tijanic Award\", a prominent award for bravery in journalistic expression. Lalic gave away the financial part of the award as a contribution to a journalist from a small town near Belgrade, who was attacked for his writing. The journalist, Milan Jovanović from Vrčin, had had his house burned down in an assault. Jovanović has reported on the \"suddenly acquired property\" of the head of the local Grocka municipality, as well as alleging corruption in the construction of sewage systems, after which local authorities cut down his water supply. The president of Grocka municipality and official of ruling was arrested, suspected for ordering an arson attack on Jovanović's house.\nThe website Nedeljnik.rs was named as one of the top five best news web sites in the country for 2017 in a ranking conducted by the magazine PCPRESS.\nIn 2017, Dragan Krsnik won the award for investigative reportage.\nIn 2017, the Queen of the United Kingdom decorated Branko Rosić, managing editor of Nedeljnik, with a Medal of The British Empire, for his lifetime contribution in creating cultural ties between the two countries.\nIn 2017, Nenad Čaluković, political editor of Nedeljnik, won an award for the interview of the year.\nIN 2016, Marko Prelević, managing editor of Nedeljnik, won an award for columnist of the year.\nIn 2015, Veljko Lalić, editor in chief of Nedeljnik, won an award for best editor in the country from the national association of journalists (Journalists Association of Serbia).\n\n\nInvestigative journalism\nIn February 2017, Nedeljnik published a story written by Dragan Krsnik, the undercover reporter who spent several months working at a Samsung factory in Galanta, Slovakia, without a proper working permit. In the report, Krsnik described slave-like conditions and woeful wages for hundreds of Serbian and other foreign workers in the plants in Slovakia. The report spawned an immediate reaction from Serbian and Slovak public and the governments of Slovakia and Serbia.\nA few days after the report was published, the Labour Ministry of Slovakia announced it would pay more attention to companies with foreign staff. \"The Labour Ministry wants to see foreigners working in Slovakia only legally and in conditions corresponding to the Slovak Labour Code\", the minister Richter said. \"We've found out - and this was also confirmed by Hungarian authorities - that several Serbian nationals working in Slovakia were deceived and were staying here illegally, although they themselves didn't know that\", he added.\nIn June 2017, the Serbian minister of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs visited Bratislava, Slovakia and spoke about the ways for joint action in cases of unlawful treatment of workers coming from the third countries.\nIn November 2017, Serbia and Slovakia signed a protocol on cooperation between in the field of labor and employment, the Serbian government announced.\nIn February 2018, the Slovak parliament approved a draft amendment to the law on employment services that simplifies the conditions for employing people from the non-EU countries.\nKrsnik and Nedeljnik were featured in numerous media outlets throughout Europe. The report was featured in Le Monde diplomatique, among others.\nKrsnik's report won the Association of Journalists of Serbia's award for reportage in December 2017.\nIn August 2019, Nedeljnik discovered that Serbia had granted citizenship to Thailand's fugitive former premier Yingluck Shinawatra, who was ousted ahead of the 2014 coup.\n\n\nSpecial editions\nPerson of the Year\nNedeljnik introduced the annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in December 2016. The first \"Person of the Year\" selected was president of Serbian Academy of Science and Arts Vladimir Kostić. The next year, famous basketball coach Dušan Duda Ivković was featured as \"Person of the Year\". It was his last year as active basketball coach, and because of political connotations his last game was organized in Greece, rather than Serbia.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe Internet edition of Nedeljnik is one of the most popular websites among highly educated and high income readers in Serbia, according to Gemius agency. The website Nedeljnik.rs has been selected as one of the top five news sites in Serbia in most respective yearly selections of its kind, conducted by Serbia's renowned PC magazine.\n\n\nAir Serbia business lounge case\nNedeljnik was one of the political news magazines Air Serbia Airport Lounge staff were instructed not to display. Staff were directed by a supervisor to remove all newspapers and magazines left behind by travelers. \"Pay special attention to NIN, Vreme and Nedeljnik weeklies and newspapers of similar content. They should not be exhibited,\" the memo to staff said. This action was seen as controversial in Serbia, and reactions of European officials followed. Opposition politicians in Serbia used this case to illustrate the censorship in Serbia.\n\n\nJournalist surveillance case\nIn February 2020 Serbia's Defence Minister Aleksandar Vulin commented on an article in Nedeljnik that had never been published by the newspaper, or anyone else.\nAuthor of the opinion piece in question was opposition politician Dragan Sutanovac, who asked the editor-in-chief Veljko Lalic if Nedeljnik would publish his column in a part of the weekly where public figures express their views.\n\"Sutanovac sent the column on Monday, and Lalic told him on Tuesday afternoon that the weekly wouldn't publish it. It hasn't been either published in the print issue nor has it been posted on the website. It remained in Sutanovac's and Lalic's e-mails and in the correspondence with the other editor Marko Prelevic whom Lalic sent the article. After that, Sutanovac said he would offer the article to other media. And that will be all as far as we are concerned,\" Nedeljnik said in the statement.\nLater, the Defence Ministry apologised, blaming its PR, which said the article was published by Nedeljnik instead of the Kurir tabloid. Nevertheless, it added, \"all the Minister said was true.\"\nSutanovac said that in interview for Kurir he didn't say anything regarding the issues Vulin commented in his statement, so it was obvious that article in Nedeljnik he had in mind.\n\"The debate with the unpublished article undoubtedly confirms that Vulin has illegally obtained the e-mails exchange between the Nedeljnik's editor and me. Is Serbia becoming the country of 'Big Brother' in which the state resources are used to intercept the communication between the former Defence Minister and media editor, is now doubtless.\"\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) urged the Serbian authorities to investigate the possibility that the government had spied on and intercepted emails between an opposition politician and Nedeljnik.\n\n\nCOVID-19 coverage\n\nDuring the coronavirus crisis in early spring of 2020, Nedeljnik published a series of special issues on global and local influence of the new pandemic. Most influential thinkers and opinion makers, global and domestic, presented their prospective of a new world after the pandemic. Among others, such influential thinkers as Francis Fukuyama and Yuval Noah Harari gave interviews for Nedeljnik.\nOne of the Nedeljnik covers during the pandemic drew particular attention. It presented the faces of doctors imprinted with the masks of superheroes. It was part of a campaign by the McCann agency. On this occasion McCann World Group referred to Nedeljnik as the \"Serbian equivalent of Time magazine\".\n\n\nCirculation\nAccording to IPSOS agency, the readership of Nedeljnik is around 100,000, while according to agency Partner, Nedeljnik is the only political magazine among the weeklies with the highest circulation, with an average readership close to 80,000.\nThe research of Ipsos Strategic Marketing shows that more than 70 percent of readers of Nedeljnik are highly educated, and they are the opinion makers, political and business elite of this country.\nAccording to the recent report by the Serbian government’s Commission for Protection of Competition, Nedeljnik controls between 30 and 40 percent of the current affairs magazines market, which includes more than 20 publications \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Edgar Manucharyan (Armenian: Էդգար Մանուչարյան; born 19 January 1987) is an Armenian former professional footballer who played as a forward.\n\n\nClub career\n\n\nAjax\nIn early December 2004, Manucharyan joined Ajax Amsterdam. On 14 December, he took part in a friendly game against the Spanish club Barcelona playing 14 minutes before suffering a foot injury. As was later revealed in a medical examination, Manucharyan had broken the metatarsal bones in his right leg. The same day the Football Federation of Armenia named Manucharyan best player of Armenia in 2004 in a survey conducted among journalists. After the injury, Ajax did not immediately sign a contract with Manucharyan but in July 2005, he joined on a three-year contract with Ajax paying Pyunik a $100,000 fee.\nManucharyan scored his first goal for Ajax in an 18–0 pre-season win over a Dutch amateur side. Manucharyan made his Ajax and his Eredivisie debut on 18 September 2005 in a 4–2 defeat to AZ Alkmaar coming off the bench in the 84th minute in place of striker Ryan Babel In the 2005–06 season, he played a total of four matches in the championship and won the KNVB Cup. He also participated in the Amsterdam Tournament of 2006 coming on as a substitute against Inter Milan and featuring in the starting line-up against Manchester United. After the match, both Olympique Lyonnais and S.L. Benfica showed interest in the player. However, on 16 March 2007 his running contract until 2008 was extended until 30 June 2011.\nIn the 2006–07 season, Manucharyan rarely got into the first team squad and was frequently injured. He mostly played for the youth team, Jong Ajax. On 2 November 2006, Manucharyan scored his first official goal for Ajax in a 3–0 win over Austrian club FK Austria Wien during the 2006–07 UEFA Cup season. Having come on as a substitute in the 57th minute, he scored 8 minutes later. On 22 July 2006, Manucharyan took part in a friendly match against English club Arsenal F.C., which was held at the new Emirates Stadium. The match was the farewell game for Dennis Bergkamp, former player of Ajax and Arsenal. Manucharyan made an assist to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who scored the first ever goal at the new Emirates Stadium. In early March 2007, he extended his contract until 2011, and in May he won his second KNVB Cup.\nIn the 2007–08 season, Manucharyan did not feature in a single game for the first team under new coach Adrie Koster, despite being in excellent form, and constantly played for the youth team, while being affected by minor injuries. In May 2008, Manucharyan expressed his desire to leave the team. In June 2008, Manucharyan and five other Ajax players were declared surplus to requirements.\n\n\nHaarlem and Apeldoorn\nOn 6 August 2009, Manucharyan went on loan to Dutch first division club Haarlem. The lease term was calculated for one year. The next day, on 7 August, he made his debut for the team in the first division match against SC Veendam. Replacing defender Franck Karremana, Manucharyan came off the bench in the 58th minute while Haarlem eventually lost 1–6 at home. Manucharyan scored his first goal for the club on 26 September 2009 against FC Den Bosch. For the next six months spent in the Eredivisie championship, he played 17 matches and scored 6 goals for Haarlem. On 25 January 2010, Haarlem declared bankruptcy. The club was unable to find an investor who would be willing to take on the debts of the club. As one of six Ajax players who joined Haarlem on loan, Manucharyan briefly returned to Ajax. A few days later, on 3 February, Edgar went on loan to AGOVV Apeldoorn, coached by former Ajax player John van den Brom. Manucharyan's first game for the club was marked by a goal, contributing to his team's 0–1 win in the away league match against FC Volendam. A week later, on 19 February, he scored a hat-trick in a game against SBV Excelsior.\n\n\nReturn to Pyunik\nIn July 2010, at the end of the 2009–10 season, Manucharyan and Ajax agreed over the termination of his contract valid until the summer of 2011. After becoming a free agent, he joined his former club Pyunik Yerevan signing a six-month contract. He made his debut in the second leg of the 2010–11 Champions League second qualifying round tie with Partizan Belgrade. Pyunik lost the match 1–0 at home, sealing a 4–1 aggregate win for Partizan. Domestically, Manucharyan contributed five goals in the 2010 Armenian Premier League as Pyunik won the national league with just a point advantage over Banants. After the end of his contract, Manucharyan became a free agent and with Ukrainian club FC Karpaty Lviv showing interest in signing him. He was due to fly to the city, but the signing did not happen and Manucharyan instead left for Pyunik's training camp in Sochi before signing a three-year contract with the club.\nIn mid-August 2011, he was loaned to Ural Sverdlovsk Oblast on a one-year lease. Manucharyan played just five games scoring three goals and providing one assist.\n\n\nUral Sverdlovsk Oblast\nOn 17 July 2012, Manucharyan signed a two-year contract with Ural Sverdlovsk Oblast. On 1 April 2013, he scored his first two goals in his seventh match for the club, a 2–0 defeat of Tom Tomsk.\nHe left Ural after his contract expired at the end of the 2017–18 season.\n\n\nAlashkert\nOn 25 July 2018, Manucharyan signed for Alashkert, being released by Alashkert at the end of the 2018–19 season on 5 June 2019.\n\n\nPyunik\nOn 6 June 2019, FC Pyunik announced the return of Manucharyan. Manucharyan left Pyunik on 24 December 2019 after playing just four games and scoring once.\n\n\nAlashkert\nOn 4 March 2020, FC Alashkert announced the return of Manucharyan.

    "text": "874 Rotraut (prov. designation: A917 KK or 1917 CC) is a dark and elongated background asteroid, approximately 58 kilometers (36 miles) in diameter, located in the outer region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 25 May 1917, by astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory is southwest Germany. The hydrated carbonaceous C-type asteroid (Ch) has a rotation period of 14.3 hours. It was likely named after the ballad Schön Rotraut by German lyric poet Eduard Mörike (1804–1875).\n\n\nOrbit and classification\nRotraut is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9–3.4 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,044 days; semi-major axis of 3.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg Observatory with its official discovery observation on 25 May 1917.\n\n\nNaming\n\"Rotraut\" is a feminine German first name. This minor planet was likely named after the ballad Schön Rotraut (Pretty Rohtraut) by the German lyric poet Eduard Mörike (1804–1875). Lutz Schmadel, the author of the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names learned about Wolf's source of inspiration from private communications with Dutch astronomer Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld, who worked as a young astronomer at Heidelberg.\n\n\nPhysical characteristics\nIn the Tholen-like taxonomy of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2), Rotraut is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid (Caa), while in the survey's SMASS-like taxonomic variation it is a hydrated C-type (Ch).\n\n\nRotation period\n\nTwo rotational lightcurves of Rotraut were obtained from photometric observations by Richard Ditteon at Oakley Southern Sky Observatory (E09), Australia, in February 2017, and by Tom Polakis at the Command Module Observatory (V02) in Arizona in May 2018. Lightcurve analysis gave an identical rotation period of 14.297 hours with a brightness variation of 0.25±0.05 and 0.29±0.03 magnitude, respectively (U=3−/3−). The result supersedes a tentative period determination of 14.586±0.003 hours and an amplitude of 0.24±0.01 magnitude by French amateur astronomers Stéphane Charbonnel and Claudine Rinner from July 2002 (U=2).\nIn 2016, a modeled lightcurve gave a sidereal period of 14.3007±0.0002 hours using data from the Uppsala Asteroid Photometric Catalogue, the Palomar Transient Factory survey, and individual observers (such as above), as well as sparse-in-time photometry from the NOFS, the Catalina Sky Survey, and the La Palma surveys (950). The study also determined two spin axes of (201.0°, −41.0°) and (2.0°, −36.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).\n\n\nDiameter and albedo\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and the Japanese Akari satellite, Rotraut measures (56.47±5.5), (58.287±0.198) and (59.38±0.73) kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (0.0554±0.013), (0.054±0.004) and (0.051±0.002), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0506 and a diameter of 56.42 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.1. Alternative mean-diameter measurements published by the WISE team include (55.05±26.18 km), (58.70±0.56 km), (61.30±17.55 km) and (65.759±0.648 km) with corresponding albedos of (0.04±0.06), (0.047±0.006), (0.04±0.03) and (0.0409±0.0089).\nThree asteroid occultations, observed on 30 November 2009, 22 September 2013 and 21 November 2015, gave a best-fit ellipse dimension of (53.0 km × 53.0 km), (51.1 km × 37.7 km) (best), and (59.0 km × 59.0 km), respectively. These timed observations are taken when the asteroid passes in front of a distant star. However the quality of the measurement is rated poorly.\n\n\nReferences\n \n\n\nExternal links\nPretty Rohtraut, The LiederNet Archive\nLightcurve Database Query (LCDB), at www.minorplanet.info\nDictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\nAsteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR – Geneva Observatory, Raoul Behrend\nDiscovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) – Minor Planet Center\n874 Rotraut at AstDyS-2, Asteroids—Dynamic Site\nEphemeris · Observation prediction · Orbital info · Proper elements · Observational info\n874 Rotraut at the JPL Small-Body Database",

    "text": "The Witch of Endor (Biblical Hebrew: בַּעֲלַת־אֹוב בְּעֵין דּוֹר, romanized: baʿălaṯ-ʾōḇ bəʿĒyn Dōr, lit. 'mistress of the ʾōḇ in Endor'), according to the Hebrew Bible, was consulted by Saul to summon the spirit of the prophet Samuel. Saul wished to receive advice on defeating the Philistines in battle after prior attempts to consult God through sacred lots and other means had failed. However, what was summoned (whether the actual ghost of Samuel or a spirit impersonating him) delivered a prophecy of doom against Saul and his army, who were defeated. This event occurs in 1 Samuel 28:3–25 and is also mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Sirach.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe Hebrew Bible calls her \"a woman, possessor of an ʾōḇ at En Dor,\" apparently a settlement around a spring. The word ov has been suggested by Harry A. Hoffner to refer to a ritual pit for summoning the dead from the netherworld based on parallels in other Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures. The word has cognates in other regional languages (cf. Sumerian ab, Akkadian âbu, Hittite a-a-bi, Ugaritic ib) and the medium or witch of Endor's ritual has parallels in Mesopotamian and Hittite magical texts  as well as rites to chthonic deities in the Odyssey.\nOther suggestions for a definition of ov include a familiar spirit, a talisman, or a wineskin, in reference to ventriloquism.\nIn the Septuagint, she is called the engastrímuthos (\"belly-talker\", an Ancient Greek term for a spirit medium) of Aendōr (Koine Greek: ἐγγαστρίμυθος ἐν Αενδωρ, romanized: engastrímythos en Aendōr). The Latin Vulgate has pythonem in Aendor, both terms referencing then-contemporary pagan oracles.\nThe medium says that she sees \"elohim arising\" from the ground, using the word typically translated as \"god(s)\" to refer to the spirit of the dead. This is also paralleled by the use of the Akkadian cognate word ilu \"god\" in a similar fashion.\n\n\nBiblical narrative\n\nWhen the prophet Samuel dies, he is buried in Rama (1 Samuel 25:1; 28:3). Saul, King of Israel, seeks advice from God in choosing a course of action against the assembled forces of the Philistine army. He receives no answer from dreams, prophets, or the Urim and Thummim. Having previously expelled all necromancers and magicians from Israel, Saul anonymously searches for a witch. He is told one is living in the village of Endor, so Saul disguises himself and crosses enemy lines to visit her. He asks the woman to raise Samuel, and she initially refuses citing Saul's own royal edict against sorcery, but Saul assures her that she will not be punished.\nThe woman then summons a spirit, and when it appears, she works out who Saul is and screams, \"Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!\" Saul assures her again that no harm will come to her, then asks what she sees. She says she sees \"elohim rising\" (plural noun and verb). Then, Saul asks what \"he\" (singular) looks like, and she describes an old man wrapped in a robe. Saul bows down to the spirit despite being unable to see it himself.\nThe spirit complains of being disturbed, berates Saul for disobeying God, and predicts Saul's downfall. The living Samuel had previously said Saul would have his kingship removed, but this spirit adds that Israel's army will be defeated, and Saul and his sons will be \"with me\" tomorrow. Saul collapses in terror; the woman comforts him and prepares him a meal of a fatted calf to restore his strength.\nThe following day, the Israelite army is defeated as prophesied: Saul is wounded by the Philistines and commits suicide by falling on his sword. Later, a young Amalekite, hoping to impress David, will falsely claim he delivered the death blow, and David will execute him. In 1 Chronicles, it is stated Saul's death was partly punishment for seeking advice from a medium rather than from God.\n\n\nInterpretations\n\n\nJudaism\n\nIn the Septuagint (2nd century BC), the woman is described as a ventriloquist, possibly reflecting the consistent view of the Alexandrian translators that demons do not exist. On the other hand, the Hebrew Book of Sirach, composed in the same period, represents it as a fact that Samuel prophesied to Saul after his death. Josephus, writing in the 1st century AD, also appears to find the story completely credible. In the Talmud and the Midrash, the view is expressed that Samuel could be summoned from the dead since the soul comes and goes from the body in the first twelve months after a person's death.\nThe Yalkut Shimoni (11th century) identifies the anonymous witch as the mother of Abner. Based upon the witch's claim to have seen something, and Saul having heard a disembodied voice, the Yalkut suggests that necromancers can see the spirits of the dead but are unable to hear their speech, while the person for whom the deceased was summoned hears the voice but fails to see anything.\nAccording to Antoine Augustin Calmet, writing in the 18th century:\n\nThe Jews of our days believe that after the body of a man is interred, his spirit goes and comes, and departs from the spot where it is destined to visit his body, and to know what passes around him; that it is wandering during a whole year after the death of the body, and that it was during that year of delay that the Pythoness of Endor evoked the soul of Samuel, after which time the evocation would have had no power over his spirit.\n\n\nChristianity\n\nThe Church Fathers and some modern Christian writers have debated the theological issues raised by this text, which would appear at first sight to affirm that it is possible (though forbidden) for humans to summon the spirits of the dead by magic.\nKing James, in his philosophical treatise Daemonologie (1597), rejected the theory that the witch was performing an act of ventriloquism, but also denied that she had truly summoned the spirit of Samuel. He wrote that the Devil is permitted at times to take on the likeness of the saints, citing 2 Corinthians 11:14, which says that \"Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light\". James describes the witch of Endor as \"Saul's Pythonese\", likening her to the ancient Greek oracle Pythia. He asserts the reality of witchcraft, arguing that if such things were not possible, they would not be prohibited in Scripture:\n\nCertain it is, that the Law of God speaks nothing in vain, neither does it lay curses, or enjoin punishments upon shadows, condemning that to be ill, which is not in essence or being as we call it.\nOther medieval glosses to the Bible also suggested that what the witch summoned was not the ghost of Samuel, but a demon taking his shape or an illusion crafted by the witch. Martin Luther, who believed that the dead were unconscious, read that it was \"the Devil's ghost\", whereas John Calvin read that \"it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre.\"\nAntoine Augustin Calmet briefly mentions the witch of Endor in his Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c. (1759), among other scriptural proofs of \"the reality of magic.\" He acknowledges that this interpretation is disputed and says that he will deduce nothing from the passage \"except that this woman passed for a witch, [and] that Saul esteemed her such.\"\n\nSince this passage states that the witch made a loud cry in fear when she saw Samuel's spirit, some interpreters reject the suggestion that the witch was responsible for summoning Samuel's spirit, claiming instead it was the work of God. Joyce Baldwin (1989) writes that: the incident does not tell us anything about the veracity of claims to consult the dead on the part of mediums, because the indications [of the woman’s behavior] are that this was an extraordinary event for her, and a frightening one, because she was not in control.\nGrenville Kent summarises the two main historical interpretations: one, that Samuel really appeared, either bodily or in resurrected form; and two, that Samuel was impersonated by a demon in order to destroy Saul. He argues that the latter view matches the text.\n\n\nSpiritualism\n\nSpiritualists have taken the story as evidence of spirit mediumship in ancient times. The story has been cited in debates between Spiritualist apologists and Christian critics. \"The woman of Endor was a medium, respectable, honest, law-abiding, and far more Christ-like than Christian critics of Spiritualism,\" asserted one Chicago Spiritualist paper in 1875.\n\n\nCultural references\n\nThe story of Saul's consultation with the witch of Endor has frequently been set to music, with many works expanding on the character of the witch. One early example is In guiltie night, an oratorio written by Robert Ramsey in the 1630s, which formed the basis of a better-known work of the same title by Henry Purcell in 1691.\nThe witch also appears in Mors Saulis et Jonathae by Charpentier (c. 1682), Saul by George Frideric Handel (1738), Die Könige in Israel by Ferdinand Ries (1837), and Le Roi David by Honegger (1921). Notable operas featuring the character include David et Jonathas by Charpentier (1688) and Saul og David by Carl Nielsen (1902). In 1965, the Martha Graham Dance Company premiered The Witch of Endor, a one act ballet with music by William Schuman; this was subsequently reworked into a short piece by American composer Moondog (Louis Hardin) for his 1969 self-titled album.\nPoetic works retelling the story include Confessio Amantis, the 14th Century poem by John Gower in Book 4 Sloth (line 1935); \"Saul\" by Lord Byron, published in his 1815 collection Hebrew Melodies, and \"In Endor\" by Shaul Tchernichovsky (1893), a major work of modern Hebrew poetry which paints Saul as a sympathetic figure. Rudyard Kipling, a year after the death of his son at the Battle of Loos, wrote a poem called \"En-Dor\", using the story to criticise contemporary mediums.\nIn literature another early example appears in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales as part of the Friar's Tale. This was believed to be written around 1390, and has the line \"...and speke as renably and faire and wel, as to the Phitonissa dide Samuel.\" This uses the term now rendered as pythoness, for a female soothsayer.\nIn theatre, the witch of Endor figures in Laurence Housman's 1944 play Samuel the Kingmaker, and has a central role in Howard Nemerov's 1961 play Endor. The character has been portrayed cinematically by Israeli actor Dov Reiser in the 1976 television film The Story of David, and by Belgian actress Lyne Renée in the 2016 series Of Kings and Prophets.\nThe character of Endora, the mother of the heroine Samantha on the television show Bewitched, may be named for the Witch of Endor.\nThe Witch of Endor is a name occasionally given to ships, both real and in fiction, such as in the Horatio Hornblower novels and the Sci Fi series The Expanse.\nIn music, the Witch of Endor is mentioned in the last verse of the song \"Lover, Leaver\" by Greta Van Fleet.\nThe Witch of Endor is also a plot point in The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel by Michael Scott.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nGreer, R.A.; Mitchell, M.M.

    "summary": "The Witch of Endor (Biblical Hebrew: בַּעֲלַת־אֹוב בְּעֵין דּוֹר, romanized: baʿălaṯ-ʾōḇ bəʿĒyn Dōr, lit. 'mistress of the ʾōḇ in Endor'), according to the Hebrew Bible, was consulted by Saul to summon the spirit of the prophet Samuel. Saul wished to receive advice on defeating the Philistines in battle after prior attempts to consult God through sacred lots and other means had failed. However, what was summoned (whether the actual ghost of Samuel or a spirit impersonating him) delivered a prophecy of doom against Saul and his army, who were defeated. This event occurs in 1 Samuel 28:3–25 and is also mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Sirach.",

Argentina won 6–0, initiating a longtime rivalry between both teams, that have met more than 190 times since that first encounter, becoming the international derby with the most matches played worldwide, surpassing even the England–Scotland rivalry, which, first held in 1872, is the oldest fixture in the world.\n\n\nOverview\nOne year before, There had been a precedent when representatives from both sides met in a match also in Montevideo, although it was not organised by any association and therefore is not considered official. Moreover, the match was organised by local club Albion in its home field located in Paso del Molino, Montevideo. The Uruguayan side had nine players from that club and the remainder from Nacional. Argentina won the match by 3–2.\n\nIn 1902, both associations, AUF and AFA, agreed to play a match in the same venue. President of AFA, Francis Hepburn Chevallier-Boutell and Lomas A.C. player Juan O. Anderson selected the players for the match. Chevallier-Boutell also chose the uniforms, so Uruguay played in a blue shirt with a white diagonal sash while Argentine wore light blue shirts. Argentina easily beat Uruguay 6–0, with Carlos Dickinson making history after scoring the first goal of the match. Uruguay starting line-up included eight players from Nacional and three from Albion, while Argentina team was formed by players from Alumni (5), Quilmes (2), Belgrano A.C. (2), Lomas (1), and Barracas A.C. (1).\nDuring a long lapse of time, Argentina and Uruguay played each other exclusively so no other national teams had been formed in South America. 8,000 spectators attended the match. Both sides played thirteen consecutive times between 1902 and 1909, giving birth to a strong rivalry that remained through the years. Some competitions contested by Argentina and Uruguay were soon created, such as Copa Lipton (first held in 1905), and Copa Newton (started in 1906).\n\n\nMatch details\n\n \n\n\nSee also\nArgentina–Uruguay football rivalry\nHistory of the Argentina national football team\n1872 Scotland v England football match\n\n\nReferences",

He is the son of three-time ARCA Racing Series champion Jack Bowsher, and the brother of fellow ARCA competitor Todd Bowsher.\n\n\nRacing career\nBowsher first made his ARCA Permatex SuperCar Series in 1988 driving the No. 01 Ford at Kil-Kare Raceway driving father Jack's family owned team, finishing 21st after starting 22nd. He would make 10 more starts and earn two top tens with a ninth at Pocono Raceway, and a fifth at Salem Speedway.\nBowsher would run his first full season in ARCA the following year in 1989, driving the No. 01 Ford for his fathers team, and he would fourth overall in the series standings that year with eight top-10's, including two top-5's at Talladega Superspeedway, where he would finish fifth, and at Salem, where he would finish third. In 1990, now in the No. 21, he would win his first ARCA race at Flat Rock Speedway after leading the 116 out of 150 laps. He would win again at Kil-Kare and would get seven more top-10's to finish third in the points. In 1991, he would win four races, tying with Bob Keselowski with the most wins in the year. He would also win his first career pole at Flat Rock, a race he would later win. He would finish runner-up in the standings behind Bill Venturini.\nIn 1992, Bowsher would start the season, finishing in second place at the season opener at Daytona International Speedway. He would then finish in the top 10 in fifteen times in the next twenty races, including back-to-back wins late in the season at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack and Toledo Speedway on his way to his first ARCA series title ahead of Bob Keselowski. In the following year, he would win one race at Toledo and earn twelve top-10's to finish third in the standings behind Keselowski and eventual champion Tim Steele.\nIn 1994, Bowsher would start out the year with seven straight top-10's, including a win at Louisville Motor Speedway, which ended at Michigan Speedway, where he would finish 22nd. He would then have a streak of ten straight top-10's, including two wins at Kil-Kare and Toledo to win his second title ahead of future series champion Frank Kimmel. In the following year in 1995, he would win two races during the year, including Shady Bowl Speedway, where he would lead every lap, and would finish second in the standings behind Andy Hillenburg. In 1996, he would start the season on a low note finishing 40th at Daytona, but would win the pole in three of the next five races, including at Louisville, where he would win the event. He would earn his final two wins at Shady Bowl Speedway, and Kil-Kare, and would once again finish second in the standings behind Tim Steele. This would end up being his final full-time season in ARCA.\nDuring his time away from ARCA from 1997 to 2002, he would run three races in the ASA National Tour in 2001, getting a best result of 18th at Memphis International Raceway and Winchester Speedway.\nAfter a five year hiatus, Bowsher would return to the now ARCA Re/Max Series, returning to his family team driving the No. 55 Ford at Talladega as a teammate to his brother Todd. After starting 41st and last, he would go on to finish 25th in the race, albeit nine laps down. He would run three races in the following year, mainly serving as a start and park entry with a best finish of 32nd at Kansas Speedway. In 2004, Bowsher would run eight more races, finishing only two of those races, including his final top ten at Springfield with a seventh place result. This would be his final season in ARCA competition as he has not raced since then.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBowsher is married and has a daughter named Brittany.\n\n\nMotorsports results\n\n\nARCA Re/Max Series\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

    "text": "Xenon trioxide is an unstable compound of xenon in its +6 oxidation state. It is a very powerful oxidizing agent, and liberates oxygen from water slowly, accelerated by exposure to sunlight. It is dangerously explosive upon contact with organic materials. When it detonates, it releases xenon and oxygen gas.\n\n\nChemistry\nSynthesis of xenon trioxide is by aqueous hydrolysis of XeF6:\n\nXeF6 + 3 H2O → XeO3 + 6 HF\nThe resulting xenon trioxide crystals are a strong oxidising agent and can oxidise most substances that are at all oxidisable. However, it is slow-acting and this reduces its usefulness.\nAbove 25 °C, xenon trioxide is very prone to violent explosion:\n\n2 XeO3 → 2 Xe + 3 O2  (ΔHf = −403 kJ/mol)\nWhen it dissolves in water, an acidic solution of xenic acid is formed:\n\nXeO3(aq) + H2O → H2XeO4 ⇌ H+ + HXeO−4\nThis solution is stable at room temperature and lacks the explosive properties of xenon trioxide. It oxidises carboxylic acids quantitatively to carbon dioxide and water.  \nAlternatively, 15-crown-5 coordinates to xenon trioxide to give a complex stable at room-temperature against mechanical shock.  \nAlternatively, it dissolves in alkaline solutions to form xenates. The HXeO−4 anion is the predominant species in xenate solutions. These are not stable and begin to disproportionate into perxenates (+8 oxidation state) and xenon and oxygen gas. Solid perxenates containing XeO4−6 have been isolated by reacting XeO3 with an aqueous solution of hydroxides. Xenon trioxide reacts with inorganic fluorides such as KF, RbF, or CsF to form stable solids of the form MXeO3F.\n\n\nPhysical properties\nHydrolysis of xenon hexafluoride or xenon tetrafluoride yields a solution from which colorless XeO3 crystals can be obtained by evaporation. The crystals are stable for days in dry air, but readily absorb water from humid air to form a concentrated solution. The crystal structure is orthorhombic with a = 6.163 Å, b = 8.115 Å, c = 5.234 Å, and 4 molecules per unit cell. The density is 4.55 g/cm3.\n\n\nSafety\nXeO3 should be handled with great caution. Samples have detonated when undisturbed at room temperature. Dry crystals react explosively with cellulose.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWebelements periodic table: page on Xenon(VI) oxide",

The population is now included in the civil parish of Bitchfield and Bassingthorpe.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe village lay in the historical wapentake of Winnibriggs and Threo.\nBoothby Pagnell has a Grade I listed surviving fragment of a medieval manor house, in the Norman style, dating from around 1200 AD.\nThe village was a small community, its population in 1086 being just 19. It has archaeological remains at Cooks Close, a field west of the church, which is chiefly of medieval housing that seems to have fallen into disuse and dereliction by the 14th century, possibly as a result of the fall in the workforce in the aftermath of the Black Death.\nJohn de Bothby, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was born here about 1320 and took his name from the village.\n\n\nIsaac Newton\nAlthough his uncle William Ayscough, the brother of Hannah Ayscough, was vicar of nearby Burton Coggles, during his period of scientific discoveries in 1666–1667, Newton spent some time in the summer at the rectory of Boothby Pagnell, which had a considerable orchard. The vicar was the Trinity College Fellow Humphrey Babington, the brother of Katherine Babington. She was a friend of Hannah Ayscough and the wife of William Clark, the owner of the house at which Newton lodged in Grantham while at school.\nIn his memoirs, Newton noted that he worked on Fluxions (which became differential calculus) at Babington's rectory and also calculated the area under a hyperbola (involving integral calculus).\n\n\nGeography\nThe village  is just north of Bitchfield and south of Old Somerby on the B1176 and approximately 5 miles (8 km) south-east from Grantham. According to the 2001 Census it had a population of 150. Boothby Pagnell forms the most western point of 'The Ropsley Triangle', which denotes the general area between Ropsley, Boothby Pagnell and Ingoldsby.\n\n\nEcclesiastical parish\nThe local authority, and the Ordnance Survey, spell the village \"Boothby Pagnell\". The Diocese of Lincoln spells the PCC as \"Boothby Pagnall\".\nThe ecclesiastical parish is part of the North Beltisloe group in the Deanery of Beltisloe. From 2006 to 2011 the incumbent was Rev. Richard Ireson.\nBoothby Pagnell Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Andrew Restored in 1896, it has a Norman tower, font and nave arcades. It also has a canonical sundial on the south wall.\n\n\nSee also\nHistory of calculus\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Boothby Pagnell at Wikimedia Commons\n\"Boothby Pagnell\", Genuki.org.uk.

    "text": "WildTomato is a monthly lifestyle magazine focused on the Nelson and Marlborough regions in the northern part of the South Island of New Zealand. The regional magazine was launched in July 2006. It was put into liquidation in March 2021 with the first liquidators' reports showing it owed $84,000, mainly to the IRD.\n\n\nHistory\nFounder Murray Farquhar launched WildTomato as a 16-page local magazine in Nelson, New Zealand, in July 2006, aiming to create an \"essential lifestyle magazine\" for the Nelson region. His initial plan was for a weekly printed magazine, before the magazine eventually shifted to a larger monthly publication. The magazine targets a readership of people aged 30-plus in the middle-to-upper socio-economic groups.\nThe current majority owner of the magazine is Jack Martin who is an immigrant to Nelson from the United Kingdom. He initially became editor of WildTomato in December 2007. Martin oversaw a substantial evolution in the scope, size, print quality, and regional coverage of the magazine, which is published as an 80-plus-page, glossy magazine. In March 2008, Martin began the process to buy WildTomato from Farquhar, eventually completing the sale in September 2008.\nIn November 2009, WildTomato changed formats, becoming a standard-sized, 100-page magazine, shifting from its traditional oversized saddle-stitched format. The magazine's website was also revamped in 2009.\nIn April 2016, Lynda Papesch (née Munden/Hooper) was appointed editor when Martin returned to the UK. Papesch comes from a journalistic background, starting her career at The Daily Post in Rotorua in 1977, then moving to The Marlborough Express in 1980.  After stints as chief reporter, deputy editor, and acting editor with The Express, Papesch moved to Nelson Tasman in 2006 and started her own media company. She joined the advertising features department of The Nelson Mail, co-ordinating features from 2010 to 2014. In February 2021, Martin put WildTomato into liquation, failing to pay monies owing to staff and blaming Covid-19. The masthead was acquired by the Nelson Magazine, and WildTomato has not been published since.(Source: Lynda Papesch) \n\n\nCommunity involvement\nThe magazine is involved in its local communities, sponsoring and otherwise being involved in several events including featuring several on a monthly basis in its \"Snapped\" pages, and creating the annual reader-voted Dine Out Awards to highlight Top of the South food, wine, and hospitality. The magazine is further entwined with its local regions by using local writers and photographers as its contributors.\n\n\nContent\n\nThe content of WildTomato reflects the neighbouring regions it covers. \n\n\nInterviews\nWildTomato regularly features themed interviews on a monthly basis, with a specific emphasis on individuals strongly connected to the Top of the South region; past interviewees include Golden Bay muralist Chris Finlayson, motocross rider Josh Coppins, Tall Blacks basketball coach Nenad Vucinic, author Marguerite van Geldermalsen, children's educational DVD creator Emma Heke, and NZ Open surfing champion Angie Koops.\n\n\nFood, fashion, and health\nAs a lifestyle magazine, some content is also devoted to food, drink, fashion and health. Fashion also features, with images sometimes shot by English lifestyle photographer Daniel Allen.\n\n\nUse of images\nWildTomato is image-centric, and uses large photos – as Martin believes quality photos are crucial to any magazine. \n\n\nReferences",

It was directed by Peter Bebjak. Ondřej Vetchý, who stars in the series, collaborated with Bebjak on Případy 1. oddělení.\nSpravedlnost received the Czech Lion Award for the Best Television Film or Miniseries of 2017.\n\n\nPlot\nRichard is a police investigator who has not seen his daughter Lily in a very long time. The series starts when Lily shows up at his door and asks for help. She tells him that she has fallen in love with Judge Kowalský, but he attacked her and she killed him in self-defense. Richard decides to help her at all costs. Richard becomes the lead investigator in the case of Kowalský's murder.\n\n\nCast\nOndřej Vetchý as Richard Koller, the series protagonist.

Each episode gathered around 700,000 viewers the age over 15, which was also the limit of audience accessibility of the show.\nAccording to Martin Svoboda, reviewer at Aktuálně.cz, the overall miniseries is \"more successful than its problematic first part\". He gave it a rating of 65%. According to him, it is also worthy of praise, in contrast to the richness of motifs common elsewhere; \"[in] Justice, one and the same motif appears repeatedly, only the backdrops differ. Thanks to this, the creators can go deeper and uncover new corners of a single idea.”\nThe series won the 2017 Czech Lion Award in the \"Best Television Film or Miniseries\" category.\n\n\nFuture\nEntertainment One Television Production acquired the rights to produce a remake of the miniseries.\nThe miniseries Vedlejší produkt, a thematic successor to Spravedlnost was broadcast in 2024.

He was prefect of the Meuse and prefect of police of Paris.\n\n\nBiography\nJean Dominique Paolini was born on 3 March 1921 in Ghisonaccia, Haute-Corse, Corsica, to a father who was a technical assistant in the public works department of the State. He studied at the Lycée de Bastia, then at the Faculty of Law of Toulouse Capitole University, where he obtained a law degree.\nHe enlisted as a volunteer in January 1943 and became chief of staff to the secretary general for the police of the Toulouse region in August 1944. He was then appointed chief of staff to Poggioli, prefect of the Hautes-Pyrénées, then of Loir-et-Cher (1945-1947). Sub-prefect of the 3rd class, he was chief of staff to the prefect of the Rhône, then secretary general of Savoie in 1951, Charente in 1958, and Meurthe-et-Moselle in 1959. He was appointed prefect of the Meuse in 1965.\nIn 1967, he became chief of staff to the prefect of police Maurice Grimaud, before himself becoming prefect of the Paris police in 1973. He was chief of staff to the Minister of the Interior Michel Poniatowski (1976) and then to Christian Bonnet (1977).\nDuring the First Cohabitation, the prefect of police of Paris, Guy Fougier, resigned because of tensions with the Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac proposed the appointment of Jean Paolini, who had already been prefect of police in 1973. The Élysée refused, but the Prime Minister reacted with the utmost firmness by threatening to make Paolini a chargé de mission in the cabinet of minister Robert Pandraud, who had all the powers that would allow him to head the police prefecture. Mitterrand relented and appointed Paolini prefect of police in Paris in 1986.\nHe retired in 1988.\nHe received the distinctions of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and Grand Cross of the Ordre national du Mérite.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Castle Salem is a fortified house near Rosscarbery, in County Cork, Ireland. The house was home to the Morris family from around 1660 until the early 1800s, and was bought in 1895 by the Daly family, descendants of whom now run it as a guest house.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nConstruction\nAccording to Charles Smith, who terms it \"a strong romantic building\", Benduff Castle was built by the O'Donovans. However, it was almost certainly built around 1470 by Catherine Fitzgerald, daughter of Thomas, 7th Earl of Desmond, who married Finghin MacCarthy Reagh. The Annals of the Four Masters says that she died in 1506. This Earl, one of the most powerful men in Ireland, was Viceroy of Ireland under Edward IV, and was executed at Drogheda in 1466, having fallen a victim, it is said, to the malice of Edward's Queen, Elizabeth Grey, in consequence of his having made a disrespectful speech in reference to her to that King. Earl Thomas's daughter is probably the person who has come down to us as \"The Black Lady,\" of whom various legends were told in connection with Benduff.\nThe ancient Castle of Benduff (Irish: Bhinn Dubh, \"The Black Peak\"), now called Castle Salem (sometimes referred to as Castlesalem, Castle Sally and Mount Salem), is situated about a mile to the north-west of Rosscarbery, in the bosom of a secluded valley shut in by hills and at one time by a dense plantation of trees. It thus differed from the generality of the feudal strongholds of old which were either perched on a rocky eminence or surmounted the summit of some rising ground. But the sheltered and isolated position of this castle probably protected it from external danger.\nOriginally a strong structure, Benduff Castle was built in the usual style of the Norman fortresses which studded Ireland during the Middle Ages, distinguished for their square central keep or tower, with thick massive walls and loop holes for the use of arms as well as the admission of light, to which were generally attached side buildings furnished with bastions, and strong outer walls enclosing the entire foundation — these latter being sometimes provided with covered ways. Benduff Castle has three internal arches; its walls were 11 feet thick, with passages and recesses, and the usual stone stairway. It was originally about 70 feet high till William Morris took the top off, and put on it a slated roof.\n\n\nCromwellian conquest of Ireland\nThe lands of Knocknamadogue with the Castle of Benduff had been the property of Florence McCarthy, a Roman Catholic rebel whose estates were forfeited to Oliver Cromwell's forces. Ballihagornagh (Barley Hill) had belonged to John Marrigoe, who had a similar history, and most of the rest of the lands had been in the possession of the O'Donovans.\nCaptain William Morris (abt. 1620–1680) was given over 1500 acres of land, including the castle, and he changed the name to Castlesalem. This was in around 1660. The land was formally granted in a grant under the act of settlement in 1678:\n\nTo William Morris, gent. Knocknamadogue, to be forever called Montsalem, 252 acres— Kemanabrickey, to be named Libott-Wood, 92 acres—Balanagornaganey, to be called Longnor, 66 acres—Manulagawne or Mullagowne, to be called Mount Stafford, 93 acres 2 roods—Kilbegg, to be called Stoney Furlong, 54 acres—Maulmurreene, to be called Green Furlong, 34 acres 2 roods— Knockrudeene (part) to be called Narrow Furlong, 11 acres—In the Baronies of East and West Carbery. The total quantity being 976 acres 3 roods statute measure at a total rent of £9.3.1 3⁄4 per annum. Dated 4 September 20 year Charles II. Enrolled 17 September 1666. By patent of 1 November 1678 Mr Morris had an abatement of £2.3.1. 1/3 of his annual rent, so that same was reduced to £7 per annum.\n\nTo Captain William Morris. In ye West part of Dunscullis alias Downescully 13 acres (to be forever called by the name of Burton)—Gortroe, 101 acres in ye East part of Dungannon (to be called Wostason)—26 acres (to be called Netley)—in ye East part of Drumuliky 5 acres (to be called ye Mill Pasture), the total quantity being 234 acres 3 roods 18 perches statute measure at a total rent of £2.3.10 3⁄4 per annum.\n\n\nWilliam Morris and the Quakers\nWilliam Morris despite having been a Cromwellian soldier became a Quaker in 1656 and was an active member of the emerging Friends community in Ireland. John Rutty gives an interesting account from the Journal of William Edmondson who describes Captain Morris as a man of talents and influence:\n\nThere was also one William Morris, an Elder amongst the Baptists in great repute. Captain of a Company, Justice of the Peace, Commissioner of the Revenues, Chief Treasurer in that Quarter, also Chief Governor of three garrisons, to whom the news of this day's work was soon carried, whereat he was much troubled in mind and told the messenger who was a justice of the peace 'it was a shame for them to suffer us to be so abused' saying 'the time would come that they would be glad to shelter under our wings'. The Rumour soon went amongst the Baptists and to the court at Dublin that Captain Morris was turned Quaker, whereupon he was removed with his company southward; not long after he was sent to Dublin to appear before the General and chief officers, many of whom were Baptists. He was examined about his being turn'd Quaker which he did not deny, but confessed our Faith and Principles and at that time was discharg'd from his command because he was a Quaker. He was a worthy wise man, had a Testimony in our Meetings and died in the Faith of Jesus. I was at Dublin at the time when they took his command from him. He would often say that I was a great help and strength to him in the truth. He was serviceable upon many occasions with the Government in appearing on behalf of suffering Friends, tho' he was also divers times a sufferer in bonds for his testimony. He wrote an excellent short Treatise entitled Tythes No Gospel Ordinance, (printed 1659).\n\nDuring 1656 William formed a Quaker meeting in Belturbet, County Cavan, with William Parker and his wife and Robert Wardell and his father.  Sometime later in 1656 he was discharged from his post and returned to Cork. Like many educated men of his time with financial means he used his influence as a vehicle for change. William had published in 1659 a short treatise entitled Tythes no gospel ordinance. He attempts to prove by reference to Scripture that \"Tythes are unjust to rich and poor alike\" and like many Friends this was to get him into trouble with the establishment.\nWilliam also wrote a treatise to the English Parliament in 1659, \"To the Supream Authoritie (under God) of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, the Commons in Parliament Assembled. The true and faithfull Testimony of William Morris, a late Member of the Army in Ireland\" (London, Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth, near Aldersgate. 4to. 1659). The work seeks to challenge Parliament about the persecution of Quakers in Ireland by Henry Cromwell, Oliver’s fourth son. Henry's principal objective in Ireland was to secure the authority of the Protectorate and to crush all disloyalty. He opposed the Baptists among the soldiers and civilian administrators because of their close association with republicans. By late 1656, Henry had succeeded in forcing leading Baptist officers to resign their commissions or to leave Ireland. He discouraged the spread of Quakerism into Ireland by arresting Quaker missionaries and dismissing army officers who appeared susceptible to their message. On the other hand, he encouraged moderate Presbyterian and Independent clergymen to come over to Ireland. Having suppressed the radicals, Henry worked to reconcile the main Protestant groupings, to gain the support of the gentry and to stabilise the administration. The policy of land seizure and transplanting the native Irish was largely carried out before his appointment as Lord-Deputy, so although he remained suspicious and watchful, Henry's treatment of the Irish Catholics tended to be moderate. Henry supported the succession of his brother Richard to the office of Lord Protector in 1658, but was powerless to prevent the collapse of the Protectorate the following year. He resigned as Lord-Deputy in June 1659 and the Restoration of Charles II just one year away in May 1670.\nThe work that could have cemented William as a major Quaker theologian and author, written with George Fox and John Perrot, was entitled \"Severall [sic] Warnings to the Baptised People\", published in 1659.\nLike many of the early Friends William was to suffer for his beliefs and was imprisoned on a number of occasions. Joseph Besse writing in 1753 told how in 1660:\n\nIn the County of Cork, William Morris, William Brimsby, Walter Castle, and John Exham, being met with others in Edward Cooke's House at Bandon-bridge, were committed to Goal by John Laundon, Provost, and put into a nasty Dungeon, where they were kept two Weeks, their Friends not being admitted to bring them Food, but as it was given them through a Grate, and the Provost was offended with the Gaoler's Wife, for suffering some Straw to be brought them to lie on.\n\nFollowing his treatise against the payment of tithes in 1663/4 Paul and William Morris were sued for tithes by the Archdeacon of Ross but the Archdeacon died suddenly under circumstances which so affected his brother clergy that for some years the Morrises were not again sued for tithes: \"A Testimony against John Reeve & Lodowick Muggleton, by the Quakers of Cork\", signed by Wm. Morris, Wm. Edmondson, Robert Sandham and 23 others with Muggleton's Sentence of damnation upon them. And the names of many other Friends & things concerning Friends are scattered throughout the vol.\"\nGeorge Fox (1624–1691), the founder of the Quaker faith, despite being unwelcome visited Ireland in 1669. He first visited Bandon then went on to Cork. The mayor was not keen to welcome Fox to Cork. Paul Morris was a brother of William Morris and acted as the guide to George Fox when he rode through the streets of Cork unharmed though there were warrants out against him and even the Mayor recognised him. The Morrises were clearly people of influence.\nFox describes how:\n\nWhen we came near the town, Friends would have shown me a way through the back side of it; but I told them my way was through the streets. Taking Paul Morrice to guide me through the town, I rode on. As we rode through the market-place, and by the mayor's door, he, seeing me, said, \"There goes George Fox\"; but he had not power to stop me. When we had passed the sentinels, and were come over the bridge, we went to a Friend's house and alighted. There the Friends told me what a rage was in the town, and how many warrants were granted to take me. While I was sitting there I felt the evil spirit at work in the town, stirring up mischief against me; and I felt the power of the Lord strike at that evil spirit. By-and-by some other friends coming in, told me it was over the town, and amongst the magistrates that I was in the town. I said, \"Let the devil do his worst.\" After we had refreshed ourselves, I called for my horse, and having a Friend to guide me, we went on our way.\n\n\nWilliam Penn\nApart from George Fox the other most widely known Quaker is William Penn (1644–1718). As a close friend William Penn was often at Castlesalem, particularly in the early months of 1670. Writing in his \"Irish Journal\" Penn frequently talks of his time with William Morris. At this time Morris was one of the most prominent Friends in the South of Ireland and clearly respected and admired by William Penn who had him act as his agent in Cork collecting rents etc. Penn stayed or visited Castle Salem on 21 February 1670, 23 February 1670, 24 February 1670, 25 February 1670, 26 March 1670, 29 March 1670 – 3 April 1670, 6 April 1670, 16 April 1670. There may have been other times but these are not recorded.\nPenn wrote some of his Great Case of Liberty of Conscience Once More Briefly Debated and Defended at Castle Salem, as he refers to it a number of times in his diary.\n\n\nThe New House (1682)\nRutty describes the death of William in 1680: \"This year died William Morris of Castle Salem in the Co of Cork, who though a man of great parts and wisdom, was convinced of Truth by a weak instrument\". Following the death of his father in 1680, Fortunatus Morris built a new house on to the fortress at Benduff. It is L-shaped, the tower being at the angle of the 'L'. It is built of small pieces of bad stone, with a high outside chimney and two gables. Fortunatus’ house was built at its rear against the old building, and from the first landing of its stairs one could step into the Castle by the ancient doorway which was placed about 12 feet from the ground. Later a Georgian hall door was added. The gardens were very extensive and laid out in old Dutch style with ponds, little islands and clipped yew trees.\n\n\n19th century\nThe Morris family still lived in the castle at the beginning of the 19th century. It was described in 1815 in Townsend's Survey as the seat of William Morris. There was an \"old house joined to a castle of still greater antiquity, standing on a rock rising in the centre of a small romantic vale surrounded by steep and lofty hills. Of the trees that were formerly very abundant many still remain, amongst which are a yew and some beech of great size. A very singular circumstance occurs here of a rookery in a grove of laurels\".\nThe castle was offered for sale at the encumbered estates court on 3 June 1853 and was bought by a Dr. Fitzgibbon for £1,350. In 1870 it was in the hands of Mrs Eliza Fitzgibbon.\nPatrick Daly bought the castle in 1895 from the Fitzgibbons and three generations of the family have now farmed the land. Under the stewardship of Michael and Margaret Daly and their family the Castle tower has been partially restored. It is still a working farm and offers bed and breakfast as well as tours.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nMap sources: 51.595881°N 9.056028°W﻿ / 51.595881; -9.056028\nAerial photograph on castle website (archived)",

    "text": "Norman Thomas William Allan,  (3 June 1909 – 28 January 1977) was the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force, from 1962 to 1972.\n\n\nBiography\nA Protestant and Freemason, Allan joined the NSW Police Force in 1929, posted at Redfern. From 1932, he prosecuted at the Central Criminal Court, until transferred to headquarters in 1938. Allan attained the rank of inspector in 1948, then superintendent in 1956, and was assistant to three consecutive police commissioners: William John MacKay, James Frederick Scott, and Colin John Delaney.\nIn 1953, Allan was awarded the Coronation Medal, and in 1957 he earned the Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service and the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. He was also specially commended by the State Premier Robert Heffron for devotion to duty and exceptional skill and ability in connection with the conviction of Stephen Leslie Bradley for the murder of Graeme Thorne.\nAllan was acting deputy-commissioner in 1959 and became Chief Commissioner of Police on 28 February 1962.  In July 1968, while negotiating with armed hostage-taker Wally Mellish at Glenfield, west of Sydney, he achieved national fame by arranging the forced marriage of the criminal to his female hostage, then supplying Mellish with an Armalite rifle and 200 bullets.\nKnown unofficially as \"Norman the Foreman,\" Allan finished his tenure during the years when Sir Robert Askin was Premier of New South Wales. While Allan was Police Commissioner, illegal casinos flourished in Sydney, in full view of both police and the public. Yet very few police raids ever took place. The collective annual turnover of illegal casinos in Sydney in 1974 was estimated to be $600 million (or $3.8 billion in 2008 terms). This netted the operators an untaxed profit of $16 million ($95 million in 2008) after all costs and alleged bribes had been paid off. A close associate of prominent Sydney racing identity Perc Galea claimed that Police Commissioner Allan and his successor Frederick Hanson were paid $100,000 a year each in bribes.\nOne of the greatest challenges of Allan's tenure as commissioner was the Arantz scandal. Detective Sergeant Philip Arantz developed a computer program that gave accurate crime data. The new data showed that information previously published by the commissioner was misleading or incorrect. NSW Police refused to acknowledge the new data, which led Arantz to leak it to the press in November 1971. Following this, Arantz was forcibly admitted into hospital having been declared mentally ill by a police doctor.  The police doctor later claimed that he had been coerced into doing so by senior police. In 1972 Arantz was sacked from the force. Allan at first denied that the new information was accurate, but he later conceded its validity in a report tabled to parliament in September 1972. Arantz was finally reinstated into the police force in 1989, after the NSW parliament brought in new reinstatement legislation.\nIn July 2008 Penguin published the book Gentle Satan: Abe Saffron, My Father by Alan Saffron, the only son of reputed Sydney crime czar Abe Saffron. The book contains allegations about Allan's supposed corrupt relationship with Saffron, claiming that Saffron regularly paid both Allan and Askin bribes of between A$5,000 and $10,000 per week each, that Allan was a frequent visitor to Saffron's office and home. Also included in the book is the allegation that Saffron paid for an overseas trip for Allan and an unnamed female companion.\n\n\nNotes",

    "text": "A plugboard or control panel (the term used depends on the application area) is an array of jacks or sockets (often called hubs) into which patch cords can be inserted to complete an electrical circuit.  Control panels are sometimes used to direct the operation of unit record equipment, cipher machines, and early computers. The array of holes is often contained in a flat removable panel that can be inserted into a machine and pressed against an array of contacts. This allows the machine to be quickly switched between different applications.\nThe contacts on the machine are hard wired to the various devices that comprise the machine, such as relays, counters, inputs from each card reader column, outputs to a card punch column or printer position, and so on. The wiring on a plugboard connects these devices to perform a specific function, say reading cards and summing up the numbers punched in a group of columns.  A modern comparison would be a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), with the plugboard serving the same purpose as the wiring layer in the FPGA.\n\n\nUnit record equipment\n\nThe earliest machines were hardwired for specific applications. Inspired by telephone switchboards,\nOtto Schäffler invented the plugboard in order to easily reprogram tabulators.\nApplications then could be wired on separate control panels, and inserted into tabulators as needed. Removable control panels came to be used in all unit record machines where the machine's use for different applications required rewiring.\nIBM removable control panels ranged in size from 6 1/4\" by 10 3/4\" (for machines such as the IBM 077, IBM 550, IBM 514) to roughly one to two feet (300 to 600 mm) on a side and had a rectangular array of hubs. Plugs at each end of a single-conductor patch cord were inserted into hubs, making a connection between two contacts on the machine when the control panel was placed in the machine, thereby connecting an emitting hub to an accepting or entry hub. For example, in a card duplicator application a card column reading (emitting) hub might be connected to a punch magnet entry hub. It was a relatively simple matter to copy some fields, perhaps to different columns, and ignore other columns by suitable wiring. Tabulator control panels could require dozens of patch cords for some applications.\nTabulator functions were implemented with both mechanical and electrical components. Control panels simplified the changing of electrical connections for different applications, but changing most tabulator's use still required mechanical changes. The IBM 407 was the first IBM tabulator that did not require such mechanical changes; all the 407's functions were electrically controlled and were completely specified by the application's control panel and carriage tape.\nFor most machines with control panels, from collators, interpreters, to the IBM 407, IBM manuals describe the control panel as \"directing\" or \"automatic operation was obtained by...\".  The control panels of calculators, such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, that specified a sequence of operations, were described as being programs.\n\n\nWiring of unit record equipment control panels\n\nUnit record equipment was typically configured for a specific task using a removable control panel. The electrical connections of the various components in the unit record machine were presented on the panel, and connections between them were determined by the wiring, with the actual connections made when the panel was inserted into the machine and locked in place. Perhaps the closest modern analog is the field-programmable gate array, where a fixed number of logic components are made available and their interconnection wiring is determined by the user.\nWiring a unit record control panel required knowledge of the machine's components and their timing constraints.  The components of most unit record machines were synchronized to a rotating shaft. One rotation represented a single machine cycle, during which punched cards would advance from one station to the next, a line might be printed, a total might be printed and so on. The cycles were divided into points according to when the rows on a punched card would appear under a read or punch station. On most machines, cards were fed face down, 9-edge (bottom edge) first. Thus the first point in a card cycle would 9-time, the second 8 time and so on to 0-time.  The times from 9 to 0 were known as digits. These would be followed by 11 time and 12 time, also known as zones.\nIn a read station, a set of 80 spring wire brushes pressed against the card, one for each column (the 407 read station, constructed without brushes, held the card stationary and could read a card multiple times, each time generating the same impulses as would be generated by an 80 spring wire station). When a hole passed under the brush, the brush would make contact with a conductive surface beneath the card that was connected to an electrical power source and an electrical pulse, an impulse in IBM terminology, would be generated. Each brush was connected to an individual hub on the control panel, from which it could be wired to another hub, as needed. The action caused by an impulse on a wire depended on when in the cycle it occurred, a simple form of time-division multiplexing. Thus an impulse that occurred during 7-time on a wire connected to the column 26 punch magnet would punch a hole in row 7 of column 26.   An impulse on the same wire that occurred at 4-time would punch a 4 in column 26. Impulses timed in this way often came from read brushes that detected holes punched in cards as they passed under the brushes, but such pulses were also emitted by other circuits, such as counter outputs. Zone impulses and digit impulses were both needed for alphanumeric printing. They could both be sent on a single wire, then separated out by relay circuits based on the time within a cycle.\nThe control panel for each machine type presented exit (output) and entry (input) hubs in logical arrangements. In many places, two or more adjacent common hubs, would be connected, allowing more than one wire to be connected to that exit or entry.  A few groups of hubs were wired together but not connected to any internal circuits. These bus hubs could be used to connect multiple wires when needed. Small connector blocks called wire splits were also available to join three or four wires together, above the control panel. Several are visible in the photo of an IBM 402 panel.\nThe capabilities and sophistication of unit record machine components evolved over the first half of the 20th century and were often specific to the needs of a particular machine type. The following hub groupings were typical of later IBM machines:\n\nRead brushes, 80 exit hubs, one for each card column. A tabulating machine might have two or three read stations, each with its own set of 80 hubs. A reproducing punch might have an additional read station after the punch station for verification.\nPunch magnets Machines that could punch cards, such as a reproducing punch, had hub entries for each card column. An impulse to one of those entries triggered the electromagnet that initiated the punching of a hole at that column position.\nPrint entries, one hub for each print position. Impulses to these entries controlled the motion of print bars or wheels to place the correct type element under the print hammers. The 407 also had exits from each print wheel that could then feed the counters for addition or subtraction. This insured that totals always matched what was printed.\nCounter entries. An IBM tabulating machine, such as the 402 or 407 series would have several counters available in different sizes. (For example, the IBM 402/403 had four sets each of 2, 4, 6 and 8 digit counters, labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B etc.)  Each counter had two counter control entries to specify either addition (plus) or subtraction (minus). If neither were pulsed, no operation was performed. If addition was commanded, a digit impulse wired from a column to a counter entry hub started the counter wheel turning. It stopped automatically at zero time. Thus a pulse at 8 time caused the wheel to advance 8 steps, adding the value 8 to that counter position. Carries within a group were performed automatically. Carry in and carry out hubs allowed counters to be coupled, permitting longer numbers to be accumulated.  Subtraction was more complicated and used nines complement arithmetic.\nCounter total exits. A counter's Total entry hub caused that counter to emit total pulses which could be wired to print positions. After a total was printed, the counter was reset. Special circuits allowed negative values to be printed correctly, not as nines complements, and a special exit was provided to allow an appropriate symbol (\"cr\" or \"-\") to be printed next to the number when it was negative.\nComparing. Simple comparing circuits had two entries and one exit that emitted a pulse whenever pulses arrived at the entries at different times. Some machines, e.g. collators, could detect which number was higher if they were not equal.  A tabulating machine might compare the account number on successive cards and print a total when a new account number appeared. For the compare function, IBM implemented what would now be called a XOR gate using opposing electromagnets. If neither magnet was energized or both magnets were energized at the same time, the relay armature would not move. If only one magnet was energized, the armature would move and touch one of two contacts placed on either side. The two contacts were wired together internally and connected to an exit hub that indicated an unequal comparison.\nDistributors allowed an output pulse to be wired to more than one input without creating a back circuit between the inputs.\nEmitters were sets of 12 exit hubs that automatically generated a pulse at each specified time in the card cycle. The twelve exit hubs were wired to contacts on a rotary switch that turned with the card cycle.  Thus wiring the 6 exit from an emitter to a punch magnet entry would cause a 6 to be punched at that position. Emitters might be used to put a numeric constant value, say a date, on every card. Alphanumeric constant data could be created by carefully combining digit and zone pulses. Later machines, such as the 407 also had a complete set of alphanumeric emitters that only required one wire to use.\nSelectors directed a pulse from a common entry to either of two outputs, depending on whether a relay magnet was energized.  Many types of selectors were employed that differed in how the \"pickup\" relay was energized. In the simplest case, immediate (I) entries, the magnet was energized when a pulse was received and held for the remainder of the cycle.  More complex selectors, called pilot selectors, had a D entry hub that caused the selector magnet to pick up on the next machine cycle, and X entry hub that also delayed but was only triggered by an 11 or 12 pulse. The one-cycle delay was needed because in most cases, by the time a pulse was detected it was too late to reliably take action in that cycle. Co-selectors had only an immediate input, but five sets of contacts and were typically triggered by a pilot selector's coupling exit, hence the names.\nDigit selectors were similar to emitters,  with one exit hub for each cycle point, but they also had an entry hub that was switched to the successive exit hubs as the cycle progressed. A digit selector could be converted to a digit emitter by wiring its entry hub to a constant source of cycle pulses. But it could also be fed other signals and used to detect a particular digit. Wiring a first read brush to a digit selector's entry and connecting, say, its 4 exit to a pilot selector's D entry would cause that selector to transfer on the next read cycle if a 4 was punched in that first read brush's column.\nColumn splits were relays that energized during only at 11 and 12-time, allowing digit pulses to be separated from zone pulses.\nStorage. Later machines such as the 407 and 602 could store several values for later use, by means of a mechanical device somewhat similar to an emitter, except it contained a sliding contact that determined at what time point an impulse was to be emitted. The contact slider was positioned electro-mechanically when a value was stored, and stayed in position until the storage was cleared.\n\n\nCypher machines\n\nA plugboard was used on the famous Enigma machine; it was not removable. In this case the plugboard acted as a \"fourth rotor\" in the rotor machine's workings. Plugboard wirings were part of the \"day settings\" that specified which rotors to insert into which slot, and which plugboard connections to make. In practice the plugboard did improve the security of the cypher being generated, but as it did not change with every keypress, unlike the rotors, its impact was limited. See Cryptanalysis of the Enigma.\n\n\nEarly computers\n\nThe first version of the ENIAC computer was programmed via cabling, switches and plugboards.  ENIAC's cabling was later reconfigured to use the existing Function Tables data ROM memory as program ROM memory (the switches and plugboards continued to be used in the reconfigured ENIAC).\nThe IBM 305 RAMAC used a plugboard for all program compare operations and all branch operations. Other plugboards controlled card reading and punching, the printer and the console typewriter. Many peripheral devices, e.g. the IBM 711 and 716, for first and second generation IBM computers, including the IBM 700/7000 series and the IBM 650, were based on unit record machines and included plugboards.\nPlugboards remained in use in specialty-purpose computers for some time, acting as a read only memory (ROM) but able to be manually reprogrammed in the field. One example is the Ferranti Argus computer, used on the Bristol Bloodhound missile, which feature a plugboard programmed by inserting small ferrite rods into slots, in effect creating a read-only core memory by hand.\n\n\nSee also\nEnigma machine\nPowers-Samas, a British manufacturer of unit record equipment that used a removable \"connection-box\" with mechanical linkages instead of a plug board\nTelephone switchboard\nBreadboard, the term for a solderless plugboard used for prototyping electronics\n\n\nReferences\n\nIBM (1956).

    "text": "James Edward McGrory (26 April 1904 – 20 October 1982) was a Scottish footballer who played for Celtic, Clydebank and Scotland as a forward. He later managed Kilmarnock and Celtic.\nMcGrory is the all-time leading goalscorer in top-flight British football, with a total of 550 goals in 547 competitive first-team games at club and international level.\nA legendary figure within Celtic's history, he played for the club for 15 years between 1922 and 1937 (aside from the majority of the 1923–24 season which was spent on loan at fellow Division One side Clydebank), and is Celtic's top scorer of all time with 522 goals from 501 games and holds their record for the most goals in a season, with 62 goals from 46 games in the 1927–28 season. He has also notched up a British top-flight record of 55 hat-tricks, 48 coming in Scottish Football League games and seven from Scottish Cup ties. Some argue that he scored 56, as he hit eight goals in a Scottish League game against Dunfermline Athletic on 14 January 1928, a British top-flight record.\nAfter a spell managing Kilmarnock from December 1937 to July 1945, he became Celtic manager, where he remained for just under 20 years, until March 1965 when he was succeeded by Jock Stein.\nAlthough only 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) tall, McGrory was renowned for his prowess and ability for headers. His trademark was an almost horizontal bullet header, which he used regularly in scoring, and which earned him the nicknames \"the Human Torpedo\" and \"the Mermaid\".\n\n\nEarly life\nMcGrory was born at Millburn Street in the Garngad neighbourhood of Glasgow. He was the son of Henry McGrory and Catherine Coll, both of whom were Irish Catholic immigrants from Ulster. Henry and Catherine had been married at Saint Baithin's Church (known locally as 'the Chapel') in St Johnston, a village in The Laggan district in the east of County Donegal, before emigrating to Scotland. Catherine was from the townland of Cavanacaw and Henry was from the townland of Tullyowen, both in St Johnston, where Jimmy's elder brother was born before the family left Ireland. They lived in Glasgow's East End on his father's wages as a gasworks labourer.\n\n\nPlaying career\n\n\nSt Roch's\nMcGrory began playing for St Roch's Juniors aged 16, earning £2 a week. In his first season of 1921–22, he helped the side win a Double. St Roch's won the Scottish Junior Football League and the Scottish Junior Cup, where he scored the equaliser in a 2–1 win over Kilwinning Rangers. In 2013, St Roch's renamed their ground in honour of McGrory, changing it from Provanmill Park to The James McGrory Park.\n\n\nCeltic\n\n\n1920s\nWith many clubs now scouting McGrory, such as Third Lanark and Fulham, Celtic jumped in first and approached to sign him. He signed his first full professional contract for Celtic on 10 June 1922, for £5 a week, in the pavilion at Third Lanark's Cathkin Park. He made his debut on 20 January 1923, in a 1–0 away defeat, also at Cathkin Park. His first goal came two weeks later on 3 February 1923, in a 4–3 League defeat against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. In total, he made three League and one Scottish Cup appearances, scoring that one goal at Rugby Park.\nHe was loaned out to Clydebank on 7 August 1923 and later that month scored on his debut against Aberdeen at Pittodrie in a 3–1 defeat. On 1 March 1924, he lined up in the Clydebank side to face Celtic at Parkhead. It ended up being quite a bizarre day for him, as he ended up scoring the winner in a shock 2–1 victory for Clydebank. Not long after this, and before the season was out, he was recalled to Celtic. In his time at Clydebank he played 33 League and Scottish Cup games, scoring 16 goals. Having returned to Celtic, he featured in the Glasgow Charity Cup semi-final against Queens Park on 6 May 1924, scoring in a 2–0 win. The final was two days later on 8 May 1924, where he played at outside-left in a 2–1 win over Rangers.\nThe 1924–25 season started poorly, with McGrory not scoring in his first three games, but worse was to come when his father was killed after accidentally being struck by a stone in a local park. McGrory played against Falkirk the following Saturday, just hours after having attended his father's funeral, and yet managed to get off the mark for the season with his first goal in a 2–1 win. With his goalscoring touch returned, he continued to add to his tally until a knee injury in November 1924 ruled him out until into the following year. McGrory returned in stunning form in the 1924–25 Scottish Cup, scoring a hat-trick against Third Lanark and a double against Rangers in a 5–0 semi-final victory. He then headed a last minute winning goal in the 2–1 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dundee on 11 April 1925, the first major honour of his career. He finished his first full season at Celtic with 30 goals.\nThe 1925–26 season was a successful one both personally and collectively, with Celtic winning the 1925–26 Scottish Division One championship and McGrory finishing the season with 49 goals in all competitions, including a streak of scoring in seven consecutive league games. Celtic reached their second successive Scottish Cup Final, but McGrory this time was on the losing side as they lost 2–0 to St Mirren.\nWhile Celtic relinquished the Scottish League title in 1926–27, finishing in third place, McGrory had his best goalscoring season. He started well, twice scoring four goals and twice scoring five, and by New Year had 34 League goals, only one fewer than the previous season's final tally of 35. He was just as prolific in the 1926–27 Scottish Cup, where he scored nine goals in only six outings, although he missed out on playing in the final, which Celtic won 3–1 against East Fife, due to breaking two ribs in an April league defeat to Falkirk. Despite missing the final, he still received a winner's medal on manager Willie Maley's recommendation due to the goals he had scored during their cup run. His 48 league goals throughout the season, including seven hat-tricks, saw him finish the top scorer in the Scottish top flight for the first time. He also scored a further hat trick in the Scottish Cup, in a 6–3 win away at Brechin City, to make a total of 8 hat-tricks for the season. A further two goals in the Glasgow Cup brought McGrory's total for the season to 59 goals.\nBy the late 1920s McGrory was a wanted man; in five seasons he had scored 143 League and Scottish Cup goals in just 152 games, and Celtic had already received and turned down countless offers for him. However, in August 1927 they decided to accept an offer from Arsenal for £10,000, which would have set a new world football transfer record. McGrory accepted a paid holiday invitation from Celtic to make a pilgrimage to the shrine at Lourdes, as a guest of Celtic manager Willie Maley; however, Maley had arranged a meeting with Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman and chairman Sir Samuel Hill-Wood MP in London, which surprised McGrory when he and Maley arrived at Euston railway station. Chapman tried his hardest to persuade McGrory to sign for Arsenal, but he turned him down flatly. Upon their return from Lourdes, McGrory and Maley were again met in London by Chapman and Hill-Wood (this time also surprising Maley) and made one last attempt at getting McGrory's signature, but again failed to persuade him. In the aftermath of his refusal to leave Celtic, McGrory's weekly wage was reduced from £9 to £8 from the beginning of the season, with no warning or reason given. It is generally assumed that this was done out of spite for his refusal to sign for Arsenal and the club's loss of a £10,000 windfall. McGrory would later quip about the episode that \"McGrory of Arsenal just never sounded as good as McGrory of Celtic\".\nIt was ultimately an unsuccessful season though, with Celtic finishing second in the Division One and losing the Scottish Cup Final. Despite all his disappointment, he kept up his exceptional goal scoring feats, completing back to back finishes as top League scorer in Scotland with 47 goals in 36 games. He scored a total of 53 League and Scottish Cup goals in 42 games that season, and a further nine goals in the Glasgow Cup brought his tally up to a total of 62 goals for the season. Among these goals, which again included eight hat-tricks, he created what is still a Celtic, Scottish and British record for the most goals in a top-flight League match by one player, with 8 goals in a 9–0 win over Dunfermline on 14 January 1928.\nCeltic finished second in the 1928–29 league season, but were 16 points behind winners Rangers. They were knocked out of the Scottish Cup at the semi-final stage, losing 0–1 to Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. McGrory spent a lengthy spell on the sidelines after picking up a very bad injury in an appearance for the Scottish League XI at Villa Park in November 1928, and due to this prolonged period on the treatment table he missed a lot of matches and in turn his goalscoring tally was down on the previous three seasons. Nevertheless, he still managed 31 League and Scottish Cup goals in 27 games.\n\n\n1930s\n\nNo honours were achieved either in 1929–30, although McGrory continued to score regularly, netting 36 goals in 29 League and Scottish Cup games. Injuries were by now starting to take their toll on McGrory, who was always a regular target for some brutal 'defending'. He missed the first six games of season 1930–31 due to such an injury. While the League campaign was to ultimately prove disappointing, the team had shown promise and improved on the previous seasons finish of fourth place, running eventual winners Rangers close and finishing in second place only two points behind them. Celtic scored 101 goals in the process, with McGrory helping himself to a very credible 36 of them in only 29 games. The 1930–31 Scottish Cup was to prove more fruitful all round, where he ended up with a winners medal and eight goals from six games. In the Cup Final on 11 April 1931, he scored the opening goal in a 2–2 draw against Motherwell in front of crowd of 104,863 at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The replay took place on 15 April 1931, which Celtic won 4–2 thanks to two goals each from McGrory and Bertie Thomson.\nCeltic found themselves way off the pace again in the 1931–32 Scottish Division One, finishing in third place, 18 points behind champions Motherwell. A huge factor in the indifferent season was the death of their goalkeeper John Thomson on 5 September 1931 at Ibrox Park. Rangers forward Sam English collided with Thomson and his knee struck the goalkeeper's temple, fracturing his skull. Thomson was rushed to the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow, but died later that evening. The effect on the Celtic team was evident in their general performance from that point onwards. McGrory, on top of losing a teammate and friend, was succumbing to more serious injuries and missed large chunks of the season, only playing in 22 of the 38 League games. He and Celtic fared little better in the Scottish Cup, again losing out to Motherwell at the first round of entry, in round three. The injuries put paid to his usual high goal tally, and he suffered his lowest seasonal total since his first full season in 1924–25 season, with 28 goals in 23 League and Scottish Cup games.\nOn 14 March 1936, McGrory achieved the fastest hat-trick in Scottish League history, scoring three goals in less than 3 minutes, during a 5–0 win over Motherwell. He was allowed to leave Celtic in December 1937 to become the manager of Kilmarnock, on the condition that he retired from playing.\n\n\nInternational career\nMcGrory gained a total of seven caps for the Scottish national team, scoring six goals. In the mid and late 1920s he was generally overlooked, as were Dave Halliday and Hughie Ferguson, in favour of Hughie Gallacher who played 18 times in that period, scoring 24 goals in 17 victories and one draw. McGrory's full international debut was at Firhill in 1928 against Ireland when Gallacher was on a two-month suspension; Scotland lost 1–0 to an opponent Gallacher usually scored freely against. McGrory became something of a scapegoat, waiting over three years for his full international recall.\nMcGrory's six other caps were in the 1930s when Gallacher was unavailable due to a ban affecting non-English players playing for English clubs (Gallacher had been at the centre of this club-versus-country dispute when, under pressure from Newcastle United directors in April 1930, he played for them against Arsenal rather than for Scotland against England –  Arsenal felt especially aggrieved since they had released Alex James and David Jack to play in the international at Wembley). In these six games, McGrory scored six goals, but despite this strike rate he was never given an extended run in the team; his final appearance, the only one in which he did not score aside from his debut, was also against Ireland and resulted in defeat, this time at his home club ground Celtic Park. The press were critical of the Scottish players individually and collectively, and McGrory was one of five in the Scotland team who were not selected for international duty again.\nMcGrory received his first calling to play for the Scottish Football League XI on 27 October 1926 to play against the Irish League XI at Tynecastle Park, scoring once in a 5–2 win. He then featured in the match with the English League XI at Filbert Street on 19 March 1927, and scored one goal in a 2–2 draw. He scored twice in a 6–2 defeat against the same opposition at Ibrox Park on 10 March 1928. McGrory played in six Inter-League matches in all, scoring six times.\n\n\nStyle of play\nAlthough he was only 5 ft 6ins, McGrory was renowned for his prowess and ability from headers. His trademark was an almost horizontal, bullet header, which he performed and scored regularly from and which earned him his nicknames, of the \"Human Torpedo\" and the \"Mermaid\". Johnny Paton, who played for Celtic and Chelsea, described McGrory as being \"all strength and muscle\" and having a \"great bull neck\", adding that he was \"the hardest header of a ball I ever saw\" and also had \"a great shot in his right boot.\"\n\n\nManagerial career\n\n\nKilmarnock\nMcGrory became the first full-time manager of Kilmarnock in December 1937. Kilmarnock were struggling in the league, and lost their first two games under McGrory; a humiliating 9–1 rout at the hands of Celtic in his debut as manager and a 4–0 loss to Hibernian. However, the team's form improved and they went on a run of losing only once in a dozen games, and eventually managed to stay up. He also led Kilmarnock to the Scottish Cup Final, knocking out both Celtic and Rangers en route. The final took place on 23 April 1938 between Kilmarnock and East Fife, finishing in a 1–1 draw. The replay was held four days later, Kilmarnock losing 4–2.\nKilmarnock improved further in McGrory's first full season as manager, finishing in a comfortable mid-table position in the league at the end of 1938–39. They weren't able to replicate the previous season's cup form however, going out of the Scottish Cup in the second round to Hibernian. Hopes that McGrory's side of efficient journeymen and enthusiastic youngsters could progress further were quashed by Britain's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939. The Scottish League was abandoned and regional competitions organised in their place to minimise travelling across the country during wartime. Kilmarnock's ground, Rugby Park, was then requisitioned by the army in the summer of 1940 as a fuel depot. The combination of losing their ground and players being conscripted resulted in Kilmarnock stopping playing football altogether. McGrory was kept on officially as manager, but had virtually nothing to do. During this time he found work as chief storeman at a munitions factory in Ayrshire, and he also joined the Home Guard.\nKilmarnock finally returned to playing football again in the summer of 1944, although they had to play their home games at a nearby junior team's ground as Rugby Park was still being used by the army. Eventually their ground was returned to them in April 1945, and the club joined the Southern League for the forthcoming season. However, in July 1945 a Glasgow newspaper reported that McGrory would \"make a sensational move soon.\" He himself later confirmed that Tom White, the Celtic chairman, had telephoned to arrange a meeting. McGrory duly travelled to Glasgow to speak with him, and was offered the job as manager of Celtic.\n\n\nCeltic manager\nOn 24 July 1945, McGrory returned to Parkhead to manage Celtic. His first season proved to be difficult, with the side comprising an uneasy blend of veterans and youngsters. Winger Jimmy Delaney's sale to Manchester United in February 1946, after asking Celtic for a £2 rise in his weekly wage, and the transfer of Malky MacDonald to Kilmarnock further weakened the side. The season then ended in controversy when Celtic lost to Rangers in the semi-final of the Victory Cup, with numerous dubious decisions made against Celtic by a referee who appeared to be affected by alcohol. Celtic made a poor start to the following season, winning only one of their first five games. A further defeat against Third Lanark in September 1946 saw a large number of fans protest outside the ground, although it was the chairman Tom White who was subject of their criticism and not McGrory.\nIn March 1947, Tom White died and director Robert Kelly was elected as his successor as chairman. For the next 18 years, Kelly would be the dominant personality at Celtic Park; imposing his will in the running of the club at all levels including having direct involvement in team selection.\nIn 1948, the club endured an even worse season, and went into their last league game of the season with the possibility of being relegated. Celtic went on to win 3–2 against Dundee, to the relief of all associated with the club. McGrory later described Celtic's flirtation with relegation as \"the worst experience I've ever had in football.\" In June 1948, McGrory signed Charlie Tully from Belfast Celtic for £8,000. Tully was a charismatic performer who combined audacious dribbling with outright showboating and razor sharp wit, making him hugely popular with the Celtic support. Celtic also appointed Jimmy Hogan during the summer of 1948 as a coach. He had previously worked throughout Europe, notably Hungary, and spent six years as the English FA's coach. Hogan only spent two years at Parkhead but is credited with the improvement in Celtic's football in the early 1950s.\nMatters improved in the 1950s, with Bobby Evans, Bertie Peacock, Bobby Collins, along with Tully, making a positive impact on the team. In April 1951, a John McPhail goal saw Celtic defeat Motherwell 1–0 in the Scottish Cup Final for the club's first major trophy since the war. Two years later, Celtic defeated Arsenal, Manchester United and Hibernian to win the Coronation Cup, a one-off tournament held in May 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II.\nIn 1954 Celtic won their first league and cup double for forty years, and their first league title since 1938. Celtic finished five points ahead of Hearts in the league and had the best defensive record in the division (only 29 goals conceded). The Scottish Cup Final was contested between Celtic and Aberdeen. A keenly contested match was won by a Sean Fallon goal after excellent play from Willie Fernie.\nHe also led Celtic to their famous 7-1 Scottish League Cup Final win over Rangers in 1957, which to this day remains a record score-line in a major British cup final. The game and McGrory are remembered in the supporters' song \"Hampden in the Sun\". McGrory is also remembered in another popular song amongst the supporters named after his manager, the \"Willie Maley Song\".\nHis time as manager, however, is considered largely a period of underachievement, and with chairman Robert Kelly's domineering influence in the running of the club, many questioned how much say McGrory had in team selection. The years that followed the League Cup Final win over Rangers saw Celtic struggle and, despite the emergence of hugely promising players such as Billy McNeill, Paddy Crerand, Bertie Auld and Jimmy Johnstone, Celtic won no more major trophies under McGrory.\nCeltic's third-place finish in the league in season 1961–62 saw them qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1962–63; the club's first participation in European club competitions. Drawn against Spanish side Valencia in the first round, Celtic were beaten 4–2 in the first leg in Spain on 24 October 1962, having trailed 3–0 at half time. Bobby Carroll scored Celtic's two goals in the second half, becoming the club's first ever European goalscorer. A modicum of pride after the first leg defeat was restored, however, in the return leg in Glasgow, which finished in a 2–2 draw, albeit seeing Celtic lose the tie on aggregate and be eliminated from the competition.\nThe following season, 1963–64, saw Celtic return to European competition, this time in the European Cup Winners Cup. Celtic belied their mediocre domestic form in Scotland by reaching the semi-final of the tournament, eliminating Basel, Dinamo Zagreb and Slovan Bratislava en route. The first leg of the semi-final against MTK Budapest took place at Celtic Park, and goals from Jimmy Johnstone and Stevie Chalmers gave Celtic an impressive 3–0 win. A combination of tactical naïveté and questionable refereeing saw Celtic slump to a 4–0 defeat in the return leg in Hungary and go out on aggregate.\nMcGrory was manager for nearly 20 years, before Jock Stein succeeded him in March 1965. At this time, the Celtic board appointed McGrory to the new role of Public Relations Officer, a post he would retain until his retirement in 1979.\n\n\nLegacy\nMcGrory is the all-time leading goalscorer in top-flight British football with a total of 550 goals in 547 competitive games. This total includes 6 goals that he scored in 6 Inter-League matches for the Scottish Football League XI. McGrory is a legendary figure within Celtic's history. He is their top scorer of all time with 522 goals from 501 games, and holds their record for the most goals in a season, with 62 goals from 46 games in season 1927–28. He has also notched up a British top-flight record of 55 hat-tricks, 48 coming in League games and 7 from Scottish Cup ties. It could be argued he in fact scored 56, as he hit 8 goals in a Scottish League game against Dunfermline on 14 January 1928. The eight goals scored in that match against Dunfermline is also a British top-flight record. The boots worn by McGrory and football used in that game are on display at the Scottish Football Museum.\nIn 2004, he was inducted into both the Scottish Football Hall of Fame and the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\nCareer statistics\nThe statistics below are based on research compiled by Celtic Football Club historian Pat Woods, who is the author or co-author of ten books on the club.\n\n\nClub\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nInter-league\n\n\nManagerial record\n\nA FibaStats includes a total of 39 games for season 1939–40, however 34 of these were for the unofficial regional league and cup competitions that were introduced during WW2.
