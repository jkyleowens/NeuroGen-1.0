    "text": "In the partnership card game contract bridge, the Blackwood convention is a bidding convention developed by Easley Blackwood in 1933 and still widely used in the modern game. Its purpose is to enable the partnership to explore its possession of aces, kings and in some variants, the queen of trumps to judge whether a slam would be a feasible contract. The essence of the convention is the use of an artificial 4NT bid made under certain conditions to ask partner how many aces he has; responses by partner are made in step-wise fashion to indicate the number held.\n\n\nBlackwood's original summary\nAfter developing the concept in 1933, Easley Blackwood submitted an article proposing his slam-seeking convention to The Bridge World magazine but it was rejected. Nevertheless, it gained awareness and use amongst players and was written about by several authors. In his own first publication on the convention in 1949, Easley Blackwood comments on the entries in books by others and noted that \"...in every one of these books, they have it wrong!\" He pointed out several misconceptions and concluded with a fifteen-point summary of the \"complete and official\" Blackwood Slam Convention. A synopsis of that summary follows:\n\nIn order to make the 4NT ace-asking bid, you must first:\nthink your partnership has sufficient strength for a slam,\nexpect to be able to make at the five-level even if partner has no aces, and\nbe prepared with a sound rebid no matter how partner responds\nPartner's responses to the 4NT ace-asking bid are made in step-wise fashion:\n5♣ to indicate 0 or 4 aces\n5♦ to indicate 1 ace\n5♥ to indicate 2 aces\n5♠ to indicate 3 aces\nWhen responding, do not count a void as an ace.\nGenerally, 4NT is ace-asking when your side has bid a suit. There are exceptions:\nwhen notrump has previously been bid by partner and he subsequently removes one's four-level suit bid to 4NT\nwhen a previous opportunity to employ 4NT as ace-asking has not been taken\nWhen clubs are expected to be trumps, one must have at least two aces to employ 4NT ace-asking and when diamonds are to be trump, one must have at least one ace.\nThe 4NT bidder is only partial captain of the auction and responder has certain rights:\nthe 4NT bidder sets the level of the contract but partner may correct the denomination\nwhen responder has a void in the suit in which he would convey, at the five-level, the number of aces he possesses, he may jump to six of the void suit to convey both the number of aces and the location of the void.\nwhen responder has a void and his ace-showing response is in a suit of lower rank than the trump suit, he first tells partner the number of aces he has. If partner signs-off at the five-level, responder may continue to slam if his holding justifies it.\nIf the 4NT bidder, after hearing partner's response, bids a previously unmentioned suit, responder must bid 5NT to end the auction.\nAn ace shown by a cuebid by either partner should not be counted in responding to the 4NT ace-asking bid.\nA 5NT bid after a response to a 4NT ace-asking bid, asks for kings.\nPartner's responses to the 5NT king-asking bid are made in step-wise fashion:\n6♣ to indicate 0 kings\n6♦ to indicate 1 king\n6♥ to indicate 2 kings\n6♠ to indicate 3 kings\n6NT to indicate 4 kings\nTo ask for kings via 5NT, one must first ask for aces via 4NT even when possessing all four aces oneself.\nA jump to 5NT without employing the 4NT ace-asking bid is the Culbertson Grand Slam Force and obliges partner to bid the grand slam if he holds two of the three top trumps and a small slam if he does not.\nIf the opponents interfere after the 4NT ace-asking bid, a Pass by responder indicates no aces, the suit one above the opponent's indicates one ace, two above indicates two and so on.\nExcept in duplicate, the king-asking 5NT bid assures partner possession of all four aces.\nAfter a 5NT king-asking bid, neither partner is captain and either can set the final contract.\n\n\nVariations based on 4NT as asking\nSeveral versions of Blackwood are available: Standard Blackwood, Roman Blackwood and Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKC or RKCB). All versions are initiated by a bid of four notrump (4NT), and the entire family of conventions may be called Blackwood 4NT in both versions, or Key Card 4NT in the key card variation.\nThere are other 4NT conventions, such as Culbertson 4-5 Notrump, Norman Four Notrump and San Francisco, but almost all bridge partnerships employ some member of the Blackwood family (which includes Byzantine Blackwood) as part of their slam-investigation methods.\nIf the partnership's preceding call is a natural bid in notrump, then 4NT is usually played as natural. Over an opposing pass it is simply a raise and a quantitative invitation to six notrump, a small slam. Over an intervening four of a suit by opponents it is usually played as a competitive raise, expecting to play four notrump. Those natural interpretations may hold in other auctions where the partnership has previously bid notrump naturally or shown a balanced hand conventionally. In some situations where 4NT is a quantitative invitation, especially where 4♣ is a jump, many partnerships use the Gerber convention instead of the Blackwood family: 4♣ asks for the number of aces or key cards.\nWhere both sides are bidding, 4NT is often played as a conventional takeout asking partner to help choose one of two or three suits, similar to a lower-level takeout double or cuebid reply to such a double.\n\n\nStandard Blackwood\nWhere standard Blackwood 4NT is in force, a four notrump bid (4NT) asks partner to disclose the number of aces in his hand. With no aces or four, partner replies 5♣; with one, two, or three aces, 5♦, 5♥, or 5♠, respectively. The difference between no aces and four is clear to the Blackwood bidder (unless the partnership lacks all four) so one member of the partnership knows the combined number of aces. That is often sufficient to set the final contract. (A common agreement is that when spades is not the trump suit, 5♠ asks responder to bid 5NT. That is useful when the reply to 4NT bypasses the intended trump suit but also shows that slam is likely to be a poor contract because two aces are missing.)\nThe continuation bid of 5NT asks for the number of kings according to the same code of replies at the six-level: 6♣ shows no kings or four, etc. Asking for the number of kings confirms that the partnership holds all four aces, so partner may reply at the seven level with expectation of taking thirteen tricks.\nA void may be as good as an ace in some situations but it should not be counted as an ace. Some experts (Kantar for one) recommend the 5NT reply to 4NT – the cheapest with no standard assigned meaning – to show a void plus two aces and six of a suit to show a void in the bid suit plus one ace.\n\n\nRoman Blackwood\nA variation of the standard Blackwood convention, known as Roman Blackwood, was popularized by the Italian Blue Team in the 1960s. In Roman Blackwood, the responses are more ambiguous, but more space-conserving. The basic outline of responses is:\n\nIn practice, the ambiguity is unlikely to occur, as a strength difference between hands with 0 or 1 and 3 or 4 aces is big enough that it can be established in previous rounds of bidding. In other words, a partner who has previously shown, for example, 12-15 range of high points is unlikely to hold 3 aces for his bid, etc.\nEven Roman Blackwood convention has several variations, revolving around 5♥ and 5♠ responses. In all variants, they denote 2 aces. One variation is that 5♠ shows extra values, while 5♥ does not. In other variations, responses 5♥ - 5NT denote specific combinations of aces (same color, same rank, or \"mixed\").\nIf the querying partner ascertains that all aces are present, he can continue as follows:\n\n5NT is the Grand slam force\nThe first available bid which is not the agreed suit is the Roman Blackwood for kings. The partner responds stepwise, as above.\n\n\nRoman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB)\nRoman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB) has largely replaced the standard version among tournament players. It developed from the Roman Blackwood variant (see above). According to RKCB there are five equivalent key cards rather than just the four aces: the trump king is counted as the fifth key card. The key card replies to 4NT are more compressed than standard ones and they also begin to locate the queen of trumps.\n\nAlthough the replies to 4NT are more compressed, it is almost always possible to infer which number of keycards is correct: 0 or 3, 1 or 4, 2 or 5. Evidence for that inference includes the entire auction as well as the number of key cards that the 4NT bidder holds.\nThe 5♥ and 5♠ replies with 2 or 5 key cards also deny and show the trump queen, respectively. (Responder may also show the queen with extra length in trumps, typically indicating a 10-card fit, where the ace and king will probably draw all outstanding cards in the suit.)\nThe 5♣ and 5♦ replies tell nothing about the queen or extra length, but the 4NT bidder may ask about that using the cheapest bid other than five of the trump suit. The code for replies to that \"queen ask\" vary; a common rule is that the cheapest bid in the trump suit denies the queen or extra length and any other call shows it. An option is for the positive calls to show a feature, such as a king in that suit, and 6 of the trump suit can show the queen of trumps with no outside kings.\nRoman Key Card Blackwood is predicated on existence of a trump suit, which determines which of the four kings and queens responder should show as key cards. Trump agreement is not necessary, however. One common rule is that the last suit bid before 4NT bid is the key suit, lacking trump agreement.\nSome partnerships use the club response to show 1 or 4 and the diamond response to show 3 or none, dubbed \"1430\" (coincidentally the score for making a vulnerable small slam in a major suit), with the original version being dubbed \"3014\" when distinction is necessary. In order to facilitate the Queen Ask, an experts' version has been developed, where \"1430\" is used by the strong hand and \"3014\" is used by the weak hand. There are specific rules which determine when the asker hand is the weak one and when it is the strong one.\n\n\nKey Card Blackwood (KCB)\nA half-way house between standard Blackwood and RKCB is Keycard Blackwood. Again there are five key cards, including the trump king, but unlike RKCB, the queen of trumps is not considered.\n5♣ – 0 or 4 key cards\n5♦ – 1 or 5 key cards \n5♥ – 2 key cards\n5♠ – 3 key cards\nThis is advocated by Bernard Magee as being simpler for club players, as with RKCB players are sometimes unsure whether partner holds 0 or 3 key cards, or 1 or 4.\n\n\nVariations not based on 4NT\n\n\nKickback\n\"Kickback\" is the variant of RKCB devised by Jeff Rubens in accordance with the Useful Space Principle. The step responses are the same as in RKCB, but the ask is not necessarily 4NT. Instead it is the 4-level bid immediately above the agreed trump suit; i.e.:\n\nKickback has the advantage that it saves bidding space and, especially for minor-suit fits, provides safety at the 5-level if the required key cards are missing. Because the Kickback bid would otherwise be a control bid, 4NT is usually substituted as the control bid in that suit (e.g., 4NT is a control bid in hearts if the agreed trump suit is diamonds). The drawback is that in unpracticed partnerships there can be confusion as to whether a bid is Kickback, a control bid or preference for a different strain:\n\nEast intended 4♥ as Kickback, but West thought it was secondary support for hearts, and decided to pass with minimum values. As result, a reasonable grand slam in diamonds was missed.\nAn established partnership might have agreed that as hearts were not supported after opener's rebid, 4♥ cannot possibly show support, and must be ace asking in diamonds.\n\n\nRedwood\n\"Redwood\" is a variation of Kickback that is only used when a minor suit is trumps. A 4 level bid in the suit above the agreed trump suit is the ace / key card ask and the name comes from the fact that this bid will always be a red suit:\n4♦– RKCB for clubs\n4♥– RKCB for diamonds\nOnce key cards have been identified the next step bid (other than trumps) can be used to ask for Kings.\nOne advantage of this approach is that it avoids the potential for misunderstanding that can occur when using Minorwood but one disadvantage is that it uses up one more bid (than Minorwood) and might constrain the bidding later when asking for Kings or Queens.\nUsing \"Redwood,\" the ace/key card ask of 4NT is still used when the trump suit is a major (hearts or spades).\n\n\nMinorwood\n\"Minorwood\" is a variation of Blackwood, in which the minor suit which the partners agree will be trumps is itself used as the ace/key card ask. The ask will be at the four level. Hence:\n4♣– RKCB for clubs\n4♦– RKCB for diamonds\nOne disadvantage to this convention is that either the partnership must agree to lose the natural 4 level bid in trumps or have clear agreement on which sequences are slam seeking and which are natural bids. The advantage of this approach is that it conserves bidding space.  For example, the use of Redwood reduces the risk of a misunderstanding but uses up one more bid and might constrain the bidding later when asking for Kings or Queens.\n\n\nExclusion Blackwood\nExclusion Blackwood or Voidwood. was devised by Bobby Goldman as an attempt to resolve the situation when the Blackwood-asker has a void. In that case, he is not interested in the partner's ace in the void suit, as he already has the first-round control; partner's ace would present a duplicated value in that case. Many players, even experts, refuse to play Exclusion Blackwood because of the potential disaster of forgetting the agreement.\nIt is usually played as the Roman Key Card Blackwood, with only four key cards: the three Aces outside the void suit and the King of trumps. However, the asking bid is not 4NT, but the void suit — Voidwood is made by jumping on level 4 or 5 in the void suit after a fit has been found, for example:\n\nBids of 5♣, 5♦ and 5♥ present a Voidwood, denoting the void in the suit bid and asking for other key cards. The responses are, as in RKCB:\n1st step – 0 or 3 key cards (1 or 4, if playing 1430)\n2nd step – 1 or 4 key cards (0 or 3)\n3rd step – 2 key cards without trump queen\n4th step – 2 key cards with trump queen\n\n\nSee also\nGerber convention\nGlossary of contract bridge terms\nGrand slam force\nNorman four notrump\nQuantitative no trump bids\nSan Francisco convention\nSlam-seeking conventions\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBlackwood, Easely (1949).

    "text": "The early life and military career of John Sidney McCain III spans the first forty-five years of his life (1936–1981). McCain's father and grandfather were admirals in the United States Navy. McCain was born on August 29, 1936, in the Panama Canal Zone, and attended many schools growing up as his family moved among naval facilities. McCain graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958. He married the former Carol Shepp in 1965; he adopted two children from her previous marriage and they had another child together.\nAs a naval aviator, McCain flew attack aircraft from carriers. During the Vietnam War, he narrowly escaped death in the 1967 Forrestal fire. On his twenty-third  bombing mission during Operation Rolling Thunder in October 1967, he was shot down over Hanoi and badly injured. He subsequently endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war, including periods of torture. In 1968, he refused a North Vietnamese offer of early release, because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners who had been held longer. He was released in 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords.\nUpon his return, McCain studied at the National War College, commanded a large training squadron in Florida, and was appointed the Navy liaison to the U.S. Senate. He divorced his wife Carol in 1980 and married the former Cindy Hensley shortly thereafter. He retired from the Navy in 1981 as a captain.\n\n\nEarly years and education\n\n\nFamily heritage\n\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born on August 29, 1936, at a United States Navy hospital at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, which at that time was considered to be among the unincorporated territories of the United States. His parents were Navy officer John S. \"Jack\" McCain, Jr. (1911–1981) and Roberta (Wright) McCain (1912–2020). McCain was of Scots-Irish and English ancestry.\nJohn McCain's grandparents were natives of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, and much of his ancestry was Southern on both his mother's side and father's side. The McCain family's patrilineal ancestral home is in Mississippi's Carroll County; they owned and ran a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) plantation in Teoc from 1848 until 1952. The plantation had slaves before the American Civil War – some of whose descendants share the surname and call themselves the \"black McCains\" – and sharecroppers afterward; influential blues guitarist Mississippi John Hurt was born on the plantation to one of the latter.\nThe McCain family tree has a long heritage of American military service, with ancestors fighting as soldiers in the Indian Wars, American Revolutionary War (due to which McCain maintained a membership with the Sons of the American Revolution), War of 1812, for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War, and in World War I. The tree also includes roguish behavior and economic success. John McCain's maternal grandfather, Archibald Wright (1875–1971), was a Mississippi native who migrated to Muskogee, Oklahoma, in his twenties, ran afoul of the law with several gambling and bootlegging charges, then became a strong-willed wildcatter who prospered on land deals during the early statehood years and struck oil in the Southwest. Rich by age forty, he never worked again and became a stay-at-home father. Raising a family in Oklahoma and Southern California, he instilled in Roberta and her twin sister Rowena a lifelong habit of travel and adventure. There is also independent-minded behavior in the family tree: Jack McCain and Roberta Wright eloped and married in a bar in Tijuana, Mexico, when Archibald Wright's wife Myrtle objected to Roberta's association with a sailor.\nMcCain's father and paternal grandfather eventually became Navy admirals, and were the first father–son pair to achieve four-star admiral rank. His grandfather, Admiral John S. \"Slew\" McCain, Sr. (1884–1945), was a pioneer of aircraft carrier operations who in 1942 commanded all land-based air operations in support of the Guadalcanal Campaign, and who ultimately in 1944–1945 aggressively led the Fast Carrier Task Force in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. His operations off the Philippines and Okinawa, and air strikes against Formosa and the Japanese home islands, caused tremendous destruction of Japanese naval and air forces in the closing period of the war. His death four days after the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay was front-page news. Jack McCain was a submarine commander in several theaters of operation in World War II and was decorated with both the Silver Star Medal and Bronze Star Medal.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nFor his first ten years, \"Johnny\" McCain (the nickname he was given as part of a family tradition of distinguishing the generations) was frequently uprooted as his family, including older sister Sandy (1934–2019) and younger brother Joe (born 1942), followed his father to New London, Connecticut, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other stations in the Pacific Ocean. Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family's Teoc plantation, but McCain always felt his heritage was military, not Southern. McCain attended whatever naval base school was available, often to the detriment of his education, as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often erratic. After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, his father was absent for long stretches. His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose him to historical and cultural sites. He later wrote, \"She taught me to find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of living.\" A Republican, she also made sure that he followed current events, although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father's military career.\nAfter World War II ended, his father stayed in the Navy, sometimes working political liaison posts. The family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended the educationally stronger St. Stephen's School in Alexandria from 1946 to 1949. To his family, McCain had long been quiet, dependable, and courteous, while at St. Stephen's he began to develop an unruly, defiant streak. Another two years were then spent following his father to naval stations; altogether he attended about twenty schools during his youth. He was frequently disciplined in school for fighting. He later wrote, \"The repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood constantly disrupted by the demands of my father's career... At each new school I arrived eager to make, by means of my insolent attitude, new friends to compensate for the loss of others. At each new school I grew more determined to assert my crude individualism. At each new school I became a more unrepentant pain in the neck.\"\n\nIn 1951, McCain enrolled at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, an academically superior, all-male private boarding school with a rigorous honor code, tradition of hazing, and spartan living environment. Most of the children there were sons of wealthy Southerners, from whom McCain got a glimpse of life and career aspirations outside the Navy culture.  Nicknamed \"Punk\" and \"McNasty\" due to his combative, fiery disposition, McCain enjoyed and cultivated a tough guy image; he also made a few friends. McCain earned two varsity letters in wrestling, excelling in the lighter weight classes. He also played on the junior varsity football team and the tennis team, and participated in the student newspaper, yearbook, and drama club. English teacher William Bee Ravenel III, who was also his football coach, became a great influence towards his sense of learning, honor, and self-image. With what he later termed an \"undistinguished, but acceptable\" academic record, McCain graduated from high school in 1954.\n\n\nNaval Academy\nHaving done well on its entrance exams, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in June 1954, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. He had neither been ordered to go there by his parents nor discussed alternatives; as he later wrote, \"I remember simply recognizing my eventual enrollment at the Academy as an immutable fact of life, and accepting it without comment.\"\nAmbivalent about his presence there, McCain chose not to conform to the Academy's rules and some of its traditions. Each year he was given over a hundred demerits – earning him membership in the \"Century Club\" – for offenses such as shoes not being shined, formation faults, room in disorder, and talking out of place. His father came to the Academy to reprimand him on his behavior a number of times. He hated \"plebe year\", the trial by ordeal and hazing of entering midshipmen that would eventually weed out one quarter of the class. He did not take well to those of higher rank arbitrarily wielding power over him – \"It was bullshit, and I resented the hell out of it\" – and occasionally intervened when he saw it being done to others. At 5-foot 7 inches and 127 pounds (1.70 m and 58 kg), he competed as a lightweight boxer for three years, where he lacked skills but was fearless and \"didn't have a reverse gear\". In his final year, he managed the battalion boxing team to a brigade championship.\nPossessed of a strong intelligence, McCain did well in a few subjects that interested him, such as English literature, history, and government. There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all midshipmen; McCain's classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities on mathematics, science, and engineering courses and thought his low grades were by inclination and not ability, while McCain would later acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him. His class rank was further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership, which reflected his sloppy appearance, rebellious attitude, and poor relations with his company officer. Despite his low standing, McCain was popular and a leader among his fellow midshipmen, in what writer Robert Timberg, in his acclaimed 1995 work The Nightingale's Song, called a \"manic, intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way\". Good at attracting women, McCain was famed for organizing off-Yard activities with a group who called themselves \"the Bad Bunch\"; one classmate said that \"being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck.\" Other midshipmen were annoyed by his behavior. A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer USS Hunt found McCain showing good skills at the conn, and the destination stop in Rio de Janeiro led to a dream-like romance with Brazilian fashion model and ballerina Maria Gracinda that persisted through a Christmastime reunion.\nMcCain graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1958; he was fifth from the bottom in class rank, 894th out of 899. Despite his difficulties, McCain later wrote that he never defamed the more compelling traditions of the Academy – courage, resilience, honor, and sacrifice for one's country – and he never wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same mettle as his naval forebears. Indeed, Slew and Jack McCain had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively. McCain realized later that the Academy had taught him that \"to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime it would be necessary for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my self-interest\", a lesson that he would need to carry him through a \"desperate and uncertain\" time a decade later.\n\n\nMilitary career\n\n\nNaval training, early assignments, first marriage, and children\n\nMcCain was commissioned an ensign on June 4, 1958. He spent two years as a naval aviator in training, first at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida through September 1959, and then at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, during which time he was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade. He earned a reputation as a party man, as he drove a Corvette, dated an exotic dancer named \"Marie the Flame of Florida\", spent all his free time on the beach or in a Bachelor Officer Quarters room turned bar and friendly gambling den, and, as he later said, \"generally misused my good health and youth\". He began as a sub-par flier: he had limited patience for studying aviation manuals, and spent study time reading history books instead. He was not assigned to the elite units flying fighter aircraft, and instead became a pilot of attack aircraft. During a March 1960 practice run in Texas, he lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-engine, piston-driven AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. Although momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact, he squeezed out of the cockpit and swam ten feet to the surface, escaping without major injuries. He graduated from flight school at Corpus Christi in May 1960. He joined squadron VA-42 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for five months of further training on the Skyraider.\nStarting in November 1960, McCain flew Skyraiders with the VA-65 \"World Famous Fighting Tigers\" squadron on the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise. The carriers were based at Naval Station Norfolk and cruised in the Caribbean and in several deployments to the Mediterranean. His aviation skills improved, but around December 1961 he collided with power lines while flying recklessly low over southern Spain. The area suffered a power outage, but McCain was able to return his damaged Skyraider to Intrepid.\nOn board for Enterprise's maiden voyage in January 1962, McCain gained visibility with the captain and shipboard publicity that fellow sailors and aviators attributed to his famous last name. McCain was made a lieutenant in June 1962, and was on alert duty on Enterprise when it helped enforce the naval quarantine of Cuba during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In November 1963, he was rotated back to shore duty, serving nine months on the staff of the Naval Air Basic Training Command at Pensacola. In September 1964, he became a flight instructor with the VT-7 training squadron at Naval Air Station Meridian in Mississippi, where McCain Field had been named for his grandfather.\nDuring the 1964 stint at Pensacola, McCain began a relationship with Carol Shepp, a successful swimwear and runway model originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They had known each other at the Naval Academy and she had married and then divorced one of his classmates. McCain told her he wanted to do something important with his life, so he would be recorded in history. On July 3, 1965, McCain married Shepp in Philadelphia. She already had two children, Douglas and Andrew, born in 1959 and 1962 respectively; he adopted them in 1966. Carol and he then had a daughter named Sidney in September 1966.\nIn the summer of 1965, McCain appeared as a contestant on the television quiz show Jeopardy! (during the Art Fleming era). McCain won the first day, but lost on the second day. He later recalled Final Jeopardy making the difference, where the clue was \"Cathy loves him, but she married Edgar Linton instead\". McCain knew the novel in question, writing down \"What is Wuthering Heights?\", but the clue was looking for the specific character, \"Who is Heathcliff?\"\n\nIn November 1965, he had his third accident when apparent engine failure in his T-2 Buckeye trainer jet over the Eastern Shore of Virginia led to his ejecting safely before his plane crashed. While at Meridian, McCain requested a combat assignment. In October 1966, he was slated for upcoming Vietnam War duty, and so reported to the VA-44 Replacement Air Group squadron at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Florida for training on the A-4 Skyhawk, a single-seat jet attack aircraft. There McCain was seen as a good pilot, albeit one who tended to \"push the envelope\" in his flying. Promoted to lieutenant commander in January 1967, McCain joined the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal by May 1967, flying Skyhawks with the VA-46 \"Clansmen\" squadron. Forrestal conducted training exercises in the Atlantic early in the year, then set sail for the Pacific in June. By this time, Jack McCain had risen in the ranks, making rear admiral in 1958 and vice admiral in 1963; in May 1967, he was promoted to four-star admiral, and became Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, stationed in London.\n\n\nVietnam operations\nOn July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin and joined Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–68 air interdiction and strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. By the end of 1966, Rolling Thunder was not meeting its most important goals. Accordingly, for 1967 an emphasized focus was placed on strategic industrial and resupply targets such as power plants, port facilities, and the like, including some targets that had previously been deemed too politically sensitive to attack. In particular, the alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. The flights were quite dangerous, due to the strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, \"The target list was so restricted that we had to go back and hit the same targets over and over again... Most of our pilots flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless. In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion of what it took to win the war.\"\n\nMcCain was almost killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. While the air wing was preparing to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. McCain later said, \"I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere.\" McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to the nose of the jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestal's ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134 sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20 aircraft, and took 24 hours to control. In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told The New York Times reporter R. W. Apple Jr., \"It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam.\" But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, \"I always wanted to be in the Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation.\"\n\nAs Forrestal headed to port for repairs, McCain volunteered to join the undermanned VA-163 \"Saints\" squadron on board the USS Oriskany. This carrier had earlier endured its own deck fire disaster and its squadrons had suffered some of the heaviest losses during Rolling Thunder. The Saints had a reputation for aggressive, daring attacks, but paid the price: in 1967, one-third of their pilots were killed or captured, and all of their original fifteen A-4s had been destroyed. After taking some leave in Europe and back home in Orange Park, Florida, McCain joined Oriskany on September 30, 1967, for a tour he expected would finish early the next summer. He volunteered to fly the squadron's most dangerous missions right away, rather than work his way up to them. During October 1967, the pilots operated in constant twelve-hour on, twelve-hour off shifts. McCain would be awarded a Navy Commendation Medal for leading his air section through heavy enemy fire during an October 18 raid on the Lac Trai shipyard in Haiphong. On October 25, McCain successfully attacked the Phúc Yên Air Base north of Hanoi through a barrage of anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missile fire; credited with destroying one aircraft on the ground and damaging two, the raid would garner him the Air Medal. Air defenses around Hanoi were at this point the strongest they would be during the entire war.\n\n\nPrisoner of war\n\n\nArrival\n\nOn October 26, 1967, McCain was flying his twenty-third mission, part of a twenty-plane strike force against the Yen Phu thermal power plant in central Hanoi that previously had almost always been off-limits to U.S. raids due to the possibility of collateral damage. Arriving just before noon, McCain dove from 9,000 to 4,000 feet on his approach; as he neared the target, warning systems in McCain's A-4E Skyhawk alerted him that he was being tracked by enemy fire-control radar. Like other U.S. pilots in similar situations, he did not break off the bombing run, and he held his dive until he released his bombs at about 3,500 feet (1,000 m). As he started to pull up, the Skyhawk's wing was blown off by a Soviet-made SA-2 anti-aircraft missile fired by the North Vietnamese Air Defense Command's 61st Battalion, commanded by Captain Nguyen Lan assisted by fire control officer Lieutenant Nguyen Xuan Dai. McCain was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this day, while Nguyen Xuan Dai was awarded the title Hero of the People's Armed Forces. Decades later, Soviet Army Lieutenant Yuri Trushechkin claimed that he had been the missile guidance officer who had shot McCain down. In any case, the raid was a failure, as the power plant was not damaged and three of the attacking planes were shot down.)\n\nMcCain's plane went into a vertical inverted spin. McCain bailed out upside down at high speed; the force of the ejection fractured his right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him unconscious. McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he regained consciousness, he could not use his arms. Eventually, he was able to inflate his life vest using his teeth. Several Vietnamese, possibly led by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore. A mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and left groin area. He was then transported to Hanoi's main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the \"Hanoi Hilton\" by American POWs.\nMcCain reached Hỏa Lò in as bad a physical condition as any prisoner during the war. His captors refused to give him medical care unless he gave them military information; they beat and interrogated him, but McCain only offered his name, rank, serial number, and date of birth (the only information he was required to provide under the Geneva Conventions and permitted to give under the U.S. Code of Conduct). Soon thinking he was near death, McCain said he would give them more information if taken to the hospital, hoping he could then put his interrogators off once he was treated. A prison doctor came and said it was too late, as McCain was about to die anyway. Only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a high-ranking admiral did they give him medical care, calling him \"the crown prince\". Two days after McCain's plane went down, that event and his status as a POW made the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. Interrogation and beatings resumed in the hospital; McCain gave the North Vietnamese his ship's name, squadron's name, and the attack's intended target. This information, along with personal details of McCain's life and purported statements by McCain about the war's progress, would appear over the next two weeks in the North Vietnamese official newspaper Nhân Dân as well as in dispatches from outlets such as the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina. Disclosing the military information was in violation of the Code of Conduct, which McCain later wrote he regretted, although he saw the information as being of no practical use to the North Vietnamese. Further coerced to give future targets, he named cities that had already been bombed, and responding to demands for the names of his squadron's members, he supplied instead the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line.\n\nMcCain spent six weeks in the hospital, receiving marginal care in a dirty, wet environment. A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm, done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful; he received an operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm. He was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, François Chalais, whose report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968 and later in the U.S. on the CBS Evening News. The film footage of McCain lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly, would become one of the most widely distributed images of McCain's imprisonment. McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Tuân and Defense Minister and Army commander-in-chief General Võ Nguyên Giáp. Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain must be part of America's political-military-economic elite. Now having lost fifty pounds (twenty-three kilograms), in a chest cast, covered in grime and eyes full of fever, and with his hair turned white, in early December 1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed \"the Plantation\". He was placed in a cell with George \"Bud\" Day, a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot (later awarded the Medal of Honor) and Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain to live another week. Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and kept him alive; Day later recalled that McCain had \"a fantastic will to live\".\n\n\nSolitary\nIn March 1968, McCain was put into solitary confinement, where he remained for two years. Unknown to the POWs, in April 1968, Jack McCain was named Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC) effective in July, stationed in Honolulu and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater. In mid-June, Major Bai, commander of the North Vietnamese prison camp system, offered McCain a chance to return home early. The North Vietnamese wanted to score a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful, and also wanted to show other POWs that members of the elite like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain turned down the offer of release, due to the POWs' \"first in, first out\" interpretation of the U.S. Code of Conduct: he would only accept the offer if every man captured before him was released as well. McCain's refusal to be released was remarked upon by North Vietnamese senior negotiator Lê Đức Thọ to U.S. envoy Averell Harriman, during the ongoing Paris Peace Talks. Enraged by his declining of the offer, Bai and his assistant told McCain that things would get very bad for him.\nIn late August 1968, a program of vigorous torture methods began on McCain. The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged, painful positions and severely beat him every two hours, all while he was suffering from dysentery. His right leg was reinjured, his ribs were cracked, some teeth were broken at the gumline, and his left arm was re-fractured. Lying in his own waste, his spirit was broken; the beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by guards. After four days of this, McCain signed and taped an anti-American propaganda \"confession\" that said, in part, \"I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life, thanks to the doctors.\" He used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced. McCain was haunted then and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country, his family, his comrades and himself by his statement, but as he later wrote, \"I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.\" Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a second statement; his will to resist restored, he refused. He sometimes received two to three beatings per week because of his continued resistance; the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year. His refusals to cooperate, laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards, were often heard by other POWs. His boxing experience from his Naval Academy days helped him withstand the battering, and the North Vietnamese did not break him again.\n\nOther American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract \"confessions\" and propaganda statements. Many, especially among those who had been captured earlier and imprisoned longer – such as those in the \"Alcatraz Gang\" – endured even worse treatment than McCain. Under extreme duress, virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their captors. There were momentary exceptions: on one occasion, a guard surreptitiously loosened McCain's painful rope bindings for a night; when, months later, the guard later saw McCain on Christmas Day, he stood next to McCain and silently drew a cross in the dirt with his foot. In October 1968, McCain's isolation was partly relieved when Ernest C. Brace was placed in the cell next to him; he taught Brace the tap code the prisoners used to communicate. On Christmas Eve 1968, a church service for the POWs was staged for photographers and film cameras; McCain defied North Vietnamese instructions to be quiet, speaking out details of his treatment then shouting \"Fu-u-u-u-ck you, you son of a bitch!\" and giving the finger whenever a camera was pointed at him. McCain refused to meet with various anti-Vietnam War peace groups coming to Hanoi, such as those led by David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, and Rennie Davis, not wanting to give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father. McCain was still badly hobbled by his injuries, earning the nickname \"Crip\" among the other POWs, but despite his physical condition, continued beatings and isolation, he was one of the key players in the Plantation's resistance efforts.\nIn May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began publicly questioning North Vietnamese treatment of U.S. prisoners. On June 6, 1969, a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast, made on June 2, that denied any such mistreatment. The transmission, one of a series of North Vietnamese propaganda broadcasts on the subject of prisoners, used excerpts from McCain's spoken, forced \"confession\" of a year before, including statements such as: \"I have bombed the cities, towns and villages and caused injuries and even death for the people of North Vietnam. After I was captured, I was taken to a hospital in Hanoi where I received very good medical treatment. I was given an operation on my leg which enabled me to walk again and a cast on my right arm, which was badly broken in three places. The doctors are very good and they knew a great deal about medicine.\" (The broadcast was picked up and recorded by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service and copies of it are available from the National Archives and Records Administration, as a 2016 newspaper story confirmed.)\nStarting in late 1969, treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved. North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs. Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected, and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included McCain's brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hỏa Lò, \"Hanoi Hilton\"; his solitary confinement ended in March 1970. When the prisoners talked about what they wanted to do once they got out, McCain said he wanted to become president. McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside Hỏa Lò with Spanish-born, Cuban psychologist Fernando Barral, that was published in the official Cuban newspaper Granma. McCain talked about his life and expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam, and Barral proclaimed him \"an insensitive individual without human depth.\" The POWs issued an edict forbidding any further such interviews, and despite pressure from his captors, McCain subsequently refused to see any anti-war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime.\n\n\nRelease\n\nMcCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times, but conditions over the next several years were generally more tolerable than they had been before. Unknown to them, during each year that Jack McCain was CINCPAC he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in South Vietnam serving closest to the DMZ; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get. By 1971, some 30–50 percent of the POWs had become disillusioned about the war, both because of the apparent lack of military progress and what they heard of the growing anti-war movement in the U.S., and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese. McCain was not among them: he participated in a defiant church service and led an effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light, and as a result spent much of the year in a camp reserved for \"bad attitude\" cases.\nBack at the \"Hanoi Hilton\" from November 1971 onward, McCain and the other POWs cheered the resumed bombing of the north starting in April 1972, whose targets included the Hanoi area and whose daily orders were issued by Jack McCain, knowing his son was in the vicinity. Jack McCain's tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972, despite his desire to have it extended so he could see the war to its conclusion. The old-time POWs cheered even more during the intense \"Christmas Bombing\" campaign of December 1972, when Hanoi was subjected for the first time to repeated B-52 Stratofortress raids. Although its explosions lit the night sky and shook the walls of the camp, scaring some of the newer POWs, most saw it as a forceful measure to compel North Vietnam to finally come to terms.\nThe Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27, 1973, ending direct U.S. involvement in the war, but the Operation Homecoming arrangements for the 591 American POWs took longer. McCain was finally released from captivity on March 14, 1973, being taken by bus to Gia Lam Airport, transferred to U.S. custody, and flown by C-141 to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. (After the last of the POWs had been released, McCain's forced \"confession\", along with similar statements from other POWs, was aired again during a Voice of Vietnam broadcast on April 10, 1973, as the North Vietnamese sought to refute the returning prisoners' tales of having been tortured.)\nAltogether, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years, nearly five of them after his refusal to accept the out-of-sequence repatriation offer. His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising either arm more than 80 degrees. For his actions as a POW, McCain was awarded the Silver Star Medal, the Legion of Merit, three Bronze Star Medals, another instance of the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart Medal. He also gained an appreciation, from experiencing the mutual help and organized resistance of the POWs, that his earlier individualism needed to be tempered by a belief in causes greater than self-interest.\n\n\nReturn to United States\n\nUpon his return to the United States a few days later, McCain was reunited with his wife Carol and his family. She had suffered her own crippling, near-death ordeal during his captivity, due to an automobile accident in December 1969 that left her hospitalized for six months and facing twenty-three operations and ongoing physical therapy. (Businessman and POW advocate Ross Perot had paid for her medical care.) By the time McCain saw her, she was four inches (ten centimeters) shorter, on crutches, and substantially heavier. \nAs a returned POW, McCain became a celebrity of sorts: The New York Times ran a story and front-page photo of him getting off the plane at Clark Air Base in the Philippines; he authored a thirteen-page cover story describing his ordeal and his support for the Nixon administration's handling of the war in U.S. News & World Report; he participated in parades in Orange Park and elsewhere and made personal appearances before groups, where he showed strong speaking skills; and he was given the key to the city of Jacksonville, Florida. \nMcCain also found high-level political visibility. On April 14, four returned POWs were in attendance and honored at the White House Correspondents' dinner; McCain was one of them and shook hands with President Richard Nixon. Then Nixon gave an address to former POWs in an auditorium at the State Department during the day of May 24. McCain had undergone surgery earlier in the month for leg injuries suffered during his shoot-down, and a photograph of him on crutches shaking the hand of President Nixon became iconic. That evening, 600 ex-POWs and their families were honored at a gala dinner on the lawn of The White House. The McCains became frequent guests of honor at dinners hosted by Governor of California Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan, and John McCain made a strong impression speaking at a large prayer breakfast hosted by the governor. McCain had admired Ronald Reagan while in captivity and afterwards, believing him to be a man who saw honor in Vietnam service and a potential leader who would not lead the nation into a war it was unwilling to win.\nMcCain underwent three operations in total and other treatment for his injuries, spending three months at the Naval Regional Medical Center in Jacksonville. Psychological tests, given to all the returning POWs, showed that McCain had \"adjusted exceptionally well to repatriation\" and had \"an ambitious, striving, successful pattern of adjustment\". McCain told examiners that he withstood his ordeal by having \"Faith in country, United States Navy, family, and God\". Unlike many veterans, McCain did not experience flashbacks or nightmares of his Vietnam experience, although due to the association with prison guards, the sound of keys rattling would cause him to \"tense up\".\nMcCain was promoted to commander effective July 1973 and attended the National War College in Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during the 1973–1974 academic year. (Former POWs were given latitude in choosing their next assignment. Navy officials objected to McCain's choice of the National War College, as he was not yet a commander, the minimum rank needed to qualify; McCain had earned the rank but it had not yet become official. McCain appealed to Secretary of the Navy John Warner, a friend of his father's, and gained admission.) There he intensively studied the history of Vietnam and the French and American wars there, and wrote \"The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam Prisoners of War\", a long paper on the Vietnam POW experience as a test of the U.S. Code of Conduct. \nBy the time he graduated, McCain concluded that mistakes by American political and military leaders had doomed the war effort. (The particular operation that had led to his downing, Rolling Thunder, had been stopped in 1968, and while it had caused the North Vietnamese some logistical and resource difficulties, it had not succeeded in altering any of the fundamental equations involved in eventually determining the war's outcome.) McCain accepted the right of the anti-war movement in the U.S. to have exercised their freedom to protest, and he adopted a live-and-let-live attitude towards those who had evaded the draft. Nor did the vast changes in American social mores that had taken place during his absence bother him, as it did many other former POWs. McCain returned to Saigon in November 1974; he and a couple of other former POWs received the National Order of Vietnam, that country's highest honor. He also spoke at the South Vietnamese war college, five months before Saigon fell. \nMcCain resolved not to become a \"professional POW\" but to move forward and rebuild his life. Few thought McCain could fly again, and if he could not meet the medical requirements to remain a naval aviator he said he would consider a career in the United States Foreign Service. But he was determined to try, and during this time he engaged in nine months of grueling, painful physical therapy, especially to get his knees to bend again.\n\n\nCommanding officer\nMcCain recuperated just enough to pass his flight physical and have his flight status reinstated. In August 1974, he was assigned to the Replacement Air Group VA-174 \"Hellrazors\". This was an A-7 Corsair II training squadron located at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville and the largest aviation squadron in the Navy. He became its executive officer in 1975, and on July 1, 1976, he was made VA-174's commanding officer. This last assignment was controversial, as he did not have the required experience of having commanded a smaller squadron first (something that he now had too high a rank to do). While some senior officers resented McCain's presence as favoritism due to his father, junior officers rallied to him and helped him qualify for A-7 carrier landings.\nAs commanding officer, McCain relied upon a relatively unorthodox leadership style based upon the force of his personality. He removed personnel he thought ineffective, and sought to improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men. Dealing with limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages, he was forceful in demanding that respect be given to the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit. McCain's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly. Although some operational metrics declined during the period, the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents. The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation, while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal. McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA-174 was the most rewarding assignment of his naval career. When his stint ended in July 1977, the change of command ceremony was attended by his father and the rest of his family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in a place of honor in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.\nDuring their time in Jacksonville, the McCains' marriage began to falter. McCain had extramarital affairs; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing. Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro. Marital difficulties were in fact quite common among the returned POWs. However, McCain later said, \"My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine.\" His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that \"I attribute [the breakup of our marriage] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else.\" Writer and Vietnam veteran Robert Timberg believes that \"Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on.\" According to John McCain, \"I had changed, she had changed. People who have been apart that much change.\"\n\n\nSenate liaison, divorce, and second marriage\n\nMcCain had thought about entering politics since his return from Vietnam, although 1964 had been the only time in his life he had ever voted. In 1976, he briefly thought of running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida; he had the support of some local figures in Jacksonville, but was convinced by other Republican Party leaders that he did not have sufficient political experience, funding, or popular support to defeat longtime Democratic incumbent Charles E. Bennett. Instead, he worked so hard for Ronald Reagan's 1976 Republican primary campaign that his base commander reprimanded him for being too politically active for his naval position.\nAs his tenure with VA-174 was ending, McCain was assigned to a low-profile desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of McCain's social talents, and instead in July 1977 McCain was appointed to the Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs (an assignment Jack McCain had once held). The office's role mostly consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among legislators, the Department of Defense, and lobbyists. McCain later said the liaison job represented \"[my] real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant\". McCain's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff. He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he arranged entertaining side escapades. McCain was influenced by senators of both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During 1978 and 1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration and Navy Secretary W. Graham Claytor Jr. In August 1979, McCain was promoted to naval captain, and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office. During McCain's time there, the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence.\nMcCain and his wife Carol had been briefly separated soon after returning to Washington, but then reunited and remained married. In April 1979, while attending a military reception for senators in Hawaii, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, eighteen years his junior, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona, and the daughter of James Willis Hensley, a wealthy Anheuser-Busch beer distributor, and Marguerite \"Smitty\" Hensley. They began dating, travelling between Arizona and Washington to see each other, and John McCain urged his wife Carol to accept a divorce. The McCains stopped cohabiting in January 1980, and John McCain filed for divorce in February, which Carol McCain accepted at that time. After she did not respond to court summonses, the uncontested divorce became official in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, on April 2, 1980. McCain gave Carol a settlement that included full custody of their children, alimony, child support including college tuition, houses in Virginia and Florida, and lifelong financial support for her ongoing medical treatments resulting from the 1969 automobile accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, in Phoenix, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart as best man and groomsman. McCain's children were upset with him and did not attend the wedding, but after several years they reconciled with him and Cindy. Carol McCain became a personal assistant to Nancy Reagan and later Director of the White House Visitors Office. The Reagans were stunned by the divorce; Nancy Reagan's relationship with John McCain turned cold for a while following it, but eventually the two renewed their friendship. The same happened with most of McCain's other friends, who were eventually won over by the force of his personality and his frequent expressions of guilt over what had happened.\nAround the end of 1980, McCain decided to retire from the Navy. He had not been given a major sea command, and his physical condition had deteriorated, causing him to fail the flight physical required for any carrier command position (in addition to his limited arm movement, certain weather would always cause him to walk with a limp). McCain thought he might make rear admiral, but probably not vice admiral, and never become a four-star admiral as his grandfather and father had been. McCain later wrote that he did not anguish over his decision, although it pained his mother, who thought congressional careers paled in comparison to top naval ones. He was excited by the idea of being a member of Congress and was soon recruiting a campaign manager that Cohen knew, for a planned run at a House seat from Arizona. In early 1981, Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, who did not want to see McCain leave the liaison post, told McCain that he was still on the path to be selected for one-star rear admiral. McCain told Lehman that he was leaving the Navy and that he could \"do more good\" in Congress.\nMcCain retired with an effective date of April 1, 1981, the rank of captain, and a disability pension due to his wartime injuries. For his service in the Senate liaison office, McCain was awarded a gold star in lieu of a second award of the Legion of Merit. Jack McCain died on March 22, 1981. On March 27, 1981, McCain attended his father's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery, wearing his uniform for the last time before signing his discharge papers, and later that day flew to Phoenix with his wife Cindy to begin his new life.\n\n\nMilitary awards\nMcCain's military decorations and awards include:\n\n\nCitations\nThese are some of the citations associated with the awards:\n\nSilver Star Medal\nLegion of Merit\nFirst award (with \"V\" device)\nSecond award (gold star)\nDistinguished Flying Cross\nBronze Star Medal\nFirst award (with \"V\" device)\nSecond award (gold star; with \"V\" device)\nThird award (gold star; with \"V\" device)\nMeritorious Service Medal\nAir Medal\nFirst award (with bronze star)\nSecond award (numeral \"2\")\nNavy Commendation Medal\nFirst award (with \"V\" device)\nSecond award (gold star; with \"V\" device)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\nGeobiography of John McCain's early years and military career",
    "summary": "The early life and military career of John Sidney McCain III spans the first forty-five years of his life (1936–1981). McCain's father and grandfather were admirals in the United States Navy. McCain was born on August 29, 1936, in the Panama Canal Zone, and attended many schools growing up as his family moved among naval facilities. McCain graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958. He married the former Carol Shepp in 1965; he adopted two children from her previous marriage and they had another child together.\nAs a naval aviator, McCain flew attack aircraft from carriers. During the Vietnam War, he narrowly escaped death in the 1967 Forrestal fire. On his twenty-third  bombing mission during Operation Rolling Thunder in October 1967, he was shot down over Hanoi and badly injured. He subsequently endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war, including periods of torture. In 1968, he refused a North Vietnamese offer of early release, because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners who had been held longer. He was released in 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords.\nUpon his return, McCain studied at the National War College, commanded a large training squadron in Florida, and was appointed the Navy liaison to the U.S. Senate. He divorced his wife Carol in 1980 and married the former Cindy Hensley shortly thereafter. He retired from the Navy in 1981 as a captain.",

It was directed by Songyos Sugmakanan, and stars Pachara Chirathivat, Somboonsuk Niyomsiri (aka Piak Poster) and Walanlak Kumsuwan. The Billionaire tells the story of Itthipat Kulapongvanich and how he, at the age of nineteen, dropped out from university to launch a packaged fried seaweed business that is now Taokaenoi Food & Marketing and became one of Thailand's youngest (baht) billionaires. It grossed 38,796,264 baht.\n\n\nPlot\nIn 2002, Itthipat \"Top\" Kulapongvanich makes money from real money trading in an online game, resulting in his school grades dropping. The following year, he ignores his parents' university advice and attempts to start a business out of reselling Chinese-made DVD players; he ends up buying bad quality players using his university tuition. In an attempt to get money for college, Top secretly steals and sells his father's amulet and later skips school, telling his friend to record the classes so he doesn't miss out.\nTop visits a trade fair and visits a sweet chestnut stand, inspiring him to start a sweet chestnut business, hiring his uncle Tuan as a clerk. However, their stand at the mall receives no customers at all, and he negotiates with the mall to have his stand moved to a different location. Some time later, Top flees a complulsory exam when he learns that their stand has gained success, but finds out that the chestnut machine's smoke has stained the mall. He also finds out that his father's business is in heavy debt, and his parents plan to move to China where Top's siblings are working. Top decides to stay in Thailand, opting to continue his chestnut business.\nTop's situation gets worse - painting the stain disturbs other stands, the chestnut machine starts breaking, and his house is foreclosed on by a bank mortgage. During a date with his girlfriend Rin, he tries seasoned seaweed that she brought home and is inspired to try a seasoned seaweed business instead. After some difficulties of trying to find a way to successfully fry the seaweed, Top sells his computers to buy more seaweed. On a rainy night, he returns home to find Tuan collapsed and sends him to the hospital. However, this results in a discovery of a way to fry seaweed, as a piece of seaweed was moistened by the rain.\nThe seaweed business is a success, with an estimated 1 million baht per year being predicted. Top learns that his father's indebted to 40 million baht, and soon his house is put on sale. Albeit considering moving to China, he is then inspired to sell his seaweed to 7-Eleven. He makes an appointment with Pooh, the person in charge of the company that owns 7-Eleven, only to be told that his product doesn't fit the chain's requirements. After breaking up with Rin, Top gets the packaging fixed and visits Pooh without making an appointment. Although she never meets him due to her being busy, Pooh discovers the new packaging while her employees enjoy the seaweed packs Top left behind.\nThe seasoned seaweed snack, named Tao Kae Noi, is accepted by 7-Eleven and Top is told to set up a factory that would pass a sanitary inspection set to happen in one month. Top attempts to get a loan from a bank and tells his story to a banker (this scene is used as a framing device for the movie up until it happens), who rejects him due to his young age and the fact that his parents are overseas. A devastated Top once again considers moving to China, but after being rejected and threatened with a gun by a pawn shopkeeper that he sold his amulet to, he decides to go ahead with the factory and sets it up at an abandoned warehouse. The factory passes the inspection despite several problems, which Top fixes, and he is able to make his first delivery to 7-Eleven. Top calls his parents and tells them they can return home.\nTop, having paid off his parents' debt, lives with them while Tao Kae Noi grows - the business receives 2,500 employees, has reached 6,000 7-Eleven stores, has been delivered to 27 countries, owns a seaweed farm in South Korea, and sells around 15 billion baht in 2010, making Top the youngest billionaire in Thailand.

As of July 2022, he is the head coach of the Bowdoin College Men's hockey team.\n\n\nPlaying career\nAs a youth, Guité played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from the Lac-Saint-Louis area of Montreal.\nGuité was drafted 172nd overall in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. Guité played junior hockey for the Capital District Selects of the Eastern Junior Hockey League, before continuing his career at the University of Maine in the Hockey East division. Unsigned, Guité made his professional debut in 2000 with the Tallahassee Tiger Sharks of the ECHL before signing with the New York Islanders as a free agent on August 1, 2001.\nOn March 19, 2002, while playing with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League (AHL), Guité was traded by the Islanders along with Bjorn Melin to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for Dave Roche. A year later Guité returned to Bridgeport signing as a free agent.\nOn August 15, 2005, Guité was signed by the Boston Bruins and played just a solitary game, his NHL debut, on January 30, 2006. After spending most of his time with the Providence Bruins in the 2005–06 season, Guité signed with the Colorado Avalanche on July 12, 2006.\nGuité ended the 2006–07 season establishing a role as a defensive forward on the Avalanche, and re-signed for a further two seasons for the team.\nIn the 2007–08 season, his first full season in the NHL, Guité played 79 games, totaling 11 goals and 11 assists for 22 points.

    "text": "Stan Polovets (born June 8, 1963) is an American businessman and philanthropist. He is known for his work in the international energy sector and for his innovative philanthropic initiatives.\nPolovets played a notable role in the creation of TNK-BP, one of the largest joint ventures in the global energy industry, which operated in 2003-2013 and controlled more than 18% of Russia’s total oil production. He held a number of executive and board posts and was instrumental in its subsequent divestment in a record $55 billion transaction.\nIn May 2020, Polovets was elected chairman of the board of directors of Anchiano Therapeutics Ltd., a NASDAQ-listed biopharmaceutical company. In March 2021, he stepped down as chairman after the company posted a 630% return in 12 months, and merged with Israel-based Chemomab Therapeutics.\nPolovets is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the President’s Global Council at New York University (NYU), and the board of overseers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. From 2014 to 2019, he served on the board of overseers of Stanford University's Hoover Institution.\nHe is the co-founder and chairman/CEO of the Genesis Prize Foundation, a global philanthropic initiative focused on enhancing Jewish identity.\n\n\nPersonal life and education\nStan Polovets was born in 1963 in Moscow, USSR. His family immigrated to the United States in 1976, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from California State University, Northridge (1985), and attended Stanford University, graduating with an MBA and MA in 1989.\n\n\nBusiness affiliations\n\n\nEarly career\nPrior to graduate school, he worked as an analyst for Exxon, a management consultant for KPMG, and defense analyst at The RAND Corporation, a public policy think tank. After receiving his MBA from Stanford Business School, Polovets moved to New York to work at the global headquarters of Ernst & Young, where he was responsible for establishing the company's consulting business in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\nIn 1992, he established RPI Group, a boutique communications and consulting firm focused on the Russian energy sector. Until the company’s sale in 1998, he served as its CEO and was an advisor to the minister of oil and gas of Turkmenistan and to the general director of Mazeikiu Nafta, Lithuania’s national oil company. RPI’s two flagship publications, Russian Petroleum Investor and Caspian Investor, continue to be published by Thomson Reuters.\n\n\nTNK-BP and AAR\nIn 2001, Polovets joined Tyumen Oil Company (TNK), an emerging Russian oil producer, as vice president of mergers and acquisitions. In 2002–2003 Polovets represented TNK in a $15 billion merger with BP that led to the establishment of TNK-BP. The merger became the largest corporate transaction in Russia and the single largest foreign investment in a Russian company at that time. The company established as a result of this merger eventually became one of the world’s ten largest non-state oil producers, comparable in size with such companies as Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Statoil. It operated in Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Venezuela and Vietnam.\nBetween 2003 and 2006 Polovets held a number of senior executive posts in the TNK-BP Group, including senior vice president and chief of staff to TNK-BP’s president Bob Dudley, later the CEO of BP.\nIn 2006 Polovets briefly left the TNK-BP Group to become first vice president of Uralsib, a major Russian financial institution. In 2007 Polovets became the CEO of the Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) Consortium, which held a 50% stake in TNK-BP. In that capacity, he represented AAR on the board and board committees of TNK-BP, as well as its key subsidiaries and affiliates, including Slavneft (a joint venture with Gazpromneft) and TNK Trading International (TTI, an international trading subsidiary).\nIn 2011, Polovets was involved in AAR’s legal battle against BP, which was also a 50% shareholder in TNK-BP. AAR filed a lawsuit seeking to block BP's strategic alliance with Rosneft in a bid to access Russia's Arctic reserves and bypass TNK-BP.\nAAR won an injunction from the High Court of London that blocked BP from entering a strategic alliance and executing a share swap with Rosneft. The Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal made a similar ruling, upholding AAR’s position and preventing BP’s attempted alliance with Russia’s state-owned company.  AAR’s successful bid to block the BP-Rosneft alliance paved the way for AAR’s cash-out from TNK-BP two years later.\nIn 2013, in his capacity as CEO of AAR, Polovets was involved in executing the sale of AAR’s 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft for $28 billion. BP also sold its TNK-BP stake to Rosneft in a parallel transaction, making the $55 billion sale of TNK-BP the largest M&A deal in Russia’s history, and the largest M&A transaction in the global energy sector in a decade. Between 2003 and 2013, AAR shareholders received more than $20 billion in dividends from TNK-BP and saw the value of its stake grow from $7.5 billion to $28 billion, making it one of the most successful investments in the history of the oil and gas industry.\nFrom May 2013 until December 2019, Polovets served as the lead non-executive director for L1 Energy, the international investment vehicle of Alfa Group.\nFrom May 2014 through October 2016, Polovets served as the chairman for Russia and Eastern Europe at Edelman, the largest global PR firm.\nFrom September 2014 until March 2020, Polovets served as senior advisor to Access Industries, a privately held industrial group with long-term holdings in natural resources, chemicals, media, telecoms and real estate, owned by American entrepreneur and philanthropist Len Blavatnik. Polovets represented Access as the lead non-executive director on the board of directors of Clal Industries, a major Israeli holding company with a diversified portfolio of investments in industrial manufacturing, hi-tech and consumer sectors.\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nPolovets is a co-founder and chairman and CEO of the Genesis Prize Foundation. The Foundation awards an annual $1 million prize to exceptional individuals whose achievements will inspire and instill a sense of pride in the next generation of Jews. The prize has a permanent endowment of $100 million and is a partnership between the Genesis Prize Foundation and the Jewish Agency for Israel (Sokhnut).  Each of the laureates has chosen to forgo the award funds and directed their $1 million prizes – often matched by additional donors – to various charitable causes.\nPolovets is also a co-founder and CEO emeritus of Genesis Philanthropy Group (GPG), one of the largest private foundations in the field of Jewish philanthropy, with offices in Moscow, New York City, London and Tel Aviv. Polovets served as the founding CEO of GPG from its inception in 2007 until July 2014. He represented GPG on the boards of several non-profits funded by GPG, including serving as vice chairman of Hillel Russia.\nIn 2003, Polovets established, funded, and managed the Vnimanie Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Russian children with learning disabilities and behavioral disorders.  The board of Vnimanie included many prominent individuals, including the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The executive director of Vnimanie Foundation was Sergei Filatov, who previously served as President Boris Yeltsin’s chief of staff.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "2008–2009 Kenya drought",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=65632541",
    "text": "Between 2008 and early 2010, Kenya, one of the countries of Eastern Africa, was affected by a severe drought, which put ten million people at risk of hunger and caused a large number of deaths to livestock in Kenyan Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), constituting around 88% of the country.\nThe areas which experienced the worst effects were Northern Kenya, Somalia and Southern Ethiopia, most severely in Kajiado and Laikipia. These predominantly pastoral regions reported deaths of up to half of the livestock. Droughts in Kenya have become more frequent causing crop failures and devastation as three-quarters of the population are sustained by agriculture.\n\n\nBackground\n\nOwing to the lack of annual rainfall, the arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya (ASALs) are very susceptible to drought and flooding. These lands are impacted by the increasing effects of climate change and the risk of desertification. Water scarcity leaves unimproved water supplies for the majority of the population, so these places tend to be marginalized, and have high rates of poverty.\nKenya experienced limited rainfall in 2008 from October to December, followed by a similar situation in 2009. The Kenyan Red Cross conducted assessment reports indicating the risk of starvation for millions of Kenyans, resulting in an appeal to the international donor community for food aid.\nKenya has been supported by a drought management system since 1980. The system includes policies and strategies, an early warning system, a funded contingency plan, and overall drought coordination and response structure. Despite that, at the end of the 2008–2009 drought, the European Union delegation considered that a review of the responses to this drought would have been appropriate, in order to strengthen the efficiency of the drought management and alleviate its consequences. The system became the responsibility of the National Drought Management Authority, established in 2011.\n\n\nEffects\n\n\nFood security\n\nAgriculture supports around 75% of the Kenyan population and accounts for 25.9% of the GDP, making it one of the leading means of sustenance of the country and a significant contributor to employment and food security; on the other hand, droughts caused by climate change have put a strain on agriculture and the country itself to the extent that in January 2009 the Government declared a state of emergency, because ten million Kenyans needed food aid after a poor harvest.\nIn the North of the country, by April, 30% of the population was suffering from acute malnutrition because the \"long rains\" of 2009 failed, and some areas of the country were already worn out by five years of consecutive droughts.\nThe shortage of food was also worsened by a political crisis caused by a disputed election in early 2008.  This provoked a climate of violence in the East of the country which drove away farmers who were unable to return in time to plant maize in the planting season.  This led to food, water, and power shortages throughout the country.\nIn 2011 the USAID youth program, which works closely with Feed the Future, brought groups of young mothers together to improve food security, working on nutrition. Cultivating vegetables and legumes they have been improving their health and that of their infants, in a shared urban farm in Mombasa. Making sure that children are well-fed is eminent as malnutrition in childhood and pregnancy has many adverse consequences for child survival and long-term well-being. Food-borne illnesses are often caused by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that affect human health.  Food security issues were also created by violations in trade standards, resulting in the exclusion of food from international, regional, and local markets.\n\n\nEffects on the Maasai pastoralists\nIn Kenya, pastoralism represents a mainstay source of sustenance, providing livelihood, security, and employment opportunities (around 90% of the population). It is impacted by droughts, that directly impact livestock assets of pastoral households.\nMaasai pastoralists are traditionally semi-nomad and practice seasonal transhumance from dry to wet season pastures. The severe drought of 2009 has prompted pastoralists in Northern Kenya to abandon their traditional lifestyles (like in the 2005 drought) due to the harsh living conditions and the destruction of their pastures by drought, overgrazing, and soil erosion. In conditions of extreme drought, some pastoralists tried to dig down into dry riverbeds and water pans looking for water and others moved onto highland pastures in Mt. Kenya.  These responses were eventually unsuccessful due to the increasing number of livestock deaths (it is estimated that over 38,000 cattle died). The high number of losses also constituted a social implication for the Maasai, who as a tradition measure their wealth on the dimension of their herds.\nDue to the high mortality rate at the time, there was a major decline in livestock.  This raised the prices of milk and other livestock items, which adversely affected hunger levels and lowered income levels. Land degradation also increased due to livestock competition from pastures and water.\nTo cope with the drought in the short term the Maasai developed four strategies. The first was to take their animals to graze very early in the morning when the grass is covered with dew. The second was to guard reserve pastures on their higher lands while the grass regenerated so that it can be used during drought. The third strategy was to increase the length of their migrations as the gravity of the drought worsened. The last method was to dig shallow wells in dry riverbeds during migrations to acquire water.\nTwo long-term solutions were developed. The first was to keep livestock of mixed-species; in addition to the traditional herd composed by grazers (cattle and sheep) and browsers (goats), pastoralists added donkeys and camels. Different animal species adapt differently to drought and this method ensured that at least part of the herd survived in a specific climatic event. The second method was to increase the size of their herds during wetter periods, so they have some animals left at the end of a drought period.\n\n\nMicro-climate\n\nClimate change has been playing an important role in Kenya's droughts, reducing the drought cycle from every ten years to annual events. When the cycle of droughts in Kenya occurred every ten years, farmers had recovery time to rebuild their livestock and crops before the next drought. When the recovery time dropped to two years, this recovery was no longer possible.\nDryness is not the only outcome of climate change: rains have decreased during the long rainy season (from March to May), but have registered an increase from September to February causing an extension of the normal rainfall period (October to December), which, together with growing intensity and strength, has created vulnerability to floods.\nThe table below displays data of the average monthly rainfall of Kenya from 1901 to 2016, compared with the predicted changes for 2080–2099.\n\nIt is expected that the annual average temperature of the territory of Kenya will increase by 1.0 °C to 2.8 °C by 2060, with greater effects in the tea production, but a negative impact on crop and maize revenues.\nData showing the actual and predicted mean annual temperature increase is shown for the period 1901 to 2099:  \n\nThe Rift Valley Province is particularly sensitive to climate change. It is predicted that coastal areas will suffer from rising sea levels from which floods and saltwater intrusions will result, due to the melting of glaciers which will further reduce the availability of water.\n\n\nThe effects on wildlife\nDue to the drought animals were dying, some from starvation, others of thirst and many because their weak immune systems could not fight disease or infection.\nBy September 2009, at least 60 elephants and hundreds of animals had died in the country.\nThere was a conflict between locals and wildlife due to the absence of land. Consequently, the pastoralists took their herds illegally into the national parks and wildlife reserves, in a search for grazing land and water. The pastoralists felt betrayed by their government because they thought that the interests of the tourists who come to see the wildlife had been put before their own. They questioned why they had to allow wildlife on to their land but could not legally use the parks and reserves for grazing at such difficult times.\n\n\nThe effects on the GDP\n\nBefore the 2008 drought, the Kenyan economy had been growing at relatively high annual rates ranging from 6 to 7 per cent, and it was expected to continue on the same path during the following years. The annual growth rate fell to 1.5 per cent because of the drought. Despite the growth they worked for in the construction sector, tourism and agriculture faced very high declines (-36 and -5 per cent, respectively), and inflation rose to an unprecedented annual rate of 26.2 per cent.\nIn 2009, the government designed certain steps to promote growth in order to increase the GDP. These initiatives included restoration of investor confidence, an expansionary fiscal policy through a stimulus package, and monetary policy focus to preserve price stability at a single-digit rate. They were able to make the GDP rise by 2.6% with this method. The agriculture sector contracted by 2.7% due to the drought, high costs of inputs, and depressed demand for some of the country's exports due to the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn 2011, the GDP reached 10.06% due to the strong performance of the financial sector, construction and tourism. The population was also facing a high annual rate of inflation caused by rising food and fuel prices, which appeared to affect the poor disproportionately. The combination of four factors was also threatening the Kenyan economy: high fuel prices, high food prices, the drought in the Horn of Africa, and the Euro crisis.\n\n\nResponses\nThe main financial contributors in efforts were ALRMP (Arid Lands Resource Management Project) and the government; these organizations are designated a significant role under the country's drought management system.\nALRMP funded 83% of interventions and provided for 46% of total expenditure on drought response; 62% of the total transactions audited during 2007–2008 were suspected to be fraudulent or questionable. Among the funds, foreign donors accounted for 8%. This is likely to be an underestimation because cost information for two-thirds of the projects funded by these donors were not available. Government accounted for 29% of spending, but just 6% of programs, reflecting the high cost of the commercial interventions for de-stocking.\n\n\nWater related responses\n\nMost water tankering interventions were not providing adequate supplementary water to justify the cost involved. The amount of that water in the communities was relatively limited, not even coming close to the MoWI’s suggested standard of 10 litres (2.2 imp gal) per person per day.\nIn Dol Dol, the people were able to remain in the villages even though starvation had not been completely eradicated. Clean water tanks were distributed to the communities, who used it to cook their food, removing the need to walk 20 kilometres (12 mi) to fetch water (6:00 to 15:00 every day). The farm animals had access to water, but the impact was minimal as most died anyway.\nThere were two limits of the intervention. Firstly, the water supplied was not enough for all the inhabitants. Only those who lived near the roads could be helped, because the arid terrain made moving to the inner villages too risky. Secondly, whoever managed to acquire the water could only use it for cooking and drinking, because there was not enough to be used for chores such as washing clothes or bathing. They mostly targeted women and schools for water support, rather than the adult male population, therefore the community estimated only about 10 per cent of the population benefited. In Merti, Isiolo, the community also felt that the use of a Bowser (tanker) helped the people that were left in the villages, whilst the animal breeders were forced to migrate with their animals, looking for other natural sources.\n\n\nCommercial destocking responses\nBy the height of the drought in mid-2008, few measures had been implemented. Most of the effective measures occurred in 2009. Compared to other measures, de-stocking, restocking and animal health interventions began relatively late.  All de-stocking options were carried out after June 2009, when the drought had reached its worst stage.  After June, 63% of all measures were introduced, 77% related to animal feeding, 70% to borehole development/maintenance, and 54% for peace-building.\nThe Kenyan government began carry out de-stocking operations in May 2009. Effective contributions made from NGOs started later in the year, from July 2009. ALRMP, which began to contribute to interventions by the Kenyan government, was the only exception to this latency of action by the key members. \n49% of the total expenditure on livestock-related drought intervention between 2008 and 2009 was accounted for by conventional livestock interventions, which mainly included feed, health, and de-stocking. The Kenyan government and ALRMP were the biggest investors, highlighting the contributions made by organizations in the Kenyan drought management system. \n\n\nLivestock responses\nIn Kenya, recurrent droughts can contribute to livestock disease. Consequently, more animal breeders chose to train in the field of livestock health. The increase in the number of trained and community-based health workers operating in the Turkana areas has enabled livestock keepers to acquire relevant skills through training and knowledge.\nA tradition of the Kenyan rural culture is that local herbs and techniques are used in the treatment of livestock diseases. In recent years, with the emergence of trained community-based animal health workers, a safer and more advanced control is being opted for.\n\n\nResponses assessment\nThe effectiveness of the drought intervention measures have been assessed in a range of studies. The main determinants which established the level of effectiveness of an intervention  were whether the intervention was completed as planned and if they were able to deliver the intended benefits to the targeted beneficiaries.\nContributions from NGOs were generally considered more effective than those completed by the Kenyan government. Specifically, the contributions that made most of the difference and therefore top-ranked in the highest average effectiveness ratings, were funded by international donors.\nIt was not possible to determine a relationship between the effectiveness of an intervention and the time at which it started.\nOn average, an intervention reached 3,227 individuals, increasing from 55 for peace-building to 22,370 for water trucking. The cost per individual reached was KSh. 3,362/= (approximately US$30.60 in 2021).  This ranged from 163/= for water trucking to 8,652/= for emergency replenishment. This indicates that a total of more than 1.5 million people benefited, based on the presumption of no duplication (if the same person is benefiting from multiple interventions).\nThe real relative impact that each intervention has had on the population is difficult to assess even though there is evidence to determine a better efficacy of one intervention. The reason is that there is inadequate information on the scale of the benefits given to individuals and households.\nIn general, there was no relationship between an intervention's efficacy and the capital invested in its success.\n\n\nSee also\nKenya, climate section\nList of droughts\nKenya water crisis\nIndex of Kenya-related articles\nEconomy of Kenya\nNon-government organization\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nAn assessment of the response to the 2008 - 2009 drought in Kenya at OCHA from CGIAR, 23 Aug 2011 - a detailed view over the management of food, nutrition and agriculture in Kenya\nDrought in Africa, Nasa Earth Observatory, July 21 - October 10, 2009 - map representation and explanation of the effect of drought on vegetation as rain becomes to fall in October 2009\nThe Economics of Early Response and Resilience: Lessons from Kenya, June 2012 - additional study of the drought responses in Kenya\nDROUGHT IN KENYA, Department of Meteorology - University Of Nairobi, December 2016 - a more in-depth meteorological study of droughts in Kenya",
    "summary": "Between 2008 and early 2010, Kenya, one of the countries of Eastern Africa, was affected by a severe drought, which put ten million people at risk of hunger and caused a large number of deaths to livestock in Kenyan Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), constituting around 88% of the country.\nThe areas which experienced the worst effects were Northern Kenya, Somalia and Southern Ethiopia, most severely in Kajiado and Laikipia. These predominantly pastoral regions reported deaths of up to half of the livestock. Droughts in Kenya have become more frequent causing crop failures and devastation as three-quarters of the population are sustained by agriculture.",

    "text": "Dysbindin, short for dystrobrevin-binding protein 1, is a protein constituent of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) of skeletal muscle cells. It is also a part of BLOC-1, or biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1.In humans, dysbindin is encoded by the DTNBP1 gene.\n\n\nDiscovery\nDysbindin was discovered by the research group of Derek Blake via yeast two-hybrid screening for binding partners of α-dystrobrevin.\n\n\nTissue distribution\nDysbindin is found in neural tissue of the brain, particularly in axon bundles and especially in certain axon terminals, notably mossy fiber synaptic terminals in the cerebellum and hippocampus.\n\n\nStructure\nDysbindin is a coiled-coil-containing protein that serves as a core, stable component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), a multisubunit complex involved in intracellular protein trafficking and synaptic function. Structurally, dysbindin engages in direct interactions with other BLOC-1 subunits—pallidin, snapin, and muted—primarily through a 69-residue region that forms coiled-coil domains, which are critical for complex assembly and stability. Dysbindin’s sequence does not share significant identity with proteins of known function outside BLOC-1, but its acidic C-terminal region is homologous to domains found in other regulatory proteins, suggesting a role in recruiting or scaffolding additional protein partners (PMID 16533041). Within neurons, dysbindin and its BLOC-1 partners localize to endosomal and synaptic compartments, where they regulate the trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins and surface expression of neurotransmitter receptors, processes fundamental to synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.\n\n\nFunction\nDysbindin is a multifunctional regulatory protein highly expressed in the brain, where it plays a critical role in synaptic function, neurotransmitter release, and cognitive processes. As a core component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), dysbindin is essential for the trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins and the regulation of receptor surface expression, particularly dopamine D2 receptors in cortical neurons. Reduced dysbindin expression leads to increased surface D2 receptor levels and altered excitability of prefrontal cortical microcircuits, effects that have been linked to cognitive deficits and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Additionally, dysbindin is involved in the regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, synapse formation, and maintenance, further underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity.\nIn drosophila, dysbindin has been shown to be essential for neural plasticity.\n\n\nClinical significance\nInterest in dysbindin has grown from pedigree-based family association studies of schizophrenia, which found a strong correlation between a particular dysbindin allele and the clinical manifestation of the disease. However, this genetic link has not been consistently replicated across all case-control samples, suggesting that different genetic subtypes of schizophrenia, with varying disease allele frequencies, exist in different populations. This phenomenon, known as genetic locus heterogeneity, is common among complex disorders with strong genetic components. Compounding this complexity, it is likely that multiple distinct mutations within the dysbindin gene contribute to schizophrenia. This situation, known as disease allele heterogeneity, helps explain why different markers in the dysbindin gene show associations in different study populations.\nAlthough the precise mechanisms by which dysbindin contributes to brain dysfunction are not fully understood, evidence suggests functional consequences. One study reported that schizophrenia patients carrying a high-risk dysbindin haplotype exhibited deficits in visual processing. Another study demonstrated that reduced expression of DTNBP1 led to increased cell surface levels of dopamine D2 receptors, implicating dysbindin in dopaminergic signaling regulation.\nIn addition to its role in schizophrenia, mutations in the DTNBP1 gene have been shown to cause Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome type 7.\n\n\nInteractions\nDysbindin has been shown to interact with SNAPAP, MUTED and PLDN.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nGeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome\nDysbindin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",

S. specialty press Arkham House in a first edition trade hardcover of 4,148 copies; it has since been published in several mass-market paperback editions and again in hardcover in the UK. Portions of the novel were first serialized as individual shorter works through The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction.

The novel details his journey to uncover the secrets of his own past and the true nature of his mysterious ability.\nFor eight weary months, Alaric the minstrel trudged the lonely road of exile. Born with preternatural powers, the infant Alaric had been found by foster parents abandoned on a hillside, newborn and naked, with a bloody, severed hand clutching his ankles. Older and with those powers on full display, he suddenly found himself rejected by his foster family, branded a witch-child. Alaric now wanders the world as a solitary wayfarer, with a knapsack, a few clothes, and a lute his only possessions.\nOn this journey, he encounters the craggy towers and shining spires of a distant castle, like some gleaming vision in one of his songs. Within, Alaric is accepted as court minstrel but becomes embroiled in palace intrigue that involves Medron, the court magician, and the King's daughter, Princess Solinde. Subsequently, he journeys to the sinister Inn of the Black Swan and then to a superstition-ensorcelled village. There, Alaric is restored to his supernatural antecedents, known as the Lords of All Power.\n\n\nSources\nJaffery, Sheldon (1989). The Arkham House Companion.

The song was written by Max, Charlie Puth, Maria Jane Smith, Victor Thell, Gigi Grombacher, Roland Spreckley, and the producer Cirkut. It is an electropop song which discusses the importance of self-love, being an outcast and not fitting into society. A remixed version of the song featuring South Korean boy band NCT 127 was released on July 3, 2019, with additional rap verses performed in English and Korean.\nUpon release, \"So Am I\" peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart, and at number 14 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. It also peaked at number five on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. The song was certified triple platinum in Poland, double platinum in Australia, and received platinum certifications in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, and Switzerland. The Isaac Rentz-directed music video was released on March 7, 2019, which depicts Max performing in a school with students; the concept was chosen by Max to represent the theme of bullying.\n\n\nBackground\nMax teased the release of \"So Am I\" on Twitter for several weeks, encouraging fans to share pictures of themselves to \"show the world what makes you different\" using the hashtag #SoAmI. The song was released for digital download and streaming on March 7, 2019, and on contemporary radio stations in the United States on June 25, 2019. It was co-written by Max, Charlie Puth, Maria Jane Smith, Victor Thell, Gigi Grombacher, Roland Spreckley, and the producer Cirkut.\nA remix featuring South Korean boy band NCT 127 was announced by Max on July 2, 2019, with the official cover art, which resembled a high school yearbook. It was released on July 3, 2019. Mark and Taeyong perform new life-affirming rap verses in English and Korean halfway through the song before Jaehyun accompanies Max during the chorus. Both the former and Doyoung also perform backing vocals throughout the remix.\n\n\nComposition\n\"So Am I\" is an electropop song, described as an \"inspirational, self-acceptance anthem\". According to the song's sheet music that was published on Musicnotes.com, it is set in the time signature of 44 common time, with a tempo of 130 beats per minute, while composed in the key of G-flat major. Max's voice on the track ranges from the low note of G♭3 to the high note of E♭5, while the song is constructed in verse–chorus form. The song was recorded in pieces over several days. According to Max, the lyrics are about \"loving yourself, being different, being an outcast and not fitting in the format that society wants to put us in\".\n\n\nCritical reception\nMichael Silva of Billboard described the song as a \"bouncy, pop-heavy anthem\" with lyrics about \"navigating your adolescent years\". Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal described Max's vocals as \"crisp, soothing and expressive\" and praised the song's production which has \"infectious hooks and a catchy beat to it that will inspire listeners to get up and dance along\". He concluded by comparing the song's \"message of hope and optimism\" to her 2018 song \"Sweet but Psycho\". Writing for The Guardian, Michael Cragg described \"So Am I\" as an \"I'm weird me\" outcast anthem, while Helena Wadia of Evening Standard criticized the song as \"lack[ing] nuance\", despite being \"a rousing anthem after a few listens\".\nWriting about the song's remix, Madeline Roth of MTV News praised the guest appearance of NCT 127, stating that \"they lend more empowering, feel-good vibes with a fresh verse about appreciating someone who owns their originality\".\n\n\nCommercial performance\n\"So Am I\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 50 on the chart issued March 21, 2019. The song peaked at number 13 on April 26, 2019, after spending 16 weeks on the chart. It was eventually certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on January 1, 2021, for selling 600,000 equivalent units in sales. The track topped the Polish Airplay Top 100 chart, where it received a triple platinum certification on January 13, 2021. The song peaked at number two in Norway, where it charted for 18 weeks. \"So Am I\" charted at number five in Scotland, spending 16 total weeks on the chart. In Finland, the song bowed at number eight, while it was certified platinum in Switzerland and Denmark, bowing in the top 20 in both countries.\n\"So Am I\" reached number five on the US Dance Club Songs issue dated July 6, 2019, before receiving a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 6, 2022, for selling 1,000,000 equivalent units in the US.

It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling over 140,000 units in Australia.\n\n\nMusic video\n\n\nBackground and reception\nThe Isaac Rentz-directed music video was simultaneously released with the song and was uploaded on YouTube on March 7, 2019. Max described the video's setting: \"I actually filmed it in a school because of the bullying that goes on. It starts in school. That’s where a lot of people get hurt from it all. I wanted the storyline to focus on all the outcasts and all that diversity to show that we are all one in unity. It’s okay to be different. In general, I think society wants to put us in a format and I don’t think we should be fitting into it. We should do our own thing.\" She also acknowledged that she was bullied during the seventh grade, consequently retaliating against the bully and was kicked out. Issei Honke of Billboard Japan compared it to the music video of Britney Spears' 1998 song \"...Baby One More Time\", which he stated that both artists showcased their personality while dancing on a school stage in uniform. As of February 2023, the music video has over 250 million views on YouTube. A second fanmade music video was also released on June 12, 2019, which consisted of 15 German fans who were personally selected by Max from the #SoAmIFanVideo challenge. The music video was filmed inside YouTube Space Berlin.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe video begins with Max walking down a school corridor, wearing a black & red striped shirt, along with a black dress. As she opens a locker, she begins singing while beginning to walk down the hallway, while students begin entering their designated classrooms. She performs a dance alongside two girls wearing Catholic school uniform, before performing a choreographed dance routine in the playground with 6 other school students while wearing a white shirt. Various shots of students are interspersed throughout the routine.\nMax is then shown sitting on top of the teacher's desk, as the word 'Detention' is written on the blackboard. The students stare at each other while she dances around them. In the next segment, Max performs a dance in a black blazer on top of a red shirt inside a football stadium with multiple students. She is then seen wearing red Beats by Dre headphones while standing next to a wall. The final segment shows Max walking onto the field with the students, as they socialize with each other while sitting down. She performs a belt on the field, as the students stand in a horizontal line, holding up their right hand under their mouth with the words 'So Am I' written in black ink. At the end of the line, Max places her right hand over her forehead and she falls backwards.\n\n\nLive performances\nMax performed \"So Am I\" in a medley with \"Sweet but Psycho\" on Seven Network's breakfast television show Sunrise on April 29, 2019, which was her debut televised performance in Australia. She additionally performed the song in a medley with \"Sweet but Psycho\" and \"Salt\" (2019) at Wango Tango on June 1, 2019. Her attire consisted of a Zemeta purple and green long-sleeved outfit, accompanied with black leather pants, silver Steve Madden stiletto boots, and an iridescent Avec Les Filles trenchcoat. Max appeared on the sixth-season finale of The Voice van Vlaanderen to perform \"So Am I\" in a medley with \"Sweet but Psycho\" on May 17, 2019. During the 2019 Summertime Ball hosted by Capital FM on June 8, she performed \"So Am I\" in a medley with \"Sweet but Psycho\". On August 5, 2019, Max performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! while wearing a matching blue PVC pair consisting of a trench coat and high-waist pants. She also sported a silver crop top and platform shoes, the latter which had a black laces in the front and three buckle straps near the calves. Max performed \"So Am I\" at the 2019 Jingle Bell Ball on December 7, which was included in a medley with \"Sweet but Psycho\" and \"Torn\" (2019), performing with other artists such as The Script, Rita Ora, Regard and Mabel.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nRelease history\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

The film stars Winslow Fegley, Camila Rodriguez, Derek Theler, Deric McCabe, Clara Stack, Anthony Joo, Ayden Elijah, Imogen Cohen, Madilyn Kellam, and Danny Glover. It premiered on Disney Channel on November 22, 2023.\n\n\nPlot\nAndy Steele is a 5th grade boy who constantly gets into trouble with his best friend Dulce Gutierrez. They recently pulled a heist involving stealing confiscated toys from their school to return to kids in exchange for money. Andy is constantly at odds with his sister Laurel who always does the right thing and constantly tries to out Andy for his schemes, though she is usually outwitted.\nOn Christmas day, Andy realizes that he did not get his video game console for Christmas while Dulce similarly did not get her bow and arrow set. They learn from their tech savvy friend Lewis Sobong that they are most likely on the naughty list. Through his internet algorithm,  he reveals the numerous other kids also on the list. Feeling that Santa's selectiveness has gone too far, Andy and Dulce decide to go to the North Pole to get their presents with Lewis agreeing, despite him not being naughty.\nAndy and Dulce have Lewis narrow the naughty list candidates to the locals. From the results, Andy, Dulce, and Lewis recruit the following:\n\nHa-Yoon Si-u, a girl with a love for daredevil stunts who is naughty due to her reckless behavior.\nRose Wingert, an animal whisperer who was caught letting loose wild animals.\nJon Anthony Dizon, a boy and fashion designer whose naughty behavior is not made obvious.\nAlbert Reyes, a young boy who uses his cuteness to get what he wants.\nBethany, Laurel's snooty gymnast rival.\nAndy learns that one of his father's coworkers, a pilot named Bruno, claimed to have seen Santa's reindeer during one of his cargo flights. He decides to help Andy out so that he can be vindicated. At the last minute, Dulce contacts Andy telling him that Bethany has backed out after she ends up getting the cell phone that her parents finally got her. Andy manages to recruit a reluctant Laurel to fill in for her by claiming that Bethany made fun of the fact that Laurel can't pull off the job.\nBruno flies the kids to the North Pole where Jon Anthony privately admits to Rose that he is on the naughty list because his \"originals\" are actually stolen designs. Nevertheless, he manages to make compelling elf costumes for everyone. The group is forced to make an emergency landing, though Bruno manages to coax the local air force that he is simply taking inventory. The kids sneak into Santa’s Village by using Albert's cuteness to distract an elf. Rose and Ha-Yoon recruit some of Santa's reindeer for a getaway while Lewis finds the security room. Andy, Dulce, Jon Anthony, and Laurel stop by an elf party where they briefly have fun, but Andy forces everyone to leave. When they find the naughty list, they discover that they are indeed on there, except for Laurel and they find Santa's mostly empty vault along with each of their gifts and they take them. As payback, Laurel takes what was supposed to be Bethany's phone.\nThe group manage to escape thanks to Rose and Ha-Yoon and grab Lewis and Albert while fleeing from elf security. When Andy sees that Laurel snatched Bethany's phone for herself, he becomes disillusioned. Bruno warns them that he is being forced back into the air and the kids are forced to jump into the moving plane. However, Andy decides not to get on and retains the gifts as elf security catches him.\nHe is taken to Santa Claus himself who threatens to put him and everyone else on the naughty list permanently, but Andy insists that he should be the only one punished. When Santa limits the list to simply him and Laurel, Andy is shocked. The rest of the Naughty Nine are brought in and Andy and Laurel make amends with each other. Santa tells them that no one is ever kept on the naughty list permanently and that they just need to be nice, but not change who they are. The Naughty Nine are allowed to leave. Though Bruno does get a selfie with Santa who allows it.\nOne year later, Andy has been extra good all year and is called into the principal's office. Upon arrival, Andy is greeted by Santa who tells him that he needs him to re-recruit the Naughty Nine for an unknown purpose.\n\n\nCast\nWinslow Fegley as Andy Steele, a fifth-grader that prepares the heist of the North Pole. He's on the naughty list for this reason and many more.\nCamila Rodriguez as Dulce Gutierrez, Andy's best friend who has really good aim.\nDerek Theler as Bruno, a pilot that Andy recruits into the Naughty Nine to take them to the North Pole.\nDeric McCabe as Jon Anthony Dizon, a boy who is really good at making clothes, although he's never designed anything himself. He's on the naughty list for fraud and designs the Naughty Nine's disguises.\nClara Stack as Rose Wingert, a girl who understands animals and can talk to them. She's on the naughty list for freeing captive animals and is the Naughty Nine's animal whisperer.\nAnthony Joo as Lewis Sobong, a boy that has studied the North Pole and Santa's Village for years.\nAyden Elijah as Albert Reyes, a young boy who takes advantage of others because he's cute. He's on the naughty list for this reason and is the Naughty Nine's \"adorable innocent\".\nImogen Cohen as Ha-Yoon Si-u, a daredevil girl who loves driving recklessly. She's on the naughty list for this reason and is the Naughty Nine's getaway driver.\nMadilyn Kellam as Laurel Steele, Andy's \"goody two-shoes\" sister who is a gymnast.\nDanny Glover as Santa Claus\nLiyou Abere as Bethany, a snooty gymnast and Laurel's rival who was an original candidate for the Naughty Nine. She's on the naughty list for her snootiness.\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nDevelopment\nOn February 7, 2022, it was announced that Disney Branded Television was developing a holiday heist film titled The Naughty Nine for Disney Channel and Disney+. The film was set to be directed by Alberto Belli and executive produced by Suzanne Todd, Jed Elinoff, and Scott Thomas. Elinoff and Thomas also served as the writers for the film. Winslow Fegley, Camila Rodriguez, Anthony Joo, Clara Stack, Imogen Cohen, Madilyn Kellam and Deric McCabe were all cast in the film, but none of their roles were specified.\n\n\nCasting\nOn September 28, 2023, it was announced that Danny Glover joined the cast as Santa Claus in the film.\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography was already underway in Montreal, Canada in February 2022. Filming continued until April 2022. A lot of the pivotal scenes were shot in Pointe-Claire in March 2022. The filming unit covered the grassy green area in the middle of the street with gravel.

    "title": "Jacques Léonard",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15481026",
    "text": "Jacques Léonard (French pronunciation: [ʒak leɔnaʁ]; born December 2, 1936) is a Canadian accountant, educator, and politician in the province of Quebec. He served in the National Assembly of Quebec from 1976 to 1985 and again from 1989 to 2001 and was a cabinet minister in the governments of René Lévesque, Jacques Parizeau, and Lucien Bouchard. Léonard is a Quebec sovereigntist and a member of the Parti Québécois (PQ) and Bloc Québécois (BQ).\n\n\nEarly life and career\nLéonard was born in Saint-Jovite, in the Laurentides region of Quebec. He received a diploma in accountancy in 1959 and a master's degree in commercial sciences from the Université Laval in 1962. After working for two years in the Montreal firm of Clarkson and Gordon, he continued his studies in Paris, France, from 1964 to 1966. Léonard taught at the École des hautes études commerciales and the Université national du Rwanda from 1966 to 1968, at which time he returned to Quebec. From 1968 to 1976, he was a professor and vice-dean of education at the Université de Montréal.\nLéonard became a member of the sovereigntist Rassemblement pour l'Indépendance Nationale in 1962 and joined the Parti Québécois after the former party wound down in 1968. He ran unsuccessfully as a PQ candidate in Labelle in the 1970 and 1973 provincial elections. The PQ won a historic majority government in the 1976 provincial election, and Léonard was elected on his third attempt in Labelle over one-term Liberal incumbent Roger Lapointe.\n\n\nLegislator (1976–85)\n\n\nCabinet minister (1976–84)\nPlanning\nLéonard was named to René Lévesque's first cabinet on November 26, 1976, as the minister of state responsible for planning. This was intended as one of five \"superministry\" portfolios in the cabinet; Léonard was entrusted with working on long-term strategy for land use rather than having the day-to-day administrative duties of a department. On March 2, 1978, he was also named as vice-president of the treasury board.\nIn May 1979, Léonard was a signatory to a deal that saw the governments of Quebec and Canada invest one hundred and fifty million dollars in Quebec's pulp and paper industry.\n\nMunicipal affairs\nLéonard was reassigned as municipal affairs minister on November 6, 1980, exchanging portfolios with Guy Tardif. Shortly after his appointment, he ordered the municipal government of Aylmer to focus on basic administration after receiving a troubling audit of the city's finances.\nIn 1981, a representative of Montreal's municipal government requested that the Lévesque government impose a freeze on the construction of shopping centres, arguing that they often destroy traditional city centres. Léonard responded that he was reluctant to intervene, particularly as municipalities already had the power to impose a freeze themselves.\nLéonard was re-elected in the 1981 general election, in which the Lévesque government was returned with a second consecutive majority, and was kept in the municipal affairs portfolio. He sought to restructure Montreal's municipal government in 1982, giving the smaller suburban communities more power in relation to the city. He faced opposition to this measure from long-standing Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau, whose power was threatened by the reform.\nIn 1983, Léonard attempted to pass legislation permitting the Quebec government to withhold funds from municipalities that accept federal money for job creation purposes. This bill was blocked in the legislature in December 1983, after the opposition Liberal Party threatened a filibuster. The Union des Municipalités du Québec also strongly opposed the measure, and discussions between the two levels of government reached an impasse in early 1984. After Léonard was moved to a different portfolio, the Lévesque government abandoned the legislation.\n\nTransport\nLéonard was shifted to the position of transport minister on March 5, 1984. Two months later, he said that the Quebec government would not make a bid for Nordair (which was then being sold by the federal government) but would oppose any deal under which the company would leave the province.\n\n\nOpposition member (1984–85)\nIn late 1984, the Parti Québécois went through an internal crisis over Premier Lévesque's intention to de-emphasize Quebec sovereignty in the next provincial election. Léonard sided with the hardline indépendantiste wing of the party and resigned from cabinet on November 22. Five days later, he left the PQ caucus to sit as an independent member of the assembly. From the opposition benches, he demanded that Lévesque not make any constitutional agreement with Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney that would result in a weakening of Quebec's Charter of the French Language.\nIn early 1985, Léonard joined an informal grouping of former PQ MNAs centered around the newly formed Rassemblement démocratique pour l'indépendance. He resigned his seat on May 23, 1985, to become dean of the faculty of education at the Université de Montréal, a position he held until his return to politics in 1989.\n\n\nLegislator (1989–2001)\n\n\nOpposition member (1989–94)\nLéonard returned to the Parti Québécois after Jacques Parizeau, a fellow indépendantiste and former cabinet colleague, became party leader in 1988. He was re-elected to the Quebec legislature in the 1989 provincial election over Liberal incumbent Damien Hétu, who had been elected in Labelle in 1985. The Liberals won a majority government provincially under Robert Bourassa's leadership, and Léonard re-entered the legislature as a member of the official opposition. For the next five years, he served as his party's finance critic. In 1993, he accused the Bourassa government of taking a laissez-faire approach to the economy and of having no overall vision.\n\n\nCabinet minister (1994–2001)\nTransport minister\nThe Parti Québécois won a majority government under Parizeau's leadership in the 1994 general election. Léonard was re-elected to the legislature and rejoined cabinet on September 26, 1994, as minister of transport, ironically the same position he had resigned from ten years earlier. He was also appointed to a second term as vice-president of the treasury board.\nAfter his appointment, Léonard argued that highways are an exclusively provincial jurisdiction and tried to postpone the government of Canada's planned national highway program. He announced increased penalties for persons driving under the influence of alcohol in 1995 and introduced legislation to require photographs on Quebec driving licenses. He also expressed scepticism about mandatory helmet laws for cyclists, saying that safety education was a better approach.\nIn early 1995, Léonard and industry minister Daniel Paillé announced a proposal to save the financially troubled MIL Davie Inc. shipyard with a ferry construction contract. Later in the year, he announced that the Parizeau government had no choice but to drop the plan on the grounds it had become too expensive and complex. Following protests from the shipyard workers, the government reversed itself a second time and agreed to a modified sixty-six million dollar construction program over two years.\n\nTreasury Board president\nParizeau announced his resignation as premier after the sovereignty option's narrow defeat in the 1995 Quebec referendum. On November 3, 1995, while still leading a caretaker administration, he shuffled his cabinet and named Léonard as president of the treasury board and minister responsible for administration and the public service. In the following months, Parizeau, Léonard, and finance minister Pauline Marois worked in committee reviewing government expenses and revenues in a bid to reduce public spending.\nLéonard was kept in the treasury board portfolio when Lucien Bouchard succeeded Parizeau as premier on January 29, 1996. He was also named to the priorities committee, an \"inner cabinet\" with significant control over the government's direction, and was named as minister responsible for the Laurentides. Over the next two years, he played a central role in the Bouchard government's ultimately successful effort to eliminate the provincial deficit.\nHe announced several austerity measures in March 1996, making significant spending cuts in areas such as health, education, and social assistance; the total cuts for the fiscal year amounted to $2.2 billion. In announcing these measures, Léonard said, \"We have fallen behind other Canadian provinces in cleaning up public finances. Quebec must act now.\" He also expressed scepticism about proposed pay equity legislation later in 1996, arguing that it would put a strain on public-sector spending.\nIn late 1996, Léonard announced that the Bouchard government would try to achieve $1.4 billion in savings from Quebec's public-sector unions, to be achieved by unfreezing pension reserve funds rather than by taking measures that would result in significant job losses. The unions responded with a plan that focused on early retirement and employee buyouts. Negotiations continued into 1997.\nLéonard introduced more severe funding cuts, amounting to $2.3 billion, in March 1997. At the same time, however, he noted that the Quebec's financial situation was improving and that no comparable cuts would be needed in the future. He also argued that the Bouchard government's austerity plan would benefit Quebec sovereignty in the long term, saying \"once Quebec is much more financially solid, Quebecers will look at the future with much more confidence in themselves and their state.\" Ultimately, an unexpectedly high rate of voluntary retirement in the public sector allowed the government to reach its goals without difficulty. Léonard announced further cuts of one billion dollars in 1998 and noted that the province would be out of debt the following year.\nRe-elected in the 1998 general election, Léonard was kept in the treasury board portfolio in Bouchard's post-election cabinet shuffle. In January 1999, he began a new round of negotiations with public-sector workers on collective agreements. After protracted discussions, the two sides agreed on a nine per cent wage increase over four years.\nAfter years of cutbacks, Léonard projected a $1.1 billion budget surplus in March 1999 and announced new public spending in areas such as health, education, and information technology. He also introduced new hiring in the public service, with a particular focus on minority communities. The same financial trend continued the following year, and Léonard introduced more new program funding in 2000.\nLucien Bouchard resigned as premier on March 8, 2001, and was succeeded by Bernard Landry. Léonard used the occasion to announce his own resignation from both cabinet and the legislature, saying \"You are witnessing a changing of the guard. My decision will allow one more young person to be promoted to cabinet.\" He returned to accountancy work and, in 2002, became a professor of political science at the Université du Québec à Montréal. He joined the board of governors of the Conseil de la Souveraineté du Québec in early 2003.\n\n\nFederal politics\nIn 2003–04, Léonard led a Bloc Québécois review of Canadian federal spending practices. He concluded that there had been sharp increases in some areas, including opinion polls, office furniture, and the office of the privacy commissioner of Canada.\nLéonard ran as a Bloc Québécois candidate in the Montreal division of Outremont in the 2006 federal election and finished a close second against incumbent Liberal cabinet minister Jean Lapierre. Léonard later served as the Bloc's vice-president and worked on the party's campaign in the 2008 federal election.\n\n\nElectoral record\nFederal\n\nSources: Official Results, Elections Canada and Financial Returns, Elections Canada.\n\nProvincial\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\nSource: Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "William Grey (bishop of Ely)",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=13037191",
    "text": "William Grey (died 1478) was a medieval English churchman, academic, and Lord High Treasurer. He served as Chancellor of Oxford University and as Bishop of Ely.\n\n\nFamily\nGrey was the son of Sir Thomas Grey, one of the conspirators in the Southampton Plot, and Alice Neville, the daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his first wife Margaret (d.1396), daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford.\nHe had three brothers, and four or five sisters, including:\n\nSir Thomas Grey (1404 – d. before 1426), who in 1412, at eight years of age, was betrothed to Isabel, then three years of age, only daughter of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, and Anne Mortimer, but died childless.\nSir Ralph Grey (d. 17 March 1442), who married Elizabeth FitzHugh, daughter of Henry FitzHugh, 3rd Baron FitzHugh, and Elizabeth Grey, and left children.\nSir John Grey.\na sister who married a husband surnamed Arundel.\nJoan Grey (c. 1408–1488), who married Sir John Salvin.\nElizabeth Grey (c. 1402–1454), who married firstly, Sir William Whitchester, and secondly, Sir Roger Widdrington.\n\n\nStudies in England\nGrey was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, and in due course became a Doctor of Divinity at Oxford University. His powerful family connections early secured him ecclesiastical preferment. On 11 January 1430–1 he was collated to the prebend of Kentish Town in the Diocese of London, an office which he held until 1446. On 16 May 1434 he was made archdeacon of Northampton, and in the same year prebendary of Thame in the Diocese of London; these preferments he occupied until 1454. On 21 October 1443, he was collated to the prebend of Longdon in the Diocese of Lichfield. Towards the end of 1447 he is mentioned as prebendary of Barnby, and then for a short time in the latter part of 1452 of Driffield, both in the Diocese of York. Before this last date, on 3 March 1449–50, he was admitted archdeacon of Richmond.\nHow far these various and accumulated preferments imply a residence in England may be doubtful, but that Grey lived for some time in Oxford, possibly with the object of completing the acts required for the degree of Doctor of Divinity, is shown by the facts that he was elected Chancellor of the University, and held that office in 1440-1 and also during a part of 1442, and that later in this year he acted for a time as commissary. Probably his long sojourn abroad may be placed partly before 1440 and mostly after 1442.\n\n\nStudies abroad\nGrey's travels led him first to Cologne, where he studied logic, philosophy, and theology. He lived there in princely style and with a magnificent household, for some years. Then, possibly after an interval spent in England, he went to Italy in order to apply himself more closely to the study of classical learning. He stayed for a while in Florence and then removed to Padua. Afterwards, being advised to profit by the teaching of the famous Guarino da Verona, he settled in Ferrara. Here, too, he kept a splendid establishment, and maintained Niccolò Perotti, afterwards well known as a grammarian, in his household, probably about 1477–8. Perotti was a mere youth, but his Greek scholarship made his help valuable to the Englishman. Grey remained at Ferrara until 1449, when Henry VI appointed him his proctor at the Roman curia. He took Perotti with him and afterwards procured him a post in the household of Cardinal Bessarion.\n\n\nBishop of Ely\nGrey's devotion to humanism and his patronage of learned men naturally found favour in the eyes of Pope Nicholas V. As early as 1450 the latter sought to obtain for him the bishopric of Lincoln, and failing to accomplish this, on 21 June 1454, on the elevation of Bishop Bourchier to the see of Canterbury, nominated him to the vacant bishopric of Ely. In the bull of provision Grey is described as apostolic notary and referendary. The temporalities were restored to him on 6 September, and he was consecrated by the new archbishop at Mortlake two days later. But he was not installed in his cathedral until St Cuthbert's Day, 20 March 1457–8, when there was a great frost.\n\n\nContributions to Balliol College Library\nGrey devoted much care to the collection of manuscripts, and wherever he resided constantly employed scribes to make copies of such books as he could not otherwise obtain. Many of these he had adorned with costly miniatures and initial letters by the skill of an artist who worked for him at Florence. It was his desire to make his collection the nucleus of a library for Balliol College, Oxford, to the building of which, as well as to that of the master's lodgings and of the old buttery and hall, he contributed largely. The work was finished about 1477 by Robert Abdy, then master of the college, and enriched with some two hundred manuscripts, the bishop's gift. Of these, many were destroyed in the reign of Edward VI and during the English Civil War, and by Wood's time few of the miniatures in the remaining volumes had escaped mutilation. But by 1890, no less than 152 of Grey's codices were still in the possession of the college, and form a large part of Roger Mynors' 1963 catalogue of the college's manuscripts. The bishop's coat of arms (gules, a lion rampant, within a bordure engrailed argent) is displayed on two windows of the Old Library, and in the panels below the window of the Master's dining room.\n\n\nMediator during the Wars of the Roses\nDuring the troubled years of his episcopate Grey never took a leading part in public affairs. He devoted himself rather to the charge of his diocese, and still more probably to his learned interests, which were reputed to extend not only to Greek but also to Hebrew, while in his palace on Holborn he maintained the same stately establishment as that for which he had been famous on the continent. Yet there is ample evidence also of his political activity.\nIn the beginning of 1455, he was appointed to serve on a commission to arbitrate between the Duke of York and the Duke of Somerset, the failure of which was shown in the first battle of St. Albans in the following May. Later on, apparently in 1460, before the battle of Northampton, he again took part in an attempted reconciliation of the Yorkist leaders. At length, on 25 October 1469, he was made Lord High Treasurer, and held the seals until the following July. Grey's tenure as Lord High Treasurer occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England. On 26 August 1471 he was named first on a commission of fifteen to hold a diet at Alnwick to deal with the infractions of the truce with Scotland, and in the following March to treat with the Scots ambassadors at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 25 April, and again on 16 May he was entrusted with a similar negotiation.\nIn February 1477–8, Grey's health showed signs of breaking down. After Easter, he quit his London palace for Ely, and then, as his weakness increased, he removed to his neighbouring manor of Downham. Here he died on Tuesday, 4 August 1478. On the next day his body was borne to Ely with great pomp, attended by almost all the priests of the Isle, and on that Thursday the bishop was buried between two marble pillars on the north side of Ely Cathedral, the fabric of which owes not a little to his munificence.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nFryde, E.

    "text": "William Markham (1635 – 12 June 1704) served as deputy governor of the Province of Pennsylvania. Markham was the acting governor of Pennsylvania from 1681 to 1682 and from 1693 to 1699. He was a member of the Church of England and tended to favor the interests of minority religious groups in the primarily Quaker colony.\n\n\nIn Pennsylvania\nOn 10 April 1681, Markham was appointed by his first cousin, Governor William Penn, and served as acting governor while Penn was in England. Markham sailed for America soon after his appointment. He landed in Boston and made his way to New York where he showed his credentials and took official control of the Delaware territories which had also been given to Penn.\nOn 3 August 1681, Markham arrived in Upland (now Chester, Pennsylvania), the only town in the colony at that time. He assembled a governing council that included six Quakers and three other early colonists. As governor, Markham helped select the site for Philadelphia, bought land from the Indians along the Delaware River and Pennsbury Manor, and began the discourse with Lord Baltimore over the disputed boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland.\nPenn first arrived in Pennsylvania in October 1682 and relieved Markham of his duties. Markham became a representative for the colony in England and lobbied on its behalf in the boundary dispute with Maryland. He served in various other positions including secretary of the province, secretary to the proprietary, a commissioner to sell lands, and an auditor of accounts. Markham supported John Blackwell over Thomas Lloyd in their dispute over the governorship.\nIn 1691, Delaware was separated from Pennsylvania, and Markham became the acting deputy governor of the new colony. The Glorious Revolution overthrew the Stuart dynasty with which Penn had his connections. By 1693, he temporarily fell from court popularity and lost control of the colony. The crown gave official control to Benjamin Fletcher, but Markham served a second term as acting governor as Fletcher's deputy. Penn was reinstated as official governor in August 1694, but Markham maintained control of the colony until Penn's return from England in December 1699.\nMarkham had several disputes with the legislative body and issued his own version of the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania in an attempt to resolve some of this conflict. Markham's version of the Frame gave greater power to the lower house of the legislature, the General Assembly, and greatly weakened his executive power as well as that of the upper house, the Council. Markham was criticised by the surveyor-general of customs and fellow Governors such as Francis Nicholson for, among other things, allowing pirates such as Thomas Day to run rampant. Pennsylvania did not have the military capacity to protect the Delaware Bay. Penn also complained of fraudulent financial transactions with Markham, but still had him appointed, through the deputy governor, register-general of wills in 1703.\n\n\nReferences",

Sample (October 8, 1910 – October 7, 1995) was an American conductor.\n\n\nBiography\nSample was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and began studying the violin at age ten and piano at age eleven. By the age of twenty he conducted his first symphony in Minneapolis. He earned his bachelor's in music degree at the MacPhail School of Music in 1930. In Europe, he studied for four years receiving a diploma at the Mozarteum Salzburg in 1934, and also studied with Pierre Monteux who was conducting the Paris Symphony. Sample also studied with Henri Verbrugghen and Bernhard Paumgartner. He also received a doctorate in music in 1942 from the New York College of Music and a doctor of laws degree from Gannon College in 1963.\nSample was the Master of Music at The Blake School in Minneapolis 1929–1933. He also organized the Little Symphony of Minneapolis 1931–1933. Guest conducting in Austria and France occupied his musical efforts in 1933–1937. He was the conductor for the symphony and opera music project in Los Angeles, 1938–1942. In this capacity he led the premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s choral and orchestral setting of The Star-Spangled Banner on October 14, 1941 at the Embassy Auditorium in Los Angeles featuring the WPA Orchestra, Los Angeles Oratorio Society, and the WPA Negro Chorus. Beginning in 1942, he served as an assistant to Canadian conductor Wilfrid Pelletier at the Metropolitan Opera. He made his conducting debut at New York’s City Center Opera Company replacing Laszlo Halasz on February 25, 1944 for Friedrich von Flotow’s opera Martha. He was with the Met and City Center Opera 1942–1945. He guest-conducted the Utah Symphony Orchestra 1945–1946 and is credited with a prominent role in the formation of that orchestra. He was the associate conductor for the San Francisco Symphony transcontinental tour led by Pierre Monteux in 1947. As such, he conducted the orchestra at Carnegie Hall in \"Happy Birthday to You\" for Monteux's 72nd birthday on April 4, 1947.\nSample was the conductor of the San Bernardino Symphony and Hollywood Chamber Orchestra 1947–1949. He was in charge of the KFI (Radio) Symphony Orchestra in Los Angeles 1946–49. He was conducting their Hollywood Bowl Orchestra auditions when he was selected to be the conductor of the Oregon Symphony. He led that orchestra, then known as the Portland Symphony, in the years 1949–1953. He also led that orchestra in performances on the \"Standard Hour\" radio program. Sample was credited by the orchestra's manager Phil Hart with making the orchestra and conductor a part of community life. He succeeded Fritz Mahler as conductor of the Erie Philharmonic in 1953, which he conducted 1953–1967; and became conductor of the Fort Wayne Philharmonic Orchestra in 1967. He retired from conducting in 1982 to devote his time to composition and coaching advanced vocal students.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJames Sample was married to Ernestine F. Sample (August 15, 1909 – September 6, 1980). Her father was Earnest Andersson, a polymath and self-taught composer whose music Sample championed. He died in 1995 of a heart condition in Meadville, Pennsylvania on the day before what would have been his 85th birthday. He is buried in the Columbarium Chapel of Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.\n\n\nAwards\nCity of Erie Award, 1967\n\n\nReferences\n\n\"Coast Orchestra Here for Concert\", New York Times, April 10, 1947, p. 36.\n\"The Experience of a Cooperative Orchestra: Husband and Wife\", New York Times, March 26, 1950, p. 103.\n\"New Symphony Conductor Arrives to Prepare for Season Opening\", Oregonian August 7, 1949, section 1 p. 1.\n\"Obituary\".

    "text": "Tomlinson Hall was a public meeting hall in Indianapolis, Indiana, on the northeast corner of Market and Delaware streets adjacent to the Indianapolis City Market. It hosted a variety of public events from 1886 until January 30, 1958, when it was destroyed in a fire.\nThe building was named for Stephen D. Tomlinson, an Indianapolis druggist, whose will had bequeathed the money to build it.\n\n\nBeginnings\nThe will of Indianapolis druggist Stephen D. Tomlinson, who had died on November 14, 1870, provided that the residue of his estate would, upon the death of his wife, Mary Todd Brown Tomlinson, be given to city of Indianapolis to construct a \"public building\" on the western portion of what was then East Market Square, a farmer's market that had operated since the 1830s.\nThe city reached an agreement with Mrs. Tomlinson in 1874 to receive the estate immediately. However, construction was delayed while the question of whether the site, which the State of Indiana had given to the city for use as a public market, could be used for other purposes. Some of the city's leaders also feared that the erection of a public hall would ultimately require a tax increase. The city council decided that the new structure would house both the public hall and the city market.\nThe city organized a design contest that was won by local architect Diedrich A. Bohlen. Construction using Bohlen's designs, began in 1883, and extended more than two years at a cost of $125,000. The first floor housed offices and overflow from the City Market, while the second floor contained a large auditorium with a seating capacity of 4,200 people in the audience and an additional 650 people on the stage.\n\n\nOpening and events\n\nTomlinson Hall was inaugurated on June 2, 1886, as a part of the Grand Army of the Republic Music Festival that raised money for the construction of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. William Tecumseh Sherman was one of the dignitaries presiding over that event.\nOn June 27, 1888, the hall was the site of a large celebration honoring the nomination of Benjamin Harrison for president of the United States. Rallies were held in 1917 to mark the declaration of war on Germany in World War I and in 1920 to mark the city's centennial.\nThe hall was host to several kinds of public activities during its history, including concerts, fund raisers, political events, conventions, and sporting events. Notable entertainers who performed there included John Philip Sousa and his band (which featured soprano Estelle Liebling), pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski, silent movie star Rudolph Valentino, and many prominent big bands of the 1920s. The hall was also host to the city's annual May Music Festival. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, dance marathons were held in the hall.\n\n\nDeterioration and fire\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Tomlinson Hall began to deteriorate, leading city leaders in the 1950s to consider what should be done with it. A persistent proposal was to demolish it and build a parking garage on the site. In 1955, the National Board of Fire Underwriters called the structure the \"city's worst fire hazard\".\nThe hall was destroyed by fire on January 30, 1958, allegedly after a pigeon dropped a lit cigarette on the roof of the building. The city issued a contract to demolish the building, but a group of citizens who wanted to maintain the civic landmark obtained a restraining order on March 10. The judge subsequently vacated the order on May 13, finding that because Tomlinson Hall was not part of the original market trust, the city was within its rights to raze it. The demolition was completed in July.\nThe demolition dealt only with the aboveground portions of the structure. The basement had been used to transport and store goods in a cooler location for the market vendors on the first floor. Subsequent construction of a new west wing of the City Market in the 1970s retained the basement. Since then the 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) underground area, while no longer used for any purpose, has become known as the Indianapolis Catacombs, with guided tours given at various times.\nWhen the adjacent City Market was rehabilitated in the 1970s, an arch from Tomlinson Hall that had been incorporated into a later wall was uncovered and renovated as a memorial to the hall and its benefactor. Charles L. Whistler Memorial Plaza has occupied the site since its dedication in 1987. Plans for a redesigned plaza were unveiled in January 2025, including the demolition of the City Market's west-wing addition and daylighting sections of the catacombs below.\n\n\nSee also\nList of destroyed heritage of the United States\n\n\nReferences",

The transmitter is off the Trans-Canada Highway near Massey Drive in Corner Brook.\nCBY is a Class A station, transmitting with 10,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna. By day, the signal covers most of Western Newfoundland. At night, with a good radio, it can be heard around the Maritime Provinces and parts of Quebec and New England. Nine FM rebroadcasters provide additional coverage throughout Western Newfoundland and the Northern Peninsula.\n\n\nHistory\nBefore Newfoundland joined the Canadian Confederation in 1949, Newfoundland radio stations had call signs beginning with VO. Thus, what is now CBY was launched with the call sign VOWN, standing for the Voice Of West Newfoundland, on July 5, 1943 during a public ceremony attended by about two hundred guests in the ballroom of the Glynmill Inn. The broadcast opened with a rendition of Ode to Newfoundland played by the Corner Brook Militia Band, followed by a recorded address from Sir Humphrey Walwyn, Governor of Newfoundland.\nThe station originally broadcast on a frequency of 840 kHz and was owned by the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland. Following a power increase from 250 watts to 1,000 watts on March 23, 1947, the station began broadcasting on 790 kHz. \nOn March 31, 1949, the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland was absorbed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation when Newfoundland joined Canada. Consequently, VOWN adopted its present call sign. In 1963, the station began broadcasting on 990 kHz.\nCBNA St. Anthony signed on the air on August 2, 1969 on 600 kHz; it has since moved to the FM band on 100.3 MHz.\nOn October 19, 2012, CBY made its final broadcast from its longtime studios of 53 years on Premier Drive in Corner Brook after the announcement of budget cuts by the federal government. The station is now located in the Valley Mall, a decision that drew much criticism mostly because of the size of the new studios. The former CBC location was a building, owned and operated by the CBC.\nOn August 29, 2025, the CBC filed an application to the CRTC to move CBY Corner Brook from the AM band (990 kHz) to the FM band on 106.7 MHz. \n\n\nLocal programming\nSince 2018, CBY has cooperated with CBG in Gander to produce CBC Newfoundland Morning, a local morning show focused on central and western Newfoundland, the Northern Peninsula, and southern Labrador. Prior to this, CBY produced its own morning show called The West Coast Morning Show.\nFor the remainder of local programming blocks within the CBC Radio One schedule, CBY broadcasts programming from CBN in St. John's.\n\n\nTransmitters\n\nOn May 27, 1986, the CRTC approved the CBC's application to change CBNE from 1370 to 1420 kHz. CBNE was later converted to 91.9 MHz on February 15, 1989.\nOn February 5, 2018, the CRTC approved the CBC's application to convert CBNA 600 to 100.3 MHz with an effective radiated power of 4,500 watts (non-directional antenna with an effective height of the antenna above average terrain of 173 metres). The licensee also stated that the new FM transmitter will reach a greater population than the existing AM signal.\n\n\nCBY call sign history\nThe call sign CBY was previously used by a CBL rebroadcaster in Toronto from 1938 to 1943.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCBC Newfoundland and Labrador\nCBY-AM at The History of Canadian Broadcasting by the Canadian Communications Foundation\nCBY in the REC Canadian station database",

In better times, AJ (Triple H) would have done anything to protect his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), a two-bit gangster and the son of Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) -- the city's toughest crime boss. While A.J. is in prison, Jack marries Claire (Parker Posey), the love of AJ's life, and together they raise a daughter, Pepper (Juliette Goglia). Pepper is A.J.'s daughter, a fact known to Jack, but Jack pretends to be her biological father. The day Jack picks up AJ from prison, the short-fused thug gets an itchy trigger finger that could land his buddy right back behind bars. The situation grows increasingly tense as Dr. Vic attempts to handle the situation quietly as he comes under investigation by the Louisiana Tax Board agent Martha (Julie White) for dealing in untaxed cigarettes.

On 18 July 1909, their house of prayer was consecrated. The small building was funded and constructed by the local villagers. In 1916, the association was granted permission to build a graveyard next to the prayer house. The parish priest was required to go to the prayer house twice a year to bury the dead and hold funerals. In 1939, the government gave permission for the priest to have four worship services each year at the small prayer house, and later this was raised to six per year. In 1942, the prayer house received an altar and baptismal font. An altarpiece was added in 1943 when the prayer house was upgraded to the status of annex chapel. During the 1960s, the building was renovated extensively. In 1978, the Osmarka Inner Mission Association disbanded and gave the building and graveyard to the municipality to take care of. In 1983, the building was enlarged to add bathroom facilities. From 2002-2005, the exterior of the building was renovated, returning it to its original 1909 appearance.\n\n\nSee also\nList of churches in Møre\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Water Engineers for the Americas (WEFTA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, founded in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2002.\nIn rural populations around the world, approximately 15% of people do not have access to improved water systems, and between 30-50% have unimproved sanitation systems. Focusing on Latin American communities, WEFTA's mission is to ensure access to potable water and proper sanitation, reduce waterborne diseases, protect the environment and lessen the burden of hauling and disinfecting water on families, especially women and children.\n\n\nStructure\nWEFTA is an all-volunteer organization. The volunteer board of directors is made up of water engineers and community development professionals from several firms in the southwest United States, most notably Souder Miller & Associates (New Mexico) and Aqua Engineering (Utah). Engineers from these and other firms donate their expertise to help communities in Latin America build and maintain simple, inexpensive potable water and basic sanitation systems. Volunteers use vacation time or are on loan from their companies while on assignment. WEFTA works only when requested by the benefitting community, which covers the volunteer’s expenses on the ground. Transportation to projects is donated by individuals and through grants to cover overhead expenses through the Wallace Genetic Foundation. WEFTA also partners with UniversalGiving to raise fund for projects. 100% of any other donations received by WEFTA go directly to fund material costs for projects (such as PVC pipe, hand pumps, water purifiers, etc.).\n\n\nHow it works\n\nA community needing water or sanitation generally hears about WEFTA through word of mouth. A leader of that community fills out an application and submits it to WEFTA in Santa Fe or to a local WEFTA volunteer. Before committing to a project, a WEFTA member meets with the entire community to identify the community leader who will manage the role of the beneficiaries of the project. The local community must collect 30-40% of the material cost of the project or apply for these funds from their municipalities or regional governments. WEFTA often matches these funds, which are low due to the low-tech nature of the projects. The community performs all unskilled labor and also collects materials such as gravel or sand, depending on the project. One or more water engineers visit and live within the community and design the simplest, most easy to maintain system possible to provide potable water and/or basic sanitation. The volunteer stays until the project is completed and WEFTA returns approximately every two years to ensure that the system is still functioning and is well maintained. Once a community is engaged with WEFTA, WEFTA guarantees to maintain and repair the water system for life with the help of the community.\n\n\nWork to date\n\nIn 2011, WEFTA was invited by a group of municipalities in the Urubamba Valley of Peru—the Sacred Valley of the Incas and site of a quickly developing tourism industry—to devise a simple solution for waste water treatment of the polluted Urubamba river. WEFTA representatives have made several trips there and submitted plans to use cheap, effective organic biodigesters to replace the costly and inefficient traditional chemical or filtration plants.\nIn November 2013, WEFTA entered into a partnership with USAID-ACCESO]to promote health and livelihoods of over 300,000 residents of western Honduras with WEFTA upgrading and building new water system worth approximately US$350,000 to achieve those ends.\nBy May 2014, WEFTA had completed 62 projects in seven countries (Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Peru). These projects have directly provided approximately 3,400 families (17,000 individuals) with potable water and/or basic sanitation or waste water treatment. WEFTA has worked with partners around the country and at the request of Save the Children in Honduras, Habitat for Humanity in Guatemala and Peru, Lutheran World Relief and Homes from the Heart.\nIn addition to designing and building water systems, WEFTA also provides training and education to partners in the countries it serves, seeking to empower local engineers and technicians to carry forward the work WEFTA has started with community-based, self-help projects  WEFTA has also held several WASH-in-Schools programs and built toilet, shower and drinking-water facilities for regional schools in Peru and Bolivia.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWater Engineers for the Americas official web site",

    "title": "M. Karunanidhi",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=479912",
    "text": "Muthuvel Karunanidhi (3 June 1924 – 7 August 2018), popularly known as Kalaignar (Artist), was an Indian writer and politician who served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for almost two decades over five terms between 1969 and 2011. He had the longest intermittent tenure as Chief Minister with 6,863 days in office. He was also a long-standing leader of the Dravidian movement and ten-time president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam political party. Karunanidhi has the record of never losing an election to the Tamil Nadu Assembly, having won 13 times since his first victory in 1957. Before entering politics, he worked in the Tamil film industry as a screenwriter. He also made contributions to Tamil literature, having written stories, plays, novels, and a multiple-volume memoir. As such, he is also referred to as Mutthamizh Arignar (Tamil Scholar) for his contributions to Tamil literature. Dravida Kazhagam prominent leader Pattukkottai Alagiri conferred the title Kalaignar on him during \"Thookumedi\" drama. Karunanidhi died on 7 August 2018 at Kauvery Hospital in Chennai after a series of prolonged, age-related illnesses.\nKarunanidhi was born in the Tamil Nadu village of Thirukkuvalai on 3 June 1924. His parents were from the Isai Vellalar community, a caste of musicians that perform at temples and other social gatherings. Growing up in a caste-ridden culture, Karunanidhi was learned about the crippling circumstances that arose from being born into a low caste. When he was 14, he formed a student movement against the imposition of Hindi as India's National Language during the Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937–40. This served as a forerunner to Karunanidhi's wider anti-Hindi demonstrations in 1965. As a high school student, Karunanidhi created the Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, the Dravidian movement's first student wing. He also started a news paper during his school days, which grew into the Murasoli, the DMK's official publication. Karunanidhi began participating in theatrical productions at a young age, including composing plays. Later on, he started writing for movies. As a writer, he wrote screenplays, historical novels, screenplays, biographies, poems and novels. He utilised his writing to propagate reformist ideals effectively. He wrote the script and dialogue for M. G. Ramachandran's maiden film as a hero, Rajakumari. He also composed the dialogue for Sivaji Ganesan's debut film, Parasakthi. He was critical of organised religion and superstition. He was an atheist and a self-described rationalist.\nKarunanidhi started his political career in 1957, when he was voted to the Madras state legislature. When the DMK first entered the state legislature the following year, he was named treasurer and deputy leader of the opposition. Karunanidhi ascended quickly through the ranks. After the death of C.N. Annadurai in 1969, he became the DMK's leader and Chief minister of Tamil Nadu and led the party to a landslide win in the 1971 Assembly elections. He was influenced by the rationalist and egalitarian ideology of Periyar and DMK founder C N Annadurai. Karunanidhi was among those who fought Indira Gandhi's Emergency in 1975 which led to governments getting dismissed in 1976. In the 1976 Assembly elections, he gave the Congress 50 per cent of the seats, but the partnership fell apart, and MGR prevailed. After MGR's death in 1989, he led the party to power. His administration was dismissed in 1991 for its alleged links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He came to power in the state in 1996 after forming a partnership with the Tamil Maanila Congress and joined the United Front led by Deve Gowda in the centre. His party allied with the BJP in 1999. He was arrested from his house in 2001 by the police on the orders of Jayalalithaa as an act of vendetta over alleged losses in construction of fly-overs. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, he teamed up with the Congress and won by a landslide. He became a chief minister again in 2006. In April 2009, then-Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi held a six-hour hunger strike to demand a ceasefire in the Sri Lankan civil war. The controversial fast was widely seen as a political move to gain electoral support for the DMK, particularly since it was held just before the general elections. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he contested alone and lost. In 2016, he made his son Stalin as leader of opposition for the DMK become the Tamil Nadu Assembly's biggest opposition party.\nDuring his political career, Karunanidhi advocated for increased state autonomy and affirmative action to favour lower castes. He implemented a caste-based quota system for government employment and government school students, as well as subsidies to the poor. His initiatives were quickly adopted in other Indian states. His initiatives earned him popularity among the lower castes. He was frequently confronted with accusations of nepotism. He has also stirred controversies by publicly supporting the LTTE and other separatist groups in Sri Lanka. During his different tenures, he implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the expansion of industry in the state. He was also instrumental in erecting a 133-foot monument of Thiruvalluvar in Kanyakumari and ensuring classical language status to Tamil language.\n\n\nEarly life and family\nKarunanidhi was born on 3 June 1924, in the village of Thirukkuvalai in Tanjore district (currently Nagapattinam district), Madras Presidency in the erstwhile British Raj, to Ayyadurai Muthuvel and Anjugam. He had two elder sisters, Periyanayaki and Shanmugasundari. There was some misconception that his birth name was Dakshinamurthy, later changed to Karunanidhi as influenced by Dravidian and rationalist movements, Karunanidhi himself stated that C.N. Annadurai asked him to keep his birthname \"Karunanidhi\", since it is already popular among the people. In his own writings Karunanidhi said that his family were of the Isai Vellalar, a community who had traditionally played musical instruments at ceremonial occasions; however his political rival M. G. Ramachandran and some observers contested that and said that he was of Telugu ancestry. Karunanidhi started his education at a local school. Karunanidhi's father was eager to teach him music. His music teachers were from the Isai Vellalar group, and the lessons were conducted in temples where he was not allowed to cover his upper body, wear slippers, or wear a cotton cloth around his hips as a sign of respect for the upper caste people. He couldn't tolerate learning in an environment where he wasn't treated with respect, which made his father agree to stop his music classes. His father also asked the local headmaster to set up special tutoring courses for Karunanidhi and paid a tuition fee of milk every morning and evening.My music lessons were actually my first political studies. I learnt about the oppression of humans based on their caste. I saw the delight with which certain individuals could humiliate others, and the self-righteousness of others in carrying out their customs without realising that they were mistreating a large majority of the people.\n\nAt the age of 12, he left to Thiruvarur to start his high school. Karunanidhi started to organise school students for the anti-Hindi agitations. The deaths of two anti-Hindi agitators by the police made a profound impact on him. At the age of 13, he wrote his first Tamil historical novel titled Selvachandira.\n\n\nEntry into politics and early writing career\nKarunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Pattukkottai Alagiri of the Justice Party, and participated in Anti-Hindi agitations. As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including Panagal Arasar, Periyar and Pattukkottai Alagiri (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons). Karunanidhi joined the anti-Hindi protests sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a cycle rickshaw. The law was rescinded in 1939. The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with Communism, Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of Justice Party, Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam. According to Karunanidhi, he joined the Periyar's movement when he saw his father hurriedly rising and tied his towel to his waist from his head as a gesture of servitude when an upper caste landlord walked past him.\nAt the age of fifteen, Karunanidhi started his own magazine Maanavanesan (transl. friends of students). He along with his friends would make fifty copies of the magazine and circulate it and also sometimes mailed them to the leaders of Self-respect movement. A political activist after reading his magazine asked him to lead the forum for peace, liberty equality and justice, he accepted and became its elected secretary. Later, he dissolved the forum after there was a blatant attempt to convert the forum into as a front of the Congress party. He refunded the subscription money many refused to take the refund. Using the rest of ₹75, he started the Tamil Nadu Tamil students association in 1941. In 1942, the association held an annual function attended by Bharathidasan K.A Anbazhagan and K. A. Mathiazhagan and student leaders from Annamalai University. He couldn't afford to pay for the invitees' and guest speakers' travels and expenditures, so he was forced to steal a gold necklace that his mother had made for him but which he rarely wore, pawned it for ₹50, and paid his invitees.\nAs his writings were gaining popularity in Thiruvarur, he started Murasoli to widen his publishing platform. Its writer and chief editor was Karunanidhi, and its secretary was his friend Thennavan. It had a large print run, was mailed to many Tamil political organisations, and was in the forefront of the fight against caste, social isolation, sophistry, and supremacy. He wrote a critical piece in Murasoli titled \"Varnama, Maanama?\" in 1944 when a conference was organised by conservatives in support of varna system. He penned an article named 'Ilamaibali' (Youth Sacrifice) and sent it to C.N Annadurai's Dravida Nadu magazine. It appeared in the next issue. For a week, he wandered the streets of Thiruvarur with a print in hand, persuading many others to read it. He also penned an article that was never published. Within a week, Annadurai arrived in Thiruvarur for a public gathering and asked for Karunanidhi, he was stunned to find Karunanidhi as an 18-year-old school student. He instructed him to cease writing until he completed his education and asked him not to send any more articles. Karunanidhi refused to go back as a school student.\nHe failed three times in his final exams. During the result day, unable to face his family over his third consecutive failure, he left to Thopputhurai in search of his classmate Asan Abdul Kaathar who consoled him. He then started his passion of writing as a career. In Thiruvarur, he started writing and staging plays. These plays served as a channel for the Dravidian movement's ideology to spread. In Thiruvarur, he presented a play named Palaniappan to raise cash for his student association. The total amount collected was only ₹80, despite the fact that the performance had cost him ₹200 to stage. He had no idea how he was going to repay the debt he owed to the individuals who were now harassing him for it. He travelled with his friend Thennavan for Nagapattinam, keen to take his chances somewhere else and met with R. V Gopal, a local leader of the Dravidar Kazhagam. Gopal sympathised with his situation but was hesitant to lend him the money but Instead bought the play for ₹100. The sale of his first play made his to write more ideological plays.\nHis parents didn't approve of his writing career. They advised him to look for a job that would pay him at least ₹50 per month. He was determined on not taking a regular job. Karunanidhi then fell in love with a girl. He was certain that the girl was infatuated with him as well. When he and his family met the girl's parents, they demanded that if a wedding was to take place, it must be performed in the presence of Brahmin priests and vedic chanting. Karunanidhi rejected, citing his belief in the Self-Respect Movement as justification.\nAfter marriage, he worked as a playwright through the help of R.V Gopal who help his earlier with his play. Their first camp for the troupe was at Villupuram where he was joined by his friends Thennavan and C.T Murthy. Their plays failed to bring people even after the attendance of Periyar and Annadurai. The failure was due to their comments against the caste prejudices, the troupe was named \"Dravida Theatre group\", the term \"Dravida\" was perceived to be a term for Dalits and hence non-Dalits boycotted it. The troupe started to play in Pondicherry which was at the time a hub for social cultural and political change. His plays were an instant success and people started to call him as \"Sivaguru\", the name of his character. During his stay in Pondicherry, Karunanidhi penned \"That Pen!\" a criticism of Gandhi and the Congress centred on a pen which was lost from the Sabarmati Ashram, which infuriated the congress workers. He followed up with a piece titled \"What If Gandhi Became Viceroy?\" Later, members of the congress attacked a public gathering in Pondicherry attended by Periyar, Annadurai, and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy. Karunanidhi was chased down and beaten until he fell unconscious. They dropped his unconscious body into the sewers and departed, thinking he was dead. He was nursed back by an old women and taken to Periyar who applied medicines to him and took him to Erode along with him where he worked as an assistant editor with Periyar's Kudi Arasu magazine in Erode for a year.\n\n\nEarly political career\nKarunanidhi along with a group of young band of Tamil enthusiasts led by Annadurai dissented from Dravidar Kazhagam and formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on 17 September 1949.\n\n\nKallakudi demonstration\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi demonstration in Kallakudi in 1953 when he was 29. The original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi. Kallakudi was renamed as \"Dalmiapuram\" by the state administration led by Rajagopalachari to commemorate the North Indian business magnate Ram Krishan Dalmia, who owned a cement factory there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi because Ram Krishna Dalmia depicted north Indian hegemonic power and predatory businesses. In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains. Six people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested and was sent to jail for six months.\n\n\nMLA and deputy leader of opposition\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the Kulithalai seat in Tiruchirapalli during the 1957 election among the 15 DMK legislators elected and were elected as the Chief Whip. During the 1959 elections of the Madras Municipal Corporation, he was managing the party campaigns, the party won 45 out of the 90 contested. He was elected as DMK treasurer on 25 September 1960. Karunanidhi was elected to the state assembly for the second time on 21 February 1962, from the Thanjavur constituency. He defeated Congress candidate A.Y.S. Parisutha Nadar. In the same year, he became the deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly.\nDuring this time, Karunanidhi recognised the necessity for a regular engagement with party cadres. He began sending daily letters to his party members, whom he referred to as udan pirappukal (blood brothers), a practice he followed for fifty years.\n\n\n1965 Anti-Hindi Agitations and imprisonment\n\nAnti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu started when the Union government announced that Hindi would become the single official language. The DMK, led by CN Annadurai, planned to organise a series of rallies against the action and declared 26 January to be a day of mourning. Chants of 'Hindi Ozhiga, Tamil Vaazhga' (Down with Hindi, long live Tamil) were heard everywhere. Violence continued across the state and several set themselves on fire. Karunanidhi, the leader of the DMK's anti-Hindi agitation, was arrested on 16 February 1965, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment at the Central Prison in Palayamkottai. He was later released at 15 April 1985.\n\n\nCabinet Minister of state\nAnnadurai declared Karunnanidhi as a DMK candidate for the February 1967 Madras Legislative Assembly election, at the DMK's State-level meeting at Virugambakkam, Chennai. Karunanidhi, as DMK treasurer, raised ₹11 lakh for the party's election campaign. For the first time, the DMK was elected with an absolute majority in February 1967 and Annadurai became the Chief minister. After being elected to the Saidapet Assembly constituency in Chennai in March 1967, Karunanidhi was appointed as the Minister of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department.\nOn 14 January 1969, under CN Annadurai's administration, Madras State was rechristened as Tamil Nadu. Karunanidhi was in control of five ministries at the time: Transportation, Public Works, Highways, Ports, and Minor Irrigation.\n\n\nFirst term as Chief minister (1969–1971)\n\nOn 3 February 1969, the existing chief minister Annadurai died of cancer. On 9 February 1969, the DMK's MLAs chose Karunanidhi to lead the party with help of M. G. Ramachandran who his long-time friend. He was also chosen as the DMK's legislative assembly leader. Karunanidhi was appointed chief minister on 10 February 1969, the next day and was sworn in by Governor Sardar Ujjal Singh. Members of the DMK selected him as the leader of the DMK on 27 July 1969, a position that had been kept vacant during Annadurai's tenure in honour of Periyar.\nThe six Ministers of Annadurai's Cabinet were kept by Karunanidhi. In addition to his own ministries, Karunanidhi took on the ministries of late Annadurai and Nedunchezhiyan, who had refused to join his cabinet.\nHe once found himself in a difficult situation in the state Assembly when members of the Congress party and Rajagopalachari's Swatantra Party hammered him and his amateur ministers with hard questions. Swatantra Party MP HV Hande described his new government as 'third rate.' Karunanidhi sprang up and exclaimed, 'Sorry, this is not third-rate government', This is a fourth-rate government.\" The house was startled for a few minutes. Some people believed Karunanidhi had admitted to the government's incompetence. Then Karunanidhi indicated that his government of Shudras, the lowest caste in the caste hierarchy which enraged the opposition.\nKarunanidhi started sending letters to his party members in Murasoli, opening with the words \"Udan pirappe\" (My blood brothers). These letters covered a wide range of themes, including the DMK's philosophy, his justifications for various party actions, and encouragements to party members to work very hard throughout electoral campaigns, among other things. Karunanidhi sent around 7,000 of these letters to party leaders between 1969 and his death in December 2016. They were later published in seven volumes.\nKarunanidhi sponsored and presided over a State Autonomy Conference in Madras on 12 September 1970, which included Periyar, West Bengal Chief Minister Ajoy Mukherjee, numerous Parliamentarians, and other dignitaries.\nDuring his tenure, he granted legal status to Self-Respect marriages and implemented a number of other programs aimed at protecting women and children. Karunanidhi's administration established the Sattanathan commission for backward classes in 1969 to recognise underprivileged groups and give them with representation in government employment and educational institutions. He implemented the \"Manu Needhi Thittam\", which mandated district officials to set aside a day every week to hear public grievances, and set up grievance redress procedures. Karunanidhi founded the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in September 1970 to build permanent houses for those living in slums. His government gave free eye surgeries for the blind from the 'Kannoli Thittam\" In 1970, he proposed the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Reduction of Ceiling on Land) Act, which cut the maximum amount of land a family could possess up to 15 standard acres, down from 30 acres under the previous Congress rule.\n\n\nSecond term as Chief Minister (1971–1976)\n\nIn March 1971, Karunanidhi formed an alliance with the Congress headed by Indira Gandhi, on the precondition that her party will not contest in any Assembly seats. In March 1971, the DMK contests for both the Assembly and the Lok Sabha. The DMK-Congress combination beat the Swatantra Party-Congress (Organisation) alliance led by Kamaraj and C. Rajagopalachari. The DMK won a landslide victory, with its candidates capturing 184 of the 234 seats on the ballot. Karunanidhi is re-elected as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the second time. He was elected from Saidapet.\nChief Minister M. Karunanidhi dismissed DMK's Treasurer M.G. Ramachandran from the party. He made this decision in response to a request from 26 of the executive council's 31 members. Karunanidhi later described the decision as \"painful\" at a public platform. The DMK send him a requisition accusing him of breaking party rules. MGR said he was banned because he \"demanded the party's finances, especially those connected to elections\". But the finances were submitted to the party executive committee. There had been conflict in the past, with MGR wanting to be Health Minister but Karunanidhi unwilling to satisfy him. On 17 October 1972, MGR founded the ADMK.\nM Karunanidhi in 1970 issued an order that he said would \"eliminate the thorn in the heart\" of social reformer Periyar. The decree made it possible for people of all castes to become priests in public temples. However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision in 1972.\nUntil 1973, Governors raised the national flag in state capitals on both Republic Day and Independence Day. Karunanidhi protested in February of that year that the Chief Ministers were \"ignored\" on Independence Day and Republic Day. In view of the Rajamannar Committee's report on Centre-State relations(1969–1971) being submitted at the time, he was reinforcing his call for State autonomy. In July, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave in to his demands, announcing that Chief Ministers would now hoist the flag on Independence Day, while Governors would do so on Republic Day. Karunanidhi became the first Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to raise the national flag at Fort St. George on 15 August 1974.\nKarunanidhi launched the \"Beggar rehabitation scheme\" on his 48th birthday on 3 June 1971, and begged for funds for the scheme from shopkeepers near his residence, collecting ₹3,000 and said \"Begging is not an insult to the person doing the begging. But it is an insult to the country and society that made him a beggar.\" Karunanidhi established the Government Servants' Family Benefit Fund Scheme to give financial compensation to an employee's relatives in the event that he loses his job owing to permanent complete disability, medical incapacity, or death. In 1971, his government increased reservation for BC from 25% to 31% and the reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) from 16% to 18%. Karunanidhi established a separate Ministry for the Welfare of the backward class, the first such in the country. During 1973, women were first inducted into the police force.\n\n\nThe Emergency and government dismissal\n\nHe resisted to let the Emergency's on Tamil Nadu for approximately seven months, until his administration was ousted on 31 January 1976. Karunanidhi was a supporter of Jayaparakash Narayan's anti-Emergency campaign and was the first one to ally with his Janata Party. During an event at Don Bosco School, Karunanidhi stated, \"Most likely, this would be my final public function as Chief Minister.\" He was dismissed before he even got home form the function. This occurred just 50 days before his tenure ended. The DMK suffered a great deal of damage once it was dismissed. 25,000 members of the party including Karunanidhi's close relatives and friends were imprisoned. His maternal uncle Murasoli Maran and his son M.K Stalin suffered health issues from torture and C. Chittibabu died trying to save M.K Stalin in prison. He sent ₹200 a month to their families of jailed DMK members through the party office.\nA one-man Sarkaria Commission was established in February 1976 under Supreme Court judge Ranjit Singh Sarkaria, shortly after the Indira Gandhi government ousted the DMK administration after allegations of corruption were made by opposition leader MGR. DMK tried to make out that the investigation was an act of political vendetta. The Sarkaria commission described the evidence on the claims as \"cogent, convincing, and reliable.\" Although none of the corruption charges against him were proved.\n\n\nLeader of the opposition (1977–1983)\nAIADMK led alliance won 34 seats out of 39 seats in the 1977 Indian general election. Top party figures such as general secretary V.R. Nedunchezhiyan, K. Rajaram and S. Madhavan quit accusing Karunanidhi for the DMK's failure in the general elections and demanded Karunanidhi to resign as the party's leader. Later, DMK lost the 1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, Karunanidhi won from Anna Nagar consistency and became the leader of the opposition.\nOn 29 October 1977, DMK supporters brandished black flags and yelled \"Go back, Indira!\" as she exited the Madras Airport for dissolving the DMK government in 1975. Indira Gandhi's vehicle was unable to pass through the black flag barrier in Madurai. Karunanidhi violated the police prohibition in Madras and led protests in Guindy. Karunanidhi and 28 other DMK leaders were detained the next day and were held in judicial custody.\nMGR offered a kind hand to the Morarji Desai government, while Karunanidhi renewed his alliance with Indira Gandhi. When Indira returned to power following the untimely end of Desai's government, she lost no time in dissolving MGR's cabinet. In the 1980 Indian general election and 1980 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the state voted in favour of the AIADMK. MGR was re-elected as Chief Minister. Karunanidhi was elected from Anna Nagar consistency again. In February 1982, Karunanidhi embarked on a week-long padayatra from Madurai to Tiruchendur, spanning about 200 kilometres, in order to seek 'justice' for Subramania Pillai, a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department (HR & CE) officer who was found dead in November 1980. There were allegations that he was assassinated to cover financial misappropriation in the Tiruchendur temple. While Chief Minister MGR said the victim died by suicide, the DMK claimed it was an assassination. Karunanidhi walked over 30 kilometres during the day with a large crowd of cadres and leaders, stopping for lunch in small towns along the way. He gave public speeches in the evenings. The number of persons joining the padayatra grew by the day, and it became a topic of conversation in every family. The ruling government alarmed by the DMK's support, appointed a one-man committee chaired by retired judge C.J.R. Paul. The conclusions of the panel were never presented to the Assembly. Karunanidhi was able to obtain a copy of the study and disclosed it to the public in 1982 which revealed the panel's conclusion that Pillai had not committed suicide.\n\n\nLeader of the DMK (1983–1989)\nKarunanidhi and DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan resigned from the State Assembly soon after the 1983 anti-Tamil riots in Sri Lanka in protest of the union government and state's failure to defend the Eelam tamils in Sri Lanka. In May 1986, Karunanidhi established the Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation (TESO) and held a major national conclave in Madurai to promote the Tamil aspiration for self-determination in Sri Lanka.\nSoon after AIADMK's election win in 1980, Congress abandoned its ally DMK and allied with AIADMK. The 1984 elections took place against the backdrop of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination. In December 1984, contested as allies in both Lok Sabha and the State Assembly which conducted together and were carried to victory by the sympathy generated for Indira Gandhi and MGR who was undergoing a Kidney transplant in New york. After being voted to the legislative council in April 1984, Karunanidhi decided to skip the elections. In 1986, the MLC was however abolished by the Chief Minister, MG Ramachandran.\nKarunanidhi was instrumental in bringing the seven-party National Front together in Chennai in October 1988. With a plea for social justice, he backed Vishwanath Pratap Singh and his announcement of the Mandal Commission Report. Earlier on 17 September 1988, he organised a large rally in Chennai with largely DMK members and a public meeting to commemorate the National Front's formation. It was the largest rally Chennai has ever seen. Its inauguration was attended by 20 top national opposition leaders, including three non-Congress(I) chief ministers.\n\n\nThird term as Chief minister (1989–1991)\n\nAfter a 13-year break, the DMK returned to power in 1989. Following MGR's death from a heart attack, the AIADMK split into two. The late Chief Minister MG Ramachandran's wife V N Janaki  led one faction, while J Jayalalithaa led another that helped the DMK. With about 33% of the vote, the DMK was able to secure a solid majority of 151 seats. Karunandihi was elected Chief Minister for the third time from Chennai's Harbour constituency.\nKarunanidhi allowed the LTTE to use Tamil Nadu as a rear base for its battle for Eelam Between 1989 and 1991, even after Prabhakaran took up arms against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Karunanidhi accused the Indian soldiers of rape and massacre of Tamils in Sri Lanka and refused to receive the returning soldiers. The Karunanidhi administration was then dismissed and placed under presidents rule by the Chandra Shekhar led union government after only two years of its five-year tenure due to its inability to act against Sri Lankan Tamil militants. Despite Governor S.S. Barnala's unwillingness to report to the Union Cabinet that Tamil Nadu's constitutional apparatus had broken down, the government was dismissed.\nHe enacted legislations which provided financial assistance to widows and inter-caste weddings. In 1989, Karunanidhi passed a law giving equal rights to women in family properties. In 1989, Tamil Nadu became the first state to reserve 30% of government jobs for women. After announcing on 17 November 1990, that his government would give free power connection, he followed it up with a Government Order giving power connection to 12.40 lakh farmers. Women's self-help groups were first established in 1989 in Dharmapuri to integrate women and increase self-employment opportunities. In 1990, Karunanidhi separated reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) which gave 1% separate quota for STs.\n\n\nLeader of the DMK (1991–1996)\n\nAssassination of Rajiv Gandhi by the LTTE took place during the electoral campaign for the 1991 Indian general elections. The DMK was accused in the incident and mobs vandalised the properties of DMK members and functionaries. The allies AIADMK and the Congress campaigned together and spread propaganda claiming that the DMK was to responsible for Rajiv Gandhi's assassination and it worked. The AIADMK-Congress coalition won a decisive win in the Assembly elections on 24 June 1991, and Jayalalithaa is elected Chief Minister for the first time. Except for Karunanidhi, Parithi Ilamvazhuthi was the only DMK candidate who was elected in the elections, and Karunanidhi resigned from his seat immediately.\nFollowing the Demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the DMK began holding rallies and public gatherings criticising the inrentions of Kar sevaks. On 5 December 1992, Karunanidhi stated in Murasoli: \"What does Kar Seva mean? God's service? Or The service of planting the seeds of unrest?\".\n\n\nFourth term as Chief minister (1996–2001)\n\nIn 1996, he formed an alliance with the Tamil Maanila Congress, led by G.K. Moopanar, and was elected Chief Minister for the fourth time in the state. At the centre, he joined the Deve Gowda-led United Front government. Karunanidhi's party, which had only two seats in the 1991 elections got 173 MPs, nine more than the AIADMK had the year before.\nIn 1999, Karunanidhi made his most significant ideological concession. The DMK joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance to fight the elections, portraying Vajpayee as a softer ideological character than LK Advani. The National Democratic Alliance won the elections. Following the DMK's support of the BJP, the TMC, CPI(M), and CPI withdrew. The alliance with the BJP put him under increased pressure from both within and outside of the party. Following the 2002 Gujarat riots, Karunanidhi stated that both DMK and BJP were simply partners in the NDA and that the DMK had no intention of forming an alliance with the BJP. \"We are not affiliated with the BJP.\" We are members of the NDA, and so is the BJP. That's it. So, where does the matter of forming an alliance with the BJP stand?\". Later, A Raja said that Karunanidhi told him that he regretted the alliance.\nHe had to deal with caste animosity in numerous districts of Tamil Nadu throughout his tenure.\n\nIn 1996–97, Karunanidhi introduced the free bus pass system, which exempted government school and college students from paying for a ticket while giving private school and college students a 50% discount. Karunanidhi devised the Uzhavar Sandhai plan in 1999, which aims to promote farmer-to-consumer communication and remove the middleman and helped farmers gain more remuneration. He opened the Samathuvapuram (Equality Village) schemes in 145 places in Tamil Nadu in 1998 in order to forget and to eliminate caste-based segregation. His administration was credited for accelerating the IT revolution, introducing mini-buses for connectivity. Karunanidhi renamed Madras to Chennai to reflect Tamil identity. He introduced initiative which gives free education for the first graduate in a family up to their graduation. His decision to phase out hand-pulled rickshaws was enthusiastically applauded, and the rickshaw-pullers were given alternative work. He introduced the marriage assistance scheme for impoverished women. His government introduced legislation establishing 33% reservation for women in local government.\n\nHe was responsible for almost all of the state's major infrastructure projects which were implemented during this tenure including the TIDEL Park, the Coimbatore flyover, the Koyambedu bus terminal, Gemini flyover in Chennai, the rehabilitation of Poompuhar, the Anna Centenary Library, and the grade separators in Chennai and the new Secretariat complex.\n\n\nThiruvalluvar statue\n\nOn 31 December 1975, during a state cabinet meeting led by Karunanidhi, a plan was authorised to erect a statue for Thiruvalluvar at Kanyakumari. The DMK administration was dismissed a month later, and the state was placed under President's Rule. During his next term from 1989 to 1991, he resurrected the project. In March 1990, when presenting the Budget, he stated that a 133-foot-tall monument of Thiruvalluvar will be erected in Kanyakumari. He launched the project six months later. The project was restarted once he reclaimed power in May 1996. He unveiled the monument on New Year's Day, 2000.\n\n\n2001 state elections\nJayalalithaa, who was aligned with the Tamil Maanila Congress, the Congress, the Pattali Makkal Katchi, with both the communist parties, and other parties in 2001 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections received 49.89% of the vote, defeating the ruling DMK-led alliance by a large majority. Karunanidhi assumption that the DMK will be re-elected on the grounds of its government's good performance proved incorrect. His government's performance was praised by voters but it was not transferred into votes. Karunanidhi was elected from Chepauk constituency.\n\n\nLeader of the DMK (2001–2006 )\nHe served as the president of the DMK. K. Anbazhagan was made the leader of opposition.\n\n\nControversy of arrests in Tamil Nadu about construction of flyovers\n\nIn the midnight 30 June 2001, he was arrested on the orders of J. Jayalalithaa as an act of vendetta based on a First Information report over of alleged losses of ₹12 crore on construction of flyovers filed by Commissioner J. C. T. Acharyalu who Karunanidhi had earlier kept under suspension. He was arrested after a few hours after the complaint with no time for investigation. Sun TV broadcast these images live across the state, the cops stormed in, busted open his bedroom door, and hauled him out. The images of Karunanidhi falling, being dragged, being lifted up and pushed by the police created a sympathy wave for him. T R Baalu and Murasoli Maran, two Union ministers, were also detained. Karunanidhi told reporters \"They didn't have a summons. They didn't have an arrest warrant. They claimed that these were unnecessary. They dragged me. They pushed me. They ripped my shirt. We treated her with respect when we arrested her.\" Union Law Minister Arun Jaitley claimed it was a case of 'personal agenda'. The Union ministers were freed and the allegations against them were dismissed. Karunanidhi was later released on bail on humanitarian grounds. The police later dropped the case in 2006 citing it was a \"mistake of facts\".\n\n\n2004 general elections\nKarunanidhi, on the other hand, left the BJP coalition in 2004 as the Union government refused to revoke the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He stood for the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress party in the general elections, which won all 39 seats of the Parliament from Tamil Nadu.\n\n\nFifth term as Chief minister (2006–2011)\n\nOn 8 May 2006, Karunanidhi's administration became the first minority administration in Tamil Nadu's history, and soon after declared a price cut for rice and the waiver of cooperative farmer loans, two of the DMK's main electoral promises. The DMK won 96 of the 234 seats and emerged as the single-largest party in the Assembly with the alliance of CPI-M, Congress and CPI. Karunanidhi won from Chepauk constituency.\n\nKarunanidhi in January 2009 threatened to resign from the ruling alliance if India does not assist in securing a cease-fire in the Sri Lankan civil war.\nIn 2006, the DMK administration formed 30 special welfare boards entrusted with lobbying for the rights of disadvantaged and marginalised people ranging from transgenders to construction workers who may not have political influence or form voting groups and endure many forms of oppression. In 2006, Karunanidhi introduced the 'Anaithu Grama Anna Marumalarchi Thittam,' which aimed for the establishment of a library in each village panchayat. In September 2006, he implemented the free land distribution scheme for the benefit of the landless poor. Karunanidhi saw the value of the ramp as a wheelchair user. He mandated that all new government buildings, as well as existing ones, include a ramp and an elevator. He reserved 3% of government jobs for the physically challenged. He launched the free gas connection distribution scheme in mid-January 2007. In September 2008, he declared that 1 kg of rice will be offered at ₹1 at PDS stores, surpassing the campaign promise of ₹2. In 2009, he introduced a special quota of 3 per cent reservations for the Arunthathiyar community. In 2019, the Arunthathiyars started building a temple \"as a mark of thanksgiving to Kalaignar\". Karunanidhi launched the \"Kalaignar Kapitu Thitam\" in 2009 to give people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds receive quality medical treatments without discrimination. At least 3 out of 5 people in the state have medical insurance due to this scheme. In 2010, he introduced the \"Kalaignar Veetu Vasathi Thittam\" to convert thatched huts to concrete houses in the state. During this tenure he implemented the construction of new Collectorates in nine districts, many universities were established, and highways and flyovers were built. The bus terminal in Koyambedu in Chennai, which is the largest in Asia, was built. His health-care initiatives in the tenure, which included financial help for pregnant mothers, were well received by Jayalalithaa. Multiple medical camps were held around the state as part of the Varumun Kappom Thittam initiative, benefiting a huge portion of Tamil Nadu's population. Schemes were implemented to provide free color TVs to every family with ration cards and to provide gas stoves with free gas connection to the poor women who use wood stove-kerosene stove.\n\n\nLeader of the DMK (2011–2016)\n\nDuring the 2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the AIADMK alliance won 203 seats and the DMK alliance won 31. Karunanidi won by a huge margin of 50,249 votes Tiruvarur Assembly constituency. Following the defeat, M. Karunanidhi said, \"People have given me proper rest,\" before congratulating the people of the state.\nOn his 86th birthday, Karunanidhi donated his Gopalapuram home to the Annai Anjugam Trust, which would manage a free hospital for the underprivileged after his and his wife's demise.\nDuring the 2016 Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections, which the DMK lost only by 1.5 per cent votes. Karunanidhi won from Tiruvarur constituency with margin of 68,366 votes thereby recording his 13th straight victory since 1957.\nIn 2013, Karunanidhi announced his younger son M. K. Stalin was his successor, confirmed in 2016.\n\n\nPolitical positions\n\n\nSri Lankan Tamil issue\n\nKarunanidhi was known among his supporters as the \"Tamil Inaththalaivar\" (transl. leader of the Tamil race) He was close to numerous Sri Lankan Tamil politicians. In 1956, Karunanidhi issued a resolution at the DMK council in Chidambaram denouncing Sri Lanka's 'Sinhala Only policy'. He was acquainted with S.J.V. Chelvanayakam and was close with A. Amirthalingam, the head of the Tamil United Liberation Front. After 1977 anti-Tamil pogrom and 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, his administration was at the forefront of organising protest demonstrations in Tamil Nadu. In protest at the 1983 riots, Karunanidhi and DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan resigned from the State Assembly.\nThe DMK was thought to support the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO). After the LTTE started a war against its fellow Tamil militant group TELO in May 1986, Karunanidhi was sceptical of the LTTE's strategy. Karunanidhi founded the Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation (TESO) and held a large national conference in Madurai in May 1986 to emphasise the Tamil aspiration for sovereignty in Sri Lanka, during which he urged the LTTE to cease murdering TELO cadre. The LTTE then proceeded to kill the majority of the TELO cadres. The infighting was criticised by Karunanidhi as Sagodhara Yudham' (A Battle Between Brothers). Since the AIADMK and MGR were prepared to support the LTTE as the only representation of Sri Lankan Tamils, his constant attempts to convey the necessity for an unified front to the LTTE were ignored. Karunanidhi was a vocal opponent of the decision to send Indian peace keeping forces (IPKF) to Sri Lanka as part of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, and he was accused of being anti-national for his outspoken criticism of the atrocities perpetrated by the IPKF. He viewed the expulsion of Muslims from the North by the LTTE in 1990 as \"ethnic cleansing.\" His inaction against the LTTE in the state finally led to the Chandrasekhar government dismissing his cabinet in January 1991. After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by LTTE he was not friendly with the overt LTTE sympathizers in the state.\nHe ordered a special investigation of the conditions in the Tamil refugee camps in 2006, and subsequently provided funds to repair deteriorating dwellings. In 2009, during the final stages of the war, Karunanidhi was unable to convince the UPA alliance to intervene.\n\n\nTamil language\nKarunanidhi on multiple occasions, expressed his admiration for Thiruvalluvar. The DMK administration built Valluvar Kottam, a memorial in Chennai dedicated to Valluvar in the mid-1970s. However, the government was removed from power in 1976, just weeks before the memorial was to be opened. Karunanidhi awaited 13 years to visit the memorial, and when the DMK regained power in January 1989, he held the swearing-in ceremony there. Karunanidhi built the Silappadikaram Art Gallery in Poompuhar and a special department for Tamil development as Chief Minister. His administration passed an order making Tamil obligatory in all schools until Class X a few weeks after he became Chief Minister in May 2006. Karunanidhi, a supporter of the two-language formula, had stressed the need of retaining English as the sole additional language in educational institutions. After consulting with scholars, his government determined in 1972 that Thiruvalluvar was born in 31 BCE. Karunanidhi and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi were vital in ensuring classical language status to Tamil in 2004.\n\n\nWorld Tamil Conference\n\nHe delivered the special address on the inaugural day of 3rd World Tamil Conference held in Paris in 1970, and also on the inaugural day of 6th World Tamil Conference held in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) in 1987. He penned the song \"Semmozhiyaana Tamizh Mozhiyaam\", the official theme song for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010, that was set to tune by A. R. Rahman.\nIn June 2010, his administration organised the World Classical Tamil Conference in Coimbatore. 'Ulaga Tamizh Manadu' (World Tamil Conference), was the first coined word for the conference in 2010, however the IATR organisation that had right to conduct the conference was not happy hence change in name. In the conference, Karunanidhi described Tamil as supreme among all classical languages. He reinforced the demand for Tamil to be recognised as a language of the Madras High Court. Karunanidhi announced the foundation of the World Tholkappiyar Classical Tamil Sangam, that would include worldwide academics and will be based in Madurai, to hold World Classical Tamil Conferences at periodic intervals in the future. and to bring dispersed Tamil research centres and develop connections with Tamil organisations throughout the world.\n\n\nScreenwriting\n\n \n\nKarunanidhi began his career as a screenwriter in the Tamil film industry. His first movie as screenwriter was Rajakumari produced by Coimbatore-based Jupiter Pictures directed by A. S. A. Sami starring M. G. Ramachandran. During this period he and M. G. Ramachandran, then an upcoming actor and later day founder of AIADMK party started a long friendship eventually turning into rivals in later years politics. His stint with Jupiters Pictures then housed at Central Studios continued for another MGR starrer Abhimanyu, Marudhanaattu Ilavarasi (1950) starring M. G. Ramachandran and V. N. Janaki.\nAround late 1949, T. R. Sundaram of Modern Theatres Studio in Salem engaged Karunanidhi as scriptwriter for the film Manthiri Kumari starring M. G. Ramachandran which would become be a blockbuster hit. Later T. R. Sundaram had Karunanidhi on permanent rolls at Modern Studio.\nKarunanidhi chose to pen a script for a TV series based on the Vaishnavite philosopher-sage Ramanuja. He claimed that his party opposed Hindu fundamentalism, not Hindus.\n\n\nParasakthi\nHis most notable movie was Parasakthi, a turning point in Tamil cinema, as it espoused the ideologies of the Dravidian movement and also introduced two prominent actors of Tamil filmdom, Sivaji Ganesan and S. S. Rajendran. The movie was initially marred with controversies and faced censorship troubles, but was eventually released in 1952. becoming a huge box office hit. The movie was opposed by orthodox Hindus since it contained elements that criticised Hinduism. The story contained condemnation of Tamil Nadu's severe social disparities, India's power difference between South and the North, and the moral corruption of the Hindu priestly caste. Upper caste Hindus sought to ban the movie.\nTwo other movies that contained such messages were Panam (1952) directed by famous comedian and political activist N. S. Krishnan and Thangarathinam (1960) produced and acted by S. S. Rajendran another popular actor and DMK activist. These movies contained themes such as widow remarriage, abolition of untouchability, self-respect marriages, abolition of zamindari and abolition of religious hypocrisy. Another memorable hit movie was Manohara (1954) starring Sivaji Ganesan, S. S. Rajendran and P. Kannamba known for its crisp dialogues.\n\n\nWriting and narration style\nThrough his wit and oratorical skills he rapidly rose as a popular politician. As his movies and plays with strong social messages became popular, they suffered from increased censorship; two of his plays in the 1950s were banned. He was famous for writing historical and social (reformist) stories which propagated the socialist and rationalist ideals of the Dravidian movement to which he belonged. Alongside C. N. Annadurai he began using Tamil cinema to propagate his political ideals through his movies. His compositions, which often chastised upper castes while it making heroes out of the poor and advocating secularism, were seen as revolutionary.\n\n\nFilmography\nAt the age of 20, Karunanidhi went to work for Jupiter Pictures as a scriptwriter. His first film, Rajakumaari, gained him much popularity. It was here that his skills as a scriptwriter were honed, which extended to several films. He was active in screenwriting even during his later political career until 2011 when he last wrote for historic movie Ponnar Shankar.\n\n\nAs a scriptwriter\n\n\nTelevision\nRomapuri Pandian (Kalaignar TV)\nRamanujar (Kalaignar TV)\n\n\nLyrics\n\n\nLiterature\nKarunanidhi is known for his contributions to Tamil literature. His contributions cover a wide range: poems, letters, screenplays, novels, biographies, historical novels, stage-plays, dialogues and movie songs. He has written Kuraloviam for Thirukural, Tholkaappiya Poonga, Poombukar, as well as many poems, essays and books. Apart from literature, Karunanidhi has also contributed to the Tamil language through art and architecture. Like the Kuraloviyam, in which Kalaignar wrote about Thirukkural, through the construction of Valluvar Kottam he gave an architectural presence to Thiruvalluvar, in Chennai. At Kanyakumari, Karunanidhi constructed a 133-foot-high statue of Thiruvalluvar in honour of the scholar.\n\n\nBooks\nThe books written by Karunanidhi include Sanga Thamizh, Thirukkural Urai, Ponnar Sankar, Romapuri Pandian, Thenpandi Singam, Vellikizhamai, Nenjukku Needhi, Iniyavai Irubathu and Kuraloviam. His books of prose and poetry number more than 100.\n\n\nStage plays\nKarunanidhi's stage plays include: Manimagudam, Ore Ratham, Palaniappan, Thooku Medai, Kagithapoo, Naane Arivali, Vellikizhamai, Udhayasooriyan and Silappathikaram.\n\n\nPersonal life\nKarunanidhi married three times. Karunanidhi's parents were eager to marry him off to Padma, the sister of C. S. Jayaraman. He made one condition that the bride side must accept a reformist wedding. He hoped they would call off the marriage as he was not earning and the bride's father was religious but their family agreed to their marriage also held the marriage of their son C.S Jayaraman the same day. He married Padmavathi Ammal on 13 September 1944, under the Dravidian movement's Self-Respect form of marriage where the bride and groom exchanged garlands, without a thaali (mangalsutra), and specifically without Brahmin priests presiding. They had a son M. K. Muthu, who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was arranged with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, M. K. Alagiri, M. K. Stalin and M. K. Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M. K. Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too. With his third marriage with Rajathi Ammal, Karunanidhi had a daughter, Kanimozhi.\nKarunanidhi's left eye got critically injured in 1953 when the vehicle in which he was travelling got involved in an accident near Tirupattur. An eye surgery was performed and doctors recommended him to wear sunglasses to protect his eyes from the sun. Karunanidhi used regular spectacles. However, after following American ophthalmologists recommendation for his ongoing discomfort in his left eye, which he had been suffering from since the mid-1950s, he switched to his trade-mark dark glasses in 1971. Doctors determined that the dark glass frames were too hefty for him in November 2017 and advised a lighter frame.\nSince 2004, he has had to deal with his deteriorating health and struggled to stand when a spinal operation went wrong and became wheelchair-dependent. After a few years, he upgraded to a motorised wheelchair and a customised van with a hydraulic system to raise the chair into or out of the vehicle easily.\n\n\nIllness, death and reactions\n\nDue to a drug-induced allergy, Karunanidhi became unwell in October 2016. He was hospitalised in the first week of December 2016 for \"optimization of nutrition and hydration\" and subsequently for a throat and lung infections. He went through a tracheostomy surgery to improve his breathing. He has stayed out of politics since then, making just a few public appearances. His last public appearance was on 3 June 2018, when he turned 94.\nOn 28 July 2018, Karunanidhi's health deteriorated and became \"extremely critical and unstable\", and he was admitted at Kauvery Hospital in Chennai for treatment. He died there at 18:10 on 7 August 2018 due to age-related illness, which led to multiple organ failure.\nThe government of Tamil Nadu declared a public holiday on 8 August 2018 and a seven-day mourning after Karunanidhi's death. He was accorded a state funeral. A national mourning on 8 August 2018 was announced by the government of India. The national flag flew half-mast in Delhi, all state capitals and across Tamil Nadu on 8 August 2018. The governments of Karnataka and Bihar announced one-day and two-days state mourning respectively.\nOn 18 August 2018, the DMK said that as many as 248 party workers died, 'shocked' by Karunanidhi's demise, and announced a solatium of ₹2 lakh to their families.\n\n\nAwards and titles\nAnnamalai University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1971.\nHe was awarded \"Raja Rajan Award\" by Tamil University, Thanjavur for his book Thenpandi Singam.\nOn 15 December 2006, the Governor of Tamil Nadu and the Chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University, Surjit Singh Barnala conferred an honorary doctorate on the Chief Minister on the occasion of the 40th annual convocation.\nIn June 2007, the Tamil Nadu Muslim Makkal Katchi announced that it would confer the title \"Friend of the Muslim Community\" (Yaaran-E-Millath) upon M. Karunanidhi.\n\n\nElections contested and positions held\nKarunanidhi contested and won in all Tamil Nadu Assembly general elections (then Madras) since 1957 except 1984 when he didn't contest the election. He resigned immediately after being elected in 1991, due to the routing of his party (only 2 seats out of 234).\n\n\nControversies\n\n\nRam Setu remarks\nIn September 2007, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposed Sethusamudram Canal project stating that it will demolish limestone shoals the party claimed to be remains of a bridge built by Rama to get to Lanka to save his wife Sita. He replied, \"It is said that there was a God thousands of years ago called Ram. Do not touch the bridge built by him. I ask who is this Ram? Which engineering college did he graduate from?\" BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad accused Karunanidhi of religious discrimination when noting \"We would like to know from Karunanidhi if he would make a similar statement against the head of any other religion.\" CPM general secretary Prakash Karat came to his support and said \"in this country, there are individuals with religious views and people like us. It is not wrong to voice an opinion\". Later, Karunanidhi clarified his remarks by saying that \"I'm not against Ram, my conscience is my God\".\nSuspected Sangh Parivar activists attacked the house of Karunanidhi's daughter Selvi in Bangalore with petrol bombs and stones over his comments. A bus bound to Chennai was set on fire in Bangalore by a mob which burnt alive two people. The police blamed the attack on Hindu activists who were enraged over his comments. Karunanidhi said the attacks showed the \"true culture of Ram Sevaks.\"\n\n\nConnections with LTTE\nIn an April 2009 interview to NDTV, Karunanidhi made a controversial remark stating that \"Prabhakaran is my good friend\" and also said, \"India could not forgive the LTTE for assassinating Rajiv Gandhi\". An interim report of Justice Jain Commission, which oversaw the investigation into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, had indicted Karunanidhi for abetting Rajiv Gandhi's murderers, who belonged to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). but the final report contained no such allegations.\n\n\nAllegations of nepotism\nKarunanidhi has been accused by opponents, by some members of his party, and by other political observers of trying to promote nepotism. Many political opponents and DMK party senior leaders have been critical of the rise of M. K. Stalin in the party. But some of the party men have pointed out that Stalin has come up on his own. Stalin was jailed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during the Emergency that a fellow DMK party prisoner died trying to save him.\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nSee also\nList of political families\nList of Indian writers\nKarunanidhi family\nFirst Karunanidhi ministry\nSecond Karunanidhi ministry\nThird Karunanidhi ministry\nFourth Karunanidhi ministry\nFifth Karunanidhi ministry\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nGuneratne, Anthony R.; Wimal Dissanayake; Sumita S.

    "summary": "Muthuvel Karunanidhi (3 June 1924 – 7 August 2018), popularly known as Kalaignar (Artist), was an Indian writer and politician who served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for almost two decades over five terms between 1969 and 2011. He had the longest intermittent tenure as Chief Minister with 6,863 days in office. He was also a long-standing leader of the Dravidian movement and ten-time president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam political party. Karunanidhi has the record of never losing an election to the Tamil Nadu Assembly, having won 13 times since his first victory in 1957. Before entering politics, he worked in the Tamil film industry as a screenwriter. He also made contributions to Tamil literature, having written stories, plays, novels, and a multiple-volume memoir. As such, he is also referred to as Mutthamizh Arignar (Tamil Scholar) for his contributions to Tamil literature. Dravida Kazhagam prominent leader Pattukkottai Alagiri conferred the title Kalaignar on him during \"Thookumedi\" drama. Karunanidhi died on 7 August 2018 at Kauvery Hospital in Chennai after a series of prolonged, age-related illnesses.\nKarunanidhi was born in the Tamil Nadu village of Thirukkuvalai on 3 June 1924. His parents were from the Isai Vellalar community, a caste of musicians that perform at temples and other social gatherings. Growing up in a caste-ridden culture, Karunanidhi was learned about the crippling circumstances that arose from being born into a low caste. When he was 14, he formed a student movement against the imposition of Hindi as India's National Language during the Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937–40. This served as a forerunner to Karunanidhi's wider anti-Hindi demonstrations in 1965. As a high school student, Karunanidhi created the Tamil Nadu Tamil Manavar Mandram, the Dravidian movement's first student wing. He also started a news paper during his school days, which grew into the Murasoli, the DMK's official publication. Karunanidhi began participating in theatrical productions at a young age, including composing plays. Later on, he started writing for movies. As a writer, he wrote screenplays, historical novels, screenplays, biographies, poems and novels. He utilised his writing to propagate reformist ideals effectively. He wrote the script and dialogue for M. G. Ramachandran's maiden film as a hero, Rajakumari. He also composed the dialogue for Sivaji Ganesan's debut film, Parasakthi. He was critical of organised religion and superstition. He was an atheist and a self-described rationalist.\nKarunanidhi started his political career in 1957, when he was voted to the Madras state legislature. When the DMK first entered the state legislature the following year, he was named treasurer and deputy leader of the opposition. Karunanidhi ascended quickly through the ranks. After the death of C.N. Annadurai in 1969, he became the DMK's leader and Chief minister of Tamil Nadu and led the party to a landslide win in the 1971 Assembly elections. He was influenced by the rationalist and egalitarian ideology of Periyar and DMK founder C N Annadurai. Karunanidhi was among those who fought Indira Gandhi's Emergency in 1975 which led to governments getting dismissed in 1976. In the 1976 Assembly elections, he gave the Congress 50 per cent of the seats, but the partnership fell apart, and MGR prevailed. After MGR's death in 1989, he led the party to power. His administration was dismissed in 1991 for its alleged links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He came to power in the state in 1996 after forming a partnership with the Tamil Maanila Congress and joined the United Front led by Deve Gowda in the centre. His party allied with the BJP in 1999. He was arrested from his house in 2001 by the police on the orders of Jayalalithaa as an act of vendetta over alleged losses in construction of fly-overs. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, he teamed up with the Congress and won by a landslide. He became a chief minister again in 2006. In April 2009, then-Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi held a six-hour hunger strike to demand a ceasefire in the Sri Lankan civil war. The controversial fast was widely seen as a political move to gain electoral support for the DMK, particularly since it was held just before the general elections. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he contested alone and lost. In 2016, he made his son Stalin as leader of opposition for the DMK become the Tamil Nadu Assembly's biggest opposition party.\nDuring his political career, Karunanidhi advocated for increased state autonomy and affirmative action to favour lower castes. He implemented a caste-based quota system for government employment and government school students, as well as subsidies to the poor. His initiatives were quickly adopted in other Indian states. His initiatives earned him popularity among the lower castes. He was frequently confronted with accusations of nepotism. He has also stirred controversies by publicly supporting the LTTE and other separatist groups in Sri Lanka. During his different tenures, he implemented a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the expansion of industry in the state. He was also instrumental in erecting a 133-foot monument of Thiruvalluvar in Kanyakumari and ensuring classical language status to Tamil language.",

It is located on Bayshore Drive, west of U.S. 19, a mile south of I-275. On August 12, 1970, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is also a Florida State Park.\nThe 10-acre (0.040 km2) site was the first Native American location in Florida to be designated as a State Archaeological Site.\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological excavations have established that indigenous occupation reaches back 2,000 years, and across three distinct periods: Manasota, Weedon Island, and Safety Harbor cultures. The people constructed a massive earthwork temple/ceremonial mound from shells, sand and detritus.  It is still 20-foot (6.1 m) high, with a base nearly 100 by 170 feet (52 m).\nScholars believe that the mound site continued to be of great ceremonial importance to the historic Tocobaga Indians of the surrounding area, who coalesced as a people before European encounter in the late sixteenth century. They survived into the eighteenth century but disappeared as a tribe due to infectious diseases and warfare.\nThe site is named for Madira Bickel of Sarasota. She and her husband, Karl, purchased the land around the main mound and donated it to the state in 1948.\n\n\nThe mounds\nThe point of greatest interest at the site is the 20-foot (6.1 m) high temple/ceremonial mound. Composed of shells (obtained from a midden to the west), sand, and detritus, the mound's base is 100 feet (30 m) by 170 feet (52 m). To more easily reach the top, the Tocobaga constructed a curved 10-foot (3.0 m) wide ramp on the western side.\nThe state park has graduated stairways for access, and at the top, has cleared an area (protected by a fence) for overlooking the park. Over the centuries, the mound has become covered with vegetation, including tall trees.\nAlso in the park are the remains of the Prine Burial Mound, which is circular, about 40 feet (12 m) wide, and about 2 feet (0.61 m) high at the center. It was used through the three major archaeological cultures described above, from 800-1500 AD. Since settlement and development, much of the mound's contents have been disturbed.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMadira Bickel Mounds State Archaeological Site at Florida State Parks\nManatee County listings,  Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs\n\"Madira Bickel Temple Mound Site\", School District of Manatee County\nMadira Bickel Mound Photograph Gallery, Florida Center for Instructional Technology, University of South Florida",

    "text": "Baron Farnham, of Farnham in the County of Cavan, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1756 for John Maxwell, who had previously represented Cavan Borough in the Irish House of Commons. John Maxwell's son, the second Baron, was created Viscount Farnham in 1760 and Earl of Farnham in 1763. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland but became extinct when he died childless in 1779. His brother and successor, the third Baron, was again created Viscount Farnham in 1781 and Earl of Farnham in 1785. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. His son, the second Earl, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1816 to 1823. However, he had no children and on his death in 1823 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct.\nHe was succeeded in the barony by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the eldest son of The Rt Rev. and Hon. Henry Maxwell, Lord Bishop of Meath, third son of the first Baron. Lord Farnham sat as a Member of Parliament for County Cavan and was an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1825 to 1838. His nephew, the seventh Baron (who succeeded his father in 1838), also represented County Cavan in the House of Commons and served as an Irish Representative Peer between 1839 and 1868. Lord Farnham and his wife were killed in the Abergele train disaster of 1868. The title then passed to his younger brother, the eighth Baron, who had earlier represented County Cavan in Parliament. He was succeeded by another brother, the ninth Baron, who also sat as a Member of Parliament for County Cavan. In 1885 he succeeded a distant relative as eleventh Baronet of Calderwood. On his death, the titles passed to his nephew, the tenth Baron. He served as Lord Lieutenant of County Cavan and was briefly an Irish Representative Peer from 1898 until his early death in 1900. His son, the eleventh Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1908 to 1957. As of 2014 the titles are held by his grandson, the thirteenth Baron, who succeeded his elder brother in 2001. Lord Farnham is the son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Somerset Arthur Maxwell. He lives in Oxfordshire in Great Britain.\n\nThe Maxwell baronetcy of Calderwood was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1627 for Sir James Maxwell (died c. 1670). The 2nd baronet died without issue, and was succeeded by a son of Colonel John Maxwell who died in Dunbar in 1650. The 6th baronet also died without issue, and was succeeded by the son of Alexander Maxwell of Leith, third son of 4th baronet. This line too failed, when his grandson, the tenth Baronet died in 1885. The next holder was the aforementioned 9th Baron, who succeeded as eleventh Baronet. The title passed to the 10th Baron and continued to his descendants.\nThe Farnhams are remembered in the name of one of the main streets in Cavan town, Farnham Street, as well as in the name of a hotel, The Farnham Arms, which has the family crest with inscription Je suis pret (I am ready) above the door.\nThe family seat was Farnham House, near Cavan, County Cavan.\n\n\nBarons Farnham (1756)\nJohn Maxwell, 1st Baron Farnham (died 1759)\nRobert Maxwell, 2nd Baron Farnham (died 1779) (created Earl of Farnham in 1763)\n\n\nEarls of Farnham, first creation (1763)\nRobert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham, 2nd Baron Farnham (died 1779)\n\n\nBarons Farnham (1756; reverted)\nBarry Maxwell, 3rd Baron Farnham (died 1800) (created Earl of Farnham in 1785)\n\n\nEarls of Farnham, second creation (1785)\nBarry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham (died 1800)\nJohn James Maxwell, 2nd Earl of Farnham (1760–1823)\n\n\nBarons Farnham (1756; reverted)\nJohn Maxwell-Barry, 5th Baron Farnham (1767–1838)\nHenry Maxwell, 6th Baron Farnham (1774–1838)\nHenry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham (1799–1868)\nSomerset Richard Maxwell, 8th Baron Farnham (1803–1884)\nJames Pierce Maxwell, 9th Baron Farnham (1813–1896)\nSomerset Henry Maxwell, 10th Baron Farnham (1849–1900)\nArthur Kenlis Maxwell, 11th Baron Farnham (1879–1957)\nBarry Owen Somerset Maxwell, 12th Baron Farnham (1931–2001)\nSimon Kenlis Maxwell, 13th Baron Farnham (born 1933)\nThe heir apparent is the present holder's son, Hon.

    "summary": "Baron Farnham, of Farnham in the County of Cavan, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1756 for John Maxwell, who had previously represented Cavan Borough in the Irish House of Commons. John Maxwell's son, the second Baron, was created Viscount Farnham in 1760 and Earl of Farnham in 1763. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland but became extinct when he died childless in 1779. His brother and successor, the third Baron, was again created Viscount Farnham in 1781 and Earl of Farnham in 1785. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. His son, the second Earl, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1816 to 1823. However, he had no children and on his death in 1823 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct.\nHe was succeeded in the barony by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the eldest son of The Rt Rev. and Hon. Henry Maxwell, Lord Bishop of Meath, third son of the first Baron. Lord Farnham sat as a Member of Parliament for County Cavan and was an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1825 to 1838. His nephew, the seventh Baron (who succeeded his father in 1838), also represented County Cavan in the House of Commons and served as an Irish Representative Peer between 1839 and 1868. Lord Farnham and his wife were killed in the Abergele train disaster of 1868. The title then passed to his younger brother, the eighth Baron, who had earlier represented County Cavan in Parliament.

    "text": "Forty Guns is a 1957 American Western film starring Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan and Gene Barry. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller, the independent black-and-white picture was filmed in CinemaScope and released by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\nPlot\nIn the 1880s, Griff Bonnell, and his brothers, Wes and Chico, arrive in the town of Tombstone in Cochise County, Arizona. Griff is a reformed gunslinger, now working for the Attorney General's office, looking to arrest Howard Swain for mail robbery.\nSwain is one of landowner Jessica Drummond's forty hired guns. She runs the territory with an iron fist, allowing the town to be terrorized and trashed by her brother, Brockie Drummond, and his boys. Brockie is an arrogant drunk and bully, but he goes too far by shooting vision-impaired town Marshal Chisolm in the leg. Brockie and his drunken friends then start trashing the town.\nGriff intervenes and pistol-whips Brockie with a single blow while Wes covers him with a rifle from the gunsmith shop. Trying to avoid unnecessary killing, Griff makes it a point not to crack Brockie's skull. Jessica delivered Brockie when their mother gave birth for the last time.\nWes falls in love with Louvenie Spanger, the daughter of the town gunsmith, so he decides to settle down and become the town's marshal. Griff becomes romantically involved with Jessica after she is dragged by a horse during a tornado.\nTwo of Jessica's forty dragoons, Logan and Savage, attempt to ambush Griff in an alley. He is saved by youngest brother Chico, who was supposed to be leaving for California for a new life on a farm. Chico's shot kills Savage, after which Jessica's brother and hired guns try to turn the town against the Bonnell brothers.\nOn his wedding day, Wes is gunned down by Brockie, who misses Griff when he leans forward to kiss the bride. Brockie is jailed for the murder. Jessica spends every dime she has and pulls every string she can to save him, but he is sentenced to hang.\nWhile she accepts his fate, he tries to escape by using her as a shield, daring Griff to shoot, and is shocked when Griff does so. Griff's expertly-placed bullet merely wounds Jessica, and the cowardly Brockie then becomes the first man Griff has had to kill in ten years.\nChico remains behind to take the marshal's job. Griff departs for California, certain that Jessica hates him for killing her brother, but she runs after his buckboard calling his name. They ride off together.\n\n\nCast\nBarbara Stanwyck as Jessica Drummond\nBarry Sullivan as Griff Bonnell\nGene Barry as Wes Bonnell\nRobert Dix as Chico Bonnell\nDean Jagger as Sherriff Ned Logan\nJohn Ericson as Brockie Drummond\nHank Worden as Marshal John Chisholm\nJidge Carroll as Barney Cashman\nPaul Dubov as Judge Macy\nGerald Milton as Shotgun Spanger\nZiva Rodann as Rio\nNeyle Morrow as Wiley\nChuck Roberson as Howard Swain\nChuck Hayward as Charlie Savage\nSandy Wirth as Chico's Girlfriend\nEve Brent as Louvenia Spanger\n\n\nProduction\nDuring pre-production the title of the film was Woman With A Whip. Fuller uses every opportunity to show off the widescreen format while employing extensive use of close-ups and one of the longest tracking shots ever done at Fox's studio at that time – over five minutes long.\nHarry Sukman composed and conducted the score. Jidge Carroll sings two songs onscreen in the film, the theme song titled \"High Ridin' Woman,\" written by Harold Adamson and Harry Sukman; and \"God Has His Arms Around Me,\" written by Victor Young and Harold Adamson. Both songs were later recorded by the western singing group, The Sons of the Pioneers, and released on their single for RCA (RCA 47-7079) on November 1, 1957.\nFuller later repeatedly claimed that the ending he wanted involved Griff killing Jessica to get Brockie and the studio overruled him.  The available script copies, written by Fuller, have the same ending as the film.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nThe film has received critical acclaim from modern day critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 86% based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 7.9/10.\nJonathan Rosenbaum hailed it in 2007 as \"probably the best and craziest\" of Fuller's westerns, \"the feature that fully announces his talent as an avant-garde filmmaker, even in this unlikeliest of genres...if you've ever wondered why Godard and other French New Wave directors deify Fuller, this movie explains it all.\" Richard Brody also championed the film, writing that \"Fuller's hardboiled 1957 Western serves up doomed love and sudden death with dramatic richness...in Fuller's progressive view, the closing frontier made the hired gun obsolete. Despite the poetic bursts of violence in Fuller's signature shock images, the hero knows that the land will soon belong to the sedate townsfolk on whose behalf he honorably plies his loathsome trade.\"\n\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1957\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nForty Guns at IMDb\nForty Guns at AllMovie\nForty Guns at the TCM Movie Database\nForty Guns at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nForty Guns at Rotten Tomatoes\nForty Guns: High-Riding Woman an essay by Lisa Dombrowski at the Criterion Collection",

    "text": "Joanne \"Joltin' Jo\" Weaver (December 19, 1935 – March 19, 2000) was a right fielder who played from 1951 through 1954 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 142 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\n\n\nOverview profile\nOne of the most talented hitters in AAGPBL history, Joanne Weaver was the youngest of three sisters to play for the Fort Wayne Daisies in the final years of the league. Weaver often outdid her renowned sister, Betty, as a power hitter, winning three consecutive batting titles and setting several all-time records. At this point, the Weaver-Foss duet led the AAGPBL in most major offensive categories between 1952 and 1954. A three-time All-Star, Weaver earned Player of the Year honors in 1954, when she hit a .429 average to set an AAGPBL single-season record. Besides this, her .429 mark was the highest Professional American Baseball batting average collected by any player in a single season in a minimum of 300 at-bat appearances.\n\n\nEarly life\nA native of Metropolis, Illinois, Joanne Weaver was the daughter of minor league pitcher Lloyd Weaver and Elsie (Dummeier) Weaver. At the age of 11, she began playing softball with her sisters Betty and Jean. Their father tried to get them to play on a local boys' baseball team, with little success, until he managed to insert them into the Magnavox team of the Chicago industrial league, a successful fastpitch softball squad in which they finally started to play regularly. In 1950, Betty rejected a contract offer from the Chicago White Sox minor league system and opted to sign with the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Betty was allocated to the Fort Wayne Daisies and her sisters joined her on the team a year later.\n\n\nAAGPBL career\nJoanne Weaver debuted at third base with the Daisies in the 1951 season. She hit .276 in 53 games, showing a smooth, quick swing with good speed and above average base running instincts. Her fielding was the only skill lacking. Meanwhile, her sister Betty won batting titles in back-to-back seasons in 1950 and 1951, helping Fort Wayne to make the playoffs in these years.\nWeaver's performance exploded in her second season. After moving to right field in 1952, she led all hitters with a .344 average, surpassing her sister Betty (.331), who led five offensive categories and earned the Player of the Year Award, while Joanne did not rank high in any other category. Both sisters were selected for the All-Star Team and helped Fort Wayne advance to the playoffs.\nWeaver improved her fielding considerably in 1953, when she finished the year with a .952 average. Her hitting stayed about the same, which was good enough to win another batting title with a .346 average, ending second to Betty in total bases (187) and hits (142, two behind). Joanne also finished third in runs (79), stolen bases (70), and runs batted in (76). Fort Wayne added another playoff trip, and she made the All-Star Team again.\nDuring the 1954 midseason the AAGPBL reduced the ball from 10.00 inches to the major league size, around 9.00 inches. The league also extended pitching distance from 56 feet to 60 feet and base paths from 75 feet to 85 feet. As a result, Joanne earned the Player of the Year Award and made the All-Star Team for the third consecutive year after setting season-records with 29 home runs and 254 total bases, while leading the league in hits (143), runs (109) and stolen bases (79).  She finished second in doubles (16) and triples (4), and joined Eleanor Callow as the only players in the league's history to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases during a regular season. Weaver also hit a league-leading .429, which remains the highest professional baseball batting average posted in the 20th century.\nThe Fort Wayne Daisies advanced to the best-of-five game Championship Series. Previously in the playoffs, the Kalamazoo Lassies dispatched the South Bend Blue Sox in three games and Fort Wayne did the same with the Grand Rapids Chicks.\n\n\n1954 Championship Title\nIn Game 1 of the AAGPBL Series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies 17–9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from June Peppas, who also helped herself by hitting 2-for-4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben and Fern Shollenberger also slugged one each, while Chris Ballingall added a grand slam. Katie Horstman connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause and Joanne Weaver slugged one. Pitching star Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18–7 record with a 3.23 ERA during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss.\nThe Daisies evened the Series against the Lassies by winning Game 2, 11–4, after hitting five home runs off two pitchers. Horstman started the feat with a two-run home run to open the score in the first inning. In the rest of the game, Betty added two homers with five RBI, while Joanne and Jean Geissinger added solo shots. Nancy Mudge and Dorothy Schroeder homered for Kalamazoo, while Peppas, who played first base, hit a solo homer in three at-bats.\nIn Game 3, the Daisies defeated the Lassies, 8–7, fueled again by a heavy hitting performance by Joanne Weaver, who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at bats, driving in four runs. Peppas went 1-for-4 to spark a seventh inning three-run rally, but Fort Wayne came back in the bottom of the inning with two runs that marked the difference. Cordes relieved with the bases loaded in the seventh inning, but did not allow any damage for the remainder of the game.  \nIn another close score, the Lassies evened the Series in Game 4 with a victory over the Daisies, 6–5. Cordes started again with her team against the wall, 2-to-1. This time properly warmed up, she hurled a complete game, allowing five runs on nine hits. Habben drove in two runs which marked the difference, while Kline suffered her second loss of the Series. Peppas contributed with a single, a double and one RBI in four at-bats.\nIn decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3-for-5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by an 8–5 margin to give the Lassies the Championship title in the AAGPBL's last ever game. She received support from Balingall (3-for-4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run in the bottom of the eighth. Peppas finished with a .450 average and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in the league's history.\nThe sisters Foss-Weaver were able to win the final five batting championships of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League and two Player of the Year awards. With Helen Callaghan winning the batting title in 1945, the Fort Wayne Daisies amassed six batting crowns to set a league record. But while Fort Wayne made the playoffs in the last seven seasons of the league, the team struggled in the post-season and never won a Championship Title. In 1952 and 1953, the Daisies were knocked out in the first round after posting the best regular-season record.\n\n\nBill Allington All-Stars\nOnce the league disbanded in 1954, Joanne Weaver was one of eleven players selected by former Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans. The Allington All-Stars played 100 games between 1954 and 1958, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Weaver, the All-Americans included her sister Betty Foss, Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Jean Geissinger, Mary Froning, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Magdalen Redman, Ruth Richard, Jean Smith, Dorothy Schroeder and Dolly Vanderlip, among others.\n\n\nLife after baseball\nFollowing her baseball career, Joanne Weaver lived in Fort Wayne, Indiana for more than 30 years. In November 1988, the Weaver sisters received recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York dedicated a permanent display to the entire league rather than any individual player.\nIn 1990 Joanne moved back to her hometown of Metropolis, Illinois, to be with her parents. Betty returned in 1994 while Jean moved back in 1995, allowing the three Weaver sisters to see each other every day. Betty died in 1998, at the age of 68, following complications related to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). Joanne died in 2000 at age 64 of the same disease that claimed her sister. Eight years later, Jean died at age 74.\nWeaver was honored by Major League Baseball when the league named a conference room in her honor at its headquarters in New York in 2020.\n\n\nCareer statistics\nBatting \n\nFielding\n\n\nSources",

Its product portfolio offers different technologies and applications for the bread, biscuit, confectionery, snack, and breakfast cereal sectors. \nAlongside its facilities in the United Kingdom, the company operates another location in Michigan in the United States.\nBaker Perkins was founded in 1918 through the merger of Joseph Baker & Sons Ltd and Perkins Engineers Ltd, and later bought by the dairy and liquid food specialist APV which helped it grow internationally. The company regained independence in 2006 with its acquisition by private investors.\nSince November 2020, Baker Perkins is part of the Schenck Process Group, an international engineering company based in Germany.\n\n\nHistory\nThe company has its origins with the inventors Jacob Perkins (1766–1849) and Joseph Baker, both immigrants from America.\nJacob Perkins\nAfter moving from Massachusetts to England in 1819, Perkins son Angier March Perkins (1799–1881) founded the firm of A. M. Perkins & Co Ltd to manufacture the inventions of his father, such as a steam oven for baking bread. In 1893, the company merged with the London business Werner & Pfleiderer to form Werner, Pfleiderer & Perkins Ltd and later relocated their manufacturing from London to Westwood, Peterborough in 1904. Bowing to pressure over its German-sounding name, the company renamed to Perkins Engineers Ltd in 1914. During World War I, the company produced a range of armaments including  Ricardo engines for Mark IV tanks.  \nJoseph Baker\nJoseph Baker first established his business Joseph Baker & Sons in Ontario, Canada, where he invented and produced a combined flour scoop and sifter that proved to be successful among Victorian housewives. In the 1870s, Baker decided to test the market in England where he gained fast success. His decision helped the business grow as a supplier of machinery to bakery, biscuit, chocolate and confectionery industries and established it as a serious exporter and manufacturer of food machinery in the UK, directly competing with Perkins Engineers Ltd.\nBaker Perkins\nDuring World War I, both companies collaborated on automatic baking equipment for armies in the field and later merged to become Joseph Baker Sons & Perkins Ltd in 1918, before rebranding to Baker Perkins Ltd in 1923.\nAround the time of the merger, Baker bought a factory in Saginaw, Michigan, which became the base for manufacture of food and chemical equipment in North America.\nBetween the wars, the company manufactured a wide range of machinery including laundry equipment. In 1939, Baker Perkins was asked to take on production of the new twin 6-pounder coast defence gun and also made components for a wide range of other artillery pieces. Post war, Baker Perkins specialized in equipment for the food processing and printing industries.\nThe business had expanded to become global in its organization and sales when in 1987 the dairy and liquid food specialist, APV, acquired it to become APV Baker. During this time the company relocated from old premises near the center of Peterborough to a new purpose-built facility on the outskirts.\nBaker Perkins Today\nIn 2006 Baker Perkins regained its historical name and independence when it was acquired by private investors as a long-term venture. In recent history, Baker Perkins has introduced new molding and forming technology that enables bakers to improve the quality of their bread; developed equipment allowing confectioners to develop colorful new candies and lollipops; and pioneered technology expanding the variety of convenient, tasty and attention grabbing snacks and breakfast cereals.\nIt currently operates in two office locations, the headquarters being in Paston, Peterborough with a second office in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nSince November 2020, Baker Perkins Ltd. is part of the Schenck Process Group, an international engineering company with headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\n\nTrade Associations\nBaker Perkins maintains close links to the industries it serves through membership of key trade associations and research organisations. These include AACC International, PMCA, BEMA and B&CMA in the US: and the Leatherhead Food International and Campden BRI in the UK.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nBaker Perkins Historical Society\nWestwood Works 1903 - 2003",

    "text": "The Noble M15 is a sports car designed and developed by Noble Automotive, a high-performance sports car manufacturer based in Leicestershire, England.\nProduction of the M15 was due to begin in early 2006. The Noble M15 is intended to appeal to a far broader market than the M12-GTO3R or the M400 and compete directly with the Porsche 911 Turbo/GT-3 and Ferrari F430. As a result, the Noble M15 has a number of features not previously found on Nobles such as satellite navigation, traction control, electric windows and ABS.\nNoble founder Lee Noble has been quoted in indicating \"the M12 is a great car, but it's very focused and [he] wanted to produce a supercar people could use every day... It was time for Noble to take a big step up in terms of refinement, practicality and style.\"  Despite increased comfort and usability compared to previous Noble cars, Lee Noble has also stated that the M15 is significantly quicker than the M400 around a race track.\n\n\nDesign\nThe car is based on a brand new platform with a longitudinally-mounted engine connected to a bespoke gearbox created by Graziano. The double wishbone suspension is a development of the system mounted on the M400. Mounting the engine longitudinally (rather than transversely as on the M400) allowed the engine designers to increase the cooling flow to the engine, which allows the 3.0 L; 181.1 cu in (2,967 cc) twin-turbo Ford Duratec V6 engine to develop 455 bhp (339 kW; 461 PS). The engine has been designed to meet European emission standards and the new steel/aluminium space frame has been designed with a view to passing crash test regulations around the world. The M15 is planned to be the first Noble which gains European and US type approval.\nLike all the Noble M models, the M15 has a steel spaceframe and roll cage covered with graphite-reinforced plastic body panelling, ventilated disc brakes front and rear, but unlike the previous models is designed to be more of a grand tourer/everyday sports car (an example of which would be the now-defunct Honda NSX) rather than an all-out track day car.\nThe Noble M15 accelerates from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 185 mph (298 km/h). Its body shape is a coupé and it has 2 seats. In Britain it costs £74,950.\nWhen it appeared on the popular British car TV show Top Gear, it was driven by Richard Hammond who praised its handling (\"it just grips and grips, and then there's a tiny little bit of understeer to tell you you're being a bit of a spanner.\") When it was handed over to Top Gear's 'tame racing driver', The Stig, it completed a lap of their circuit in 1:22.5, a time faster than a Ferrari F430 (1:22.9), and an Audi R8 (1:24.4).

The Noble M15 is intended to appeal to a far broader market than the M12-GTO3R or the M400 and compete directly with the Porsche 911 Turbo/GT-3 and Ferrari F430. As a result, the Noble M15 has a number of features not previously found on Nobles such as satellite navigation, traction control, electric windows and ABS.\nNoble founder Lee Noble has been quoted in indicating \"the M12 is a great car, but it's very focused and [he] wanted to produce a supercar people could use every day... It was time for Noble to take a big step up in terms of refinement, practicality and style.\"  Despite increased comfort and usability compared to previous Noble cars, Lee Noble has also stated that the M15 is significantly quicker than the M400 around a race track.",

    "text": "The Division of Arkansas Heritage (DAH) is a division of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism of the U.S. State of Arkansas responsible for preserving, promoting, and protecting Arkansas's natural and cultural history and heritage. It was known as the Department of Arkansas Heritage until it was merged with the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism (ADPT) on July 1, 2019, becoming a division of ADPT's successor, the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism.\nThe division is headquartered in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas along the banks of the Arkansas River. Its headquarters is about 34,000 square feet at 1100 North St. in Little Rock and includes offices, a materials and collections storage facility, a fleet-management physical plant, an herbarium, a library, and multiple meeting spaces available for public use.\nThe Division of Arkansas Heritage promotes Arkansas Heritage Month each May to promote Arkansas history and tourism. It began as Heritage Week in 1982 and expanded into a month-long program in 1998.  Each year, DAH selects one of its various agencies to highlight during the month of May. Local entities can apply for and receive grants in order to create specific Heritage Month events, focused on the year's theme. In the past, Arkansas Heritage Month events have included historical biking tours, special exhibits in local museums or libraries, or history fairs with reenactments and historic activities.\n\n\nHistory\nThe impetus behind the creation of the department was to group together existing state agencies that were culturally oriented. Several legislators sponsored Act 1001 of 1975, which created the Department of Arkansas Natural and Cultural Heritage and brought together six agencies. The name was changed to the Department of Arkansas Heritage in 1985. Anne Bartley was appointed the first director of Arkansas Heritage in 1975 by Gov. David Pryor to lead the Department of Arkansas Natural and Cultural Heritage. Cathie Matthews, who held the position from 1997 until 2012, was the longest-serving director. Stacy Hurst, appointed by Governor Asa Hutchinson in January 2015, was its last director as a separate department. The present director of the Heritage division (as of 2024) is Marty Ryall.\nOn March 31, 2016, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson created the Arkansas World War I Centennial Commemoration Committee to lead the state's remembrance of the events of 100 years ago. The committee worked with the people of Arkansas to plan activities, conduct research, and otherwise expanded the understanding and appreciation of the significance of World War I, until it was dissolved on December 31, 2018.\nThe Arkansas Food Hall of Fame program was founded in 2016 by the Department of Arkansas Heritage to honor the unique foods and food traditions of Arkansas. It was originally made up of four categories for nominations, Proprietor or Chef of the Year, Food-themed Event, Food Hall of Fame, and People's Choice, with a fifth category added in 2017 titled Gone But Not Forgotten. A 13-member committee selects the finalists and winners from the entries. Honorees and finalists are announced at a special ceremony every spring.\n\n\nStructure\nThe division consists of eight separate units: four heritage resource agencies and four heritage museums. The division's central office coordinates and promotes all unit efforts to make information and materials about the state readily accessible to all Arkansans through heritage and cultural events, educational resources and special publications. The common goal of all units is to seek out and protect the legacy and lore of Arkansas and what distinguishes it from other states.\nThe heritage resource agencies are:\n\nArkansas Arts Council (AAC) seeks to advance the arts in Arkansas and provides grants for arts organizations and activities in communities across the state. ACC hosts conferences such as ArtLinks and GetSmart!. Its programs include Arkansas Living Treasure Award, Governor's Arts Awards, Small Works on Paper, Arkansas Artist Registry, and Arts in Education Roster. It was established in 1966 and became part of the Department of Arkansas Heritage in 1975. AAC is also funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts.\nArkansas Historic Preservation Program (AHPP) manages the state's historic and cultural resources, including properties on the National Register of Historic Places, and operates the Main Street Arkansas program, which works with local communities as a resource for revitalization and preservation. The Department of Arkansas Heritage acquired the Jacob Wolf House Site and Territorial Courthouse from the Baxter County Quorum Court in 2016. The Arkansas Historic Preservation Program operates the site with a historic site manager, offering comprehensive interpretive themes between 1829 and 1863 tied to the historic site.\nArkansas Natural Heritage Commission (ANHC) was created by the Arkansas General Assembly in 1969 and works to conserve Arkansas's natural landscape by conducting surveys, studies, and maintaining a biodiversity database. Volunteers can assist the ANHC professional staff in surveys or educational resource guides. The commission also created an Adopt-A-Natural Area Program where individuals or organizations can take responsibility for helping ANHC maintain and monitor a specific natural area. ANHC established and maintains the Arkansas System of Natural Areas, including a central repository of rare and endangered species.\nIn 2016, legislation transferred the Arkansas History Commission (AHC) from the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism to DAH, renaming it the Arkansas State Archives (ASA). The ASA keeps and cares for the official archives of the State of Arkansas. Arkansans across the state can access databases and historical materials for genealogy and other research, whether at the Little Rock headquarters or at one of its two branches, Northeast Arkansas Regional Archives (NEARA) and Southwest Arkansas Regional Archives (SARA). Artifacts and records from everyday Arkansans are collected and preserved through the Archives. The Black History Commission of Arkansas serves to collect materials on Arkansas's African American history for the Arkansas State Archives, working to raise awareness of the contributions of African American Arkansans.\nThe heritage museums are:\n\nThe Delta Cultural Center (DCC) chronicles the life and times of the people, traditions, music, and art of the Arkansas Delta. The museum opened in 1990 in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas and was added to the Department of Arkansas Heritage the same year. Part of the center is located in the restored 1912 train depot. It's also home to the famed King Biscuit Time radio show.\nThe Historic Arkansas Museum (HAM) is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums and is the state's foremost interpreter of frontier Arkansas, chronicling the social, political, and creative history of the state through the 19th century. It was the state's first history or historic site museum accredited by the AAM. The museum includes four major historic buildings on their original sites and a transplanted 1830s log cabin. The Hinderliter Tavern, built in 1827 and the oldest building in Little Rock, remains on its original site on the museum grounds. The museum also houses one of the country's best Bowie knife collections and is home to the American Bladesmith Society Hall of Fame.\nMosaic Templars Cultural Center (MTCC) tells the story of Arkansas's African Americans from 1870 to the present. Its mission is to collect and preserve African-American history in Arkansas, highlighting achievements in education, the arts, business, and politics. The museum has housed an Arkansas Black Hall of Fame exhibit on the second floor since September 2008. Two former slaves, John E. Bush and Chester W. Keatts, founded the Mosaic Templars of America in 1882. The fraternal organization was established in Little Rock to provide services to African Americans. The organization expanded to build a three-building complex. The three-story museum stands within the historic site's original footprint after the original building burned down.\nOld State House Museum (OSHM) is the oldest standing state capitol west of the Mississippi. It emphasizes political history, women's history, and historical programming for school children. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The building was not only Arkansas's first capitol building, but it also served as the backdrop for Bill Clinton's presidential election victory parties. It has permanent collections featuring artifacts from Arkansas's first families as well as the state's First Ladies' gowns.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nArkansas Heritage's channel on YouTube",

    "text": "Introduced by William Benoit, image restoration theory (also known as image repair theory) outlines strategies that can be used to restore one's image in an event where reputation has been damaged. Image restoration theory can be applied as an approach for understanding both personal and organizational crisis situations. It is a component of crisis communication, which is a sub-specialty of public relations. Its purpose is to protect an individual, company, or organization facing a public challenge to its reputation.\nBenoit outlines this theory in Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies.\n\n\nBasic concepts\nTwo components must be present in a given attack to the image of an individual or organization: \n\nThe accused is held responsible for an action.\nthe act is considered offensive.\nImage restoration theory is grounded in two fundamental assumptions.\n\nCommunication is a goal-directed activity. Communicators may have multiple goals that are not collectively compatible, but people try to achieve goals that are most important to them at the time, with reasonable cost.\n Maintaining a favorable reputation is a key goal of communication. Because face, image, or reputation is valued as important, individuals or organizations are motivated to take action when it is compromised.\nPerception is fundamental to image restoration, as the accused actor will not engage in a defensive strategy unless the perception exists that he is at fault. The actor who committed the wrongful act must decide on the strategy of the best course based on their specific situation. Factors such as credibility, audience perceptions, and the degree of offensiveness of the act must be taken into account.\nSome image repair factors include\n\nCrisis responsibility – how much a company or person is responsible for in a crisis\nCrisis type – what type of crisis is happening\nOrganizational reputation – what is the known reputation and behavior of a company or a person\n\n\nTheoretical framework\nThe importance of image is one of the key factors in a brand, or persons, business. This is one of the most important factors when it comes to conflict management and resolution. The theory of image restoration builds upon theories of apologia and accounts. Apologia is a formal defense or justification of an individual's opinion, position, or actions, and an account is a statement made by an individual or organization to explain unanticipated or transgressive events.\nBenoit claims that these treatments of image restoration focus on identifying options rather than prescribing solutions. He grounds image restoration theory on a comprehensive literature review of apologia and accounts theories.\nSpecific influences of image restoration theory include Rosenfield's (1968) theory of analog, Ware and Linkugel's (1973) theory of apologia; Kenneth Burke's (1970) theory of goals and purification; Ryan's (1982) kategoria and apologia; Scott and Lyman's (1968) analysis of accounts; Goffman's (1967) remedial moves; Schonbach's (1980) updated analysis of Scott and Lyman's (1968) theory; and Schlenker's (1980) analysis of impression management and accounts.\n\n\nTypology of strategies\n\n\nCase studies\n\n\nCase studies by Benoit\nBased on several case studies by Benoit and his colleagues, a number of prescriptive recommendations were cited for the use of crisis strategies:\n\nThe dominant recommendation is for an organization to immediately admit fault/accept responsibility.\nCorrective actions should be taken and an organization need to publicize those actions.\nBolstering, which is directly related to the charge, is the most effective strategy.\nIf the organization is innocent, denial is an effective strategy.\n\"Image restoration theory is the dominant line of research generating these recommendations. The most common recommendations suggest using the mortification and corrective action crisis response when an organization is guilty.\"\nIn the table below, representative case studies by Benoit and his colleagues are introduced:\n\n\nLimitation of Image repair theory – Coombs\nEven though image restoration theory represented the use of mortification (accepting responsibility) and corrective action, there might be alternative recommendations. For instance, his studies using situational crisis communication theory found no support for always using mortification and corrective action. Also, the mortification and corrective action strategies had no greater effect than a simple bolstering strategy in a criminal violation crisis such as racial discrimination (Coombs, 2006). This theory can not be predicted.\nAdditionally, in terms of the limitation of case studies in image restoration theory, Coombs  argued that closer scrutiny with insights should be taken before offering strategies to crisis managers as facts. To gain additional insights into the use of crisis responses, he pointed out many similar crises should be examined for patterns of strategy use and effect, and \"a large number of cases could be coded and subjected to log-linear analysis to identify patterns.\" (Coombs, 2006, p. 191-192)\n\n\nThe Cola Wars\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi's longstanding competition reached its peak when Coke and Pepsi placed advertisements in Nation's Restaurant News with unmistakable attacks from both sides.\nBenoit analyses advertisements from both companies from 1990–1992 to address the persuasive strategies of Coke and Pepsi to determine recommendations for image restoration following an attack. He advises that companies should avoid making false claims, provide adequate support for claims, and develop themes throughout a campaign, and avoid arguments that might backfire.\n\n\nSee also\nReputation management\n\n\nExternal links\nWilliam Benoit Archived 2013-02-13 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=27752797",
    "text": "The Zeppelin-Staaken VGO.II was a heavy bomber built in Germany in 1915 and which saw limited service during World War I. Although only one example was built, it served as a prototype for further Riesenflugzeuge (\"giant aircraft\") by Zeppelin-Staaken. Its \"VGO\" designation was assigned because the aircraft was constructed by Versuchsbau Gotha-Ost, a division of Gothaer Waggonfabrik. It was developed from the VGO.I that had been purchased by the Imperial German Navy, but the VGO.II was purchased by the Army instead. \n\n\nDesign\nThe VGO.II was a four-bay, equal-span biplane with slightly negative wing stagger. Of mostly conventional configuration it diverged most noticeably from the designs of the day not only by its size, but by its biplane horizontal stabilisers, its two fins, and its tricycle undercarriage. Its two pilots sat in an open cockpit. One engine was mounted in the nose, driving a tractor propeller, and the other two were mounted in nacelles in the interplane gap and drove pusher propellers. These nacelles were large enough to accommodate a mechanic, who could make his way into them in flight (a requirement of the Riesenflugzeuge specification). The fuselage included a bomb bay large enough to carry a 1,000-kilogram (2,200 lb) bomb. As defensive armament, the VGO.II carried two machine guns in the fuselage, one firing upward and the other downward, plus a machine gun in the front of each engine nacelle.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe design and construction of the VGO.II was very similar to that of the VGO.I, but incorporated several refinements based on experience gained with test flights of the earlier machine. These modifications included a redesigned tail with a larger gap between the horizontal surfaces, and fewer fins, plus the addition of machine-gun positions in the fronts of the engine nacelles. These changes were later retrofitted to the VGO.I during its first rebuild. \nConstruction work began in December 1914, and the first flight took place on 25 October 1915. By then, the ongoing problems that the Navy had experienced with the VGO.I very nearly led the Army to cancel the VGO.II, but the aircraft was accepted into Army service on 28 November and given the Idflieg serial number R.9/15.\n\n\nOperational history\nIn February 1916, the VGO.II was assigned to Rfa 500 (Riesenflugzeugabteilung, \"giant aeroplane unit\") at Auce. From there, it undertook test flights before becoming the first R-plane to see combat. Although test pilot Offizierstellvertreter Vinzenz Selmer claimed to have made an attack on Russian targets as early as March, the earliest substantiated raid by the VGO.II was on 13 August against the railway junction at Sloka. Successfully missions continued into the autumn. On one of these, it was damaged in a forced landing that tore off its undercarriage and damaged a strut, but it was repaired and returned to service within a few days.\nDuring its service life, the VGO.II was fitted with experimental armament. The first of these was a machine gun fitted to the tip of the tail. However, the flexibility of the fuselage structure meant that this position and the gunner assigned to it were subject to such oscillation as to render the crewmember hopelessly airsick to the point of incapacitation. A more promising trial was fitting a downward-firing 130-millimetre (5+1⁄8 in) cannon in the fuselage. Dubbed (Aussstossrohn, \"launching tube\"), it was hoped that this installation would be able to achieve greater accuracy than was possible with free-fall bombs, especially against relatively small targets like warships, whose armoured decks it would also be able to penetrate. Ground tests of the cannon installed on a tower began on 25 May, especially to investigate how much recoil it produced. When this proved acceptable, the fuselage of the VGO.II was reinforced, and the cannon installation was again tested on the ground on 6 and 10 October, this time mounted in the aircraft itself. Finally, on 19 October, it was tested in flight. The accuracy proved disappointing, missing the target by 40–45 metres (131–148 ft) from an altitude of 800 metres (2,600 ft), and the cannon was removed.\nBy the end of 1916, the VGO.II was obsolete, and on 1 January 1917, it was reassigned to Rea (Riesenflugzeugersatzabteilung, \"giant aeroplane support unit\") as a training machine at Döberitz. It was eventually damaged beyond repair in a hard landing. The exact date is unknown, but was probably in Summer 1917. No casualty records are associated with the incident.\n\n\nOperators\nImperial German Army Air Service\nRfa 500\nRea\n\n\nSpecifications\nData from Kroschel & Stützer 1994, p.133, and as notedGeneral characteristics\nCrew: Six\nLength: 23.78 m (78 ft 0 in)\nWingspan: 42.2 m (138 ft 5 in)\nHeight: 7 m (23 ft 0 in)\nWing area: 332 m2 (3,570 sq ft)\nEmpty weight: 6,637 kg (14,632 lb)\nGross weight: 10,203 kg (22,494 lb)\nPowerplant: 3 × Maybach HS six-cylinder, water-cooled, inline piston engine, 177 kW (237 hp) each (240 PS each)\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 110 km/h (68 mph, 59 kn)\nService ceiling: 3,000 m (9,800 ft)\nTime to altitude: 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in 39 minutes3,000 metres (9,800 ft) in 79 minutes\nArmament\n\nGuns: 4 × 7.92-millimetre (0.312 in) Parabellum MG 14 machine guns\nBombs: 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb) bombs\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nCooksley, Peter (2000).

    "text": "Ten 17 was an Independent Local Radio station, broadcast from studios at the Latton Bush Centre in Harlow. The station launched in May 1993 and served Harlow, East Herts and West Essex until its closure on 25 July 2010.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTen 17 came into existence following long campaigning work by a voluntary group, Harlow Community Radio Association (HCRA), which had the goal of launching a community radio station for the Harlow area. HCRA was led by four former Harlow Hospital Radio officers: Russ Lewell (chairman), Alan Hall (Secretary), Tony Saxby (Treasurer) and Tony Poole (Station Manager), who formed Harlow Radio Ltd as the legal entity for the group. \nHCRA and Harlow Radio Ltd had well over 100 volunteers, community groups and local businesses interested in radio, or with a community orientation, and supportive of a radio station specifically for Harlow. Indeed, the HCRA team were successful in obtaining a £36,000 grant from Harlow Council to build a suite of studios and office space at its Latton Bush Centre. \nDue to the success of the group, which gained widespread support from the local community, the Radio Authority (the regulator at the time) was sufficiently impressed by the Group's work and offer that they decided to advertise Harlow as one of the first licences for its new small scale commercial radio licences. Indeed, when the advertisement of the operating licence was announced, Harlow Radio Ltd was the only applicant group and it was widely assumed that they would be successful in being granted the licence.\nHowever, the Radio Authority suspended the licence grant having reservations about the level of financial backing for the community group. HCRA therefore entered discussions with Essex Radio Group to agree terms to jointly run the radio station. Essex Radio Group Chairman, Eric Moonman, and Managing Director, Phil Hinton, took a personal interest in the cooperation, and a Station Director from Essex Radio, Peter Kerridge, was appointed to lead the development and launch what then became Ten 17.  Essex Radio formed a new legal entity, Harlow FM Ltd, and Russ Lewell and Alan Hall from the original HCRA group became directors of the re-formed company, along with Eric Moonman, Phil Hinton and Mick Garrett (Essex Radio Finance Director).  Although Essex Radio was the major shareholder, members of the HCRA were also given the opportunity to purchase shares, which many did.\nTen 17 launched on 1 May 1993. The first presenters were taken from the group of HCRA volunteers and trained by the Essex Radio Team. Russ Lewell was the first presenter to speak on Ten 17, introducing the first song - Simply The Best, by Tina Turner - and other voluntary presenters at the time of launch included Tony Saxby, Ian Daborn, Lee Canderton, Graham Hindley and Vic James.  Steve Sampson and Steve Saunders presented the popular Megasport programme on Saturday afternoons, featuring local and national sports news and music, supported by a team of dedicated volunteers. \nAlan Hall developed a Training Programme for Features Presenters, to produce short, punchy three minute features.  Alan also produced four series of features himself, each following the work of local services - including “On The Beat” (following the work of Harlow Police), “Harlow Ambulance”, “Harlow Green Watch” (Fire and Rescue Service) and “London Stansted”. \nOther Features Presenters included Liz Good, Phil Dale and James Cassidy.  \nThere were only two paid members of the presenting team on launch - Tony Williams (Presenter of the Drivetime Show) and Matt Precey (Journalist / News Presenter).  The rest of the output was provided by a combination of shows presented by trained volunteers and content fed from Essex Radio, with local news interjected. \nA few months after launch, though, Ten17 introduced its own breakfast programme, presented by former volunteers Vic James and, latterly, Gary Mulligan. \nThe technical team was headed locally by Zulqar Cheema and the Station Receptionist was Judy Crosby - who went on to marry Ten 17 Director and Features Presenter, Alan Hall.  \nMany volunteers who presented programmes on Ten 17 have gone on to have successful careers in broadcasting and the media, including Simon Burrell (Simon James) and James Burrell (James Hill), Scott Hughes, Chris Badcock, Gavin Inskip, David Francis, Debbie (Mac) Mackintosh (now Johnson), Dave Wartnaby, Gary Mulligan and Wyatt Wendels (Planet Rock)..\nOn Peter's departure from Ten 17, Russ Lewell, one of the original founders and presenter, became Station Director. \n\n\nRebrand and Closure\n\n\nRebranding\n\n1999 - DMG Radio Ltd \nIn 1999, Ten 17 FM was rebranded as Mercury FM, as were 5 of the 6 stations owned by DMG Radio Ltd. This station was known as Mercury 101.7. It was then changed back to Ten 17 when it was bought by GWR.\n\n\nThe 2000s onwards - GWR, GCap, and Global\n\nTen 17's owners, GWR, later merged with Capital Radio to become GCap. The station was retained. GCap was then bought by Global Radio in 2008. Up until July 2010, the station formed part of Global's The Hit Music Network, broadcasting a mix of locally produced output from Harlow and networked programming from Nottingham.\n\n\nClosure\nOn 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to rebrand Ten 17 as Heart and merge the station with Heart Essex and Heart Colchester as part of restructuring plans for the Heart Network.\nThe new station, Heart Essex, launched on Monday 26 July 2010 and broadcasts from studios in Chelmsford. The very last programme from Ten 17 was broadcast on Sunday 25 July 2010.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nTen-17 FM website",

According to 2022 census, the urban area of the city has a population of 34,942, while the population of the city administrative area has 49,601 inhabitants.\nThe city has rich geographical features, including the mountains of Stara Planina, Vlaška Planina, Belava, Suva Planina; rivers which flow through the town, including Nišava, Jerma, Rasnička Reka, Temštica and the Visočica; and four lakes, the Zavoj Lake, Berovacko Lake, Krupac Lake and Sukovo Lake.\nIt also has a rich culture, with notable Orthodox church buildings, including the Church of St. Petka, and the monastery of St. Georges and St. John the Theologian from the late 14th century, both of which display an example of medieval architecture. Pirot is known for its traditional woven carpet, the Pirot carpet (Pirot ćilim).\n\n\nGeography\nThe municipality of Pirot covers an area of 1,235 km2 (476.84 sq mi), with over seventy settlements, including the city of Pirot. According to the 2002 census report, in the municipality of Pirot lived 63791 residents. Around 45,000 people live in the city itself and about 22,000 people live in the villages around the city.\nThe river Nišava divides the Pirot into two districts: Tijabara and Pazar.\nPirot has several mountains in the vicinity, including Stara Planina, Vlaška planina, Belava, and Suva Planina.\nThe following rivers flow through Pirot: the Nišava, Jerma, Rasnička Reka, Temštica, and Visočica. Pirot also has four lakes: Lake Zavoj, Lake Berovacko, Lake Krupac, and Lake Sukov.\nPirot has a Temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) with warm summers and cold winters.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nRoman era\nDuring the rule of Roman Emperor Tiberius (14–37), Ponišavlje was part of Moesia, and during Vespasian (69–79) it was, as the rest of Serbia, organized into Upper Moesia (as opposed to most of Bulgaria, Lower Moesia). At the end of the 4th century the basin of the Nišava was organized into the province of Dacia Mediterranea. The Roman settlement of Turres (Latin for \"towers\"), which was a military residence, is mentioned in the first half of the 3rd century. Later, the Byzantine town of Quimedava is mentioned here, with remains that have survived.\nThe town was set to enable control and defence of the main road in this part of the empire. Besides, travellers could sleep here overnight, as well as get refreshments and new horses or vehicles. In time, the settlement advanced because of the important road passing through. It was also disturbed very persistently by invasions of the Gothic tribes throughout the 4th century, as well as the Huns in the 5th century.\n\n\nEarly Byzantine era\nAccording to the written accounts On Buildings by Procopius of Caesarea, writing during the reign of the emperor Justinian I (527 – 565), the emperor ordered the reconstruction of thirty fortresses in the area from Niš to Sofia, including the towers of Pirot. He also gave the detailed description of those construction works. In times when the Slavs and Avars were invading the Balkans, the settlement was named Quimedava, and was situated on the southern slope of the Sarlah Hill.\nCorresponding to the archaeological investigations, the town back then, surrounded by forts and fortified walls, also included an early Christian basilica, thermae (public baths), a necropolis, and other facilities. Beside the military fortress, a civil settlement (vicus) existed on the site called Majilka. By the late 6th century and early 7th century, successive barbarian invasions had broken through the Byzantine Danube frontier, and Slavs settled in large numbers across the Balkans.\n\n\nMiddle Ages\n \nBy the mid-6th century Slavs had settled the area. In 679 the Bulgars crossed the Danube into Lower Moesia, and eventually expand to the west and south. Since the beginning of the 9th century the region of Pirot is part of the First Bulgarian State. The Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 960–1025) reconquered the Balkans from the Bulgars.\nIn 1153, Arab geographer Burizi crossed the country, and recorded the place of Atrubi at the site of old Turres, describing it as situated by a small river which arrives from the Serbian mountains and was a tributary of the Morava. In 1182–83 the Serbian army led by Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja conquered Byzantine territories from Niš to Sofia. The Serbians were expelled by the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelus in 1190. Pirot and Bela Palanka (Remesiana) were not mentioned as they were in ruin since the rebellions in the 940s. Since the end of the 12th century the region of Pirot was part of the restored Bulgarian state. The region was for some time in the domains of Bulgarian noble sevastokrator Kaloyan. In 1331-1332 Church of St. Petka in Staničenje was built - at the time of Bulgarian Emperor Joan Asen (Ivan Alexander) and Vidin master Belaur.\nSome authors suggest that during the 1370s the region of Pirot was included in the Serbian state. Pirot was part of Prince Lazar's state, in which it was an important strategical point. The city was captured by the Ottomans in 1386. The name of the city, Pirot, dates to the 14th century and is derived from Greek pirgos (\"tower\").\n\n\nOttoman rule\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, the region of Pirot was one of the centres of the Uprising of Konstantin and Fruzhin. A significant blow to the efforts of the Bulgarian princes for the restoration of the Bulgarian state was imposed by the Ottoman ruler Sulejman, who conquered the Bulgarian fortress of Temsko, near today's village of Temska, to the north of Pirot.\nIts Turkish name, Şehirköy (meaning \"city, town village\"), is first mentioned in 1443. It was organized into the Sanjak of Niš. In 1469, the body of Serbian king Stefan Milutin was transferred via Pirot. In 1561, hieromonk Isaija from Pirot visited Hilandar where he contributed a book. Hilandar had dependencies in Pirot up until the 19th century. Travel writer Stephen Gerlach (fl. 1578) recorded that Pirot Christians claimed that the town was the earlier estate of Miloš Obilić, the slayer of Sultan Murad at Kosovo. He also noted that Pirot was a significant place in Bulgaria. In 1659, Austrian deputy August von Mayern visited the town and described it as \"Schiarchici, a town called by the Orthodox as Pirot, but is not surrounded by walls and inhabited by Turks and Rascians\" (Rasciani according to the author were even the citizens of Sofia, Ihtiman etc.). In 1664, Austrian deputy Leslie and English nobleman John Burberry visited the town, the latter noting that there were three churches, one of which was earlier Dominican. In 1688 Ottoman renegade Yegen Pasha resided in the town.\nDuring the Great Turkish War, after taking Niš on 25 September 1689, Austrian general Piccolomini with his army of Serb volunteers and some Germans chased Turks towards Sofia. Arriving at Pirot, the town was empty of Turks, and he reported that the town was in flames and some parts in ash. In August 1690 a large Ottoman army took Pirot, defended only by 100 Germans, and then besieged Niš, taking it after three weeks. Hungarian detachments retreating via Temska ravaged the monastery and terrorized the surrounding population, as inscribed by a priest on the church walls. That year, many locals fled northwards with Patriarch Arsenije III.\nDuring the Austro-Turkish War (1737–39) the Austrian army took Pirot on 23 July 1737. In 1739, upon Ottoman return, the town was burnt down and its churches destroyed (one transformed into a mosque). 140 houses were burnt down which is evidence that hajduks of the region participated. Many locals from the region fled northwards with Patriarch Arsenije IV.\nThe first known literary monument, influenced by Torlakian dialects is the Manuscript from Temska Monastery from 1762, in which its author, the Monk Kiril Zhivkovich from Pirot, considered his language as \"simple Bulgarian\".\nIn 1768, the town is described as half in ruins. From 1761 to 1878, Pirot was the seat of the Metropolitan of Nišava.\n\n \nIn 1806, during the First Serbian Uprising (1804–13), Hajduk-Veljko attacked Bela Palanka. Ibrahim Pasha, unable to enter Serbia cross Aleksinac and Deligrad, planned to attack from Pirot and Lom with the intent to clash with the Serbian army before Niš; the Serbian army went to stop this and defeated him in the mountains between Pirot, Knjaževac and Chiprovtsi. Rebel leaders from Pirot included Mita and Marinko, who were tasked to defend the border towards Pirot (in Ottoman hands). After the Serbian Revolution, some of the population in the area migrated to avoid Ottoman retribution. It was estimated in 1836 that there were 6–8,000 inhabitants. Carpetry was the main occupation, there were many shops and cafés in the centre, the population was mixed, and it was the domain of the sister of the Sultan. On 24 May 1836 a rebellion broke out in the town, which was suppressed by early June, and then another one broke out in August, also unsuccessful. The rebels corresponded with Prince Miloš Obrenović. The Niš Uprising (1841), which included the Pirot area, was also suppressed by the Ottomans. In 1846–1864 Pirot was administratively part of the Niš Eyalet. During this period, in 1863, first branch of Ziraat Bank, largest bank of modern Turkey specializing in agricultural banking, was opened in Pirot. With the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870 Pirot was the part of the Nishava eparchy.\nJérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, traveling across Bulgaria in 1841, describes the population of the Sanjak of Niš as Bulgarians. In the 19th century Johann Georg von Hahn stated that the Christian population of Pirot is Bulgarian. Philipp Kanitz claimed that some inhabitants \"Did not imagine that six years later the cursed Turkish rule in their city would end, and even less, because they always felt that they are Bulgarians, that they would belong to the Principality of Serbia\".\nDuring the Exodus of Muslims from Serbia in 1862, some Turkish families moved from Belgrade to Pirot.\nIn 1877. The urban population of Pirot consisted of 29,741 Christian and 5,772 Muslim males, with total number of 3,000 Serbian houses and 400 Muslim houses. However, after the Serbian-Ottoman war in 1878 the population of Pirot changed via emigration process of Muslim population. In 1884. Pirot had 77,922 inhabitants, 76,545 being Serbs and 36 Turks.\n\n\nModern history\n\nOn 16 December 1877, during the Serbian-Ottoman War (1876–1877), the Serbian army entered Pirot. This raised a conflict between the Serbian authorities and the local Bulgarian citizens led by Evstatiy of Pelagonia, the bishop of the Bulgarian Exarchate's Nishava eparchy.  Pirot and its region were part of liberated Bulgaria according to the Treaty of San Stefano. The Treaty of Berlin (1878) saw Pirot and Vranje ceded to Serbia. A part of the local Bulgarians left the town and settled in Bulgaria.\nThe 1879 Serbian regional population census registered that Pirot had a population of 76,892 people, and 11,005 households. It was temporarily occupied by the Bulgarian army after the Serbo-Bulgarian War, between 15 November and 15 December 1885 [O.S.]. During World War I, the Bulgarian army entered Pirot on 14 October 1915 and occupied the city as well as the whole Pomoravlje region.\nIn the Interwar period, the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organization engaged in repeated attacks against the Yugoslav police and army. From 1929 to 1941, Pirot was part of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II Bulgaria occupied the so-called Western Outlands, as well as Pirot and Vranje. After the Second World War, these regions were returned to Yugoslavia. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, these areas remained within the Serbian state.\nPirot was granted city status in February 2016.\n\n\nSettlements\nAside from the city of Pirot itself, the city territory covers over 70 settlements:\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2022 census results, the municipality of Pirot has a population of 49,601, while the settlement proper has a population of 34,942.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\n\n\nCulture\n\nNotable brands of Pirot include the Pirot carpet, Pirot opanak, Pirot cheese, and ironed sausage.\n\n\nTourist attractions\nPirot Fortress, dating to the 14th-century Serbian Empire\nTemska Monastery, 16th-century Orthodox monastery\nZavoj Lake\nNational Park Old Mountain\nMountain home\n\n\nEconomy\nOn the territory of the city of Pirot operates tire manufacturer Tigar Tyres which is one of top Serbian exporters in the period from 2013 to 2017.

The ISGS, predominantly composed of Fulani fighters, attacked Daoussahak Tuareg villages, prompting Daoussahak and other ethnic minorities in the region to ally themselves with the Mali-based GATIA and Movement for the Salvation of Azawad, themselves allied with the French Operation Barkhane.\n\n\nAmbush\nAt the time of the attack, the Nigerien soldiers were escorting electoral officials who had been helping residents register to vote when they were ambushed by ISGS fighters. The Nigerien Ministry of Defense released scant details about the ambush, but in their statement mentioned that seven gendarmes and seven national guardsmen were killed \"at the end of a fierce battle.\" Several people were injured and one was reported missing as well. By December 30, the death toll had risen to 16 killed, four injured, and one missing. The Nigerien Ministry of Defense also stated that several ISGS jihadists were killed as well, but did not release a number. They also reported that Sanam remained under the control of Nigerien forces. ISGS claimed responsibility through ISWAP on January 14, 2020.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "List of Honkai: Star Rail characters",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=79731547",
    "text": "Honkai: Star Rail is a 2023 role-playing video game developed by HoYoverse. Set in a vast science-fantasy universe, it follows the story of the Trailblazer, a player-named protagonist who boards the interstellar train known as the Astral Express to explore distant worlds across the cosmos. Accompanied by companions such as Dan Heng, March 7th, and Himeko, the Trailblazer visits various civilizations, becoming involved in resolving crises caused by mysterious entities known as Stellarons.\nMany characters encountered throughout the journey are aligned with Paths, universal concepts that embody distinct philosophies and powers. Each Path is associated with an Aeon, a higher-dimensional deity that governs a particular aspect of existence, such as Destruction, Preservation, or the Hunt. Certain individuals, called Pathstriders, closely align with a specific Path according to their personal will or belief. Others ascend to become Emanators, beings capable of drawing divine power directly from an Aeon. Emanators are often regarded as the enforcers of their Aeon’s will, possessing strength far beyond that of mortals, though not all choose to act in service of their patron deity.\n\n\nCreation and design\nHonkai: Star Rail producer David Jiang stated that the development team places significant emphasis on character creation, noting that drafting narrative text for a single character typically takes around a month. The production team emphasized the importance of making the game's diverse characters feel as though they genuinely inhabit the fictional world. According to the writers, their role is not to direct the characters according to their own intentions but rather to document the words, actions, and events of characters as if they were real individuals within the setting. To imbue characters with a sense of authentic humanity, the writers often drew inspiration from people around them when shaping character traits. For example, when designing Qingque, a character with a strong interest in mahjong, the development team observed avid mahjong players, asking questions such as \"How do people who love mahjong typically behave?\" and \"What do they dislike?\" The resulting traits were then incorporated into the character's design.\nAccording to lead game designer Chengnan An, the development team adopts a \"character-first\" design philosophy, wherein personality and narrative are prioritized over gameplay mechanics. He explained that creating gameplay systems before developing the characters often limited their creativity, stating that \"we ran out of inspo really, really fast\" when doing so. Character concepts go through multiple visual iterations and feedback rounds to heighten their aesthetic appeal, often becoming \"prettier and even more handsome and even more cool with each iteration.\" The team is also known for incorporating distinctive, sometimes eccentric traits into character design to make them more memorable. For instance, the character Dr. Ratio attacks with an oversized book to reflect his egotistical intellect, while Himeko is portrayed calmly sipping tea amid a fiery explosion during her ultimate move.\nRegarding the design of character artificial intelligence (AI), Jiang explained that, to enhance immersion in Honkai: Star Rail, AI technology was integrated into the behavioral patterns of non-player characters (NPCs). This approach aimed to make traditionally scripted NPC behavior appear more natural, thereby providing players with a stronger sense of being part of the game world. He also noted that current AI applications are limited to serving as development aids. However, he suggested that if AI tools can be used to expand character dialogue and narrative content, they may allow for the continued introduction of new interactions between players and characters.\nIn terms of character backstories, Jiang stated that the game's narrative and worldbuilding are developed around its characters, who in turn serve as the primary means of conveying the story and its underlying themes. Honkai: Star Rail draws inspiration from the narrative structure of road movies, with the protagonist and similarly aged companions traveling across a variety of planets. These planets differ greatly in social structure, technological level, cultural systems, and historical background, offering a highly varied setting in which character development and personal growth are explored. \nPrior to a character's official release in the game, HoYoverse promotes them by releasing character-related videos through its official social media channels. In addition to the main storyline, players can undertake Companion Missions, which provide insight into each character's backstory and personality traits that may not be fully explored within the central narrative. These missions allow for a more detailed understanding of individual characters, gradually uncovering their histories and adding depth to their development throughout the journey.\nIn terms of gameplay, the development team stated that they placed greater emphasis on the relationship between the game system and its characters. The game introduces a system called Paths. From a narrative perspective, a character's Path represents the road they follow under a particular Aeon within the game's worldview, and such characters are known as Pathstriders. From a gameplay standpoint, a Path functions similarly to a character's role or class, corresponding to archetypes such as: offense, healing, defense, or support. In addition, each character's designated Path, expressed through accompanying written lore, also reflects their journey of self-discovery. At the game's launch, there were seven Paths available to playable characters: Harmony, Preservation, the Hunt, Destruction, Nihility, Erudition, and Abundance. Additional Paths, such as Remembrance, were introduced in later updates. Playable characters are also categorized by seven damage types: Fire, Ice, Wind, Lightning, Physical, Imaginary, and Quantum.\n\n\nAstral Express\n Trailblazer (开拓者; Kāituòzhě) / Caelus (穹; Qióng) or Stelle (星; Xīng)\nVoiced by: Qin Qiege (Chinese); Caleb Yen (2023–2025), Shaun Mendum (2025–present) (English); Junya Enoki (Japanese); Kim Myung-jun (Korean) (Caelus)\nVoiced by: Chen Tingting (Chinese); Rachael Chau (2023–2025), Chloe Eves (2025–present) (English); Yui Ishikawa (Japanese); Kim Ha-ru (Korean) (Stelle)\nThe main protagonist of the game.

According to IGN China reviewer Water Ash, the character designs appeal to a broad range of fan preferences, with facial expressions and animations during dialogue presented in a detailed and nuanced manner. PCGamesN reviewer Nat Smith observed that the characters possess strong individual appeal, describing them as familiar archetypes that evoke the nostalgic charm of 1990s Japanese role-playing games. Smith also highlighted the game's non-playable characters (NPCs), noting that even minor figures often play pivotal roles in the narrative, enhancing the game's world-building.

Immediately after the reveal, HoYoverse received backlash from players due to Niosi's past abuse allegations in 2019, which were affirmed by Niosi himself. Following the backlash, Niosi withdrew from the role days later and HoYoverse replaced him with Ben Balmaceda.\n\n\nSAG-AFTRA strike controversies\n\nAlthough HoYoverse wasn't explicitly targeted in the SAG-AFTRA strike, multiple English voice actors in support of the strike stopped voicing their assigned characters. HoYoverse responded by replacing some of the striking voice actors, including the voice actors for the Trailblazer, Tingyun, Argenti, and Tail.\nIn May 2025, following a rejected \"best, last, and final\" offer made to SAG-AFTRA, Allegra Clark, the English voice actor for Acheron, called on SAG-AFTRA to end the strike, saying that AAA companies are actively moving out of the United States to find voice actors.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences",

Set in a vast science-fantasy universe, it follows the story of the Trailblazer, a player-named protagonist who boards the interstellar train known as the Astral Express to explore distant worlds across the cosmos. Accompanied by companions such as Dan Heng, March 7th, and Himeko, the Trailblazer visits various civilizations, becoming involved in resolving crises caused by mysterious entities known as Stellarons.\nMany characters encountered throughout the journey are aligned with Paths, universal concepts that embody distinct philosophies and powers. Each Path is associated with an Aeon, a higher-dimensional deity that governs a particular aspect of existence, such as Destruction, Preservation, or the Hunt. Certain individuals, called Pathstriders, closely align with a specific Path according to their personal will or belief. Others ascend to become Emanators, beings capable of drawing divine power directly from an Aeon. Emanators are often regarded as the enforcers of their Aeon’s will, possessing strength far beyond that of mortals, though not all choose to act in service of their patron deity.",

    "text": "Strongheart is a 1904 American play by William C. deMille. It is a comedy drama in four acts, with three settings and twenty characters. The story concerns the eponymous character, a football-playing Native American at Columbia University, who encounters fellowship, racial prejudice, and love. The action of the play takes place on three separate days of the same week. The play was considered to be the first with an educated Native American as the leading character, and a variation on the theme expressed by James Fenimore Cooper in The Last of the Mohicans. \nThe play was first produced by Henry B. Harris, staged by his father William Harris, with sets by Joseph A. Physioc, and starred Robert Edeson. It had a tryout at St. Paul, Minnesota starting in late December 1904 before premiering on Broadway during January 1905. Reviews considered the play acceptable for the sporting elements, but ranged widely on the chaste romance between Strongheart and a white girl.\nThe production made a return engagement on Broadway in August 1905, before going on tour of North America, and had a London debut in May 1907. Strongheart served as the basis for a 1914 silent film.\n\n\nCharacters\nCharacters are listed in order of appearance within their scope.\nLead\n\nDick Livingston is a junior halfback from a wealthy family, next to Strongheart the best player on Columbia's team.\nFrank Nelson is a senior, captain of the football team, whose life was saved \"out west\" by Strongheart.\nBilly Saunders plays center, a senior by courtesy, reliant on Reade's notes to maintain team status.\nSoangataha called Strongheart, is a Carlisle grad; his tribe is paying for his graduate work at Columbia.\nSupporting\n\nRoss is a freshman who has made the team through grit.\nTaylor is a sophomore.\nReade is a \"grind\", a student who actually studies.\nRalph Thorne is an ethically challenged special teams player, who bets on his own football games.\nMolly Livingston is Dick's sister, the object of Billy's desire.\nDorothy Nelson is Frank's sister, who encourages Strongheart to persevere at Columbia.\nFeatured\n\nFred Skinner is a loudly-dressed \"sporting gent\"; that is, an off-campus bookie.\nMrs. Nelson is Frank and Dorothy's mother.\nBetty Bates is a friend of Molly.\nMaud Weston is a bubblehead friend of Betty.\nTommy Nash is a backfield player.\nTad is a \"rubber\", a physical conditioner.\nJosh is a trainer.\nBuckley is Columbia's coach, and a graduate.\nFarley is the visiting team's manager, who wants a fair game.\nBlack Eagle is an elder of Strongheart's tribe who brings a message.\nBit Player\n\nButler serves at the Nelson household.\nAllen is a guard, Benton is a tackle; other football players and subs.\nCanine\n\nSiegfried is the team mascot, a Dachshund belonging to Billy.\n\n\nSynopsis\nAct I (The Columbia dorm room of Frank and Dick. Afternoon.) Ralph Thorne meets Frank Skinner at the empty room. Thorne has bet $3000 with Skinner that Columbia will lose the upcoming game. He based the bet on Strongheart being sidelined due to injury, but now Strongheart has recovered enough to play. Thorne assures Skinner the bet will hold, because he will pass Columbia's signals to the opposing coach, Farley. Skinner asks why Dick Livingston bet $3000 on Columbia to win. Thorne explains it was because he had beaten Dick in poker for that amount, then suggested the bet as a way to recoup his losses before his father found out. Thorne liked the same girl as Dick, and wanted to nobble his rival. Skinner hightails it when Dick, Frank Nelson, and other students come back to the room to prepare for entertaining. Billy tells Reade he needs to keep his class notes a little longer. Strongheart arrives, to be mockingly salaamed by the others as their great chief. Strongheart is undisturbed; he knows this is the boys' way of compensating for their secret admiration of his academic and athletic prowess. Dorothy Nelson, Mollie Livingston, and their friends arrive for afternoon tea. With Mrs. Nelson to chaperone and remedy the amateur attempt to make tea, the get together is a success. Meanwhile, Thorne has switched the list of signals Dick wrote out with his own copy. Excited to meet the exotic Strongheart at last, Maud Weston flusteredly asks him how he likes America. Strongheart replies that his people like it just fine. (Curtain)\nAct II (Columbia football team's locker room at the Polo Grounds. Two days later.) At halftime in the big game, the Columbia players straggle into the locker room, having failed to score. Their coach Buckley encourages and excoriates them, pitching his speech to the team as a whole, while tailoring asides to individual players. At Strongheart's suggestion he blisters the freshman Ross. Strongheart knows that righteous anger will stimulate Ross to inspired effort. Their conference is interrupted by Farley's entrance, holding the list of signals he was given anonymously. Farley wants a fair game, so he has brought the list to Buckley. Strongheart sees the list is in Dick's handwriting, but he himself is accused of the treachery by Thorne. Frank as captain decides to bench him for the second half. Strongheart stays in the locker room with Tommy Nash, who has been injured. He looks out the window to follow the game, describing it for Nash, until at last his triumphantly exclaims \"We win! We Win!\". (Curtain)\n\nAct III (The library of the Nelson family home. Evening of the same day.) At a formal victory celebration, the boys dance with the girls in the Nelson's ballroom, while the library serves for more clandestine rendezvous. Molly advises a worried Dorothy to marry Strongheart if he asks, and don't let his race stop her. Dick asks Frank's permission to propose to his sister Dorothy, since their father is dead. Frank readily gives it. Billy accuses Molly of having sent the signals list he gave her to Farley. Strongheart clears up that misconception, but Molly will not accept Bill's apology yet. Strongheart asks Dorothy for the next dance, but explains they will have to sit it out, since the government won't allow him to dance. Strongheart tells Dorothy of his love for her, and she asks him to come back tomorrow for her answer. Strongheart confronts Thorne over the signals list, but is distracted by his asserting Frank and Dick will deny him a chance with Dorothy. Thorne is right; Frank and Dick are incensed when Strongheart says he has proposed to Dorothy. The call him a traitor, and Dick further accuses him of betraying the team. Even when Strongheart reveals the list is in Dick's handwriting, Dick says he stole it. When Dorothy chides her brother for discourtesy, he holds her back as Strongheart leaves their house, saying he will return for her answer tomorrow. (Curtain)\nAct IV (Same as Act III. Afternoon of the next day.) Billy and Molly make up and he proposes. The team has gathered and Strongheart proves that Thorne sent the list to Farley, then prevents the others from attacking him. Thorne exits, ostracized from the team. The other team members congratulate Strongheart then go with Frank to have some dinner, but Dick hangs back. He apologizes to Strongheart for his harsh words of last night, but says they cannot be friends. Even so, they shake hands. Billy returns to hear Strongheart softly say \"And I thought I was one of them\". The Butler now announces a visitor to see Strongheart. Black Eagle has come from the West: Strongheart's father has died, and his people now require him to return home. As they have paid for his post-graduate work, he feels obligated to obey their wishes. He informs Black Eagle that he may be bringing Dorothy as his wife, but is startled when the elder reacts as negatively as Frank and Dick. Black Eagle is angry that Soangataha would choose a woman not of his own people for a wife. He says how can you ask a white woman to live as we do? Dorothy has overheard his words. She proclaims her love for Strongheart and will go with him, but he realizes he cannot ask this of her. They agree to part, despite their love. Left alone, Strongheart raises his hands overhead and prays for help from the Great Spirit of his people, saying he is alone in a desert. (Curtain)\n\n\nOriginal production\n\n\nBackground\nRobert Edeson was determined to appear only in American dramas, at a time when American stages mounted mainly European works by choice. William C. deMille was a professor of English at Columbia University when Edeson and his producer-manager Henry B. Harris asked him to write a play with a Native American as \"a vital factor\". It reportedly took deMille two years to complete the play. It was presented to Harris and Edeson at Boston in September 1904, at which time the title Strongheart was chosen, over a suggested alternative of Classmates. Edeson said \"I think it will be the first time that an educated Indian will be the hero of a play\".\nDeMille made clear in an interview that he never contemplated letting the romance between Strongheart and Dorothy Nelson go beyond verbal expressions of love. He couldn't countenance a marriage of the two characters, and insisted other dramatists he consulted agreed with the ending. DeMille also emphasized there was no embrace between Strongheart and Dorothy in the play. Another report of the same interview quoted deMille as saying: \"No matter how strongly an American's reason tells him that the colored man or the Indian in any particular case is deserving of all happiness, even to the winning of the white woman he loves, no one of us is quite willing that the white woman should be our sister\".\nStrongheart came out at a time when college football was growing popular with the general public, and the Native American players of Carlisle were achieving surprising results against much larger and far wealthier schools. Edeson lamented to Burns Mantle that he and Harris had Strongheart in hand for two years, but when finally it was stage ready, \"along came George Ade with The College Widow and another football scene\".\nRehearsals for the production were held in St. Louis during Christmas week 1904. During this time, producer Henry B. Harris came down with malaria, and eventually had to be sent back to New York to recover.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nTryouts\nThe play's first tryout occurred at the Metropolitan Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota on December 29, 1904. It was the fourteenth anniversary of the opening of this venue, and a rare production debut for this city. A local reviewer reported the play was \"strong\" and received enthusiastically by the large audience. However, they questioned the ending, saying the average tribal member doesn't care whether their chief has a wife or not, and certainly not what color she is. They conclude: \"Where is the harm in the marriage of a white girl to an Indian when that Indian is educated, refined, and by far a better and stronger man than any of his white associates?\" Another critic complained of the lack of sympathetic appeal for Strongheart in Edeson's interpretation, suggesting the easygoing banter of the other football players rendered him stodgy and humorless by comparison, a \"man who had learned the English language from a schoolmaster rather than his mother\". This same critic reinforced their view with a second column two days later, and went on in a more virulent manner: \"There is something repellent in the spectacle of a full-blooded American Indian declaring his love for a white girl. You can scarcely applaud her for consenting to marry him, though you can readily sympathize with his love for her.\" And again, \"There is something repulsive in the union of a white woman and a black man. The Indian, to be sure, is not a negro, but neither is he a Caucasian\".\nFrom St. Paul, the company moved to the Metropolitan Theater in Minneapolis, where they first presented an older work, Ranson's Folly. Strongheart was performed in Minneapolis starting January 5, 1905. A reviewer for The Minneapolis Star Tribune thought Robert Edeson was growing into stardom with this role, and was enthusiastic about Edmund Breese as Coach Buckley, a type of character new to the stage. However, although they said Dallas Tyler as Dorothy Nelson was \"a pleasing personality\", they also labelled her as \"colorless\" and \"conventional\". After the tryouts in Minnesota finished, the production went back to New York. They rehearsed at the Hudson Theatre during the daytime, as Ethel Barrymore was playing in Sunday during the evenings. Strongheart would premiere at that venue after her engagement closed on January 28, 1905.\n\n\nBroadway premiere and reception\nStrongheart had its Broadway premiere at the Hudson Theatre on January 30, 1905. Reviews acknowledged the racial theme but most avoided expressing opinions about it. Instead, they concentrated on the college sports environment of the play, and reported the enthusiastic reception of the first night audience. Both deMille and Edeson were required to give curtain speeches. One critic dismissed the racial dilemma by citing the precedent of James Fenimore Cooper's Uncas in The Last of the Mohicans. The Evening World critic thought the play's depiction of college students and football much closer to real life than that of George Ade's The College Widow. But they also thought the character of Strongheart as a Columbia college student \"overdrawn\" and \"improbable\". The reviewer for The Sun was an exception who focused on the race theme in the play. They identified racial prejudice as an inherent trait of \"every tribe of human beings\", and said the \"play has not a happy ending but one that is true\".\nDuring the final week of its Broadway engagement, four new actors who would accompany the subsequent tour were brought into the cast. These were Marie Boland in the role of Dorothy Nelson, Louise Drew as Molly Livingston, Frank Gheen as Dick Livingston, and Lucille Stanford as Maud Weston.\n\n\nBroadway closing\nThe production closed its first Broadway run on March 25, 1905, at the Hudson Theatre. It immediately headed for Boston to start touring on March 27, 1905, at the Park Theatre there. Strongheart would have a limited return engagement on Broadway at the Savoy Theatre in August 1905, and a West End premiere at the Aldwych Theatre in May 1907.\n\n\nAdaptations\n\n\nFilm\nStrongheart (film) - Released in March 1914.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nSynopsis source\n\nWilliam C.

    "summary": "Strongheart is a 1904 American play by William C. deMille. It is a comedy drama in four acts, with three settings and twenty characters. The story concerns the eponymous character, a football-playing Native American at Columbia University, who encounters fellowship, racial prejudice, and love. The action of the play takes place on three separate days of the same week. The play was considered to be the first with an educated Native American as the leading character, and a variation on the theme expressed by James Fenimore Cooper in The Last of the Mohicans. \nThe play was first produced by Henry B. Harris, staged by his father William Harris, with sets by Joseph A. Physioc, and starred Robert Edeson. It had a tryout at St. Paul, Minnesota starting in late December 1904 before premiering on Broadway during January 1905. Reviews considered the play acceptable for the sporting elements, but ranged widely on the chaste romance between Strongheart and a white girl.\nThe production made a return engagement on Broadway in August 1905, before going on tour of North America, and had a London debut in May 1907. Strongheart served as the basis for a 1914 silent film.",

The role was to share good engineering practice across the company.\nThe ICL Fellows scheme was formally initiated in 1990 by Sir Peter Bonfield who was Chairman and CEO of ICL plc at that time. Five more technical leaders with a range of expertise were appointed. At this point, Professor Brian Warboys became the Senior ICL Fellow. Further appointments were made throughout the 1990s.\nIn 1993, The ICL Fellows introduced the ICL Distinguished Engineer Scheme in order to build an engineering network across the company that would remain resilient to organisational change. They also introduced an annual engineering conference that ran until 2001.\nFollowing ICL’s acquisition by and rebranding to Fujitsu in the early 2000s, support for the Fellowship scheme became limited.  However, in 2013 the scheme was re-launched as the Fujitsu Fellowship, with the same ambition to recognise and celebrate outstanding achievement and technical excellence.  Three prior ICL Fellows – Nig Greenaway, Nic Holt and Jeff Parker – were appointed inaugural Fujitsu Fellows.  The revived programme also includes recognition & development of Distinguished Engineers, and the return of an annual engineering conference.\n\n\nNotable ICL Fellows\nNotable fellows include Professor Brian Warboys (1984), Michael Kay (1990), Professor Steve Molyneux (1996) who was the first non-employee Fellow, and Ron Brunt (1999) who was the first ICL Fellow appointed in the United States.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Bits & Bytes, ICL Pensioners Newsletter\", Spring 1998, p2.",

    "text": "Thomas M. Hodgson is an American politician who served as Sheriff of Bristol County Massachusetts from 1997 to 2022.\n\n\nEarly life\nHodgson was born about 1954 and grew up in a large Catholic family in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He graduated from a Catholic military high school in Washington and attended Xavier University in Ohio for one year studying accounting. Hodgson worked as a police detective in Ocean City, Maryland, for six years until he resigned in the early-1980's to work for his brother's landscaping business. He moved to Massachusetts in 1985 and worked in an office supply company in Quincy, Massachusetts. He left to work in another brother's accounting firm.\n\n\nNew Bedford city councilor\nHodgson was elected to the New Bedford City Council in 1988. He served until resigning to become Sheriff in 1997; at the time of his resignation, he was the council's only Republican.\n\n\nBristol County sheriff\n\n\nElection history\nHodgson was appointed sheriff of Bristol County by then-Governor William F. Weld on May 21, 1997. He won election to a full six-year term in 1998 and moved to Fall River the next year. He garnered press for charging inmates for room and board, medical services and hair cuts while in jail and for getting rid of televisions and the weight room. He instituted chain gangs. In the 2016 election, he ran unopposed.\nOutgoing Governor Charlie Baker supported Hodgson in his 2022 reelection campaign. Hodgson conceded the election to his opponent, Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux.\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 2017, Hodgson offered to send detainees from Bristol County as forced laborers to build President Donald J. Trump's proposed border wall. When he was later invited to speak to a U.S. House of Representatives committee about sanctuary cities, he recommended that elected officials in such jurisdictions should be arrested.\nOn August 7, 2019, Hodgson sent an email to Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, reporting that his church, St. Julie's Billiart Parish in Dartmouth, MA, was providing information to immigrants regarding their legal rights:\n\n\"Stephen, thought you might like to see samples of cards I discovered in a holder at the back of St. Julie's Church in Dartmouth, MA.\"\n\"While attending mass last Sunday, I noticed a holder on a table near the entrance marked, \"ICE-Immigration\" and noticed the three stacks of colored cards. Trying to determine if this is an isolated situation or a common occurrence in other parish churches,\"\n\nThe email was released as part of a large email leak released to the Southern Poverty Law Center of Stephen Miller's emails focused on Miller's far right attitudes towards race and immigration.\n\n\nICE Detention Center\nOn May 1, 2020, three Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees were hospitalized following a violent incident with correctional officers during testing for COVID-19. Hodgson was on site during the incident and the Bristol County Sheriff's department reported more than $25,000 of damage to the facility.\nThe next day, Congressman Joe Kennedy III called for an independent investigation of the violence; then Senators Warren and Markey and Representative Keating joined Kennedy in signing a joint letter calling for an investigation \"by an external entity.\" The ACLU of Massachusetts sued the Bristol County Sheriff's Office after being denied access to records related to the incident. A Massachusetts Attorney General report concluded in December 2020 that Sheriff Hodgson violated the civil rights of the detainees by using excessive force and recommended the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) terminate its contract between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Bristol County. In May 2021, DHS agreed with the Massachusetts Attorney General and terminated the contract. Hodgson called the report politically motivated.\nFollowing the release of the Attorney General's report, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) contract with the Bristol County Sheriff's Office. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas wrote: \"Allow me to state one foundational principle: we will not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention.\"\n\n\nSuicides in Bristol County Jails\nA report from 2017 found that between 2012 and 2016, Bristol County jails accounted for a quarter of all jail suicides in Massachusetts, despite housing only 13% of inmates in the state. In October 2022, Adam Howe, a 34-year-old man from Truro, killed himself in an Ash Street Jail cell while awaiting trial for the murder of his mother. In a WBSM radio interview, Sheriff Hodgson praised his staff for going \"above and beyond\" the required mental health protocols. However, it was later revealed through a leaked document that Hodgson's staff were responding to a different suicide attempt 6 minutes before Howe's suicide.\nFollowing public scrutiny, Hodgson ordered an internal investigation into seven deaths that occurred in 2015 and 2017.  It was determined that the staff had acted appropriately.\nIn 2018, inmates suffering from mental illness filed a class-action lawsuit against Hodgson, alleging they had \"suffered severe harm as the result of their confinement in solitary confinement or 'segregation.'\" Hodgson denied the allegations, stating that the inmates were being used by lawyers to further a political agenda of regulating solitary confinement more closely.\n\n\nSupport for Trump presidency\nIn November 2019, President Trump appointed Hodgson an honorary chair of his 2020 Massachusetts reelection campaign. Following the 2020 election, Hodgson spread unsupported claims that Trump lost reelection due to voter fraud. In August of 2023, President Trump appointed Hodgson as chair of his 2024 Massachusetts Presidential campaign. \n\n\nControversies\nIn Thomas Hodgson's official Bristol County Sheriff portrait from 2003, he is wearing a tie that resembles the Confederate flag. In 2020, community groups called for his resignation over his ties to white supremacy. Hodgson denied the tie was connected to the Confederacy and said he would continue to wear the necktie. Senator Ed Markey tweeted, \"No one, especially someone in law enforcement, should be wearing confederate symbols and doubling down on them when called out about it.\"\nIn 2014, Hodgson's daughter was taken into custody by New Bedford police for interfering with an investigation of a shooting, claiming \"Do you know that my father's the sheriff?\" The case against the 29-year-old was later dropped, the prosecutor stating to the judge that he was \"nol prossing\" the charge.\nIn August 2017, Hodgson was photographed at New Bedford's Feast of the Blessed Sacrament holding a cup of Madeira wine and carrying a firearm while wearing a Bristol County Sheriff's Office shirt. Community members called for Hodgson to be fined for carrying a firearm while drinking alcohol. Hodgson claimed he did not break any laws because he was not under the influence of alcohol after drinking Madeira wine.\nIn February 2019, the Massachusetts State Auditor, Suzanne Bump, released a report finding that under Hodgson's leadership, the Bristol County Sheriff's Office did not transfer  US$348,922 (equivalent to $429,125 in 2024) in reimbursements from Immigration and Customs Enforcement back to the state treasurer.\nHodgson is on the advisory board of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a hate group for its white supremacist and anti-immigrant stances.\n\n\nSee also\nAsh Street Jail\n\n\nReferences",

The songs were later presented in 33 1/3 rpm and 45 rpm sets, respectively. This set featured many of Bing's great hits such as: Silver Threads Among the Gold and Now Is the Hour.\n\n\nBackground\nBing Crosby had enjoyed unprecedented success during the 1940s with his discography showing six No. 1 hits in 1944 alone. His films such as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's were huge successes as were the Road films he made with Bob Hope. On radio, his Kraft Music Hall and Philco Radio Time shows were very popular. Decca Records built on this by issuing a number of 78rpm album sets, some featuring freshly recorded material and others utilizing Crosby's back catalogue. Ten of these sets were released in 1946, nine in 1947 and twelve more in 1948.\n\n\nReception\nBillboard commented:\n\nThis, the 12th Decca album of Crosby, shows Bing at his sober sentimental best, doing tunes selected for sacrosanct dignity and hallowed usage. Most of the sides have had field days as singles, but their group character is reasonably certain to insure the package of a wide sale. It’s a family album, with interest for almost anyone who buys pop music, gaffers and youngsters alike. Bing is especially mellow on the quality standards, “Whiffenpoof,” “Babe” and “Nellie,” and plenty good enough on the rest.\n\n\nTrack listing\nThese previously issued songs were featured on a 4-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-663.\n\n\nOther releases\nThe album with all of the same selections was transferred to a 10\" LP in 1949 with the catalog number DL 5028.

Naturalization applications are decided by the Minister of Justice within eight months of submission; minor children of a person granted citizenship are automatically granted Luxembourg nationality.\n\n\nAcquisition of nationality by option\nLuxembourg law also provides for the possibility to acquire nationality by option, which is a separate legal concept from naturalization.\nObtaining nationality by option is permitted in the following ten cases:\n\nAdults with a parent (biological or adopted) or grandparent who is/was a Luxembourger and was unable to pass Luxembourg nationality to the person at birth (e.g. due to the nationality laws of another country forbidding it);\nParents of Luxembourg minors (requires 5 years of residency, including the 12 months prior to the option declaration, and passing both the Luxembourgish language exam and the civics course or exam);\nPersons who are married to a Luxembourg citizen (requires passing both the Luxembourgish language exam and the civics course or exam; no minimum residency or marriage length requirement for spouses living in Luxembourg; 3 years of marriage required for spouses living outside Luxembourg);\nPersons aged 12 or above who were born in Luxembourg and did not automatically become a citizen at birth due to neither of their parents being Luxembourg citizens or born in Luxembourg (requires 5 years of continuous residency and for at least one parent to have lived continuously in Luxembourg for at least 12 months immediately prior to the person's birth);\nAdults who have completed at least 7 years' schooling in Luxembourg (requires 12 months continuous residency immediately prior to the citizenship application);\nAdults who have legally resided in Luxembourg for at least 20 years (requires 12 months continuous residency immediately prior to the citizenship application and a total of 24 hours of attendance at a Luxembourgish language course, but no requirement to pass the language exam);\nAdults who have fulfilled the obligations of the Welcome and Integration Contract (Contrat d'accueil et d'intégration) or the introductory modules of the Citizens' Pact for Intercultural Living (Biergerpakt), a free, optional course available to any foreigner living in Luxembourg (requires 5 years residency, including 12 months continuous residency immediately before the application, and passing both the Luxembourgish language exam and the civics course or exam);\nAdults who settled in Luxembourg before turning 18 (requires 5 years residency, including 12 months continuous residency before applying, and passing both the Luxembourgish language exam and the civics course or exam);\nAdults who are stateless, refugees or have subsidiary protection status (requires 5 years residency, including 12 months of continuous residency, and passing both the Luxembourgish language exam and the civics course or exam); or\nVolunteer soldiers who have completed one year of good and loyal service, as certified by the Luxembourg Army's Chief of Staff.\nAll of the options also have the same \"good repute\" requirements as for naturalization, i.e. the applicant must not have made any false statements in conjunction with the request for citizenship or have been issued an immediate custodial sentence of 12 months or more or a suspended custodial sentence of 24 months or more, in any country, if that sentence was not fully served within the fifteen years before the application for acquiring citizenship.\nOption declarations are taken before the administration of the commune of residence or, if the applicant is not resident in Luxembourg, the administration of Luxembourg City. If the Minister of Justice does not object to and cancel the option declaration, Luxembourg nationality is acquired four months after the declaration is received by the Minister of Justice; minor children of an adult granted nationality by option are also included on the option declaration and receive nationality when their parent does.\n\n\nRecovery of citizenship\nIt is also possible to \"recover\" or \"reclaim\" Luxembourg nationality if a person can prove that they have an ancestor who was a Luxembourg citizen as of 1 January 1900. The Luxembourgish diaspora at the time moved to France, Belgium and the USA. As of January 2022, a total of 31,151 people had claimed citizenship since the passing of the 2008 law, of which more than 11,000 were Brazilian nationals. The final deadline to reclaim citizenship for some qualifying individuals was moved to December 31, 2022 because of the Covid-19 Pandemic.\nThis has in part contributed to a considerable increase in the number of people eligible to vote in legislative elections, with 23,992 new voters counted between the 2018 and 2023 elections. In light of this evolution, ahead of the 2023 election, representatives of most major parties, such as Piraten deputy Sven Clement and déi Gréng deputy Djuna Bernard travelled to Florianopolis, Brazil to co-organize an election information event, an action which some, such as déi Lénk deputy Nathalie Oberweis, criticized as unnecessary and overly expensive. Ultimately, only 188 of the 19,000 eligible voters registered to vote, by post, in the election.\n\n\nLoss of nationality\nA Luxembourg citizen aged 18 or over may renounce their citizenship at any time, free of charge, provided that doing so would not render them stateless.\nA Luxembourg citizen who became such by naturalization, option, or recovery may be stripped of their citizenship if it emerges that they obtained it by making false statements or through a marriage of convenience, provided that such an action would not render them stateless.\n\n\nMultiple citizenship\nSince 1 January 2009, Luxembourg has allowed multiple citizenship. Since then, many Belgians have made use of the new law to adopt Belgian-Luxembourg citizenship, especially Belgians living in Arelerland, a part of the Belgian province of Luxembourg at the border with the Grand Duchy.\n\n\nCitizenship of the European Union\nBecause Luxembourg forms part of the European Union, Luxembourg citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Luxembourg embassy, Luxembourg citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country. Luxembourgish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.\n\n\nTravel freedom of Luxembourg citizens\n\nVisa requirements for Luxembourg citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Luxembourg. In 2015, Luxembourg citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 171 countries and territories, ranking the Luxembourg passport 3rd in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.\nIn 2017, Luxembourg nationality is ranked sixteenth in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n(in French) Luxembourg's Ministry of Justice website\n(in French) About the new nationality law\n\n\nSee also\nLuxembourgish passport",

    "title": "Glenbrook Tunnel (1892)",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=43828578",
    "text": "The Glenbrook Tunnel is a heritage-listed single-track former railway tunnel that has also seen use as a mustard gas storage facility and as a mushroom farm. It is located on the former Main Western Line (since deviated) at Glenbrook, New South Wales, Australia. The Department of Railways designed the tunnel and built it from 1891 to 1892. It is also known as Lapstone Hill tunnel and Former Glenbrook Railway and World War II Mustard Gas Storage Tunnel. The property is owned by Blue Mountains City Council and Land and Property Management Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011. The railway tunnel was originally part of the Glenbrook 1892 single-track deviation, which bypassed the Lapstone Zig Zag across the Blue Mountains. It is 634 metres; 693 yards (31.5 chains) long and is constructed in an 'S' shape with a gradient of 1:33.\nThe tunnel was built to the east of Glenbrook railway station and opened on 18 December 1892. Due to the steep gradient, seepage keeping the rails wet causing slippage, poor ventilation and planned duplication of the track, plans were drawn up to bypass the steep route. Trains commonly stalled in the tunnel for some time before having to back the locomotive out of the tunnel for another attempt. The tunnel was closed on 25 September 1913, and was utilised for growing mushrooms. In 1942, during World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) stockpiled bulk mustard gas stocks in preparation for a possible Japanese chemical weapons attack. The facility was known as No. 2 Sub Depot of No. 1 Central Reserve RAAF and was vacated by the RAAF after the war. It features in the \"Alcatraz Down Under\" episode of Cities of the Underworld on the History Channel.\nin July 2021, the local state member Stuart Ayres announced that the NSW Government had allocated $2.5 million to progress the opening of the tunnel for public recreation\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nUse as a railway tunnel\n\nThe original line of railway was opened in 1867, scaling the escarpment above Emu Plains by the Lapstone Zig Zag. At the top of the Zig Zag the railway followed the route now occupied by the Great Western Highway through Glenbrook as far as Blaxland. When increased rail traffic caused delays on the Lapstone Zig Zag, it was decided in 1891 that a tunnel should be built bypassing the Zig Zag. The tunnel and its new approaches were designed to form an elegant S-shape, starting at the Bottom Points of the Zig Zag and ending at old Glenbrook station (now demolished, on the present Great Western Highway).\nThe building of the tunnel in 1891-2 was contracted to George Proudfoot, whose labourers and their families were established in two substantial camps at either end of the works, one at Glenbrook, the other at Lapstone. Sir Arthur Streeton's famous painting 'Fire's On!', saw the building of the tunnel and the fatal blasting accident which killed Thomas Lawless become a part of Australian mythology as well as railway history. Streeton was spending three months at Glenbrook at the end of 1891 where he was studying and painting the landscape. He had become interested in the construction of the railway tunnel and the engineering feat that was the Zig Zag Railway. The tunnel was also depicted in several other works, both informal and informal. Among these were Cutting the Lapstone Tunnel (1892) and Sketch - Blue Mountains (1891).\nThe new tunnel opened to traffic on 18 December 1892, but it was never a success, because of the steep incline and the suffocating atmosphere particularly in the west-bound trains. Traffic flow and water dripping from the roof also caused engines to slip badly on the reverse curve. The problem was finally addressed after the Lithgow Zig Zag deviation was completed in 1910 and the railway gangs were moved to Glenbrook. Bypassing Glenbrook Tunnel involved some major works, including a new viaduct over Knapsack Gully to the east and the new line then ran through virgin country south of the old alignment as far as the present Lapstone station and then turned west through a short tunnel under The Bluff and finally north to the present Glenbrook station.\nInitially it was planned to continue using the 1892 Glenbrook Tunnel for up trains. When the new deviation opened on 11 May 1913 the tunnel was still used for east-bound trains. However, the deviation was quickly duplicated and a new \"up line was activated in September. Glenbrook Tunnel was last used for trains on 25 September 1913 and old Glenbrook station was closed. The lines in the tunnel were raised and the tunnel left to quietly decay.\nIn 1913 the Glenbrook tunnel was leased from NSW Railways by Herbert Edward Rowe, an out of work master builder. Previously a Stan Breakspear had fenced off an area close to the tunnel where he kept a bull. The Rowes had the idea of growing mushrooms in the tunnel. They created living quarters from an old circus tent, a small cave and a culvert under the highway. Herbert Rowe built his own mushroom growing beds which were three metres wide with a narrow path down the left side for access and working space. About three quarters of the length of the tunnel was taken up by the beds. When the Rowes renewed their lease in 1936 the Commissioner of Railways warned them that in the event of war, they would be given three months notice to vacate the site. The Rowes are believed to have actually been given only one weeks notice to vacate the site when war broke out in September 1939.\nIn 1930 Australia ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol which banned the use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases in times of war for offensive purposes, following the experiences of chemical warfare during World War I.\n\n\nWeapons storage facility\n\nAlthough tear gas was used as early as 1914, it was not until 1915 that poisonous gases were introduced into the battles of World War One. The first was chlorine gas which was introduced by the Germans at the Second battle of Ypres in April 1915. This was followed by the use of phosphene Gas, also introduced by the Germans. These attacked victims' respiratory organs causing coughing and choking.\nThe Germans used Mustard Gas, a more advanced gas, for the first time at Riga (or Yperite) in September 1917. It caused both internal and external blistering in its victims. The blistering was often delayed and remained in the ground for weeks afterwards making capture of infected trenches dangerous. Protection against mustard gas was far more difficult than previous gases. Casualties decreased during the war with increased preparedness and death from gas became less common. However, often those who were exposed were often unable to seek employment once they were discharged from the army due to the gases effects. Following the Armistice the use of gas was viewed with horror, bringing about the Geneva Protocol. However, it is important to note that while the Protocol prevented signatories using gas for offensive purposes, it did not prevent a nation from manufacturing or importing chemical weapons for retaliatory purposes.\nThe Geneva Protocol was drawn up and signed at the conference for the supervision of the international trade in arms and ammunition, which was held in Geneva under the auspices of the League of Nations from 4 May to 17 June 1925. France suggested that a protocol be drawn up on non-use of poisonous gases. At Poland's suggestion the prohibition was extended to bacteriological weapons. In the years prior to World War II most major powers ratified the protocol, except the U.S. and Japan. The British reserved the right to waive the protocol if in time of war their enemies disregarded the terms of the agreement. Countries around the world have continued to ratify the Protocol until at least 1991.\nAustralia's ratification of the protocol was influenced by the experiences of Australian World War One soldiers who had suffered from the deadly and debilitating effects of gas exposure, particularly on the Western Front. Many were killed or maimed as the result of chemical attacks. The physical effects on survivors were clearly visible to those at home upon their return.\n\n\nUse during World War II\n\nBy 1937, two years before World War II commenced, Australia was already giving preliminary consideration to the need for procurement of gas for war time defence purposes. Early in 1942 the Japanese southward advance, particularly the fall of Singapore, caused Australia to prepare for possible invasion. Of particular concern was whether Japan would use chemical weapons as it had in China. Australia requested chemical warfare stocks from Britain in March. The response from Britain to supply Australia was swift and the first supplies docked in Australia in May 1942. Later stocks would also come from the United States. Australia would eventually hold close to 1 million individual chemical munitions weapons, including at least 16 different types of mustard gas. Thirty-five types of chemical weapons were eventually located at fifteen major storage depots across Australia.\nThe first stocks of chemical weapons destined for the RAAF were stored in the Blue Mountains while those for the army went to Albury. Naval stocks were stored at the Newington Armory in Sydney. The RAAF stocks were stored in disused tunnels, chosen because of the lower fluctuation in temperature, protection from high temperatures and constant humidity. In places such as Malaya, caves were used for the same purposes and the tunnels were anticipated to simulate the same conditions as the caves. Industrial scale production or bulk manufacturing of chemical warfare agents did not and has not taken place within Australia, although some chemical agents have been produced here as by-products of other industrial processes or in bulk for other purposes. There has also been small scale manufacture of chemical agents for experimental and testing purposes.\nThe Glenbrook tunnel was one of fifteen bulk chemical storage facilities established in Australia - seven in New South Wales, six in Queensland, one in the Northern Territory and one in Victoria. Six were supervised by the United States, including Kingswood in NSW, and the remainder by Australia. Only four of these included tunnels for storage purposes. These were Marrangaroo, Glenbrook and Clarence in the Blue Mountains and Picton south of Sydney. They were all Australian supervised sites. Marrangaroo and Glenbrook were the first of the tunnels established followed by Picton and then Clarence. The Picton tunnel was constructed as part of the original main southern railway line. The remaining three were a part of the Zig Zag railway line. The four tunnels formed the base for the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 1 Central Reserve. The headquarters for No 1CR were based at the combined RAAF-Army depot at Marangaroo, several kilometres from the Marangaroo tunnel. No. 1 CR acted as a central depot for chemical and non chemical stocks and as a replenishment centre for NSW. The location of the tunnels also placed them out of the range of aircraft carriers and out of aerial view, thus protecting them from air attack.\nThe British oversaw the initial establishment of chemical agents handling procedures. On 6 January 1942 the Air Board approved the take-over of the disused 660-metre (2,170 ft) railway tunnel at Glenbrook by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for the storage of bombs. On 9 August 1942 arrangements for the first intake of chemicals at Glenbrook were advised with material being received from the ship MV Nigerstrromm. When further supplies of chemicals arrived it was decided to move high explosive stocks from Glenbrook and Picton and devote these tunnels to gas stocks alone. Glenbrook housed mainly mustard gas from late August 1942. The RAAF stacked the Glenbrook tunnel from end to end with containers to store thousands of tonnes of mustard gas, a thick fluid that looked like oil. To accommodate facilities for maintenance and inspection, venting and decanting containers and decontamination of damaged hardware, an area was set up in the lower/eastern end cutting leading from the tunnel.\nAdditional shipments of gas in 1943-44 compelled the commissioning of Clarence tunnel to take the overflow. By 7 February 1944 the transfer of chemical weapons stocks from No. 2 Sub Depot, Glenbrook to Clarence Tunnel began. By August 1944 the RAAF decided that chemical weapons stocks and equipment other than obsolete items should be held substantially in forward areas and that No. 1 CR would become a transit point rather than a storage area to facilitate the supply of chemical weapons to forward unit should retaliatory chemical warfare action be sanctioned. two storage locations were subsequently chosen in north eastern Australia.\nDuring the peak period for the arrival of chemicals from Great Britain and the African desert zone Glenbrook railway siding was inadequate for the transport operations and associated influx of railway wagons and motor vehicles. Therefore, trains were kept at Penrith and batches of 14-20 wagons brought to Glenbrook as required.\nIn 1946, following the end of the war, the Australian Defence Committee agreed to the Army and RAAF requests to dispose of chemical ammunition. The Australian Government faced a dilemma as to how to dispose of the stocks of chemicals. Neither the Army or the Air Force had experience with disposal. As a result, trials were conducted to determine the best form of large scale chemical destruction. Burning, sea dumping and venting were found appropriate for the different types of chemicals. Fire was found to be the most appropriate for mustard gas. Gas was burned from storage sites at Talmoi and 88 Mile. The stocks at Marangaroo and Glenbrook were the last to be burned. The disposal took place in the Newnes State Forest during February and March 1946 when 2,000 tonnes (2,200 short tons) were incinerated. Post war inspections showed that the burn had been incomplete and redisposal operations were conducted between 1947 and 1949, including reburning some items and the use of bleach. Final decontamination took place in 1980 when approximately 2,500 tonnes (2,800 short tons) of mainly soil residue were removed from the Newnes State Forest burn site to the nearby Marrangaroo Ammunition Depot to be burned in a pit and bleached. Glenbrook later reverted to its former use as a mushroom farm.\nGlenbrook was considered the most pleasant of the tunnel depots by the men who worked with the gas. The site was described in 1943 as about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) into the bush. The camp consisted of the headquarters, orderly room a store, alcove for maintenance carpenter, mess hut with a big stone fireplace and an open fire to cook on, masonite and wooden framed sleeping huts which had replaced tents. The huts had shutters at the top and bottom which could be propped open shower and toilet blocks and a small transport section hut. Workers were required to do maintenance on the containers wearing gumboots, rubber gloves and heavy woollen clothing. Small burns were common if the men got gas on their skin. During the summer months RAAF staff from the Glenbrook camp were called out to fight bushfires. The purpose of their presence at Glenbrook was a long-held secret as was the testing and later disposal of the gas.\nDuring operation the s curved, 650-metre (2,130 ft) tunnel was long and dark with widely spaced lighting. On the left hand side at the start of the tunnel were small containers, canisters in wooden crates. About midway canisters were located on one side and drums on the other. Further along, the sides that the canisters and drums were stored on were reversed. The tunnel had very little clearance, making it difficult for the trucks to back into the tunnel to load and unload the chemicals. The exterior ends of the tunnel were constructed of brick with stone capping. During WWII the RAAF installed a concrete grid floor in the tunnel and installed a telephone system for security purposes. It was apparently initially used by the RAAF to store 227-kilogram (500 lb) bombs.\n\n\nCurrent-day use\nPost World War II, all four tunnels were used for mushroom growing purposes. Glenbrook tunnel has since been abandoned. In 1992 the lessee commenced growing exotic mushrooms not previously produced in Australia. Other tunnels not used for mustard gas storage have also been used as mushroom tunnels, including one at Mittagong and another near Helensburgh. The Marrangaroo storage tunnel has also been abandoned, while the Clarence tunnel forms part of the Zig Zag Tourist Railway and Picton has become a tourist attraction with a \"ghostly past\". The World War II history of the tunnel's use was not widely known until the early twenty-first century. This \"hidden history\" was the subject of significant interest when it was finally made known.\nIn 2021, it was announced that the state government will be funding works to transform the tunnel as a publicly accessible walking track, cycleway, and heritage tourist attraction, as well as better connecting the Lower Blue Mountains to neighbouring Leonay and Penrith.\n\n\nDescription\nThe S curved railway tunnel is constructed internally of brick (some areas are cement rendered) and a cement floor. It is approximately 660 metres (2,170 ft) in length, passing beneath the ridge which carried the Zig Zag line and now the Great Western Highway. The western end, which is the main entry point, is located near to the edge boundary of Knapsack Reserve. The eastern end is located near Railway Reserve/Darkes Common. To the south of the main entry is the Great Western Highway. Knapsack Reserve is north of the main entry.\nThe tunnel is laid out in reverse curves with transitions. The western entry is accessed from an unformed road through a series of large, older tin shed and outbuildings used by the existing tenant for business purposes. The road gives way to a gravel track large enough for use by vehicles. Vegetation is encroaching on the track. This appears to be covering stone walls which would have formed the 60-metre (200 ft) western railway approaches dug out when creating the tunnel and the deviation. An open shed is located close to the tunnel entry sheltering a variety of equipment. The eastern end was not accessible in 2010.\nThe entry is characterised by a large three ring brick parabolic arch with a sandstone outer curve and a horizontally articulated entablature constructed of axe-faced and margined stone ashlars. The top of the entablature course to the former rail level is approximately 8 metres (26 ft). The face brickwork of the surround is plumb and laid in English bond. The arch is flanked by brick buttresses/battered piers on either side of the entrance. Beyond these are short sandstone retaining walls laid in squared rubble. An undated light fitting on bracket is located centrally over the arch. The arch opening has been filled in with sheets of iron, exhaust fan and a roller door to secure and ventilate the tunnel for the current occupier.\nThe eastern entry is similar to the western entry, although the flanking piers are a little wider due to the slightly wider railway cutting. This is in part due to the approach to hillside at the western cutting being generally steeper.\nInside, both painted and unpainted brick and cement rendered wall and roof surfaces are visible throughout the tunnel. The brick work is laid in English bond for 40 courses above the present floor, above which the height changes to stretcher bond. The shape of the tunnel is a continuation of the entrance arch. Weep holes are located in the walls about two courses above ground level that are one course high and about 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) apart. A variety of services suspended from the roof and fixtures primarily associated with the current use are visible, including piping and racking. A strip of fluorescent lighting is located down the centre of the tunnel. What appear to be drainage ditches are located along both walls the full length of the tunnel. All railway tracks have been removed and the concrete floor has replaced what was probably a ballast surface, as has evidence of the mustard gas storage facility. The floor has an even grade of 1 in 33 upwards from east to west.\nRegularly placed recessed refuges designed as safe spaces for railway workers caught in the tunnel as a train approached are located down both sides of the tunnel about 48 metres (157 ft) apart. They are 686 millimetres (27.0 in) deep, 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) wide and 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 in) high and are characterised by a three ring segmental arch.\n\n\nCondition\n\nAs at 15 December 2010, the tunnel structure appears to be in very good condition visually. Mushroom racks and associated infrastructure and infil at the end of the tunnel appear to be non structural and easily reversed if desired.\nThe tunnel structure does not appear to have been significantly altered. The most obvious alterations are the apparent replacement of the railway tracks and ballast with a concrete floor, and removal of any purpose built facilities associated with the mustard gas storage.\n\n\nModifications and dates\n1913 - Railway lines removed\nc. 1913 - mushroom growing beds installed\nc. 1939-42 - mushroom growing beds removed for establishment of mustard gas storage\nPost 1945 - converted for mushroom growing\n\n\nHeritage listing\nAs at 22 February 2011, the former Glenbrook Railway Tunnel and Mustard Gas Storage Depot has outstanding significance as one of a series of only four tunnels, in NSW that physically embody Australian policy towards bulk chemical gas storage during World War II for defensive purposes on home soil. The presence of the gas for use only when the opposition attacked with chemical weapons, represents Australia's ongoing commitment to honouring the articles of the 1925 Geneva Protocol to which Australia submitted an instrument of ratification in 1930. It also demonstrates Australia's increasing awareness and fear of the threat posed by Axis forces, particularly Japan and the preparedness of Australia and the Allied Forces to employ antihumanitarian weapons widely condemned in World War One, in the event that the Axis powers used such weapons in an attack.\nGlenbrook Railway and World War II Mustard Gas Storage Tunnel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\nThe tunnel has state historical significance as one of only four tunnels located in NSW, secretly identified and established for storage of chemical weapons for defence purposes in the event of an attack on Australian shores during World War II. The tunnel is a reminder of this secret NSW and Australian military history not publicly known about until the first years of the twenty first century. The facility was part of a much larger process of acquisition, storage, testing and disposal of poisonous gas. Many men suffered from contact with the gas and were unable to discuss their experiences of war on the home front for many years. Its establishment was a direct response to the Australian government's fear of invasion by the Japanese, particularly after the fall of Singapore to Japan in 1942, and the potential for the Japanese to use poisonous gas against Australia. The facility also reflects the changing course of World War II and the willing use by Australia of clauses in the Geneva Protocol which prevented signatories from utilising poisonous gas for attack purposes, but did allow them to use it for retaliatory purposes in the event that they were attacked with poisonous gas.\nThe tunnel has local significance as a railway tunnel constructed to bypass the Lapstone Zig Zag as rail traffic, and subsequently delays, increased on the zig zag line. In the twenty years that it operated the tunnel gained a fearsome reputation among locomotive crews and travellers for the unpleasantness of the journey due to the choking smoke and fumes.\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\nThe site has historical associations at a state and national level with the British and United States Military forces who were involved in the establishment of chemical weapons in Australia during World War II. It also has associations with the Defence Force Armourers responsible for maintaining the facilities in Australia, in particular the Royal Australian Air Force's No 1 Central Reserve. The tunnel has high state and national significance for its direct association with events which directly resulted from the Australian and other government's ratification of the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of chemical warfare for offensive purposes.\nAs the subject of the 1891 painting, Fire's On by Arthur Streeton, it is the inspiration for a picture that has been described as one of the great icons of Australian landscape painting. The tunnel and its eastern approaches in particular also featured in a number of other works by Streeton, thereby making the site as subject of these paintings significant to the state.\nThe place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nThe Glenbrook Tunnel has state significant as being important to Defence Force Armourers and their families across NSW as evidence of the long hidden and previously disbelieved story of their work during World War II. It is also important to the defence forces generally as evidence of a previously suppressed aspect of their history.\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\nThe Glenbrook Tunnel is state significant, being rare as one of only four tunnels in New South Wales identified for chemical gas storage purposes during World War II, three of which are located within the Blue Mountain region. Unlike the remaining three tunnels, the Glenbrook tunnel is the only tunnel to retain its original post railway use, mushroom growing.\nThe tunnel has local significance as the only major item of surviving fabric from one of the three railway ascents of the eastern escarpment.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\nGlenbrook tunnel has local significance as being representative of tunnels constructed on the Main Western Line from the 1890s and into the early twentieth century to cater for increasing traffic on the railway line. The tunnel is a fine example of engineering in brickwork, displaying a substantial vaulted form of elliptical cross section, double curved in plan.\n\n\nSee also\n\nGlenbrook Deviation (1892)\nLapstone Zig Zag\nList of railway tunnels in New South Wales\nList of tunnels in Australia\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\"Bunkers, Tunnels and Fortifications in Australia during World War Two\". 2009.\nGillis, Richard G.

    "summary": "The Glenbrook Tunnel is a heritage-listed single-track former railway tunnel that has also seen use as a mustard gas storage facility and as a mushroom farm. It is located on the former Main Western Line (since deviated) at Glenbrook, New South Wales, Australia. The Department of Railways designed the tunnel and built it from 1891 to 1892. It is also known as Lapstone Hill tunnel and Former Glenbrook Railway and World War II Mustard Gas Storage Tunnel. The property is owned by Blue Mountains City Council and Land and Property Management Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011. The railway tunnel was originally part of the Glenbrook 1892 single-track deviation, which bypassed the Lapstone Zig Zag across the Blue Mountains. It is 634 metres; 693 yards (31.5 chains) long and is constructed in an 'S' shape with a gradient of 1:33.\nThe tunnel was built to the east of Glenbrook railway station and opened on 18 December 1892. Due to the steep gradient, seepage keeping the rails wet causing slippage, poor ventilation and planned duplication of the track, plans were drawn up to bypass the steep route. Trains commonly stalled in the tunnel for some time before having to back the locomotive out of the tunnel for another attempt. The tunnel was closed on 25 September 1913, and was utilised for growing mushrooms. In 1942, during World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) stockpiled bulk mustard gas stocks in preparation for a possible Japanese chemical weapons attack. The facility was known as No. 2 Sub Depot of No. 1 Central Reserve RAAF and was vacated by the RAAF after the war. It features in the \"Alcatraz Down Under\" episode of Cities of the Underworld on the History Channel.\nin July 2021, the local state member Stuart Ayres announced that the NSW Government had allocated $2.5 million to progress the opening of the tunnel for public recreation",

    "text": "The William Howard School is a co-educational secondary academy school on Longtown Road (A6071) in Brampton, Carlisle, Cumbria, England for pupils aged 11–18.\n\n\nHistory\nThe school is named after Lord William Howard (1563–1640), who was the third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. He married Elizabeth, the daughter and co-heiress of William, Lord Dacre, from whom the Naworth Castle branch of the Howard Family is descended. A Grade II monument of William Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, is positioned on one of the highest hills to one side of the town of Brampton, known as the Mote.\nThe school used to be known as the Irthing Valley Secondary Modern School, and was built between 1949 and 1953. It merged with another school in Brampton, the White House Grammar School situated on Main Street, in 1980 when comprehensive education replaced the selective education system. The ex-BBC newsreader Anna Ford was a head girl of White House Grammar School in 1961. More recently, the school had to be expanded after the closure of Lochinvar school in Longtown in 2008. A new performing arts block was built in 2010, allowing the old drama suite to be extensively refurbished to become the new sixth form centre, which was officially opened by Radio 1 DJ Greg James on 10 May 2011. The school used to have an outdoor swimming pool, but the block which is currently the sixth form centre was built on the site of the pool in the 1990s.\nWilliam Howard School was awarded Specialist Science status in 2004, Leading Edge status in 2005 and the International School Award in 2007. The school converted to become an academy in August 2011. It retained its own sixth form centre after some argument over a proposed merger with a larger Carlisle Sixth Form Centre.\nIn October 2014 it was announced that William Howard School will become the sponsor of the new Workington Academy in Workington in September 2015. The resulting multi-academy trust was called the Cumbrian Education Trust; it accepted responsibility for Whitehaven Academy and six primary schools.\n\n\nThe school today\nCurrently, the school has approximately 1600 pupils. The school has science laboratories, computer rooms, and a learning resources centre. It has a gym and a full size floodlit all-weather pitch. The school has a partner school in Tanzania.\nAfter school hours the school acts as a centre for adult education, theatrical and music performances, clubs and community meetings. The large open foyer frequently serves as a gallery space for local artists.\n\n\nTanzanian link\nFounded in 1989, the William Howard School – Uru Secondary School link has been, and continues to be, a great asset to both the Uru and Brampton communities.\nThe rural village of Uru is located in the Moshi district of Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania. About 8 miles from Moshi,  the village itself is on the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. The Uru Secondary School is a co-ed church school with about 400 students in Forms 1 to 4. The Link was formed in 1987 when the coordinator, Phil Furneaux, met the Chair of Uru School Governors at an Energy Conference in Cumbria. At first WHS sent textbooks and other gifts to Uru.  The first exchange took place in 1989 when a group of 13 students from WHS went to Uru.  Since then there has been an exchange visit each way every other year except in 2002 when the visit was postponed due to a terrorist threat.\nA few Uru students come to study in the sixth form at WHS on long term visits, and a number of WHS students go to teach English at Uru School during their gap years.\nHowever, the school cut ties with Tanzania in 2023, the reason unknown to students. The school does however have a link with Taiwan, with Taiwanese students coming to the school and staying for at least a week at a time every few years and has planned to have trips to Taiwan in return for the students in the Cultural Ambassadors program.\n\n\nSport\nThe school regularly competes at local level within Cumbria and has a history of schoolboy level FA Cup runs.\nFacilities include a fitness suite and also an astroturf pitch.\nOn the astroturf is run Carlisle and Brampton Six a Side League. There are currently 39 teams playing in five divisions. Fixtures are generally played on astroturf on Tuesdays and Friday nights.\nIn the three Tuesday leagues the two lowest placed teams are relegated to the division below. The two highest placed teams are promoted. Teams play each other three times a season.\n\n\ntheReview\ntheReview is a sixth form student newspaper that was relaunched after a two-year hiatus, in September 2012. The publication is completely and independently managed by students, all aged 16 to 17.\n\n\nYoung Enterprise\nThe school has been a strong supporter of the Young Enterprise charity. It teaches young people about business through practical methods. Students have to set up their own company, create a product, and sell it. They also have to write a detailed report on the company, as well as set up two trade stands in Carlisle, and present their findings to a panel of judges.\n\n\nNotable alumni\nAnna Ford, newsreader and former BBC and ITV broadcaster\nLucy Rose, writer and filmmaker\nAnna Nicholson, 2024 Bronze medal Paralympian.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWilliam Howard School Website\nCumbria Education Trust Website\nBrampton Live Festival website",

Ross Robertson Cup in franchise history, scoring 109 points in just 58 regular season games. Raddysh was named a Third Team All-Star at the conclusion of the season. On May 15, 2017, Raddysh was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nOn January 6, 2018, Raddysh along with Detroit Red Wings prospect Jordan Sambrook were traded to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in exchange for Hayden Fowler and nine draft picks. Following the 2017–18 season, Raddysh participated at the Lightning's 2018–19 training camp. He was reassigned to the Lightning's American Hockey League affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, on September 23. On December 28, 2018, in a game against the Utica Comets, he recorded 5 assists in a 10–0 Crunch win. His 46 points (18 goals, 28 assists) helped lead the Crunch to a division title.\nOn April 19, 2021, Raddysh was named the CCM/AHL Player of the Week for the period ending April 18, 2021. He scored three goals and added three assists in three games, including scoring his first career shorthanded goal.\nOn October 13, 2021, Raddysh made his NHL debut with the Tampa Bay Lightning against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Amalie Arena. On November 1, 2021, Raddysh recorded his first career NHL assist and point. On December 4, 2021, Raddysh recorded his first career NHL goal in a 3-2 Lightning OT win over the Boston Bruins at TD Garden. Raddysh was the 5th player in Lightning history to score a shorthanded goal as their first career goal.\nOn March 18, 2022, the Lightning, looking to bolster their offense for an upcoming playoff run, traded Raddysh along with teammate Boris Katchouk and two first-round picks in 2023 and 2024 to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for forward Brandon Hagel and two fourth-round draft picks. Raddysh appeared in 21 games for Chicago to close out the 2021–22 NHL season, where he accrued 10 points. In his first full season with the Blackhawks, Raddysh tallied 37 points, including a team-high 20 goals during the 2022–23 NHL season. His most productive stint of the season came between March 8 through 14, where he recorded six goals and one assist over four games.\nFollowing a disappointing 2023–24 season in which he managed only five goals and nine assists for 14 points, Raddysh did not receive a qualifying offer from the Blackhawks and became a free agent.\nOn July 1, 2024, Raddysh signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Washington Capitals. As a fixture in the lineup amongst the Capitals bottom six forwards, Raddysh registered 7 goals and 27 points through 80 appearances in a successful 2024–25 season with Washington.\nAt the conclusion of his contract, Raddysh left as a free agent and was signed to a two-year, $3 million contract with the New York Rangers on July 1, 2025.\n\n\nInternational play\n\nInternationally, Raddysh represented Canada at the 2017 World Junior Championships, becoming the 4th player in Team Canada history to score 4 goals in a game against Latvia on December 29, 2016.

Through Arc Dream Publishing, Ivey edited and published other games including Monsters and Other Childish Things, Wild Talents, Puppetland, and Better Angels. Ivey contributed to the books Rivendell, Horse-lords of Rohan, and Oaths of the Riddermark for Cubicle 7 Entertainment's J.R.R. Tolkien-based roleplaying game The One Ring Roleplaying Game. Ivey cowrote Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game with Dennis Detwiller, Adam Scott Glancy, and Greg Stolze, and cowrote or published 34 books in the award-winning Delta Green line between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Shane Ivey :: Pen & Paper RPG Database\".

    "text": "The Exclusive Agreement of 1892 was a treaty signed between the British and the Rulers of the Sheikhdoms of the Lower Gulf, then known as the Trucial States and today the United Arab Emirates. \nThe treaty bound the Rulers of the Trucial States to the British government, to deal only with the British and not to make any agreements regarding land or territorial rights with any foreign power. It effectively cemented the status of the Trucial States as a British protectorate, although did not formally confer protectorate status on the Sheikhdoms, a status the British were to withhold until they announced the unilateral abrogation of all of the treaties they entered into with the Trucial States on 16 January 1968. \nThe revocation of all of these treaties formally took place on the 1st December 1971, the day before the accession to the act of Union which would mark the foundation of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nBackground\nIn the 1890s, the Trucial States offered little, if any, resource of strategic interest to Britain. Oil would not be discovered, or its possibility entertained, until the 1920s. Pearling, although at the time a lucrative industry, was not taxed and therefore offered no revenue to HMG. Any role of the Trucial States in providing protection for the British trade route to its imperial asset, India, was eclipsed by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the British acquisition of a controlling interest in the canal in 1882. It has been argued that the move to implement the Exlusive Agreement was therefore a purely instinctual reaction to increased interest being shown in the region by the French, Germans, Ottomans and Persians.\nThe first sign of direct Persian interest in acquiring a measure of influence over the Trucial States was in 1887, with the landing at Abu Dhabi of the former deputy Governor of Bushire, Sartip Haji Ahmad Khan. The British Resident at Bushire, Charles Edward Ross, tasked the Residency steamer, Lawrence, to track Ahmad Khan, who visited Abu Dhabi for a few days before travelling to Dubai and then leaving for Lingeh on a local vessel from Abu Dhabi. A colourful figure, Ahmad Khan wore full ceremonial uniform throughout his visit. British officials remained in the dark about his intentions until Rashid bin Maktoum Al Maktoum of Dubai confided in Turki bin Said, the Sultan of Muscat, telling him that Ahmad Khan had proposed that Persia would back the overthrow of the British.\nAlarmed by this information, Ross in December 1887 obtained an agreement from the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Ras Al Khaimah that they would not deal with any foreign government other than the British and would not allow any other government to establish a representative in their territories. Ahmad Khan once again attempted to visit the Trucial States, with a force of troops from Qeshm in January 1888, but was refused landing at Musandam and proceeded instead to Umm Al Quwain where he met the Ruler, the turbulent Ahmad bin Abdullah Al Mualla. Ahmad had already had a number of run-ins with the British and had been found to have breached the Perpetual Maritime Truce on a number of occasions, but rejected Ahmad Khan's approach.\nA formal British complaint was subsequently made to Tehran, which disowned Ahmad Khan.\nTwo French nationals, suspected by the British of being agents, now visited Umm Al Quwain and were received cordially. Named Tramier and Chapuy, they distributed French flags, which allowed local traders to ferry contraband, including slaves from Africa, with impunity against British interdiction. News that Ahmad bin Abdullah had granted them land in Umm Al Quwain led to the new British Resident, Adelbert Talbot, drawing up a formal treaty based on the 1887 text of Ross' agreement and presenting this to the six Trucial Rulers and also to the Ruler of Bahrain. The treaty made the Trucial States a 'protectorate in all but name'.\n\n\nTreaty\nThe treaty consisted of a single page of text and three points and bound the Trucial Rulers ‘not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government’ and that they would not, without permission from that government, ‘consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other government’. Furthermore, they would not ‘cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government.’ There was no reciprocal provision for the British to accept responsibility for the defence of the Trucial States.\nThe treaty was signed between 5 and 8 March 1892 by Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi of Ajman; Ahmad bin Abdullah Al Mualla of Umm Al Quwain; Humaid bin Abdulla Al Qasimi of Sharjah; Rashid bin Maktoum Al Maktoum of Dubai and Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and on 14 March 1892 by Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa of Bahrain.\nFujairah would not accede to the Exclusive Agreement (and the other applying treaties) until 1952, when it was granted Trucial status by the British.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Berthold Klaus Paul Horn (born December 8, 1943) is an American scientist working in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. He is Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is also Principal Investigator at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT.\nHorn is the author of two books and over 300 articles. His research is focused on Machine Vision, Computational Imaging, Suppressing Traffic Flow Instabilities and Indoor Navigation.\nHorn was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2002 for contributions to computer vision, including the recovery of three-dimensional geometry from image intensities. He received the Azriel Rosenfeld Award by IEEE in 2009.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHorn was born in Teplice, German-occupied Czechoslovakia (currently in Czech Republic). His family emigrated from Germany to South Africa after World War II and Horn was brought up there. He joined the University of Witwatersrand in 1961 for his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering studies. After completing his bachelor's degree in 1965, Horn taught Numerical Analysis at the university. During this time, he also worked as a consultant for the South African Navy to help them predict tides in the harbors.\nOne of his Professors, Derek S. Henderson, who contributed significantly in bringing the first computer to the University of Witwatersrand was, at the time, working on bringing a more powerful computer to the university. In order to facilitate the process and arrange the required software and equipment, Henderson asked Horn to travel to the U.S. During the trip, he visited several universities, took the GSAT examination and decided to study at MIT for his master's degree and later Ph.D. After completing his Ph.D. in 1970, Horn traveled back to South Africa and briefly taught at the University of Witwatersrand. Later he moved back to the United States and started teaching at MIT.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1970, he began teaching at MIT and continued teaching there for the next 4 decades, becoming associate professor in 1976 and Professor in 1984. In 1983, he was appointed as the Associate Editor of Computer Vision and Image Understanding. He also serves on the editorial board of International Journal of Computer Vision.\nHorn was instrumental in the conversion to scalable, hinted outline format (Adobe Type 1) of Donald Knuth's Computer Modern fonts, The American Mathematical Society (AMS) fonts, LaTeX fonts, Michael Spivak's MathTime and MathTime Plus, as well as Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes' Lucida Bright, Lucida Bright Expert and Lucida New Math fonts, all used in mathematical typesetting.\n\n\nResearch\nMost of Horn's research has been focused on machine vision, particularly so-called \"physics-based\" machine vision, going back to the beginnings of the field in the 1960s. His thesis entitled Shape from Shading: A Method for Obtaining the Shape of a Smooth Opaque Object from One View was one of his first works in this area. Much of his work in the 1970s and 1980s is focused in this area on the topics of optical flow, photometric stereo as well as closed-form solutions of orientation problems of Photogrammetry.\nDuring the 1990s, Horn's research interest began including Computational Imaging, which is the creation of an image based on raw measurements that are not directly related to local brightness or density values, but nonetheless capture some information about spatial distribution of matter. Some of his early work in computed tomography (CT) led to methods for reconstructing from fan-beam scans,  which do not lend themselves to the widely known Fourier-slice theorem used for parallel beam scans. Through time, his research in this area moved towards structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and high resolution X-ray imaging, including phase reconstruction.\nIn 2013, Horn presented an algorithm at the IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems for reducing the problem of phantom traffic jams. He and his team studied traffic congestion and proposed that avoiding tailgating could decrease traffic jams. Their research proposed that keeping an equal distance from the car in the front and the back can reduce congestion and decrease commute time. They named their method the bilateral control. The research was published later in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. The team developed an algorithm that dictates exactly how fast a vehicle should travel to avoid congestion. Horn proposed that their algorithm could be used to improve the cruise control systems on cars. Their later research was funded by Toyota. In this area, Horn is also working on improving vehicle safety and passenger comfort using inverse-time-to-contact (TTC) for control.\nIn the late 2010s Horn research also began including the topic of indoor location by means of Fine-Time-Measurement of Round-Trip-Time of electromagnetic waves at Wifi frequencies as a possible source for turn-by-turn navigation for the visually impaired.\n\n\nBooks\nHorn's first book LISP co-authored with Patrick Winston was published in 1981. It was a textbook written for students with no previous background in the computer language LISP. The book was divided in two parts; one dealt with the theory of the language and the second gave instance of practical use in the area of artificial intelligence. A second version of the book was published in 1984 followed by a third version in 1989.\nHorn's second book, Robot Vision was published in 1986. The book was an outgrowth of one of his courses at MIT and covered the recent research in the area of image processing, machine vision and pattern recognition.\nHorn co-edited with Michael J. Brooks, the 1989 book Shape from Shading, which explained how a three dimensional object may be recovered from shading in a two dimensional image of the object. The book was one of the first in its field to provide a comprehensive review of shape from shading.\n\n\nAwards and honors\n1989 - Prize for Pioneering Work leading to Practical Vision Systems by Rank Prize Fund\n1990 - American Association for Artificial Intelligence Inaugural Fellow\n2002 - Elected to the National Academy of Engineering\n2009 - Azriel Rosenfeld Lifetime Achievement Award by IEEE Computer Society\n\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nBooks\nLISP (1981)\nRobot Vision (1986)\nShape from Shading (1989)\n\n\nArticles\nBKP Horn: Understanding image intensities.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=38034801",
    "text": "Hudgins v. Wright (1806) was a freedom suit decided in the favor of the slave Jackey Wright by the Virginia Supreme Court (then called the Court of Appeals). She had sued for freedom for herself and her two children based on her claim of descent from Indian women. Indian slavery had been prohibited in Virginia since 1705. Since 1662, slave law had incorporated the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, saying that children born in the colony took the social status of their mothers.\nHer master Houlder Hudgins appealed the decision, saying that Wright was enslaved based on mixed-race ancestry that included African. The case was notable for the Virginia Supreme Court's defining a difference between presumptions about people of Indian and African descent. The noted judge George Wythe, Chancellor of the Circuit Court/Chancery Court, had ruled in Wright's favor in the first trial, based on the presumption of persons being born free as expressed in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights.\nSt. George Tucker, a noted justice of the Virginia Supreme Court, participated in ruling on the appeals case. He and his fellow justices ruled that the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence to offset Wright's claim to be of Indian descent through her maternal line, as witnesses testified about her mother and grandmother. As a result, based on the long prohibition in the colony against Indian slavery and the Wrights' appearance as \"white\", Jackey Wright and her two children gained their liberty.\n\n\nBackground\nJackey Wright had sued for freedom from slavery for her and her two children based on her direct descent through her mother's line from generations of Indian women, as Indian slavery had been abolished in 1705 in the Virginia colony. The justices of the Virginia Supreme Court noted that the Wrights appeared \"white\" or European, relying on a factual finding by the trial judge, George Wythe. Wright's mother Phoebe was a slave, but Wright said that she was Indian and held illegally. Phoebe was a daughter of Hannah and granddaughter of Butterwood Nan, also said to be Indian; both were described by witnesses as having \"Indian\" characteristics, such as long straight hair. Since 1662 Virginia slave law held that children in the colony took the social status of their mother, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem. Slavery for Indians in Virginia was prohibited after 1691 or 1705, depending on judicial interpretation. Hudgins, the Wrights' master, had claimed that Wright was legally enslaved because she was of mixed race and partial African descent. (This shows how closely African ethnicity was associated with slavery.) But, he did not prove she had African ancestry, merely claimed that her mother and grandmother were women other than those she had claimed.\nJudge Wythe had ruled that, based on the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, there was a presumption that residents were born free. He freed the family based on the plaintiff's failing to prove maternal descent from an enslaved African. \nWright was represented by attorney George K. Taylor. He noted that \"If, in fact, the appellees are descended from Indians, it is incumbent on the appellant to prove that they are slaves; the appellees are not bound to prove the contrary.\" The justices of the Virginia Supreme Court held that the appellant had not proved that Wright had any maternal African ancestry and said that, as Indians had been considered free since at least 1705, she and her children were also free. St. George Tucker and other justices, all slaveholders, disagreed with Wythe's application of the state's Bill of Rights. Tucker said that it applied only to \"free citizens and aliens\" and could not be used to \"overturn property rights\" in slaves, as previous precedent had established that Moors, Negroes (Africans), and mulattoes, all non-Christian, had been brought into the territory only as slaves.\nThe court observed that witnesses had testified to Wright's grandmother Hannah's appearance: copper complexion and straight hair, as well as what was described as a \"noble character,\" as proof she was not black. Legal historian Ariela Gross wrote in her 2008 book, a study of court cases and other means of defining race in America, that the court's ruling confirmed that \"Indians were by default citizens of a free nation; Africans were by default members of an enslaved race.\"\n\n\nSee also\nAmerican slave court cases\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHoulder Hudgins v.

    "summary": "Hudgins v. Wright (1806) was a freedom suit decided in the favor of the slave Jackey Wright by the Virginia Supreme Court (then called the Court of Appeals). She had sued for freedom for herself and her two children based on her claim of descent from Indian women. Indian slavery had been prohibited in Virginia since 1705. Since 1662, slave law had incorporated the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, saying that children born in the colony took the social status of their mothers.\nHer master Houlder Hudgins appealed the decision, saying that Wright was enslaved based on mixed-race ancestry that included African. The case was notable for the Virginia Supreme Court's defining a difference between presumptions about people of Indian and African descent. The noted judge George Wythe, Chancellor of the Circuit Court/Chancery Court, had ruled in Wright's favor in the first trial, based on the presumption of persons being born free as expressed in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights.\nSt. George Tucker, a noted justice of the Virginia Supreme Court, participated in ruling on the appeals case. He and his fellow justices ruled that the appellant had not provided sufficient evidence to offset Wright's claim to be of Indian descent through her maternal line, as witnesses testified about her mother and grandmother. As a result, based on the long prohibition in the colony against Indian slavery and the Wrights' appearance as \"white\", Jackey Wright and her two children gained their liberty.",

    "text": "A slogan is used in Scottish heraldry as a heraldic motto or a secondary motto. It usually appears above the crest on a coat of arms, though sometimes it appears as a secondary motto beneath the shield. The word slogan dates from 1513. It is a variant of the earlier slogorn, which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic sluagh-ghairm (sluagh \"army\", \"host\" + gairm \"cry\"). In other regions it is called a war-cry.\n\n\nMottoes and heraldry\nThere are several possible origins for mottoes used in heraldry, and slogans may have originated from battle cries or war cries. There are several notable heraldic mottoes which are thought to originate from a war cries. For example, the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom contains the motto DIEU ET MON DROIT (\"God and my right\") which has been thought to originated as a war cry, as has the motto MONTJOYE SAINT-DENIS which appeared on the former French coat of arms. Several mottoes found in Irish heraldry, which end in a boo, are also thought to have originated as war cries. Examples of such Irish mottoes are CROM A BOO of the Fitzgerald earls of Leinster; and SHANET A BOO of the Fitzgerald earls of Desmond.\nNot all slogans are based on war cries. Many slogans pertaining to Scottish clan chiefs have been registered relatively recently at the Court of the Lord Lyon. Sometimes slogans are merely a name, such as A HOME A HOME A HOME of the Homes, others refer to a rallying point for the clan, like CRUACHAN of the Campbells, some slogans refer to a prominent clansman like the Maclean Fear eile airson Eachuinn (\"Another for Hector\"). In at least one case, a patron saint is used as a slogan, as in St Bennet and Set On of the Setons. The arms of Grant use two slogans (or mottoes): CRAIG ELACHAIDH, which appears above the crest; and STANDFAST, which appears beneath on a scroll beneath the shield. Sometimes a clan chief's slogan appears on his crest badge and in consequence on the crest badges worn by his clan members. In some cases the chief's slogan also appears on his standard, guidon and pinsel.\n\n\nSlogans\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Hayden Ballantyne (born 16 July 1987) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League. He was a 2014 All Australian and has previously won a Sandover Medal while playing with Peel Thunder.\n\n\nEarly career\nOnly 174 cm tall, Ballantyne started his career with Peel Thunder in the West Australian Football League in 2005 as a midfielder. In 2008, Ballantyne moved into the forward line with great success, kicking 75 goals to finish second in the Bernie Naylor Medal behind Subiaco's Brad Smith, and winning the Sandover Medal by 2 votes from Callum Chambers as the fairest and best player in the league. To recognise this achievement, Peel Thunder named the outer wing at Rushton Park the Hayden Ballantyne Wing in April 2009.\n\n\nAFL career\nBallantyne's success in the WAFL attracted the attention of AFL recruiters, and at the age of 21, he was drafted by the Fremantle Football Club with its second round selection in the 2008 AFL National Draft (pick No. 21 overall). Ballantyne risked being excluded from the draft when he missed the Western Australian state screening session due to being overseas on a holiday.  He was later tested individually and allowed to remain nominated for the draft. Ballantyne was a mature-age draftee at the age of 21, with most draftees no older than 18.\nBallantyne won the 2011 AFL Goal of the Year in a play which saw him gather three possessions before goaling from 45 metres out.\nIn his role as a small forward, Ballantyne became noted for his ability to pester and annoy his opponents, and to often win free kicks by encouraging overzealous retaliation from them. In April 2012, the Herald Sun newspaper named him as the league's \"chief pest\" for his success in this aspect of the game, in the week after champion Geelong full-back Matthew Scarlett had received a three-week suspension for such a retaliatory punch (Ballantyne himself was suspended for one week for a separate incident in the same match). Ballantyne received some criticism following his lacklustre performance in the 2013 AFL Grand Final, which Fremantle lost by 15 points.\nAt the end of the 2017 season, Ballantyne signed a one-year contract extension.\nIn August 2018, he signed a further one-year contract extension for the 2019 season. In August 2019 Ballantyne was informed that he would not be offered a contract extension for 2020.\n\n\nPost-AFL career\nBallantyne signed with Peel Thunder for the 2020 WAFL Season.\nIn January 2021 Ballantyne announced his retirement from the WAFL competition.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBallantyne's father, Graeme Ballantyne is a horse trainer based at Lark Hill, Rockingham.  The winner of the 2013 Perth Cup, Talent Show, is trained by Graeme and part owned by Hayden and his Fremantle teammate Nick Suban.\nOn 30 September 2018 Ballantyne's brother Brendan Ballantyne was struck by a pizza delivery car on Ennis Avenue in Waikiki and was killed. He was engaged to his fianceè, who was pregnant with their second child. He was 22.\n\n\nStatistics\nStatistics are correct to the end of the 2019 season\n\n\nHonours and achievements\nTeam\n\nMcClelland Trophy (Fremantle) 2015\nIndividual\nWAFL\n\n 2x Peel Thunder leading goalkicker: (2008), (2020)\nPeel Thunder best and fairest: (2008)\nSandover Medal: (2008)\nAFL\n\nAFL Goal of the Year: (2011)\nAll-Australian Team: (2014)\nFremantle leading goalkicker: (2014)\nFremantle 25 since '95 Team\nFremantle Life Member: 2017\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHayden Ballantyne's playing statistics from AFL Tables \nHayden Ballantyne at AustralianFootball.com \nHayden Ballantyne's WAFL playing statistics at WAFLFootyFacts.net \nWAFL profile",

    "text": "Gloria Orwoba (born 25 May 1986) is a former Kenyan UDA politician who has served as a nominated Senator representing women in the Senate of Kenya since 2022.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nOrwoba and her three sisters were born and raised in Nairobi by a single father originally from Kisii County. Her father was a civil servant and raised his children near the Yaya Centre in the Hurlingham neighbourhood. She attended St. George's Girls' Secondary School in Kilimani before gaining a diploma in architecture from the University of Nairobi; she subsequently obtained a degree in social work and is currently pursuing a degree in leadership and management. In 2015, she moved to Sweden with her family, and subsequently managed a Facebook data centre in Denmark.\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 2017, Orwoba briefly returned to Kenya in order to run for the Kisii County Executive for the Youth; she was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2019, she moved back to Kenya permanently and stated her intention to run as the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate for the Bobasi constituency in Kisii County. She subsequently lost the primary to a male candidate whom she accused of corruption.\nOrwoba worked as a community worker and initiated the Uji Ya Glo Nutrition programme, which provided a cup of porridge and two slices of bread each school day at thirteen primary schools within the Bobasi constituency. As a member of the UDA, she has been an outspoken supporter of William Ruto, the party's candidate in the 2022 Kenyan general election, praising his focus on inclusion and empowerment for all groups within Kenya; she publicly supported his ultimately successful presidential campaign.\nOrwoba was chosen to be a nominated Senator in 2022 representing women, in accordance with the Senate having additional Senators representing women, young people, and people with disabilities. As Senator, Orwoba has become an advocate for the rights of women, and has called on the government to do more to respond to the issue of period poverty in Kenya. She has blamed patriarchal power systems in Kenya and a lack of knowledge among men about menstruation as exacerbating the issue of period poverty, citing the fact that condoms are available for free in the country while tampons are often expensive as evidence of this. She has cited the 2019 death of Jackline Chepngeno, a 14-year-old girl from Kabiangek in Bomet County who died of suicide after being period shamed by a teacher, as making her a period poverty activist and making her want to address the taboo around menstruation. In 2023, she tabled a motion calling on the Ministry of Public Service, Gender and Affirmative Action to provide free sanitary products for all schools in Kenya. In addition, she has also requested that all schools be equipped with the correct equipment to dispose of feminine hygiene products.\n\n\n2023 menstruation incident\nOn 14 February 2023, Orwoba attended a plenary session at the Parliament Buildings wearing white trousers that were stained red in the groin area. During the session, Senator Tabitha Mutinda requested that the Speaker, Amason Kingi, make a ruling on whether Orwoba's presentation constituted a breach of the Senate's dress code. Kingi ultimately ruled that Orwoba needed to leave the chamber and return in clean clothes. Coincidentally, on the same day, in a separate incident, fellow Senator Karen Nyamu had been asked to leave the chamber after wearing a sleeveless dress.\nReception for Orwoba's actions have been mixed, and there has been a debate as to whether the incident was an accident or a publicity stunt. Mutinda called Orwoba's presentation \"indecent\" and accused her of not being a good role model for women and girls. Senator Enoch Wambua called Orwoba's actions \"a shame to this house\", while Senator Ledama ole Kinaon alleged that Orwoba had faked menstruation to make a political statement. Kingi reiterated that Orwoba had been asked to leave the chamber to give her an opportunity to change her clothes and not due to her being on her period.\nOrwoba also received praise for her actions. Johnson Sakaja, the governor of Nairobi City County, called Orwoba's actions \"bold and provocative\" and promised to promote the availability of free sanitary pads throughout Nairobi. Media personality Janet Mbugua praised Orwoba for \"reviving\" the period poverty movement in Kenya.\nOrwoba has stated she had adhered to the Senate's dress code, and called the staining an \"accident\" which she had used to raise a point about period poverty and stigma against menstruation in Kenyan society. Immediately after the incident, she visited a school in Nairobi, distributing period products. Orwoba has defended herself against accusations that she faked her period, and has reported that she was a target of Twitter cyberbullying following the incident.\nFollowing the incident, she sponsored a billboard appeared in Nairobi featuring an image of Orwoba in a white T-shirt with the words \"Anything you can do, I can do bleeding\" on it.\n\n\nPersonal life\nOrwoba has three children.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Sri Parmini (born 12 September 1956) is a retired officer of the Indonesian Army. She served as Head of the General Secretariat of the Indonesian Army and was the third woman to achieve the rank of brigadier general in the Indonesian Army.\nParmini was born in a non-military family. She spent her childhood in Boyolali and began her career as an officer in the Indonesian Army Women's Corps after graduating from Sebelas Maret University. She served in various roles, including positions at the Army Women Corps Education Centre, Army Counterintelligence and Cryptology Service, and the Kodam Jayakarta, before working as an aide officer in Army Headquarters in 2005. Four years later, she was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, where she served as an expert officer for the Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief. Subsequently, she was transferred to the position of Head of General Secretariate of the Indonesian Armed Forces Headquarters from February to December 2013. After completing her term in this position, she continued to work as a special staff officer for the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army until her retirement.\n\n\nChildhood and education\n\nParmini was born on 12 September 1956 in Boyolali, Central Java, as the eldest of four siblings. Her father was a primary school teacher, while her mother was a housewife who supported the family by trading in mining products. She was raised in Boyolali and completed her elementary to high school education in her hometown.\nAfter graduating from high school, she pursued higher education at the Department of Social Education, Faculty of Education, at Sebelas Maret University. Before her graduation, she accidentally came across a brochure from the Surakarta Military District Command regarding an opportunity to join the Indonesian Army Women's Corps for women who had already completed higher education. She tried to register because she always had an ambition to become a soldier when she was a child.\nWhen Parmini tried to register to be a candidate in the Army Women's Corps, the registration process was already closed. However, a noncommissioned officer named Koesnan assisted her in registering. Parmini subsequently underwent a selection process that spanned several days in Bandung and was accepted as a candidate officer for the Army Women's Corps after successfully passing the selection.\nParmini, who had become a candidate officer, then met with her parents and informed them that she had passed the selection. Initially, both of her parents were unhappy with the news because they had previously planned for Parmini to become a social science teacher in Surakarta. Her father objected to her choice to join the army, but she managed to convince him. Parmini then returned to Bandung to pursue her military education at the Army Women's Corps Education Centre. After she completed her education, she was commissioned as a first lieutenant in 1981.\n\n\nCareer\nParmini began her service in the Indonesian Army in 1981 at the Army Women's Corps Education Centre and served as an instructor for approximately four years. She was then transferred to the Army Counterintelligence and Cryptology Service with the rank of first lieutenant. During her service at Army Counterintelligence and Cryptology, she was promoted to the rank of captain in 1987. After her tenure at Army Counterintelligence and Cryptology ended in 1991, Parmini attended the Advanced Officer Education II course to enhance her military capabilities in 1992. After finishing her course in 1993, she was promoted to the rank of major.\n\nIn 1995, Parmini was instructed to undergo advanced military education at the Indonesian Army Command And General Staff College and became the only female student during her time at the institution. After graduating in 1996, she was reassigned to the Kodam Jayakarta as the deputy head of Military Area Command Administration at Kodam Jaya. This office handled personnel, administrative, and welfare matters for personnel within the Kodam Jaya, which raised her rank to lieutenant colonel. She held this position until 1998.\nParmini was appointed as the Commander of the Army Women's Corps Education Centre in November 2000, following two years of service as an officer without any commissioned role. During the appointment, she was promoted to the rank of colonel in 2001. Subsequently, she was reassigned as an expert officer to the Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces for the European and United States regions on 23 December 2009. Her reassignment was accompanied by the promotion of her rank to brigadier general. Indonesian National Armed Forces called this promotion a \"special gift for Indonesian Army Women's Corps\", coinciding with its recent celebration of 48 years of Indonesian Army Women's Corps on 22 December 2009. She became the third woman to achieve the rank of brigadier general in the Indonesian Army, following Kartini Hermanus and Hermawati\n\nParmini served as a special staff to the Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces for three years. On 23 January 2013, she was reassigned to the position of Head of the General Secretariate of the Indonesian Armed Forces Headquarters. She was inaugurated into this position on 25 February 2013. During her tenure, the General Secretariate of the Indonesian Armed Forces Headquarters issued several guidelines signed by Parmini, including  \"Petunjuk Administrasi Tentang Administrasi Umum TNI\", which pertains to administration within the Indonesian Armed Forces and \"Petunjuk Teknis Penggunaan Bahasa Dalam Tulisan Dinas Di Lingkungan TNI\", which pertains to the use of language in official documents within the Indonesian Armed Forces.\nJust nine months after her inauguration, on 18 November 2013, the Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces issued a decree transferring Parmini from her position to become the Special Staff to the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army. This decision was implemented after Parmini handed over her position to Hasan Saleh (politician) on the last day of 2013. Parmini retired from the military in 2014 and joined the Retired Indonesian Army Women Association in Jabodetabek as its chairwoman in 2017.\n\n\nPersonal life\nParmini met her husband, Achmad Kaelani, when she was serving as an instructor at the Army Women's Corps Education Centre. Kaelani came from a family with a career in the Indonesian Air Force and often visited the office where Parmini worked to see his sibling. Parmini and Kaelani married in 1984 and had a daughter and a son. Their daughter, Ratih Pujiati, was born in the mid-1980s, while their son, Arif Widyatmoko, was born in the early 1990s. Parmini's job as an army officer often separated her from her family, and she could only see them in person on weekends because her family lived in Jakarta. They started living together in 2008 when Parmini was transferred to Jakarta.\n\n\nOrders, decorations, and medals\nReferences: \n\n\nNote\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "\"Hurricane!\" is the second episode of the seventh season of the animated comedy series American Dad!. It first aired on Fox in the United States on October 2, 2011. The episode's plot mainly revolves around the Smith family, who prepare for evacuation in response to an oncoming hurricane. Reluctant to leave his home, Stan encourages his family to ride out the storm in their house with him. The hurricane sends a flood to the city of Langley Falls, which puts the entire family in danger.\n\"Hurricane!\" is the third and final part of the Night of the Hurricane block with Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. Kevin Reilly, the president of the entertainment division of Fox Broadcasting Company, introduced the idea of a crossover to Seth MacFarlane, the creator of all three shows. The episode was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. The episode's plot is loosely modeled to that of the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. Originally scheduled to air on May 1, 2011, as an episode for the seventh season, \"Hurricane!\" was postponed due to the 2011 Super Outbreak.\nThe episode was well received by television critics, who praised its humor and cultural references. It was viewed by 5.72 million viewers upon its initial airing, while also receiving a 2.6/6 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. \"Hurricane!\" was written by Erik Sommers, and directed by Tim Parsons. It featured the guest voices of Mike Barker, Lisa Edelstein, Jeff Fischer, Mike Henry, Matt McKenna, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Kristen Schaal.\n\n\nPlot\nWhen a hurricane arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their home with their neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing it is the best way for everyone to be safe. Hayley wants to stay to help the left-behind zoo animals, and Jeff also wishes to stay since he goes where Hayley goes since they're married. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, since he's bad with a crisis. Steve and Roger support her, with Steve siding with her since he wants his mom and Roger because of the reason Francine sides against Stan. Roger's date (whom he can't stand because she's clingy) sides with him and Francine. Klaus is about to say who he sides with, but no one cares about his opinion. \nBefore the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks, and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft from its path and trapping the Smiths in their home. The neighborhood is now flooded, and the house is drifting along the floodwater's current while Francine scolds Stan for not evacuating the family to Her parents' house that morning. Attempting to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home using Roger's wine/cocaine fridge; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.\nRoger cries when his date falls to the floor and gets impaled by a moose antler chandelier (only because she is wearing his favourite sweater). Stan, Hayley, Jeff and Klaus head to the attic for higher ground, but it starts to flood. Hayley tries to open the door, but fails due to Roger's boxes and items blocking it. Klaus, believing he can go wherever he wants, insults the Smiths and jumps out of the fishbowl into the water, but his skin burns due to the water being ocean water; Hayley puts Klaus back in his fishbowl. Francine, Steve, and Roger make a rope out of curtains to get them out of the attic after removing the boxes. Roger picks up his wigs instead of Klaus, leaving Klaus behind. Francine suggests that their rope to the first floor doesn't provide much strength, so she convinces the family to climb it one at a time. Unfortunately, Jeff panics and jumps onto the rope, with Steve still hanging on, tearing it down, and angering Hayley, as the Smiths are now stuck on the second floor of the tipped-over house.\nAs the storm worsens, the family becomes increasingly frightened and distrustful of Stan when his idea to open another window to let them float to the top results in Hayley being taken by a great white shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Steve fails to hide his pornography from his mother, while Roger drowns his date upon discovering she is still alive. After Stan separates himself from the family, they find Hayley, but are trapped on the sofa while the shark circles them. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech by comparing him to Nicolas Cage: despite his failure in several movies, Cage eventually made a successful film (which Klaus believes to be National Treasure: Book of Secrets). He suggests Stan will eventually make the right decision after his many failures, inspiring Stan to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more.\nStan obtains a grizzly bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. He then attempts to electrocute the animals, but accidentally electrocutes Roger instead. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas just to get help, Stan instead throws his old college javelin which, instead of killing the bear, accidentally impales Francine in the shoulder, to Stan's horror. Buckle enters the house with a tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, realizing that he was an equal threat. As the Hurricane passes away, Stan later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Francine comforts Stan by assuring him he is a good husband and father in all other aspects of life, but despite the whole ordeal, Stan is not convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.\nAfter the storm clears, Stan looks out to scope the damage done by the storm, only to find himself in a stand-off with Cleveland Brown and Peter Griffin, whose houses have ended up on both sides of the Smiths' house, since the same animation hit their respective towns earlier. Cleveland then tries to tell Peter he knows him, but the latter tells them to let him think. When Francine comes out the front door, Stan accidentally shoots her, which Peter claims to be \"classic American Dad!\" due to its unpredictability.\n\n\nProduction\n\nThe episode was first announced in July 2010 by series creator Seth MacFarlane at San Diego Comic-Con. Kevin Reilly, the entertainment president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, originally pitched the idea for the crossover, which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s. MacFarlane described the crossover event to be an \"enormous challenge\" and a \"substantial undertaking\"; he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters. \nHe was also willing to do another crossover event if this one received successful ratings.\nMuch of the episode plot in \"Hurricane!\" was modeled after the action adventure disaster film, The Poseidon Adventure. In his interview on the plot of the final part of the crossover episode, Mike Barker, a producer for American Dad, stated that \"[they] end up flooding the house and turning it upside down.\" He continued: \"Ultimately, the house drifts and ends up in the same neighborhood as the Griffin and Brown homes.\" The actual crossing over of the event occurs at the end of this episode when Stan gets involved in a stand off with Cleveland Brown of The Cleveland Show and Peter Griffin of Family Guy.\nIn April 2011, executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company officially announced that \"Hurricane!\" would air on May 1 as part of the Night of the Hurricane crossover, along with The Cleveland Show episode \"The Hurricane!\" and Family Guy episode \"Seahorse Seashell Party\". However, on April 29, it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule, in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. The crossover was subsequently replaced by reruns of \"I Am the Walrus\" from American Dad!, \"Brian Writes a Bestseller\" from Family Guy, and \"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\" from The Cleveland Show. MacFarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of Fox, and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episode would air the succeeding season.\n\n\"Hurricane!\" was directed by Tim Parsons, in his first directing credit of the season. This episode marked the first time Parsons has directed an American Dad! episode since the seventh season episode \"I Am the Walrus\". It was written by Erik Sommers, which also served as his first writing credit for the season. Sommers' last production credit was the sixth season episode \"You Debt Your Life\". In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Mike Henry, actress Lisa Edelstein and voice actress Kristen Schaal guest starred in the episode as Cleveland Brown, Sharri Rothberg, and Roger's One Night Stand respectively. Recurring voice actors Jeff Fischer, Mike Barker, Matt McKenna, and Kevin Michael Richardson reprised their roles of Jeff Fischer, Terry Bates, Buckle, and Principal Brian Lewis respectively. In addition to his American Dad! roles of Stan, Roger, and Greg Corbin, MacFarlane reprised his Family Guy role of Peter Griffin, while Henry guest starred as his role of Cleveland Brown. This episode marked the first time Henry made a guest appearance on American Dad since the season four episode \"Stan's Night Out\". Edelstein and McKenna reprised their roles of Shari and Buckle, having last done so in the season seven episode \"Best Little Horror House in Langley Falls\".\n\n\nReception\n\n\nRatings\n\"Hurricane!\" first aired in the United States on October 2, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox. It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons, and its sister shows The Cleveland Show and Family Guy. It was viewed by 5.71 million viewers upon its initial airing, despite simultaneously airing with Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Amazing Race on CBS, and a match between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets on NBC. Total viewership for the episode was the third highest of the animation television block on Fox, having moderately higher ratings than that of The Cleveland Show but lower ratings than that of The Simpsons and Family Guy. \"Hurricane!\" garnered a 2.6/6 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Total viewership and ratings were slightly down from the previous episode, \"Hot Water\", which was watched by 5.83 million viewers and garnered a 3.0/7 rating in the 18–49 demographic.\n\n\nTelevision reviews\nCritics generally praised the episode, with many deeming \"Hurricane!\" as the best part of the crossover. Terron Moore of Ology praised the episode, giving it an 8.5 out of ten rating. Points of acclaim went to the humor of the episode, to which Moore opined that it \"was packed with a lot of funny lines, a lot of ridiculous Stan antics [...], and a pretty funny arc involving Roger and his girlfriend\".\nRowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was polarized with the episode. Although she stated that the episode was not bad, Kaiser stated that it \"didn't quite work\". Kaiser went on to give the episode a 'B−' grade, scoring higher than the Family Guy episode \"Seahorse Seashell Party\", but lower than The Simpsons episode \"Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts\". Another writer felt that the interactions between Stan and Francine were inferior to previous episodes of the series and wrote, \"It breaks away from Francine and Stan's fun relationship and veers into the more conventional cartoon relationship, where the husband is a buffoon and the wife has to keep him check.\"\n\n\nSee also\nNight of the Hurricane\nThe Cleveland Show: \"The Hurricane!\"\nFamily Guy: \"Seahorse Seashell Party\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Hurricane!\" at IMDb",

    "text": "The Battle of Wei River (Chinese: 濰水之戰) was fought in November 204 BC between the Han and a combined force of Qi and Western Chu. The famous General Han Xin led the Han force, while the Chu were led by Long Ju (龍且) and the Qi by King Tian Guang (田廣). The result ended with Han Xin conquering the Qi kingdom.\n\n\nBackground\nIn 204 BC Han Xin completed the Han conquest of the State of Zhao. Liu Bang ordered many of Han Xin's troops and officers to return to the Central Plain to serve directly under Liu Bang, and he ordered Han Xin to raise a new army from the inhabitants of Zhao to attack the State of Qi. Qi was the last of the northern kingdoms not to have submitted to Liu Bang, and in 205 its formidable general Tian Heng, a member of the royal Tian clan, had previously forced Xiang Yu into a negotiated settlement, using fortresses and popular loyalty to the dynasty to wear down the armies of Chu.\nQi was of great use to the Han. Not only was it the richest and most populous of the northern kingdoms, with Xiang Yu making much use of it to feed his armies; it was also located directly to the north of Chu and would enable Han Xin to invade the Chu heartland to the east of the Central Plain, where Liu Bang and Xiang Yu were caught in a stalemate. Moreover, by conquering Qi, Han Xin would bring his northern strategy to completion. This strategy aimed to secure the manpower, food and wealth of northern China for Liu Bang while keeping Xiang Yu himself distracted in China's Central Plain. This was achieved by basing Liu Bang in the Central Plain in Xingyang and Chenggao, as the feud between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, two former sworn brothers, was both political and personal.\n\n\nHan invasion\nHan Xin finished raising and training his new army within only a few months, but Liu Bang also sent the noted diplomat Li Yiji (酈食其) to persuade the king of Qi, Tian Guang, to switch his allegiance to the Han faction. Liu Bang did so without informing Han Xin, but Han Xin learned through unofficial channels that Li Yiji was visiting Tian Guang and had persuaded the king to side with Liu Bang. Han Xin's advisor Kuai Tong convinced him to invade Qi anyway, since that was the order he had received from Liu Bang, and, so Kuai argued, it was unjust that Li Yiji should steal Han Xin's conquest from him with clever words.\nIn October Han Xin crossed into Qi, and surprised and defeated the Qi army at Lixia. Tian Guang believed that Li Yiji had deceived him and had him cooked alive. Meanwhile, Han Xin marched straight for Qi’s capital Linzi and took control of the city. Fleeing, Tian Guang called upon Xiang Yu for help. Xiang Yu realized the gravity of the situation, and he acted quicker to counter Han Xin than he ever had before. Previously Xiang Yu had sent forces to contest Han Xin's conquest of the State of Zhao, but this time he immediately sent his best general, Long Ju, with a very large army, to combine with the royal army of Qi.\n\n\nBattle\nIn November the Chu-Qi coalition camped on the south bank of the Wei River, opposite Han Xin’s army to the north. Upriver, Han Xin secretly constructed a makeshift dam with sandbags to lower the water level. Long Ju was counseled to fight a slow battle of attrition, since Han Xin was dangerous in battle and yet the inhabitants of Qi were hostile towards the Han army. A Chu officer suggested that they foster Qi rebellions against Han Xin by making them aware of their king Tian Guang's survival, and he noted that the Han army might have trouble feeding itself, being far from home. He also pointed out that the Qi soldiers might be more inclined to retreat, since their homes were nearby. However, Long Ju was determined to fight a decisive encounter.\nOne morning, Han Xin marched across the lowered river and attacked Long Ju's forces. Then, he made a feigned retreat, drawing Long Ju's forces across the river in pursuit. Long Ju led the vanguard in pursuit, but when only part of his army had made it across the river, Han Xin's soldiers released the dam. In this way, they isolated Long Ju and his vanguard, and Long was cut down in battle. Another Chu general, Zhou Lan, was captured, and the leaderless Chu army soon panicked and disintegrated. Having lost their allies, the Qi army fled and separated into smaller forces.\n\n\nAftermath\nHan Xin split up his army to complete the conquest of Qi, campaigning into the year 203. Han Xin pursued the king Tian Guang and captured him in Chengyang, but Tian Heng made himself the new king. Nevertheless, after capturing Qi’s Prime Minister Tian Guaang, Han Xin defeated a new counteroffensive by Tian Heng. Tian Heng subsequently fled the state for Liang, where he became a follower of the pro-Han warlord Peng Yue. Han Xin subsequently conquered the towns of Ying and Po and defeated and killed the Qi General-in-Chief Tian Xi near Qiansheng. Meanwhile, Han Xin's general Cao Shen attacked and killed Tian Ji in the Shandong Peninsula.  \nTo challenge further attempts by the Tian clan at reviving their control over Qi, Han Xin requested that Liu Bang make him the Acting King of Qi, again acting on the advice of Kuai Tong. Liu Bang was angry that Han Xin was requesting a royal title while he himself was struggling against Xiang Yu in the Central Plain, but on the advice of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, in February 203 he awarded Han Xin the full title of King while the latter was completing the conquest of Qi.\nBecause of the Han conquest of Qi, Xiang Yu's situation became increasingly precarious. Since 205, he and Liu Bang had worn each other down in a war of attrition in the Central Plain, and Xiang had effectively run out of options to wrest control of northern China from Han Xin. He sent an envoy to Han Xin with the proposal that he remain neutral and that China be divided between Liu Bang, Xiang Yu and Han Xin. Kuai Tong encouraged Han Xin to accept this proposal, accurately predicting that Liu Bang would eventually execute Han Xin as being too dangerous. However, Han Xin was grateful for the opportunities to command that he had received from Liu Bang, and he recalled that, when he had earlier served Xiang Yu as a guardsman, Xiang Yu had refused to listen to his suggestions. For these reasons, he chose to remain loyal to Liu Bang and soon coordinated the final campaign against Xiang Yu, which culminated in his victory in the Battle of Gaixia.\n\n\nSee also\nTimeline of the Chu–Han Contention\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Rancho Caslamayomi was a 26,788-acre (108.41 km2) Mexican land grant in present_day Sonoma County, California given in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Eugenio Montenegro.  The grant cut across Little Sulphur Creek in the Mayacamas Mountains north of Healdsburg.\n\n\nHistory\nEugenio Montenegro (1815–)was a Mexican soldier, who came to California with José Figueroa.  The Washington Hotel, Monterey, erected in 1832, was for a few years the private residence of Eugenio Montenegro. In 1840, Montenegro married  Juana Maria Gertrudis Soberanes  (1824–). Eugenio Montenegro, who had been promoted from customs guard to senior captain of his division, was granted the eight square league Rancho Caslamayomi in 1844.  In 1848 Montenegro, who had returned to Mexico, sold the rancho to British merchant, William Forbes of Forbes & Barron of Tepic, Mexico.  Forbes tried to extend the surveys to include the geysers and quicksilver mines in the mountains.\nWith the cession of California to the United States(US) following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.  As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Caslamayomi was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to William Forbes in 1874.\nIn 1853, Montenegro called the deal off and sold the rancho to Jacob A. Morenhout. However, Forbes considered that he owned it (he was the patentee), and in 1857, Forbes sold the rancho to his business partner, William E. Barron.  The property became involved in conflicting claims.  Barron's heirs ultimately sold the rancho in 1883 to a group of over thirty settlers.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie is a 2014 comedy film based on the sitcom Mrs. Brown's Boys and is co-produced by That's Nice Films, Penalty Kick Films, RTÉ and BocFlix. BBC Films is acting as sales agent and it was distributed by Universal Pictures. It was written by series creator (and company director of both That's Nice Films and Bocflix) Brendan O'Carroll, who also plays the lead role. The film sees Agnes Brown go to court to protect her family's stall at Dublin's Moore Street market from a corrupt Russian businessman who wishes to convert it into a shopping centre. The film was released on 27 June to negative reviews from critics. It topped the UK and Ireland box office with £4.3 million in its opening weekend, on a budget of £3.6 million, and retained the top spot for a second week. On 27 October it was released on home media, again topping the charts.\n\n\nPlot\nAgnes Brown (Brendan O'Carroll) is an independent market trader, selling fruit and vegetables on Dublin's Moore Street market. It has been under attack from P.R. Irwin (Dermot Crowley), a TD (PRIC) who is in an arrangement with a ruthless Russian businessman who wants to put all the market stalls out of business and open a shopping centre on the site. Her stall is the next to be targeted, being sent a bill for unpaid tax left by her grandmother, and a man (working for Irwin) appears offering to buy her stall and make the bill disappear. Agnes nearly accepts, but Winnie (Eilish O'Carroll) reveals this news to the locals, forcing Agnes into defending her stall from the developers while they look for ideas on how to raise the money. Agnes' friend Philomena Nine Warts informs her that her grandmother, Mary Moccasin, was next to Agnes' grandmother at the tax office when she paid the bill and therefore no money is owed. Unfortunately, Philomena's grandmother is hit by a bus on the way to the courtroom before she can testify.\nAgnes' court case attracts a lot of attention from the media, portraying her as the greatest mother in Ireland. This leads her to go to confession, where she admits (unknowingly also to a Russian mobster) that she briefly put her children in care when her husband died, but continued to claim the child support money. This is used against her in the witness box during questioning by Irwin in court (Irwin being the opposing Barrister), and she runs out in shame. Eventually being found by the river by her daughter Cathy (Jennifer Gibney), she admits all in a tearful moment on the Ha'penny Bridge, telling her how she told the nuns that she thought she could look after two of the six children, but when asked to pick she was unable to.\nMeanwhile, Agnes' son Dermot (Paddy Houlihan) and his lifelong criminal best friend Buster Brady (Danny O'Carroll) try to get the receipt. After failing to break into the restricted area of the NRS they recruit a troop of blind trainee ninjas, led by Mr. Wang (also played by Brendan O'Carroll). The Russians have already found and destroyed the original receipt, but Buster and Dermot learn that the receptionist who took the payment was blind, so there exists a braille version of the receipt. They find it and let Agnes know, telling her Tourettes-suffering barrister (Robert Bathurst) to stall the case. After navigating air ducts out of the NRS, Agnes, Buster and Dermot are chased by the mobsters and the Garda, jumping in the River Liffey. Agnes separates from the pair and returns with the \"receipt\" but it turns out Buster accidentally gave her a betting slip instead. At this point, Cathy stands up and gives a speech on how special Moore Street and its market is, and her intention to run her mother's stall when her time comes, to Agnes' joy. After their pursuit continues in a Nissan Navara and finally a dash on a stolen horse, Buster and Dermot deliver the receipt to the courtroom just in time to have the case against Agnes dropped. They all celebrate by dancing on the steps of the courtroom.\n\n\nCast\nBrendan O'Carroll as Agnes Brown and Mr. Wang\nJennifer Gibney as Cathy Brown\nRory Cowan as Rory Brown\nDanny O'Carroll as Buster Brady\nAmanda Woods as Betty Brown\nFiona O'Carroll as Maria Brown\nPaddy Houlihan as Dermot Brown\nEilish O'Carroll as Winnie McGoogan\nDermot O'Neill as Harold \"Grandad\" Brown\nMartin Delany as Trevor Brown\nPat ‘Pepsi’ Shields as Mark Brown\nGary Hollywood as Dino Doyle\nRobert Bathurst as Maydo Archer SC\nDermot Crowley as P.R.

A spokesman for O'Carroll said that the film would have a distinctly Dublin flavour, \"It's Dublin humour so you're going to need Dublin actors and technicians to get it right for the big screen.\" Despite funding being secured, O'Carroll later confirmed that a script had not been written prior to the deal. \"I haven't written it yet. That's what success does, they give you money and say 'Whatever you think'. So I've taken the money!\". At the 2013 National Television Awards O'Carroll confirmed the film had been written and would begin shooting the following autumn.\nPrincipal photography began in September 2013 in Dublin. Filming locations included Moore Street, Dublin quays, Dublin Institute of Technology, Father Matthew Square, The Customs House and Wimbledon Studios. Filming was completed on 25 October 2013.\nThe Script recorded a song for the film called \"Hail, Rain or Sunshine\".\n\n\nRelease\nThe film had its world premiere on 25 June 2014 at the Savoy Cinema in Dublin, with Brendan O'Carroll and the rest of the cast in attendance.\nThe distributors of the film did not screen the film for critics in advance of its release.\nTo this day, the film has yet to be released in North America, despite the TV series' high TV ratings.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nBox office\nThe film earned £4.3 million in the UK and Ireland in its opening weekend, breaking records in Ireland for the highest box office gross on the opening day of an Irish-made film. It was top of the UK and Ireland box office in this opening weekend, ahead of The Fault in Our Stars which took £1.7 million. It maintained its No. 1 spot for a second week, in which it grossed another £2.1 million, the only film to pass £1 million that week. For its third week, it took £1.08 million, but fell to third behind Transformers: Age of Extinction and How to Train Your Dragon 2.\nWith a total gross of £14.7 million, it was the third highest grossing British or Irish film in the domestic market in 2014, behind The Inbetweeners 2 and Paddington.\n\n\nCritical response\nThe film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 6% based on reviews from 17 critics, with an average rating of 3.30/10.\nMike McCahill of The Guardian gave the film 1 star out of 5 and called it \"a flatly indifferent cash-in\". He predicted that although the devoted fanbase of the sitcom would make it as much of a commercial success as The Inbetweeners Movie, it did not deserve to be. In The Daily Telegraph, writer Robbie Collin also gave the film 1 star out of 5. He was highly critical of the Chinese character Mr Wang, played by O'Carroll \"with his eyes narrowed and Ls and Rs switched, while making little karate-choppy motions in the air with his hands\", calling it \"something close to anti-funny\". He also said that the sitcom's inclusion of bloopers and characters breaking the fourth wall didn't translate to the format of cinema without \"very clever lateral thinking\", which the film lacked. Donald Clarke of The Irish Times called the film \"overstretched, underwritten, sluggishly paced and unsettled by the discombobulating move from studio to location\" and concluded, \"the gags are clunky, the dialogue is leaden and the story is threadbare.\" Another 1-star review came from Empire, who remarked: \"almost avant-garde in its commitment to unfunny, it's shambolically performed by the majority of its cast, and shot and edited in a fashion so slapdash it seems like a movie made almost entirely by competition winners.\" Stephen Kelly of Total Film also gave the film 1 star out of 5 and said that it will \"leave even the most fervent of fans disappointed by its abattoir of wit\" because \"while the TV show possesses a warm, ramshackle appeal, this story of granny Agnes Brown trying to save a Dublin market from d'foreigners (boo!) is not only out of its comfort zone, but full of cold, mean-spirited gags about the blind, an Indian man everyone thinks is Jamaican (um, LOL?) and [a] Chinese caricature so dazzlingly racist it beggars belief.\"\nMark Kermode gave the film a scathing review, calling it \"an absolute stinker\" and \"not funny on any level, at all\", saying that: \"it's good that the cast [laugh at themselves in the bloopers] because were it not for the cast laughing at the jokes, there wouldn't be anybody laughing in the cinema... there are no laughs. None. Nul points. Nil.\" Archie Bland of The Independent said that he \"couldn't argue\" with actor Rory Cowan who said that the views of critics were \"totally irrelevant\", but still found the film \"dreadful... slow, sentimental, and altogether cynical\", saying that \"I'm afraid I can't say I laughed, or even smiled, once in the whole godforsaken 93 minutes.\" He concluded by saying that \"I don't see why anyone is obliged to like [the film] just because it does well at the box office... In any case, it doesn't really matter. It is now absolutely clear that Mrs Brown is a slating-proof juggernaut.\"\nIn one of the few positive reviews, James Ward of the Daily Mirror gave the film 4 stars out of 5. Though Ward enjoyed the 1970s-inspired politically incorrect humour, he noted that some moments caused him to wince rather than laugh, saying the ninja character \"makes Benny Hill's Chinaman seem sensitive and respectful\". Ward concludes: \"Old-fashioned? Undoubtedly. Crude? Definitely. Funny? Well, we know what the critics with their box sets of Curb Your Enthusiasm will say [...] For the critics D'Movie may be a D'Isaster – but for the rest of us it's a D'Light\".\n\n\nSequel\nBrendan O'Carroll announced there would be a sequel to D'Movie at the National Television Awards in January 2014, whilst speaking to the Radio Times, O'Carroll said \"We're already working on a sequel – Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie 2\". In December 2015 it was confirmed that there will be a sequel.\nIn August 2016 Brendan O'Carroll told The Sun that the sequel had been delayed because of Brexit. 'We were planning to do it this year but the numbers weren't right' said O'Carroll. 'The Brexit Drop in sterling makes it a lot more expensive for the studio than it would have been previously.' In December 2018, it was confirmed that O'Carroll would be writing a sequel with his son Danny, who plays Buster. The plot will revolve around the relationship between Buster and Dermot. 'I think it's going to be really, really successful' O'Carroll said of film and compared the chemistry between Buster and Dermot to that of Morecambe and Wise.\n\n\nPossible spin-offs\nOn 20 June 2014, O'Carroll announced that he was working on two spin-off feature films following on from Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie. The first spin-off film is to be entitled Wash and Blow if it is produced and it will see O'Carroll take on the role of salon owner, Mario, alongside Rory Brown and Dino Doyle. The second spin-off film in development is to be entitled Mr Wang, who is a character introduced in D'Movie. It was confirmed that English actor Burt Kwouk, who later died in 2016, had been asked to take the title role but was unable to travel to Dublin, so O'Carroll will take on the role himself if the film gets produced. It will also co-star Buster Brady and Dermot Brown working for him under a detective agency. It is currently not known if the spin-off films will be made.\n\n\nHome media\nMrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK and Ireland on 27 October 2014. Within the first week of release in the UK, the film sold 315,981 units across DVD, Blu-ray and digital downloads, topping the home entertainment charts with nearly twice as many sold as second-placed Godzilla. O'Carroll said  \"I'm always surprised, to this day, about how much people love the show and have embraced it into their lives and their homes. We never take it for granted and always just aim to make the audience and fans laugh out loud in everything we do.\"\n\n\nSee also\nList of 2014 box office number-one films in the United Kingdom\nMadea\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie official website\nMrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie at IMDb\nMrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie at BBC Films\nMrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie at British Comedy Guide",

The first issue (which featured an eight-page backup story, \"The Generic Monsters in: Where Werewolf?\", by Fialkov and artist Nate Bellegrade) had a print run of only eight-hundred copies, making it difficult to find despite positive reviews. The series was then picked up by Canadian publisher Speakeasy Comics, which released a \"Bumper Edition\" in October 2005, collecting the first three issues and featuring a new cover by Darwyn Cooke. This was followed by an individual fourth issue in December 2005, but Speakeasy became defunct in February 2006, resulting in the cancellation of the remaining four issues.\nIn 2006, the Villard Books imprint of Random House collected all eight chapters of the series in trade paperback form. The collection, simply titled Elk's Run, was released in March 2007 with an introduction by Charlie Huston. In 2015, all eight issues were released digitally by Oni Press on a weekly schedule, beginning on 25 August, leading up the release of a new hardcover collected edition on 11 November, with an introduction by Ian Rankin.\n\n\nReception\nElk's Run was generally reviewed positively, with the second issue \"Community Bulletin\" section featuring positive quotes from Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, and Brian K. Vaughan. Entertainment Weekly gave the first issue a rating of \"A\", while Variety gave it an \"A-\". Publishers Weekly was critical to the story's simplistic characterization, but also said that \"Fialkov builds the suspense incrementally until the cycle of violence became a wave of disasters\". The horror magazine Rue Morgue gave the series a glowing review: Elk's Run is easiest described as Steven King's The Body (a.k.a. Stand by Me) crossed with M. Night Shyamalan's The Village, but comic's best kept secret is actually a great deal more. Five issues deep, this series just effortlessly generates momentum — a stunning achievement.\nBased on the first four issues, the series was nominated for the 2006 Harvey Awards in the categories of Best Writer, Best Artist, Best Letterer, Best Cover Artist, Best New Talent, and Best Continuing or Limited Series, while issue #3 was nominated for Best Single Issue or Story.\n\n\nSee also\nEchoes\nI, Vampire\nThe Last of the Greats\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Re Board of Commerce Act 1919 and the Combines and Fair Prices Act 1919, commonly known as the Board of Commerce case, is a Canadian constitutional decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in which the \"emergency doctrine\" under the federal power of peace, order and good government was first created.\n\n\nBackground\nFollowing the end of the First World War, there was a rapid rise in the cost of living in the Canadian economy. In response, the Parliament of Canada passed the Board of Commerce Act, 1919 and the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919. The assigned the Board of Commerce two main functions:\n\nInvestigate and restrain combinations, monopolies, trusts and mergers constituting a \"combine.\"\nInquire into and enforce prohibitions against hoarding and profiteering.\nIn pursuit of its functions, the Board issued an order, prohibiting certain clothing manufacturers in Ottawa from charging higher than specified profit margins. That triggered a dispute as to the Acts' constitutionality, and the Board referred the matter to the Supreme Court of Canada by way of stated case under s. 32 of the Board of Commerce Act, posing the following reference questions:\n\nHas the Board lawful authority to make the order?\nHas the Board lawful authority to require the Registrar or other proper officer of the Supreme Court of Ontario to cause the order when issued to be made a rule of said Court?\n\n\nSupreme Court of Canada\n\nThe Supreme Court split 3–3 on the question of the constitutionality of the legislation. Anglin J, joined by Davies CJ and Mignault J considered the Acts to be intra vires and repeated the observation he had previously made in the Insurance Act Reference:\n\nWhen a matter primarily of civil rights has attained such dimensions that it affects the body politic of the Dominion and has become of national concern it has in that aspect of it, not only ceased to be \"local and provincial\" but has also lost its character as a matter of \"civil rights in the province\" and has thus so far ceased to be subject to provincial jurisdiction that Dominion legislation upon it under the \"peace, order and good government\" provision does not trench upon the exclusive provincial field and is, therefore, valid and paramount.\nHowever, given the Privy Council's rulings in Citizen's Insurance Co. v. Parsons and the Local Prohibition case, he rested his decision to uphold the Acts on the basis of the federal trade and commerce power as well as on the federal power relating to peace, order and good government.\nIdington, Duff, and Brodeur JJ, in separate opinions, held that they were ultra vires. In particular, Duff J had concerns as to the interpretation of the nature of the power of peace, order and good government:\n\nIn truth if this legislation can be sustained under the residuary clause, it is not easy to put a limit to the extent to which Parliament through the instrumentality of commissions (having a large discretion in assigning the limits of their own jurisdiction, see sec. 16), may from time to time in the vicissitudes of national trade, times of high prices, times of stagnation and low prices and so on, supersede the authority of the provincial legislatures. I am not convinced that it is a proper application of the reasoning to be found in the judgments on the subject of the drink legislation, to draw from it conclusions which would justify Parliament in any conceivable circumstance forcing upon a province a system of nationalization of industry.\nAn appeal was then filed with the Privy Council.\n\n\nPrivy Council\n\nLord Haldane, for the Council, found that the Acts were ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, as they could not be justified under any heading of federal power enumerated in s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867.\n\n\nPeace, order and good government\nHaldane rejected the general power of peace, order and good government on the basis that it should be used only in circumstances \"such as those of war or famine [where] the peace, order, and good Government of the Dominion might be imperilled under conditions so exceptional that they require legislation of a character in reality beyond anything provided for by the enumerated heads in either section 92 or section 91 itself.\"\n\n\nTrade and commerce\nCiting his previous decision in John Deere v Wharton, Haldane held that the power to regulate trade and commerce was meaningless unless it could be said to supplement another federal power.\n\n\nCriminal law\nIn explaining why the federal criminal law power was not of help in the matter, Haldane also provided its first definition in Canadian jurisprudence by stating that it would apply \"where the subject matter is one which by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence.\"\n\n\nAftermath\nHaldane's statement as to the nature of the criminal law power was later described by Lord Atkin in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General of Canada as not being a definition. Instead, it was held to be \"the criminal law in its widest sense,\" including the ability to make new crimes, and the only relevant standard to apply is whether the act would attract penal consequences. In addition, while the matter of the trade and commerce power did not need to be decided in that case, the Board declared that it wished to dissociate themselves from Haldane's previous comment: \"No such restriction is properly to be inferred from that judgment.\"\n\n\nSee also\nCombines Investigation Act\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading",

    "text": "Magnhild Kennedy (born 1978 in Trondheim, Norway), better known professionally as Damselfrau, is a London-based Norwegian artist. She creates wearable art, mostly masks and jewellery. Her masks are presented on her own Instagram account and on several other websites; in magazines and exhibitions – and they are used by internationally known singers and other artists in their videos or on stage, as parts of their own projects.\n\n\nBackground and education\nKennedy grew up in Trondheim. Both her parents are artists. Her mother, Heidi Kennedy Skjerve, makes experimental textile art, while her father, Stein Rønning, is a sculptor.\nKennedy herself is self-taught as an artist. According to herself, she has never studied anything relevant to design or to mask making. She considers growing up in a home where both parents were artists, her schooling. She has no formal training in crafts or textile work, those skills she has developed over the years, learning through looking at clothes and crafts, trial and error, and watching YouTube tutorials.\n\n\nCareer\n\nWhen she and her husband Robert Kennedy moved to London in 2007, she made masks only for herself and her husband, as parts of outfits to be used in parties, but from 2009 on she works as a professional mask maker under the name Damselfrau. Damselfrau consists of the English word «Damsel» (unmarried woman) and the German word «Frau»  (woman). Kennedy interprets this inherently paradoxical pseudonym as «married to oneself». A journalist called it «a fitting mantle for an artist who has become renowned for her masks; a craft that involves placing another ‘self’ on top of your own, creating both a combination of the two and suggesting something entirely new altogether».\nKennedy's first commission was for the Norwegian singer Anneli Drecker and the band Røyksopp for one of their tours. Since then she has made masks for artists like MØ, Beyoncé and Daphne Guinness, and collaborated with Louis Vuitton.\n\n\nMaterials, inspiration, technique\nAll Damselfrau masks are made, mostly sewn, by hand. Kennedy uses all kinds of materials she can find, literary. The materials range from pearls, old tea towels and gold confetti to plastic trinkets and old laces. She never sketches or decides the design of a mask on beforehand. The materials she combines decide the design and expression of each mask, which she sculpts on mannequin heads. The process sometimes takes a day or a week. At other times the mannequin head sits on a shelf wearing a half finished mask for a year, until the right material «surfaces» in her studio.\nKennedy's masks transgress the borders between art, fashion and costume design. She is not particularly interested in masks as a category. What interests her, is to work with all sorts of materials, preferably materials with a history, and organize them in a small area, «so that in the end, they communicate something. I’m really more interested in decorating a space than a body or a face».\n\n\nExhibitions and presentations\nWhile Instagram has been the main platform for presenting her art, her masks are also shown on art and fashion websites and magazines, like Vanity Fair, Another Man and Vogue. The masks are also frequently shown in solo and group exhibitions.\n\n\nSelected solo exhibitions\n2011 – Damselfrau, Doors Showcase, London.\n2015 – Damselfrau ll, Idios.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=16034299",
    "text": "Toolson v. New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld, 7–2, the antitrust exemption first granted to Major League Baseball (MLB) three decades earlier in Federal Baseball Club v. National League. It was also the first challenge to the reserve clause which prevented free agency, and one of the first cases heard and decided by the Warren Court.\nSince it presumed that Congress's failure to act in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.\n\n\nBackground\nGeorge Earl Toolson was a pitcher with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm team for the New York Yankees in the AAA-class International League. He believed he was good enough to play in the major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the reserve clause in his and every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.\nWhen the Newark franchise was dissolved prior to the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the Binghamton Triplets, an A-class team within its minor league system. He refused to report and instead filed suit, arguing the reserve clause was a restraint of trade and that baseball should not be exempt from antitrust laws.\n\n\nBaseball antitrust exemption\nIn 1922, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a unanimous court held in Federal Baseball Club that professional baseball did not meet the definition of interstate commerce under the Constitution and the Sherman Act because, although teams traveled between states from game to game, that travel was \"incidental\" to the business and not an essential aspect, since all the revenue was generated from the actual games.\nBy the time Toolson filed his suit, baseball had grown greatly in popularity and as such had changed. Improved roads and public transportation meant that fans in some areas crossed state lines to attend games, and radio and television broadcasts, from which the teams derived substantial revenue, brought those games to the fans who did not leave home. The interstate aspects of the professional game had greatly increased.\nIn 1947, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler was sued by former New York Giants outfielder Danny Gardella, who argued that the five-year ban Chandler imposed on players who, like Gardella, had jumped briefly to the rival Mexican League was an unfair use of monopoly power and that the Federal Baseball Club decision no longer applied. A preliminary ruling in favor of the baseball commissioner was reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, returning the case to the lower court for trial. In 1949, Chandler settled with Gardella for a reported $65,000. Gardella initially sought $300,000, settling for less on his lawyers' advice he would lose on appeal to the Supreme Court.\nIn 1951, Representative Emanuel Celler, an advocate for strong antitrust enforcement, chaired a special Judiciary Committee subcommittee on monopoly power, which had looked into baseball, among other things. Celler entered the hearings believing that MLB needed laws to support the reserve clause. Star players, such as Lou Boudreau and Pee Wee Reese, indicated their support of the reserve clause. Minor league veteran Ross Horning testified about his experiences in baseball, which he said were more common for rank-and-file players. Cy Block, who appeared briefly in the major leagues, testified about his experiences and how the reserve clause prevented him from getting an extended trial in the major leagues. Celler's final report suggested that the Congress should take no action, allowing for the matter to be settled in the federal judiciary of the United States.\n\n\nTrial and appeal\nBoth the district court in Los Angeles and the Ninth Circuit relied on Federal Baseball Club in ruling for the defendants. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear it and consider a number of other cases by former Mexican League players pending at the appellate level.\nAmong the lawyers working on the case for baseball was Bowie Kuhn, then of the prestigious firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who would later himself become baseball commissioner and the respondent in Flood v. Kuhn, the next case to challenge the reserve clause. When the case reached the Supreme Court, the Boston Red Sox filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the Yankees, their bitter rival. Since the Second Circuit, in reinstating Gardella's challenge, had called Federal Baseball \"an impotent zombie\" in light of recent Supreme Court antitrust decisions, baseball did not expect the Court to rule in its favor.\n\n\nOpinion of the Court\nA one-paragraph unsigned per curiam opinion was followed by a longer dissent by Justice Harold Hitz Burton, joined by Stanley Forman Reed.\n\n\nMajority\nAfter briefly restating the conclusion of Federal Baseball Club, the majority continued:\n\nCongress has had the ruling under consideration, but has not seen fit to bring such business under these laws by legislation having prospective effect. The business has thus been left for thirty years to develop on the understanding that it was not subject to existing antitrust legislation ... [I]f there are evils in this field which now warrant application to it of the antitrust laws, it should be by legislation. Without reexamination of the underlying issues, the judgments below are affirmed ... so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including the business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws.\n\n\nDissent\nBurton listed a number of aspects of contemporary baseball—the extensive farm system, broadcasting revenues, national advertising campaigns and even its reach beyond the borders of the United States—to justify his statement that \"it is a contradiction in terms to say that the defendants in the cases before us are not now engaged in interstate trade or commerce as those terms are used in the Constitution of the United States and in the Sherman Act\". He also cited a report by a House subcommittee that had come to a similar conclusion.\nHe conceded \"the major asset which baseball is to our Nation, the high place it enjoys in the hearts of our people, and the possible justification of special treatment for organized sports which are engaged in interstate trade or commerce\". But while it was certainly within Congress's power to repeal or specifically enact an antitrust exemption for baseball, it had not done so, \"and no court has demonstrated the existence of an implied exemption from that Act of any sport that is so highly organized as to amount to an interstate monopoly or which restrains interstate trade or commerce\". He concluded \"The present popularity of organized baseball increases, rather than diminishes, the importance of its compliance with standards of reasonableness comparable with those now required by law of interstate trade or commerce.\"\n\n\nSubsequent developments\n\n\nJurisprudence\nWithin the next few terms, Toolson's logic was criticized directly and indirectly by other justices, including some  who had been in the majority, in dissents from opinions in which the Court held that it was specific to baseball and that even other professional sports weren't covered.\nChief Justice Earl Warren admitted, writing for the majority two years later when denying boxing the exemption, that \"this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, if it were not for Federal Baseball and Toolson, we think that it would be too clear for dispute.\" Dissenters Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton, who were in the Toolson majority, were harshly critical. \"It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'\", the former wrote. \"I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of stare decisis into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it.\" Minton, in his dissent, added:\n\nWhen boxers travel from State to State, carrying their shorts and fancy dressing robes in a ditty bag in order to participate in a boxing bout, which is wholly intrastate, it is now held by this Court that the boxing bout becomes interstate commerce. What this Court held in the Federal Baseball case to be incident to the exhibition now becomes more important than the exhibition. This is as fine an example of the tail wagging the dog as can be conjured up.\nAnother two years passed, and Radovich v. National Football League came before the Court. The circumstances of professional football at the time were almost identical to those of baseball, yet the Court ruled that the antitrust exemption was specific to the latter. Tom C. Clark, writing for a majority of six, defended the Toolson decision as preferable to the alternative: \"[M]ore harm would be done in overruling Federal Baseball than in upholding a ruling which, at best, was of dubious validity\" and admitted \"were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate, we would have no doubts.\"\nFrankfurter again expressed his incredulity. \"...[T]he most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball — the conditions under which that sport is carried on — from the scope of the Sherman Law, but included football\", he said. He was joined in a separate opinion by John Marshall Harlan II signed by then-new justice William Brennan: \" I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of Federal Baseball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself.\"\n\n\nFlood v. Kuhn\n\nIn 1970, St. Louis Cardinals star center fielder Curt Flood decided to refuse a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies and challenge the reserve clause again. Due to his stature as a player, his case attracted wide attention, and reached the Court in 1972. Although Flood lost, widespread support for his suit paved the way for free agency.\nWilliam O. Douglas, who had been on the Toolson majority, had ruled in a 1971 emergency appeal from a suit brought by Spencer Haywood that basketball wasn't exempt, either, and suggested he was reconsidering his role in Toolson: \"the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed.\" The following year he was the only justice from the Toolson court still sitting when Flood v. Kuhn was heard, and made his change of mind explicit in a footnote to his dissent: \"While I joined the Court's opinion in Toolson ... I have lived to regret it; and I would now correct what I believe to be its fundamental error.\"\nIn that case's majority opinion, Harry Blackmun conceded that the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce, but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.\n\n\nLegal analysis and criticism\nSports business historian Andrew Zimbalist attributes the unexpected outcome to \"a game of cat and mouse\" between Congress and the Court:\n\nThe Congress did not pass a bill lifting baseball's exemption because it thought it had already been lifted by the 1948 Gardella decision. The Supreme Court affirmed the Holmes decision because it thought Congress had given its sanction to the exemption by not passing new legislation in 1951.\nMuch of the criticism of Toolson over the years has viewed it as the middle term of the sequence that begins with Federal Baseball Club and ends with Flood, and considers it in that context. Its embrace of stare decisis and presumption of congressional inaction as a justification, is notably at odds with the position that Justice Felix Frankfurter took when writing for the Court in a 1940 trust-law case, Helvering v. Hallock, where prior flawed decisions had not been corrected through legislative action, that \"it would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines\"\nOne critic, antitrust expert Kevin McDonald of Jones Day, singles out the 1953 case for having truly created the antitrust exemption by reading congressional intent into Holmes' original opinion. After quoting the per curiam's closing sentence, he writes:\n\nWith that baseless assertion, the baseball exemption was born. As we have seen, Federal Baseball said nothing about the Congress of 1890 intentionally excluding baseball from the Sherman Act. It is as if the majority in Toolson imagined Senator Sherman announcing that \"today we enact the Magna Carta of the working class so that all American business will respect the right of consumers to free and open competition ... that is, um, except for organized baseball, of course.\" Indeed, what did it mean to affirm Federal Baseball \"so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including ... baseball within the ... antitrust laws\", when Federal Baseball said no such thing?\nLower courts, he said, took the court's reasoning to mean that other professional team sports were also exempt, forcing the justices to clarify that it only applied to baseball, and criticize their earlier ruling, in order to sustain decisions that football and boxing were interstate commerce and within the scope of antitrust law.\n\n\nEffect on baseball\nToolson's career was over, and MLB resumed its status quo ante. But the underlying issues remained, and a decade later began to be addressed when players unionized as the Major League Baseball Players Association, with free agency one of many goals.\nTwo years later, baseball held its first amateur draft, ending the system whereby wealthier and successful teams like the Yankees were able to keep their farm teams stocked with talent the way they had with Toolson, not only as insurance against player injuries but to prevent opposing teams from signing them. That ended the continuous domination of the Yankees.\nDespite legal and judicial criticism and embarrassment, baseball's antitrust exemption remains in effect. Players in the major leagues won free agency with the Seitz decision in 1975, and the 1998 Curt Flood Act gave major league players, but not others involved in baseball, rights under the antitrust laws.  But for players in the minor leagues, like Toolson, the reserve system persists, and they are still bound to the organization that initially signed them.\n\n\nSee also\n\n1953 in baseball\nBaseball law\nList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 346\nList of United States Supreme Court cases by the Warren Court\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n346 U.S. 356 (1953)\nCurt Flood Act of 1998",
    "summary": "Toolson v. New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld, 7–2, the antitrust exemption first granted to Major League Baseball (MLB) three decades earlier in Federal Baseball Club v. National League. It was also the first challenge to the reserve clause which prevented free agency, and one of the first cases heard and decided by the Warren Court.\nSince it presumed that Congress's failure to act in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.",

However, their lineup would endure many changes before the band achieved its definitive sound. After Brison returned to his native Scotland, the band went through several drummers until Alberto Melega took the job on a temporary basis. Guitarist Alessandro Cavazza (Orange) took Orsini's place for a short while, after which he was succeeded by Federico Bernardi. The introduction of baritone player Alessandro Meroli prompted a more experimental approach, which resulted in drummer Leonardo Saracino taking over for Melega.\nIn 1995, the band recorded their debut album, \"Industrie Jazzcore\". Soon after its release, Splatterpink won first prize in a national competition called \"Omaggio a Demetrio Stratos\". Two years later, the band (which had been touring for almost three years) went on to record 1997's \"Nutrimi\" for Italian label Underground Records. The album received very positive reviews from fans and critics alike.\nSplatterpink proceeded to play many gigs all over Italy, and became widely recognized as an Italian pioneer of \"jazzcore\". During this time, British radio personality John Peel sent the band a very kind and heartfelt letter, which informed them that both of their albums were on the BBC's playlist. Soon after, Splatterpink performed at the Biennale of Young Artists in Turin, and began opening for bigger acts such as Ozric Tentacles, Nomeansno, P.J.Harvey, and Asian Dub Foundation.\nIn 1999, new member Christian Rovatti took over on drums. However, his collaboration with the band was not successful. This compelled the other members to use a drum machine for several important gigs, which included an event in Mostar (Bosnia), where Splatterpink represented Italy's underground music scene.\nThe band released its third album—entitled \"#3\"—in 2001. However, many fans and critics felt that it didn't compare to previous albums. Additionally, Splatterpink was finding it difficult to see live gigs y 2003 the group is disbanded. \nIn 2012 the four musicians decide to get back together, pushed by a strong fans base reputation and to explore new boundaries with the latest formation which include the great drummer Ivano Zanotti.\nThey released an EP on 2014, April and the new album work \"Mongoflashmob\"was released for Locomotiv Records on December 1, 2014.\n\n\nAlbums\n1995 - Industrie jazzcore (Suoni Sospetti) 4\n1999 - Nutrimi (Underground Records)\n2001 - #3 (Audioglobe)\n2014 - Dolan Aproevd (EP, Locomotiv Records) limited edition\n2014 - Mongoflashmob (Locomotiv Records) out on December 1\n\n\nCompilation\n1997 - Andate a lavorare teppisti (Scandellara Records)\n1999 - Tracce (Wallace Records)\n2002 - Canzoni d'eroi (Exploit - CGIL)\n2013 - Fonderie Jazzcore (Impatto Sonoro)\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Wolf Frobenius (1 June 1940 – 4 July 2011) was a German musicologist and lecturer, who taught at the Saarland University.\n\n\nLife\nBorn in Speyer, Frobenius studied musicology, art history and history at the University of Freiburg from 1960 to 1968 (with two semesters abroad at the University of Paris), where he became a Dr. phil. in 1968 with a thesis on Johannes Boens. From 1968 to 1988, he was a research assistant at the Hand Dictionary of Musical Terminology (for which he wrote 24 articles) and edited the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Terminology for Rhythm and Notation of Mensural Music (1969-1975), Terminology of Musical Time Organization (1975-1978) and Names of the Types of the mehrst. Satzes (1978-1979), from which numerous monographs on the history of concepts have emerged.\nFrom 1971 to 1988, Frobenius was lecturer at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau. After his habilitation in 1988, he became a professor at the Saarland University. Frobenius did research on the early beginnings of music and was active in the field of early polyphony. He wrote an article on the music of the Middle Ages for the encyclopaedia Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart. Just like the beginnings of music, he was interested in the sound worlds that Neue Musik opened up. His main areas of research were the music and music theory of the Middle Ages and the 20th century. He was regarded as an expert on Robert Schumann and New Music.\nFrobenius died on 4 July 2011 at the age of 71 in Saarbrücken. Shortly before that he appeared as editor of the volume Musik des Mittelalters und der Renaissance together with Rainer Kleinertz and Christopher Flamm at the Georg Olms Verlag.

    "text": "Edward Groff Conklin (September 6, 1904 – July 19, 1968) was an American science fiction anthologist.  He edited 40 anthologies of science fiction, one of mystery stories (co-edited with physician Noah Fabricant), wrote books on home improvement and was a freelance writer on scientific subjects as well as a published poet. From 1950 to 1955, he was the book critic for Galaxy Science Fiction.\nBorn in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Conklin was educated at Dartmouth College and Harvard University, and graduated from Columbia University in 1927. He drifted through a series of jobs in the 1930s and 1940s, working for several government agencies during WWII. He was a book editor for Robert M. McBride & Co. and did public relations work for the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Office of Strategic Services, the Department of Commerce, the National Cancer Institute and the American Diabetes Association. He was also a former scientific researcher for the N.W. Ayer & Son advertising agency.\n\n\nShort fiction\nIt was as an editor of fiction that Conklin found his niche, beginning as early as 1930. At the age of 26, while employed as an assistant manager at New York's Doubleday Bookstore, he arranged for the hardcover publication of a story first published in The Smart Set (November 1913), reprinting \"A Flood\" by the Irish writer George Moore in a limited edition of 185 signed copies. In 1934, Conklin and Burton Rascoe published The Smart Set Anthology (reissued in 1944 as The Bachelor's Companion), the first collection of stories from that literary magazine.\nConklin's interest in short fiction continued with the 1936 publication of The New Republic Anthology: 1915-1935, edited with Bruce Bliven. The following year, he married Lucy Tempkin on October 1. During the next decade, he wrote books about subways, rental libraries and home construction, in addition to poetry and numerous magazine articles.\n\n\nScience fiction\nConklin did not grow up as a reader of science fiction, but came to it later in life. In his Galaxy Five-Star Shelf column of December, 1954, he states, \"...I actually did not become an earnest devotee of the form until 1944, about a year before the Atomic Age actually opened....The first item I remember reading that could be classified as science fiction was H. G. Wells' Men Like Gods, back in 1924 when I was a college sophomore. It had a tremendous effect on me....\"  A roommate from 1930 provided him with \"bound volumes of tear-sheets of early weirds, fantastics and 'scientifictions' from the old Argosy, All-Story and others....\" He sent a proposal for his first science fiction anthology to Crown Publishers in 1944, and the book was issued in 1946, several months ahead of the other great sf anthology of that year, Adventures in Time and Space edited by Raymond J. Healy and J. Francis McComas.\nAfter his first science fiction anthology, The Best of Science Fiction (1946), weighing in at 785 pages, he followed with A Treasury of Science Fiction (1948). Readers soon began to seek out books with his strikingly unusual and exotic name on the cover—The Science Fiction Galaxy (1950), The Big Book of Science Fiction (1950) and Possible Worlds of Science Fiction (1951). The prominent display of Conklin's huge hardcover anthologies in the \"New Titles\" section of libraries led numerous American readers to discover science fiction during the genre's early 1950s boom. In the Grip of Terror (Permabooks, 1951) was an offbeat collection of horror tales, and he collaborated with Lucy Conklin on The Supernatural Reader in 1953, a year before her death. Four years later, he married Florence Alexander Wohlken.\nHis book review column, \"Galaxy's Five-Star Shelf\", was a key feature in Galaxy Science Fiction from its premiere issue (October 1950) until October 1955. During that period, he also edited Grosset & Dunlap's Science Fiction Classics series, which he conceived as an inexpensive alternative to hard-to-find small-press editions of such titles as Robert A. Heinlein's Beyond This Horizon and Isaac Asimov's I, Robot, although the first title in the series (Henry Kuttner's Fury) was that story's first book publication.\nThe Weather-Conditioned House (1958) is not science fiction but a practical discussion of methods involved in weather-conditioning a house. The book was authoritative enough that it was reissued with an update in 1982.\nIn the last three years of his life, Conklin was the staff science editor for The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He lived in New York at 150 West 96th Street. At the age of 63, he died of emphysema in his summer home at Pawling, New York.\nA major survey of Conklin's contribution to science fiction is contained in Bud Webster's 41 Above the Rest: An Index and Checklist for the Anthologies of Groff Conklin. Webster's study prompted this comment from Barry N. Malzberg:\n\nGroff Conklin was the most important science fiction anthologist through the years of the genre's true second generation, that point at which its previously magazine-bound masterpieces were being systematically located, aligned and placed into permanent format. His contribution over the period of two decades was irreplaceable and all of our postwar history exists in the penumbra of his work. Bud Webster has in this index granted an act of scholarship and homage of equal irreplaceability.\nGroff Conklin was also a contributor of definitions to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He can be found listed under the heading of Definitions, along with others.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nNon-fiction\nHow to Run a Rental Library (1934)\nAll About Subways (1938)\nAll About Houses (1939)\nGood News About Diabetes (1954) with Lucy Conklin\nInsulate and Air Condition Your Home (1955) with Arthur Watkins\nThe Weather Conditioned House (1958)\nDiabetics Unknown (1961)\nThe Dangerous Cold: Its Cures and Complications (1965) with Noah D.

    "summary": "Edward Groff Conklin (September 6, 1904 – July 19, 1968) was an American science fiction anthologist.  He edited 40 anthologies of science fiction, one of mystery stories (co-edited with physician Noah Fabricant), wrote books on home improvement and was a freelance writer on scientific subjects as well as a published poet. From 1950 to 1955, he was the book critic for Galaxy Science Fiction.\nBorn in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Conklin was educated at Dartmouth College and Harvard University, and graduated from Columbia University in 1927. He drifted through a series of jobs in the 1930s and 1940s, working for several government agencies during WWII. He was a book editor for Robert M. McBride & Co. and did public relations work for the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Office of Strategic Services, the Department of Commerce, the National Cancer Institute and the American Diabetes Association. He was also a former scientific researcher for the N.W. Ayer & Son advertising agency.",

    "text": "The shifted log-logistic distribution is a probability distribution also known as the generalized log-logistic or the three-parameter log-logistic distribution. It has also been called the generalized logistic distribution, but this conflicts with other uses of the term: see generalized logistic distribution.\n\n\nDefinition\nThe shifted log-logistic distribution can be obtained from the log-logistic distribution by addition of a shift parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        δ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta }\n  \n. Thus if \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n has a log-logistic distribution then \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        +\n        δ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X+\\delta }\n  \n has a shifted log-logistic distribution. So  \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n has a shifted log-logistic distribution if \n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        ⁡\n        (\n        Y\n        −\n        δ\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log(Y-\\delta )}\n  \n has a logistic distribution. The shift parameter adds a location parameter to the  scale and shape parameters of the (unshifted) log-logistic.\nThe properties of this distribution are straightforward to derive from those of the log-logistic distribution. However, an alternative parameterisation, similar to that used for the generalized Pareto distribution and the generalized extreme value distribution, gives more interpretable parameters and also aids their estimation.\nIn this parameterisation, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the shifted log-logistic distribution is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        ;\n        μ\n        ,\n        σ\n        ,\n        ξ\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    1\n                    +\n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          ξ\n                          (\n                          x\n                          −\n                          μ\n                          )\n                        \n                        σ\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n                \n                  −\n                  1\n                  \n                    /\n                  \n                  ξ\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(x;\\mu ,\\sigma ,\\xi )={\\frac {1}{1+\\left(1+{\\frac {\\xi (x-\\mu )}{\\sigma }}\\right)^{-1/\\xi }}}}\n  \n\nfor \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        ξ\n        (\n        x\n        −\n        μ\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        σ\n        ⩾\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+\\xi (x-\\mu )/\\sigma \\geqslant 0}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu \\in \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n is the location parameter, \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        >\n        0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma >0\\,}\n  \n the scale parameter and \n  \n    \n      \n        ξ\n        ∈\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\xi \\in \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n the shape parameter.

In January 2008 the publication was awarded the Fargo Human Relations Award from the city of Fargo for its efforts to expand awareness of diverse communities within the city.  In addition publisher, Christopher Mohs, was awarded the 2008 North Dakota Small Business Journalist of the Year Award from the U.S. Small Business Administration for the efforts of OPEN Magazine and its impact on small businesses in the region.\nEach issue of OPEN Magazine reached an estimated 120,000 readers and included four main feature articles (typically two female, two male and at least one individual representing a diverse or ethnic group in the community).  The magazine's departments covered sports, city, food, travel, health, history, social occasions and home.  OPEN Magazine also included an entertainment listing and restaurant guide.\nOPEN Magazine was published by Fargo-based media company FrostFire Media Corporation\nProduction of OPEN Magazine and its sister publication Fargo Business Magazine was discontinued in the fall of 2009, largely a result of the economic impact of the spring floods that hit the metro area that year and greater impacts effecting print publications nationally at the time.

    "text": "Ladislav John \"Walter\" Ostanek, CM (born 20 April 1935) is a Canadian musician. He is known as \"Canada's Polka King.\" He has received twenty-one nominations for Grammy Awards and won three.\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Duparquet, Quebec in 1935, his family moved to St. Catharines, Ontario, when he was a boy. A young Ostanek received his first accordion as a gift in 1944. After several years, Ostanek became a popular entertainer in Southern Ontario, performing Slovenian-style (also known as Cleveland-style) polkas and waltzes. He could be heard frequently on the radio in St. Catharines and Welland. Walter began playing polka after his best friend introduced him to the accordion at age 5.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1957 Ostanek formed his own band playing Slovenian-style polka music. In 1963, Ostanek and his band, the Walter Ostanek Band, would record their first of many albums. Over his career, Ostanek would record more than 50 albums and become known as Canada's Polka King. He has received three Grammy Awards and he has been nominated thirteen times. His style has been compared to America's Polka King, Frankie Yankovic of Cleveland. Like the late Yankovic, Walter Ostanek is of Slovene descent.\n\nOstanek hosted his own television shows (one for fourteen consecutive years), radio shows, and polka tours. He has appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Phil Donahue, Tommy Hunter Show, Cleveland's Polka Varieties, and his own award-winning TV specials and telethons. He has appeared in concert with Roy Clark, The Oak Ridge Boys, Ronnie Milsap, Ray Price, Mel Tillis, Brenda Lee, Slim Whitman, Tom T. Hall, T. G. Sheppard, Tommy Hunter, Lawrence Welk, Myron Floren, Frank Yankovic, Black Forest Band, and Weiss Blau.\nOstanek is a member of Canada's Walk of Fame as well as the Polka Halls of Fame in Cleveland and Chicago. Currently Ostanek performs once a year at the annual Oktoberfest in Kitchener, Ontario.\nHe is also the subject of the 2006 Bravo! network documentary The Cult of Walt: Canada's Polka King.

    "text": "The Théâtre Libre (French pronunciation: [teɑtʁ libʁ]; \"Free Theatre\") was a theatre company that operated from 1887 to 1896 in Paris, France.  \n\n\nOrigins and History\nThéâtre Libre was founded on 30 March 1887 by André Antoine. The primary goal of the theatre was to present new plays that were untried and unproduced by the commercial houses. Antoine was driven to open his own theatre company to create a dramatization of an Émile Zola novel, Thérèse Raquin, after the theater group for which he previously worked had refused. In order to ensure that the Théâtre Libre was exempt from censorship and could produce plays that other theaters would not, the theatre was supported solely by subscribers. This allowed the Théâtre Libre to collect no money at the door meaning it was not legally considered a theatre. Being a \"free\" theatre, in the case of Théâtre Libre, meant being a theatre that presented naturalism and was dedicated to producing plays in any and all genres that had not been produced before and often were considered too much of a risk to stage.\n\nPlaybills and posters were created by leading artists of the day with an un-glamorized, gritty realism that reflected the spirit of the theatre and its repertoire. Among the artists that produced the most memorable works for its plays were Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Édouard Vuillard, Paul Signac, George Auriol, Adolphe Willette, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.There are three chapters of the Théâtre Libre's life. This first is its opening with the first two programs in the spring of 1887 and the full season that followed. Antoine quit his job at the gas company to pursue establishing the Théâtre Libre full-time. The second is from October 1888 to June 1893. During this time, the Théâtre Libre established itself as a prominent theatre company whose subscriptions were robust, produced many plays to general critical acclaim, and was sought out to produce new work. It was during these years that the Théâtre Libre saw some of its work transferring to prominent commercial theatres in Paris such as the Odéon and the Comédie-Française. The theatre's final chapter is marked from November 1893 to its close in 1896. During this time it was evident that the experimental days of the theatre had passed as the style and works produced by the Théâtre Libre were now commercially acceptable and sought after. Due to the amount of debt acquired both on behalf of the theatre and personally, Antoine turned the Théâtre Libre over to Larochelle, a son of an older director/actor who had been eager to join management, for the final two years of the theatre's operation. The last performance at Théâtre Libre was on April 27, 1896.\nThe theatre presented more than 111 plays by more than 50 playwrights during its existence. Each production produced at  Théâtre Libre was only given three performances: one dress rehearsal, one opening night performance for invited guests, and one performance for subscribers. However, despite its achievements, the theater had major financial problems. The deep debt coupled with the idea that the Théâtre Libre was no longer needed, as it had proved that a new form of theatre could be acceptable and commercial was being produced, the theatre failed and closed its doors.\n\n\nNotable Works/Controversial Productions\nThe theater concerned itself with producing work that was considered too risky to stage by more well-known theaters, sometimes even works that had been banned in Europe, such as Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts. The theater performed one foreign work per year and it staged only three performances of any production, either a foreign or domestic work.\n\nJacques Damour by Émile Zola (adapted for stage by Léon Hennique)\nThe play, focusing on a man fighting against his evil instincts, was well-received by critics.\nThe Death of the Duke of Engheim by Léon Hennique\nThis production marked the rebirth of the historical play, but approached the history in a realistic way, a precursor to documentary theater.\nThe Kiss by Théodore de Banville\nThis production one of Théâtre Libre's biggest successes critically. The fairy tale was received to standing ovations and very enthusiastic reviews.\nTabarian's Wife by Catulle Mendès\nAnother instant success for Théâtre Libre. The show transferred to the Comédie-Française.\nLucie Pellegrin's End by Paul Alexis\nCritics condemned this play and its production stating that the scandalous, realistic portrayal of a homosexual relationship onstage was offensive.\nChrist's Lover by Rodolphe Darzens\nThis mystery play depicting Christ and Mary Magdalene's love affair was deemed sacrilegious and offensive.\nThe Power of Darkness by Leo Tolstoy\nWhile other thought this play too melancholy for French audiences, Antoine embraced the Russian story.\nGhosts by Henrik Ibsen\nWhile the play had been censored in Norway, Germany, and England due to its taboo subjects such as incest and euthanasia, Antoine produced it to mixed reviews of both critics and friends alike.\nMiss Julie by August Strindberg\nBanned in Denmark\n\n\nInfluence\nThe Théâtre Libre combined Realism with Naturalism, and emphasized ensemble acting. André Antoine, its primary director, became known as the father of Naturalistic Staging. He sought to make every play as real as possible, such as when real beef carcasses were used on stage.  Many sets were erected with four standing walls for rehearsals, then Antoine would decide which wall to remove for the audience to see when plays began their run. He also replaced footlights with more naturalistic lighting. Antoine believed each play should have its own unique environment.\nThe Théâtre Libre was the first of its kind and inspired the opening many theatres, including the  Freie Bühne, (Free Stage), in Berlin that opened in 1889 as well as the Independent Theatre Society in London that opened in 1891. Out of these two theatres grew Freie Volksbühne, (Free People's Stage), and the Stage Society in 1899 and the Abbey Theatre at Dublin in 1901.\nThe influence in staging in realism and naturalism can of the Théâtre Libre can be seen in the Moscow Art Theatre which was founded in 1898 by Constantine Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchecko and still operates today.\n\n\nReferences",

He was the youngest of eight children. Both of his parents died during the 1870s, so he and some siblings moved to Klein Stadwijk, a village in Voorschoten. There, he received his first drawing lessons from his eldest sister. He attended the Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden and, together with two of his older brothers, passed an exam that enabled them to find work at a financial firm. Theo, however, was not satisfied with office life and decided to become an artist. \nHe began by taking drawing classes at the Royal Academy of Art. While there, he drew and painted the stuffed animals at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden. As a result, his uncle Adriaan van Oordt, Director of Brill Publishers, was able to get him his first commissions doing scientific illustrations. From 1889 to 1890, he became interested in lithography. That same year, he took up temporary residence in a garden house at Binckhorst Castle. The following year, after the success of his first picture book about birds (Hoe de vogels aan een koning kwamen), he was married and moved to Loosduinen. The marriage was, however, short-lived and childless, ending in divorce in 1902.\nIn 1892, he became a member of the Haagsche Kunstkring and joined Arti et Amicitiae in 1893. That same year, he produced an illustrated edition of The Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen, followed by several more bird-themed picture books.\nHe continued to move, restlessly, first to Voorburg then, in 1897, to Hilversum. For a time, he stayed with family members in London. His health became fragile and he was hospitalized for much of 1904 and 1905. He also spent a short time at a psychiatric sanatorium. When released, he went to live with a sister in The Hague and remained there, under her care, for the rest of his life.\nDespite his illness, it was during this period that he created the calendars that made him famous. His designs also formed the basis for pottery and furniture. He and his wife were the models for the main characters in Leo en Gerda (1911), a novel by Aegidius Willem Timmerman about the generation of artists who began their careers in the 1880s. A street was named after him in 1923, and a monument was placed there in 2009.\n\n\nSelected works\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\"Herinneringen aan Theo van Hoytema\", an article by J.G.

Martinho, a golden lunula structure with hollow, triangular appendages and hanging double system, possibly dating from the 4th century, and connected with the Phoenicians.\nSão Martinho de Anta was part of the early settlements that were prescribed in the 12th and 13th century foral allocated to the lands of Panois, specifically the settlements of Souto Maior and Roalde. In addition to the place of Anta, São Martinho de Anta was characterized by an antique castro, which later was the base for their names.\nThe foral for Roalde mentions the locality, also referring to the residence of nobles and knights that lived in the area. The 1258 Inquirições referred to:\n\n\"they say that the King gave that royal land to his priest for a horse and mule and a falcon...\"\nThe King mentioned was likely King Sancho I, and that Roalde pertained to the actual São Martinho de Anta ecclesiastical parish, which was dependent on the administration of the Sé in Braga.\nIt is unclear when São Martinho began being referred to with the suffix de Antas or d'Antas. It is clear that Portuguese (and early Brazilian) encyclopedias (such as the Luso-Brasileira, O Grande Dicionário da Verbo Universal) refers to São Martinho de Antas in 1406.\nIt was elevated to the status of vila (town) on 30 June 1999. Although there is a tendency to refer to the parish as São Martinho de Antas, in reality, the community was fixed by decree as São Martinho de Anta. Moreover, the decree-law 64/99, refers to the settlement as a villa in article one as:\n\nThe settlement of São Martinho de Anta, in the municipality of Sabrosa, district of Vila Real, is elevated to the category of town.\n\n\nGeography\nSão Martinho de Anta is situated five kilometres from the municipal seat, along the roadway that connects Sabrosa and Vila Real. It includes various hamlets and places including Anta, Garganta, Roalde, São Martinho de Anta, Queda and Fragas, occupying an area of approximately 16 km2. It is the largest population in Sabrosa, after the municipal seat, but its population increases considerably during the month of August, due to returnee emigrants on their vacations.\nIn the location of Tenaria (Roalde), the Ceira River is known to spring, bring water to the Douro River.\nIn addition to recreational sites, as an autocross track and tennis courts, the parish is benefited by many local services, such as the daily trash collection, connected to public water supply and drainage, a day centre, an extension of the municipal health care centre, pharmacy, post office, primary school and mini-market.\n\n\nArchitecture\nChapel of Nossa Senhora da Azinheira (Our Lady Day of the Holmoak), dating from the 18th century, it includes an ornate retable and painted ceiling. It is the centre of annual pilgrimages in honour of the Virgin Mary on 15 August and on 11 November dedicated to Saint Martin.\n\n\nNotable citizens\nAdolfo Correia Rocha, more commonly known as  Miguel Torga (12 August  1907 – Coimbra; 17 January 1995), a medic, poet and writer, receiving literary awards for his poetry, short stories, theater and a 16 volume diary, including \"Os Contos da Montanha\".\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Benque Viejo del Carmen (\"Benque\") is the westernmost town in Belize, 130 km (81 mi) by road west and south of Belize City, at the Guatemalan border. San Ignacio lies 13 km to the east and Melchor de Mencos just across the border. The Mopan River runs along the town's north and west edges.\n\n\nEarly development\nPre-Colonial & Maya Influence before the arrival of Spanish-speaking settlers, the Maya civilization had already been present in the area for centuries. The nearby Xunantunich ruins, just a few kilometers from Benque, suggest that this region was part of a thriving Maya trade and ceremonial hub. The Mopan and Yucatec Maya likely lived in scattered settlements along the Mopan River, using the fertile land for farming.  \n\n\nArrival of Mestizo and Maya refugees (mid- to late-1800s)\nThe modern town of Benque Viejo del Carmen was established in the mid-to-late 19th century by Mestizo and Maya refugees fleeing the Caste War of Yucatán (1847–1901). This war was a violent conflict in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, where the indigenous Maya rebelled against Spanish and Mestizo rule. Many Yucatec Maya and Mestizo families sought safety in British Honduras (now Belize), settling in areas like San Ignacio, Corozal, Orange Walk, and Benque Viejo del Carmen.  \nDuring the same period, some Mopan Maya were also fleeing forced labor and military conscription in Guatemala. They crossed into western Belize, where the British colonial government gave them temporary protection, allowing them to settle along the Mopan River.  \n\n\nEarly economy and growth\nThe early settlers of Benque primarily engaged in agriculture, logging, and trade. Chicle tapping (harvesting sap from sapodilla trees for chewing gum production) became a major industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many men from Benque worked as chicleros, tapping trees in the dense forests of western Belize.  \nThe Mopan River played a key role in trade, providing a natural route for transporting goods such as corn, beans, livestock, and timber. Benque’s location near the Guatemalan border also encouraged cross-border trade, a tradition that continues today.  \n\n\nReligious and cultural influence\nAs the town grew, so did its Catholic identity. The settlers built the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, which became the center of religious and social life. The church was named after the Virgin of Mount Carmel, the town’s patron saint. The annual Fiesta de la Virgen del Carmen, celebrated every July, remains one of Benque’s most important cultural events.  \nTraditional marimba music, dances, and festivals became an essential part of Benque’s cultural heritage, heavily influenced by Mestizo and Guatemalan traditions.  \n\n\nFormal recognition and growth in the 20th Century\nBy the early 1900s, Benque had become a well-established town with schools, churches, and local businesses. It was officially recognized as a town in 1904, solidifying its place in Belize’s history. The town continued to develop, and its economy remained tied to agriculture, forestry, and cross-border commerce.  \n\n\nBenque today\nDespite its small-town charm, Benque has grown into a lively border community with a strong Belizean-Guatemalan cultural blend. The Mopan River, once a key trade route, is now a scenic spot for visitors and locals. The town is still known for its Catholic traditions, marimba music, and historical importance in Belize’s western region.  \n\n\nHistorical background\nBenque was first settled by Maya from Flores, El Petén, Guatemala. It grew as a lumber camp on the Mopan River that flowed into the Belize River, to the coast at Belize Town. The Mayas had been catechized by Spanish Catholic missionaries, leading to the predominance of the Catholic church in Benque, which holds the earliest Baptismal records in Cayo District from Jesuit Fr. Bavastro in May 1865. In 1877 the town was served by Manuel Ignacio Santa Cruz Loidi, a Basque priest and military leader in the unsuccessful effort to defeat the liberals in Spain's Third Carlist War. During the 1880s Fr. Jose Maria Pinelo, a refugee from Petén during the presidency of Manuel Barillas, visited Benque, remaining from 1887 to 1889. In the 1890s the population was about 500. In 1904 a permanent Catholic residency was established by Jesuit Fr. William “Buck” Stanton. \n\nThen in 1913, at the persuasion of Jesuit Fr. Versavel, the Pallottine sisters came from Germany and served first in Benque.  Mother (Saint) Katharine Drexel subsidized their convent from her inheritance. On the night of 16 November 1937 a fire destroyed the Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and Fr. Kuenzel undertook to build the new church. In 1950, Kuenzel persuaded the Town Board to name the new football field after Corporal Marchalleck through whose \"self-sacrificing interest and persevering efforts [the] football campus came as if by magic out of what was hitherto useless tropical bush.\". St. Joseph Convent on the street of that name was completed in 1952. On 18 January 1961 Fr. Sontag, Jesuit pastor in Benque, was found murdered at his desk in the rectory, with a machete the likely weapon. The perpetrator and motive remain a mystery. In 1963 a Catholic primary school building of reinforced concrete was built. The next year the Jesuits handed the parish over to the diocesan clergy, with Fr. Herbert Panton its first native pastor. The Catholic community SOLT increased its presence in Belize from the early 1990s, beginning in Benque. Deacon Cal Cathers of SOLT founded BRC printing in Benque to improve the quality of elementary school textbooks in Belize, with his grandson Daryl Rene Calvin Cathers to implement and encourage further development for humble town.\n\n\nDemographics\nAt the time of the 2010 census, Benque Viejo del Carmen had a population of 6,148. Of these, 93.4% were Mestizo, 2.4% Mixed, 1.5% Creole, 0.7% Asian, 0.5% Garifuna, 0.4% Mennonite, 0.3% Caucasian, 0.3% Mopan Maya, 0.2% Yucatec Maya, 0.1% Ketchi Maya and 0.1% African.\nDuring the first years of the 21st century Benque experienced a rapid boom in population. In 2010 its population, mostly of Maya or Mestizo descent, was 5,824 (2,906 males and 2,918 females); households numbered 1,415 with average size 4.1. \nIn terms of languages spoken (multiple answers allowed), 97.0% spoke Spanish, 69.9% English, 7.4% Creole, 0.6% Mandarin or Cantonese, 0.5% Garifuna, 0.3% Yucatec Maya, 0.2% Ketchi Maya, 0.2% Mopan Maya, 0.1% German and 0.3% other languages; 0.1% could not speak.\nBenque has long been the place where tourists and merchants cross to Melchor and purchase Maya textiles. Now Guatemalan youth cross the border each day to receive a secondary education in English. Benque offers primary and secondary education, supermarkets, an annual fiesta, and is home to a Belize Premier Football League team.\nThe ancient Maya ruins of Xunantunich are nearby. Film director Caleb Botton used the town as the backdrop for 7 Days in Carmel which featured Benque's Holy Week processions. \nAs of May 2015, the mayor is Heraldo \"Rancha\" Ramcharan Jr. of the United Democratic Party, which also controls the town council.\n\n\nReferences",

The result, 66.02% in favor of the Yes campaign, was published on 4 March 2018. It was decisive for Angela Merkel's plan to get re-elected as chancellor of Germany on 14 March in the German Bundestag.\n\n\nBackground\nFrom 2005, the SPD had been the junior partner in successive coalition governments led by Angela Merkel. After the German Federal elections in 2017 in which the SPD received only 20.5% of the vote, its worst result since the Second World War, SPD leader Martin Schulz ruled out any participation of his party in a new federal government with the CDU party of Angela Merkel. Even after the failed coalition talks between CDU, FDP, and Alliance 90/The Greens, the party board stuck to the decision. But, by late 2017, the attitude of the SPD's leadership had changed with its board voting in favor of exploratory talks in December that year. After the initial discussion's were successfully completed, the SPD entered formal coalition talks with CDU and CSU in January 2018. Martin Schulz had to step down after the coalition talks.\n\n\nProcedure\nAll SPD members received their election documents in the run up to 20 February 2018. All registered members on the 6 February 2018 at 6 p.m., (a total of 463,723) were eligible to vote. The question was: \"Soll die Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) den mit der Christlich Demokratischen Union (CDU) und der Christlich-Sozialen Union (CSU) ausgehandelten Koalitionsvertrag vom Februar 2018 abschließen?\" (\"Should the Social Democratic Party of Germany enter into the coalition treaty agreed with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union of Germany (CSU) in February 2018?\")\n\n\nCampaign\nSeveral SPD politicians asked the party members to vote Yes, such as Andrea Nahles and Thomas Oppermann. Kevin Kühnert, chairman of the Jusos party youth organisation and the #NoGroKo (No Grand Coalition) initiative promoted the No campaign. Some SPD politicians such as SPD vice chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel feared extensive consequences for the party, in the case of a No vote. The Minister President of Lower Saxony, Stephan Weil, warned of a \"phase of political instability\" in the case of a No victory. Also, the German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel urged his party \"not to retreat into the study rooms\". New Federal elections were seen by many observers as a possible result of a No vote, whilst a CDU minority government was considered a possibility by some.\n\n\nResult\nThe result was 66.02% in favor of the coalition agreement.\n\n\nReferences",

Though assisted by Reginald Barker and Clifford Smith, Hart largely oversaw the direction himself. His combined salary as actor and director was $150 per week (equivalent to $4,000 in 2024).\nA partial print of the film survives in the Library of Congress, and was restored at the Museo del Cine Pablo Ducrós Hicken in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n\nPlot\n\nA hardworking miner, Steve Denton (Hart), has become wealthy after years of prospecting. He sets out to visit his ailing mother, Mrs. Denton (Claire).\nIn the town of Yellow Ridge, however, he becomes entangled with a dance hall girl named Trixie (Glaum), known as \"the firefly.\" Trixie swindles him out of his gold and intercepts a telegram informing him of his mother's condition.\nThe following day, Denton learns that his mother has died. Devastated and enraged by Trixie's deception and what he sees as the betrayal of those around him, he kills her lover, Chip Emmett (Mayall), and abducts her. Dragging her by the hair, he takes her into the desert. There, in isolation, he enslaves Trixie and renounces \"white civilization.\" He declares hatred for white men and women, and assumes command of a group of Indian and Mexican bandits.\nTwo years later, a wagon train of lost and dying Mississippi farmers appeals to Denton for help. He refuses. That night, Mary Jane Garth (Love), an innocent and courageous young woman among the migrants, visits him in secret and pleads their case. She declares her belief that no white man would abandon a woman in need.\nHer words stir Denton. He is moved to act, and guides the wagon train to safety. Once their survival is secured, he resumes his solitary life in the desert.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nCast notes\nHart later reflected on his performance:\n\nI think the most disagreeable part I ever had was in The Aryan. It was hard for me to really feel it, being that of a white man, forswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades, and allows white women to be attacked by them. It is difficult to put all one's decent instincts aside and live and think as such a despicable character must have done. But by allowing myself only to think of the terrible wrong that the white race had done me—pure imagery—I settled into it, and I am sure Bessie Love at the time believed I was the typical brute.\n\n\nProduction\nHart initially rejected the screenplay by C. Gardner Sullivan for lacking a clear motive behind the protagonist's harsh demeanor. He pushed for an explanation that would make the character's cruelty believable. Sullivan eventually agreed.\nAlthough silent, the script included long speeches, which were filmed and edited down.\n\nHart wanted Mae Marsh for the role of Mary Jane, but she was unavailable. D. W. Griffith suggested newcomer Bessie Love.\nThe film was produced during the height of Hart's career, but was notable for casting him as a severe and unsympathetic figure. The title reflects the racial ideologies common in early 20th-century American cinema. Hart later described the character of Steve Denton as \"a white man who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them.\"\nFilming took place at Inceville and in Sulphur Canyon.\n\n\nReception\n\nEarly reviews were highly positive. Acting, cinematography, and direction were praised. Hart himself considered it one of his finest Westerns.\nMore recent evaluations have criticized the film's racial themes. Scholar Andrew Brodie Smith called it \"a sophisticated expression of racism in the Western genre.\" Others have identified it as one of the first films to explicitly endorse white supremacy over Native Americans.\n\n\nSee also\nRacism in early American film\nWhitewashing in film\n\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nWorks cited\nDavis, Ronald L.

He served as Assistant Government Whip from September to October 2022.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nDamien Moore was born on 26 April 1980 in Workington, Cumbria. He studied history at the University of Central Lancashire. After graduating, he worked in various roles in the retail sector, gaining promotion to be a retail manager for Asda.\n\n\nPolitical career\nHe was first elected as a councillor for the Conservative Party on Preston City Council in 2010 for the Greyfriars Ward. He was re-elected with an increased majority on 5 May 2016. He has served as deputy leader of the Conservative group on the Council and as Chairman of the Preston Conservative Association. He unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative candidate in the Preston West division in the Lancashire County Council elections in 2013 and 2017.\nAt the 2015 general election, Moore stood in Southport, coming second with 28% of the vote behind the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP John Pugh.\n\n\nParliamentary career\nAt the snap 2017 general election, Moore was elected to Parliament as MP for Southport with 38.7% of the vote and a majority of 2,914.   \nOn 11 September 2017, Damien Moore was appointed to the Petitions Committee. The committee assists members of the public in raising issues directly. In January 2018 he was also appointed the Science and Technology Committee.  \nIn advance of the 2018 Preston City Council election, Moore resigned as a city councillor to focus on his parliamentary work.  \nIn December 2019, Moore was placed 611 of 650 MPs in the 2019 People-Power Index, a health check of how Parliament is working and how our MPs are listening to and engaging with, their constituents.\nMoore was re-elected as MP for Southport at the 2019 general election with an increased vote share of 47.6% and an increased majority of 4,147. His election campaign was viewed as contentious as Moore claimed he had secured £25 million from the New Towns Fund for Southport, when in fact the town actually had only the opportunity to bid for up to £25 million.\nOn 21 October 2020, Moore was the only MP from Merseyside to vote against extending the 80% furlough rate for people forced out of work in tier three lockdown areas, despite his own constituency and Merseyside being in tier three lockdown at the time.\nFollowing Labour's motion calling to extend free school meals for the poorest children on 21 October 2020, Moore abstained and protestors sent a message of dissatisfaction by leaving paper plates with messages written on them outside Moore's office in Post Office Avenue, Southport.\nIn October 2020, a group of Conservative MPs in northern England launched a new campaign group, The Northern Research Group. The aim of the group said was to pressure the government to stick to their post-election pledge of \"levelling up\" the north by spending money and increasing infrastructure projects in the area. Moore signed up to this group.

    "text": "Barabbas (Italian: Barabba) is a 1961 religious epic film directed by Richard Fleischer for Dino De Laurentiis Cinematografica, expanding on the life of Barabbas, from the Christian Passion narrative in the Gospel of Mark and other gospels. It stars Anthony Quinn, Silvana Mangano, Katy Jurado, Arthur Kennedy, Harry Andrews, Ernest Borgnine, Vittorio Gassman, and Jack Palance. The screenplay is based on Nobel Prize-winner Pär Lagerkvist's 1950 novel of the same title.\nThe film was shot in Verona and Rome. It included many highly acclaimed scenes, including a battle of gladiators in a Cinecittà film studio mock-up of the Colosseum, and a crucifixion shot during an actual total solar eclipse. It was released in Italy on December 23, 1961, and in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 10, 1962. In Italy, the film was nominated for three Nastro d'Argento Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design).\nA previous film version of the novel, in Swedish, had been made in 1953.\n\n\nPlot\n\nPontius Pilate offers to release either Jesus of Nazareth or Barabbas, in keeping with the Passover custom. The crowd gathered for the pardoning chooses Barabbas, and Jesus is condemned to crucifixion, while Barabbas is set free. Returning to his friends, Barabbas asks for his lover, Rachel. His friends inform him that Rachel has become a follower of Christ. Rachel soon returns, but she is not happy to see Barabbas, and they tussle physically.\nBarabbas witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. As Jesus dies, the sky turns black, and Barabbas is shaken. He watches Christ's body sealed in the tomb. On the third morning, Barabbas finds the tomb open. Rachel tells him that Christ has risen, but Barabbas says it is an illusion or his followers have stolen the body. He visits the apostles; they do not know where he is, but also believe he is risen.\nRachel preaches in Jerusalem about Christ Jesus himself and is stoned to death at the insistence of the priests. Barabbas, guilt-ridden, returns to his criminal ways and tries to rob a caravan transporting several of the priests. When the robbery goes bad, Barabbas does not try to flee, and he is captured by Roman soldiers. The law forbids Pilate from executing someone who has previously been pardoned, so he sentences Barabbas to lifelong slavery in the sulfur mines of Sicily.\nBarabbas survives this hellish existence for the next twenty years. He is chained to Sahak, a Christian sailor who was sent to the mines for allowing slaves to escape. Sahak at first hates Barabbas for being pardoned instead of \"the Master\", but the two men eventually become friends. Over time, Sahak becomes too weak to work. As the guards are about to kill him, the mine is destroyed in an earthquake, with Sahak and Barabbas the only survivors. Julia, the superstitious wife of the local prefect, considers them blessed. The prefect is due to leave for Rome, having been appointed to the Senate. Julia insists that Barabbas and Sahak accompany him for good luck.\nOnce in Rome, the men are trained to become gladiators by Torvald, the top gladiator in Rome. After a gladiatorial event, Sahak is overheard sharing his faith with other gladiators, and is condemned to death for treason, in this case practicing a non state sanctioned religion. When a squad deliberately miss throwing their spears, Torvald executes Sahak. The next day, Torvald and Barabbas battle in the arena. Barabbas wins, killing Torvald and impressing Emperor Nero, who sets him free. Barabbas takes Sahak's corpse to the catacombs, where the local Christians are worshiping. They give him a proper burial.\nBarabbas becomes lost in the catacombs. When he eventually emerges, Rome is on fire. Barabbas is told that the Christians started the fire. Believing that the end of the world has come (as Rachel and Sahak had taught), Barabbas sets fire to more buildings. He is confronted by Roman soldiers and tells them that he is a follower of Christ. He is imprisoned with several other Christians, among them the apostle Peter. Peter admonishes Barabbas for committing arson, informing him that Christians would not do such a thing.  Afterwards, the Christians are executed by mass crucifixion in the persecutions that follow the fire. Having finally placed his faith in Christ, Barabbas is crucified with the others, though his last words are, \"Darkness... I give myself up into your keeping... It is Barabbas\".\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\nBefore major casting began, Yul Brynner was actively considered for the title role of Barabbas, yet never got the part. His previous Biblical film roles were Rameses II in The Ten Commandments and Solomon in Solomon and Sheba.\nThe music score by Mario Nascimbene, which was conducted by Franco Ferrara, the noted conductor and lecturer on conducting at several famous international academies, was noted for its unusual, stark experimental component – the composer referred to his work, which included the introduction of electronic sounds achieved by the manipulation of tape speeds,  as  \"new sounds\". The main theme was based on the \"Kyrie\" from \"Orbis Factor:Missa XI\" which is a part of the Roman Catholic Ordinary. The depiction of the crucifixion was filmed on 15 February 1961 during an actual total eclipse of the sun.\n\n\nDifferences from the book\nIn Pär Lagerkvist's original novel, Barabbas' later crime that sends him into slavery is left vague. He is sent to the copper mines of Cyprus, rather than Sicily as in the film. Sahak (Vittorio Gassman) and Barabbas (Anthony Quinn) are freed from the mines by an overseer friendly to Christians, rather than it being destroyed by an earthquake. There are no gladiatorial scenes anywhere in the book, as Barabbas is made a field slave and then a house slave to his Roman owner.\n\n\nReception\nBarabbas received positive reviews; it currently holds an 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\n\nAwards\nNominee Best Color Cinematography - Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists (Aldo Tonti)\nNominee Best Costume Design - Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists (Maria De Matteis)\nNominee Best Production Design - Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists (Mario Chiari)\nSelected Top Foreign Films of the Year - National Board of Review\n\n\nSee also\n\n1961 in film\nList of Italian films of 1961\nList of Easter films\nList of films featuring eclipses\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBarabbas at IMDb\nBarabbas at the TCM Movie Database\nBarabbas at Rotten Tomatoes",

    "title": "Arnulf of Carinthia",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2510",
    "text": "Arnulf of Carinthia (c. 850 – 8 December 899) was the duke of Carinthia who overthrew his uncle Emperor Charles the Fat to become the Carolingian king of East Francia from 887, the disputed king of Italy from 894, and the disputed emperor from 22 February 896 until his rival Lambert's death in late 898. He died on 8 December 899 at Ratisbon just a year later, in Bavaria. He was the last member of the Carolingian dynasty from the male line to rule in Italy as both King and Emperor, despite his rule being contested by his rivals Lambert of Italy and his cousin Berengar I of Italy.\n\n\nEarly life\n\n\nIllegitimacy and early life\nArnulf was the illegitimate son of Carloman of Bavaria and Liutswind. After Arnulf's birth, Carloman married before 861, a daughter of Count Ernst, who died after 8 August 879. As it is mainly West-Franconian historiography that speaks of Arnulf's illegitimacy, it is quite possible that the two women are actually the same person, Liutswind, and that Carloman married Arnulf's mother, thus legitimizing his son.\nArnulf was granted the rule over the Duchy of Carinthia, a Frankish vassal state and successor of the ancient Principality of Carantania by his father, after Carloman reconciled with his own father, King Louis the German, and was made king in the Duchy of Bavaria.\nArnulf spent his childhood in Mosaburch or Mosapurc, which is widely believed to be Moosburg in Carinthia. Moosburg was a few miles away from one of the imperial residences, the Carolingian Kaiserpfalz at Karnburg, which had been the residence of the Carantanian princes. Arnulf kept his seat here, and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own duke. Later, after he had been crowned King of East Francia, Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the March of Carinthia, a part of the Duchy of Bavaria.\n\n\nRegional ruler\nAfter Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879, Louis the Younger inherited Bavaria, Charles the Fat was given the Kingdom of Italy, and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman. However, Bavaria was more or less ruled by Arnulf during the summer and autumn of 879 while his father arranged his succession. He was also granted \"Pannonia\", in the words of the Annales Fuldenses, or \"Carantanum\", in the words of Regino of Prüm. The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 after Carloman's death.\nWhen Engelschalk II of Pannonia in 882 rebelled against Margrave Aribo and ignited the Wilhelminer War, Arnulf supported him and accepted his and his brother's homage. This ruined Arnulf's relationship with his uncle, Emperor Charles the Fat, and put him at war with Svatopluk of Moravia. Pannonia was invaded, but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers. Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885, by which time the Moravian ruler was loyal to the emperor. Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulf's hopes of succeeding Charles the Fat.\n\n\nKing of East Francia\n\nArnulf took the leading role in the deposition of Charles the Fat. With the support of the Frankish nobles, Arnulf called a Diet at Tribur and deposed Charles in November 887, under threat of military action. Charles peacefully agreed to this involuntary retirement, but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking for a few royal villas in Swabia on which to live out his final months, which Arnulf granted him. Arnulf, having distinguished himself in the war against the Slavs, was then elected king by the nobles of East Francia (only the eastern realm, though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish Empire). West Francia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, and the Kingdom of Italy elected their own kings from the Carolingian family.\nLike many rulers of the period, Arnulf was heavily involved in ecclesiastical disputes. In 895, at the Diet of Tribur, he presided over a dispute between the episcopal sees of Bremen, Hamburg, and Cologne over jurisdictional authority, which saw Bremen and Hamburg remain a combined see, independent of the see of Cologne.\nArnulf was more a fighter than a negotiator. In 890, he was successfully battling Slavs in Pannonia. In early/mid-891, Vikings invaded Lotharingia and crushed an East Frankish army at Maastricht. Terms such as \"Vikings\", \"Danes\", \"Northmen\" and \"Norwegians\" have been used loosely and interchangeably to describe these invaders. In September 891, Arnulf repelled the Vikings and essentially ended their attacks on that front. The Annales Fuldenses report that there were so many dead Northmen that their bodies blocked the run of the river. After this victory, Arnulf built a castle on an island in the Dijle river.\n\n\nIntervention in West Francia\nArnulf took advantage of the problems in West Francia after the death of Charles the Fat to secure the territory of Lotharingia, which he converted into a kingdom for his son Zwentibold. In 889, Arnulf supported the claim of Louis the Blind to the kingdom of Provence, after receiving a personal appeal from Louis' mother, Ermengard, who came to see Arnulf at Forchheim in May 889.\n\nRecognising the superiority of Arnulf's position in 888, king Odo of France formally accepted the suzerainty of Arnulf. In 893, Arnulf switched his support from Odo to Charles the Simple after being persuaded by Fulk, Archbishop of Reims, that it was in his best interests. Arnulf then took advantage of the following fighting between Odo and Charles in 894, harrying some territories of West Francia. At one point, Charles the Simple was forced to flee to Arnulf and ask for his protection. His intervention soon forced Pope Formosus to get involved, as he was worried that a divided and war weary West Francia would be easy prey for the Vikings.\nIn 895, Arnulf summoned both Charles and Odo to his residence at Worms. Charles's advisers convinced him not to go, and he sent a representative in his place. Odo, on the other hand, personally attended, together with a large retinue, bearing many gifts for Arnulf. Angered by the non-appearance of Charles, he welcomed Odo at the Diet of Worms in May 895 and again supported Odo's claim to the throne of West Francia. In the same assembly he crowned his illegitimate son Zwentibold as the king of Lotharingia.\n\n\nWars with Moravia\nAs early as 880, Arnulf had designs on Great Moravia and had the Frankish bishop Wiching of Nitra interfere with the missionary activities of the Eastern Orthodox priest Methodius, with the aim of preventing any potential for creating a unified Moravian state. Arnulf had formal relations with the ruler of the Moravian Kingdom, Svatopluk, using them to learn the latter's military and political secrets. Later, these tactics were used to occupy the territory of the Greater Moravian state.\nArnulf failed to conquer the whole of Great Moravia in wars of 892, 893, and 899. Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes, in particular in 895, when the Duchy of Bohemia broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal state. An accord was reached between him and Duke of Bohemia Borivoj I. Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of Frankish invasion. In 893 or 894 Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory—present-day western Hungary—to him. As a reward, Wiching became Arnulf's chancellor in 892. In his attempts to conquer Moravia, in 899 Arnulf reached out to Magyars who had settled in the Carpathian Basin, and with their help he imposed a measure of control over Moravia.\n\n\nKing of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor\n\nIn Italy Guy III of Spoleto and Berengar of Friuli fought over the Iron Crown of Lombardy. Berengar had been crowned king in 887, but Guy was then crowned in 889. While Pope Stephen V supported Guy, even crowning him Roman Emperor in 891, Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar.\nIn 893, the new Pope Formosus, not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors Guy and his son Lambert, sent an embassy to Omuntesberch, where Arnulf was meeting with Svatopluk, to request that Arnulf come and liberate Italy, where he would be crowned emperor in Rome. Arnulf met the Primores of the Kingdom of Italy, dismissed them with gifts and promised to assist the pope. Arnulf then sent Zwentibold with a Bavarian army to join Berengar. They defeated Guy but were bought off and left in autumn.\nWhen Pope Formosus again asked Arnulf to invade, the duke personally led an army across the Alps, early in 894. In January 894, Bergamo fell, and Count Ambrose, Guy's representative in the city, was hanged from a tree by the city's gates. Conquering all of the territory north of the Po River, Arnulf forced the surrender of Milan and then drove Guy out of Pavia, where he was crowned King of Italy. Arnulf went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn, and a fever incapacitated his troops. His march northward through the Alps was interrupted by Rudolph I of Burgundy, and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range. In retaliation, Arnulf ordered Zwentibold to ravage Rudolph's kingdom. In the meantime, Lambert and his mother Ageltrude travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession, but when Pope Formosus, still desiring to crown Arnulf, refused, he was imprisoned in Castel Sant'Angelo.\n\nIn September 895, a new papal embassy arrived in Regensburg beseeching Arnulf's aid. In October, Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy. He crossed the Alps quickly and again took Pavia, but then he continued slowly, garnering support among the nobility of Tuscany. Maginulf, Count of Milan, and Walfred of Friuli joined him. Eventually even Adalbert II of Tuscany abandoned Lambert. Finding Rome locked against him and held by Ageltrude, Arnulf had to take the city by force on 21 February 896, freeing the pope. Arnulf was then greeted at the Ponte Milvio by the Roman Senate who escorted him into the Leonine City, where he was received by Pope Formosus on the steps of the Santi Apostoli.\nOn 22 February 896, Formosus led the king into the church of St. Peter, anointed and crowned him as emperor, and saluted him as Augustus. Arnulf then proceeded to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, where he received the homage of the Roman people, who swore \"never to hand over the city to Lambert or his mother Ageltrude\". Arnulf then proceeded to exile to Bavaria two leading senators, Constantine and Stephen, who had helped Ageltrude to seize Rome.\nLeaving one of his vassals, Farold, to hold Rome, two weeks later Arnulf marched on Spoleto, where Ageltrude had fled to join Lambert. However at this point, Arnulf had a stroke, forcing him to call off the campaign and return to Bavaria. Rumours of the time made Arnulf's condition to be a result of poisoning at the hand of Ageltrude.\nArnulf retained power in Italy only as long as he was personally there. On his way north, he stopped at Pavia where he crowned his illegitimate son Ratold as sub-king of Italy, after which he left Ratold in Milan in an attempt to preserve his hold on Italy. That same year Pope Formosus died, leaving Lambert once again in power, and both he and Berengar proceeded to kill any officials who had been appointed by Arnulf, forcing Ratold to flee from Milan to Bavaria. For the rest of his life Arnulf exercised very little control in Italy, and his agents in Rome did not prevent the accession of Pope Stephen VI in 896. The pope initially gave his support to Arnulf but eventually became a supporter of Lambert.\n\n\nFinal years\nIn addition to after effects of the stroke, Arnulf contracted morbus pediculosis (infestation of pubic lice on his eyelid), which prevented him from effectively dealing with the problems besetting his reign. Italy was lost, raiders from Moravia and Magyars were continually harassing his lands, and Lotharingia was in revolt against Zwentibold. He was also plagued by escalating violence and power struggles among the lower Frankish nobility.\nOn 8 December 899 Arnulf died at Ratisbon, in present-day Bavaria. He is entombed in St. Emmeram's Basilica at Regensburg, which is now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, the palace of the princes of Thurn und Taxis. He was succeeded as the king of East Francia by his only legitimate son from Ota, Louis the Child. After Louis' death in 911 at age 17 or 18, the East Frankish branch of the Carolingian dynasty ceased to exist. Arnulf had had the nobility recognize the rights of his illegitimate sons, Zwentibold and Ratold, as his successors. Zwentibold continued to rule Lotharingia until his murder in 900.\n\n\nSee also\n\nFamily tree of German monarchs\nList of Frankish kings\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nDuckett, Eleanor (1968).

The Tendring Hundred Railway was operated by the Great Eastern Railway, which subsequently bought the line and the adjacent Clacton-on-Sea Railway on 1 July 1883.\nWhen the line first opened there was no station at Frinton, which was then a very small village. The nearest stations were at Kirby Cross and Walton-on-the-Naze.

He previously served as bishop of Trenton in New Jersey (1934–1940).\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nEarly life\nMoses Kiley was born on November 13, 1876, in Margaree, on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, to John and Margaret (née McGarry) Kiley. He received his early education at a grade school in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.  When Kiley was 16, the family immigrated to the United States, moving to Somerville, Massachusetts. He financed his higher education by working as an errand boy at a carriage shop in Somerville established by his older brothers. He also worked as a floorwalker at a department store in Boston and as a trolley motorman.\nIn 1903, Kiley enrolled at the College of St. Laurent in Montreal, Quebec. After three years in Montreal, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1906. The following year, Kiley was sent to Rome, where he resided at the Pontifical North American College. While in Rome, he earned a doctorate in philosophy from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas in 1909, and a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Urban University in 1911.\n\n\nPriesthood\n\nKiley was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Chicago in Rome by Archbishop James Quigley on June 10, 1911.\nFollowing his return to the United States, the archdiocese assigned Kiley as a curate at St. Agnes Parish in Chicago, Illinois, where he remained for five years. In 1916, he established the Mission of the Holy Cross for homeless men. That same year, he was named the first archdiocesan director of Catholic Charities, a post he held until 1926. The Vatican elevated Kiley to the rank of monsignor in 1924.\nKiley returned to Rome in 1926 to serve as spiritual director of the Pontifical North American College.\n\n\nBishop of Trenton\nOn February 10, 1934, Kiley was appointed the fifth bishop of Trenton by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on  March 17, 1934, from Cardinal Raffaele Rossi, with Cardinal Carlo Salotti and Archbishop Thomas Walsh serving as co-consecrators, at the Church of Santa Susanna in Rome. His most notable achievement in Trenton was refinancing $10,000,000 of church obligations.\n\n\nArchbishop of Milwaukee\n\nFollowing the transfer of Archbishop Samuel Stritch to the Archdiocese of Chicago, Kiley was appointed the sixth archbishop of Milwaukee by Pope Pius XII on January 1, 1940. Kiley was installed at the Church of the Gesu in Milwaukee on March 28, 1940.\nDuring his tenure in Milwaukee, Kiley earned a reputation as a conservative leader and stern administrator. He oversaw an extensive renovation of the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Milwaukee, which had suffered major fire damage in 1935.\nKiley rebuilt the St. Aemillian Orphanage in Milwaukee, also damaged by fire in the 1930s. Kiley also renovated St. Francis Seminary in St. Francis, Wisconsin, converted Pio Nono High School into a minor seminary, and created a Catholic Family Life Bureau in 1948.\n\n\nDeath\nMoses Kiley died on April 15, 1953, at St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, at age 76.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial site of the Holy See",

    "title": "The Kingkiller Chronicle",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=22628945",
    "text": "The Kingkiller Chronicle is a planned fantasy trilogy by the American writer Patrick Rothfuss. The first two books, The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear, were released in 2007 and 2011. The books released in the series have sold over 10 million copies.\nThe series centers on a man named Kvothe, an infamous adventurer and musician telling his life story to a scribe. The book is told in a \"story-within-a-story\" format: a frame narrative relates the present day in which Kvothe runs an inn under an assumed name and is told in omniscient third person. The main plot, making up the majority of the books and concerning the actual details of Kvothe's life, is told in the first person. The series also contains metafictional stories within stories from varying perspectives that tie to the main plot in various ways.\n\n\nSynopsis\nThe Kingkiller Chronicle tells the life story of a man named Kvothe. In the present day, Kvothe is a rural innkeeper, living under a pseudonym. In the past, he was a wandering trouper and musician who grew to be a notorious arcanist (wizard), known as the infamous \"Kingkiller.\"\nThe series is framed as the transcription of his three-day-long oral autobiography, where he \"trouped, traveled, loved, lost, trusted and was betrayed\". Present-day \"interludes\" concern his life as an innkeeper, with each present day depicted in a separate book.\nThe series is a secondary world fantasy. It has its own magic systems, mixing alchemy, sympathetic magic, sygaldry (a form of runic magic combined with medieval engineering), and naming (a type of magic that allows the user to command the classical elements and objects), plus others.\n\n\nWriting and publishing history\nThe Kingkiller Chronicle is intended to be a trilogy. The books are set in a fictional world referred to as the Four Corners in-universe; the world's official name, Temerant, was revealed in 2014.\nRothfuss began writing the series in 1994. He was inspired by the French writer Edmond Rostand's 19th century play Cyrano de Bergerac, calling it \"staggering\", adding: \"It destroyed me emotionally. Cyrano is proud, brilliant, gorgeous and arrogant -- and he's an ass. The story just breaks your heart.\" He was also inspired by Casanova's memoirs, crediting Casanova for showing \"how interesting an autobiography could be, provided the person telling it has a way with words and has lived a sufficiently adventurous life\". The series began in an attempt of marrying the picaresque qualities of Casanova's memoirs with the needs of a story like Cyrano's.\nThe series had the working title The Song of Flame and Thunder; the name was changed because he disliked it, as well as to avoid confusion with the George R. R. Martin series A Song of Ice and Fire. The first draft of the trilogy was completed in 2000, a draft he described as \"a hot mess\".\nIn 2002, Rothfuss entered and won a Writers of the Future contest, which led him to a workshop with author Tim Powers. This eventually led him to meeting his agent, who helped Rothfuss revise the first third of the story—now entitled The Name of the Wind—and sold it to DAW, which published the book in March 2007.\nDespite promises that the second and third books in the trilogy would follow on an annual schedule, revisions to the second book, including work to bring in the frame narrative and introduce characters that weren't in the original draft, caused delays. The Wise Man's Fear was released in 2011, topping the New York Times bestseller list.\nIn 2017, Rothfuss said that his editor and publisher Betsy Wollheim hadn't liked his proposed title, The Doors of Stone, for the third novel, but that it had \"by popular consensus\" become the \"de facto title\", after which she accepted it. The Doors of Stone is unreleased as of 2025, a point of contention online. Rothfuss has said that the book would \"conclude Kvothe's story\", closing off the current arc, but that further stories in the world of Temerant would be forthcoming. He also said that the book presented challenges different from The Wise Man's Fear's. In 2020, Rothfuss's publisher and editor Betsy expressed frustration with the delay, stating she had not read \"a word\" of the book nine years on. She published The Narrow Road Between Desires in 2023.\nIn 2021, Rothfuss apologized for the long delay in releasing The Doors of Stone, citing issues in his personal life and his mental health as reasons.\n\n\nThe books\nThe Kingkiller Chronicle is a projected trilogy:\n\nThe Name of the Wind (2007)\nThe Wise Man's Fear (2011)\nThe Doors of Stone\n\n\nRelated works\n\"How Old Holly Came to Be\", an experimental short story, was published in Unfettered (2013), edited by Shawn Speakman.\nThe Lightning Tree, a novella, was published in Rogues (2014), edited by George R. R. Martin & Gardner Dozois. The Lightning Tree takes place in the frame setting of The Kingkiller Chronicle, and includes characters from the trilogy, centered around the character of Bast.\nThe Slow Regard of Silent Things (2014, ISBN 978-0756410438), a novella focusing on a secondary character that appears in The Kingkiller Chronicle's main plot.\nThe Narrow Road Between Desires (2023, ISBN 978-0756419172), a novella centered on the character Bast (a revision and expansion of The Lightning Tree).\nIn 2012, Rothfuss sold three other books to his publisher, DAW. He has discussed a standalone novel, centered on a legendary figure in the world, with the working title The Tale of Laniel Young-Again. The project was two-thirds complete when it was shelved to focus on The Doors of Stone.\n\n\nIn other media\n\n\nFilm and television\nIn July 2013, 20th Century Fox optioned The Kingkiller Chronicle for a TV series. The production team included Arnon Milchan, Andrew Plotkin, Brad Weston, and Robert Lawrence, with Eric Heisserer writing the pilot episode and series bible, and executive producing it. Heisserer shopped the project in 2014, but announced he'd left the project in 2015. Two years later in October, the rights to the books expired and were reverted to Rothfuss. At the same time, Rothfuss announced that Lionsgate would be involved in adapting the series through a film, TV series, and video game. Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda was attached to serve as executive producer of the television series, along with John Rogers, Jennifer Court, Robert Lawrence, and Rothfuss, with music composed by Miranda. Showtime began developing the series as of October 2017, but ended their involvement two years later in September, causing the rights to return to Lionsgate TV, which is shopping it around. In 2022, Miranda confirmed he had exited the project.\nLindsey Beer was hired to write the screenplay for the film in 2016, while Sam Raimi was announced as the director in 2018, one of several who reportedly sought the role.\n\n\nGames\nThe metafictional strategic board game Tak: A Beautiful Game was released by Rothfuss and Cheapass Games in 2016 and designed by James Ernest. In 2019, Cheapass Games, including Tak, was sold to Greater Than Games. In March 2021, Greater Than Games re-released Tak: A Beautiful Game (2nd Edition) under its own brand, with new box art and board designs co-created with Rothfuss. There are no differences in the rules between the original and second edition.\n\n\nReception\nThe series has received critical acclaim. George R. R. Martin called The Wise Man's Fear his favorite fantasy novel of 2011, and said he wished he had written it. Authors such as Brandon Sanderson, Ursula K. Le Guin, Robin Hobb, Tad Williams, Anne McCaffrey, and Michael Chabon have expressed their admiration for the series. Lin-Manuel Miranda credited the books for inspiring a song in his show Hamilton, as well as a story beat in the Walt Disney film Moana. The game designer Ron Gilbert called the series the best fantasy he'd ever read.\nThe Wise Man's Fear topped The New York Times bestseller list, and the spin-off novella The Slow Regard of Silent Things spent a month on the same before dropping to the extended list.\nThe band Nightwish's song \"Edema Ruh\" is named after the series. Their spin-off band Auri is named, in part, after a character.\nRothfuss has spoken positively of fan fiction of the series, saying that he's looked forward to it, and that \"when people start writing fan fiction about your stuff, it shows that your writing has attained a level of popularity\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Kingkiller Chronicle series listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nThe Kingkiller Chronicle at the Internet Book List\nPatrick Rothfuss' web site\n\"Knackerman\" song, from lyrics Rothfuss had written for The Name of the Wind.

It was hoped that the British forces would join this Army in the event that they decided to advance up towards France.\nOn 11 January 1809, the Ejército del Centro comprised an effective and available force of 20,505 troops and officers, of a total force of 30,097 men. Headed by Field marshal, the Duke of Albuquerque (at the head of the Vanguard); Lieutenant general, the Marquis de Coupigny, at the head of the 1st Division; Field marshal, the Count of Orgaz, at the head of the 2nd Division, and Lieutenant general Manuel de Lapeña heading the Reserve troops.\nAlthough this structure was maintained until December 1810, there were some modifications to the original organisation. The Ejército de Estremadura was never fully integrated into the Ejercito del Centro, although two of its divisions did participate at Burgos (10 November 1808) and some of its troops, together with troops from the Ejercito del Centro, fought at Somosierra (30 November 1808).

    "text": "Mernda railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Mernda line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mernda in Victoria, Australia. Mernda is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. The original station opened on 23 December 1889. The station reopened on 26 August 2018 along with the duplication of track between South Morang and Mernda.\n\n\nHistory\nThe original Mernda station opened on 23 December 1889, when the railway line from Epping was extended to Whittlesea. It was originally named South Yan Yean, and was renamed Mernda on 1 December 1913.\nMernda operated until the closure of the line beyond Lalor on 29 November 1959, following the electrification of the line as far as Lalor. Epping was re-opened on 29 November 1964, with the electrification of that section of the line. The remaining section of track from Epping to Whittlesea was dismantled in the 1970s, although the former right-of-way remained intact. Prior to the rebuilding, all that remained of the former station was a degraded platform, which was overgrown with exotic vegetation, including a peppercorn tree. The station-master's house was believed to have been moved to the Findon Pony Club, and still serves as their clubrooms.\nRestoration of the railway to Mernda was identified as a goal in the Strategic Transportation Study undertaken by the City of Whittlesea in 2002. The council had forecast that the population in Mernda and Doreen will be 40,000 by that time. The South Morang and Mernda Rail Alliance, which was successful in lobbying the state government to fulfill its promise of reinstating the rail line to South Morang, then lobbied the government to commit to reinstating the line to Mernda. In February 2016, the Victorian State Government announced the station would reopen in 2019.\nThe State Government announced funding in its 2016/17 State Budget to provide 8 km of duplicated track between South Morang and Mernda, a rebuilt station at Mernda with 1,000 car-parking spaces, and an additional station to be built near Marymede Catholic College. On 26 August 2018, this extension opened.\n\n\nPlatforms and services\nMernda has one island platform with two faces.

    "title": "Havana",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=49719",
    "text": "Havana (; Spanish: La Habana [la aˈβana] ) is the capital and largest city of Cuba. The heart of La Habana Province, Havana is the country's main port and commercial center. It is the most populous city, the largest by area, and the second largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region. The population in 2021 was 2,142,939 inhabitants, and its area is 728.26 km2 (281.18 sq mi) for the capital city side and 8,475.57 km2 for the metropolitan zone. Its official population was 1,749,964 inhabitants in 2024.\nHavana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century. It served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for Spanish galleons returning to Spain. King Philip III of Spain granted Havana the title of capital in 1607. Walls and forts were built to protect the city. The city is the seat of the Cuban government and various ministries, and headquarters of businesses and over 100 diplomatic offices. The governor is Reinaldo García Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third-highest income in the country.\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThe city attracts over a million tourists annually; (1,176,627 international tourists in 2010, a 20% increase from 2005). Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.\n\n\nEtymology\nIn 1514, Diego Velázquez founded the city San Cristóbal de la Habana, which means \"Saint Christopher of the Habana\". It has been theorized that the name is derived from Habaguanex, who was the chief of a local Taíno-speaking Native American people group about whom nothing else is known. When Habana was adapted into English, the ⟨b⟩ was switched to a ⟨v⟩ because of a linguistic phenomenon known as betacism, which is an assimilation of the voiced bilabial plosive and voiced labiodental fricative sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects. Usage of the word Havana in literature understandably peaked during the Spanish–American War, but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city. Havana is the prevailing name for the city found in English-language dictionaries.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n16th century\n\nDiego Velázquez de Cuéllar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Batabanó on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque. All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed, however; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river.\nBetween 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established two settlements on the north coast, one of them in La Chorrera, around the site of the Torreón de la Chorrera, what eventually became the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the mouth of the Almendares River. The town that became Havana originated adjacent to what was then called Puerto de Carenas (literally, \"Careening Port\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\nPánfilo de Narváez gave Havana – the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba – its name: San Cristóbal de la Habana. The name combines San Cristóbal, patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the Conquista of other lands.\nHavana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by buccaneers, pirates, and French corsairs. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair Jacques de Sores in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities – not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive contrabando (black market) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the Casa de Contratación of Seville (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\nOn 20 December 1592, King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the Spanish Crown. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n\n17th century\n\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics. During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions. The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the hospital de San Lázaro, the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era.\nIn 1649 a fatal epidemic, brought from Cartagena in Colombia,  affected a third of the population of Havana. In 1674, the works for the City Walls were started, as part of the fortification efforts. They would be completed by 1740.\nBy the middle of the 18th century, Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York City.\n\n\n18th century\n\nDuring the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World.\nThe city was captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The episode began on 6 June 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the Royal Navy and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.\nAfter regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas like Cartagena, Colombia a city that under the leadership of Blas de Lezo defeated a British invasion of 30,000 sailors. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of San Carlos de la Cabaña, the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after Castillo San Cristóbal (the biggest) and Castillo San Felipe del Morro both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 15 January 1796, the remains of Christopher Columbus were transported to the island from Santo Domingo. They rested there until 1898, when they were transferred to Seville's Cathedral, after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n\n19th century\n\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles. \nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a 51 km (32 mi) stretch between Havana and Bejucal, which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of Güines to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the Tacón Theatre, one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the Knights of the Golden Circle to create a 'Golden Circle' with a 1200 mile-radius centered on Havana. After the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana. \nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the metropolis could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish presence in the Americas.\nThe sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish–American War.\n\n\n20th century\n\nCuba's first presidential period under Tomás Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the highest standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba. \nWhile Cuba had the highest ratio of hospital beds to population in the Caribbean, around 80% of these beds were located in the city of Havana, there was only one rural hospital and it was equipped with only 10 beds. In July 1940, during World War II, the Havana Conference was held and 21 American nations, including the host country Cuba, agreed to govern their own territories that were occupied by the Axis powers.\nIn 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Caribbean standards, and in some cases by world standards. Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in the Americas, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure \"at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants\", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1959, the new government under Fidel Castro began to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. embargo, shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966–68, the Cuban government had nationalized all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" as per law No. 1076.\nAn economic downturn occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars that the Soviet Union had given the Cuban government. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe.\n\n\n21st century\nTourism in Cuba has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, a new 5-star hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry. In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists. But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\nOn the night of 27 January 2019, an unusually violent and destructive tornado ripped through Havana. The tornado killed eight people and injured over 190. It was assigned an official rating of EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale by the Cuban Meteorology Institute, making this the first F4 or EF4 tornado in Cuba since 1940.\n\n\nAdministration\n\n\nSpanish Colony (1550 - 1601)\nThe Havana City Council first started in 1550.\nIn 1557, the Council voted to ban all freed black men from owning taverns, inns, selling tabaco, or wine.\n\n\nCaptaincy General (1550 - 1898)\nUnder the Captaincy General of Cuba, the Havana City Council existed.\n\n\nRepublic of Cuba (1901 - 1959)\nAfter the Cuban War of Independence, Cuba created a new constitution in 1901. The Havana City Council was re-inaugrated on July 2, 1901. Alfredo Zayas was briefly appointed mayor, followed by the installment of Miguel Gener y Rincón, the acting Secretary of Justice of Cuba, after winning the 1900 Cuban local elections.\nIn 1902, pending an investigation by Emilio Núñez, Gener was removed as mayor of Havana by Leonard Wood, after a vote of twenty-three out of twenty-five members of the City Council requested him to do so.\n\n\n1959 - 1989\nUnder the Communist administration, the administrative makeup of the city was re-structured.\n\n\nModern era\nThe governor is Yanet Hernández Pérez, she was elected on 28 May 2023.\nThe city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer, thus Havana functions as both a city and a province of Cuba. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.\n\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections every five years, and the Municipal Assemblies are responsible for each of the city's boroughs. These assemblies elect the borough presidents and vice presidents, which are equivalents to mayors and vice mayors in the other provinces. There is only one political party, the Communist Party, but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates within the boroughs in turn elect members of the Provincial Council (until 2019 the Provincial Assembly), which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president appoints the Governor and Vice Governor, who serve as the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Havana and can be either elected by the council or appointed by the president with council confirmation. There are direct elections for the city's deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local city delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. These councils are directly responsible for the city's neighbourhoods and wards. In addition, there is involvement of \"mass organizations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the Mayabeque Province on the south and east and to Artemisa Province on the west, since former La Habana Province (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n\nGeography\n\n\nLocation\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-meter) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of La Cabaña and El Morro, the sites of Spanish fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Castillo del Príncipe (Havana).\n\n\nClimate\nHavana has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents. Under the Köppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate (Af) and a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Average temperatures range from 22 °C (72 °F) in January and February to 28 °C (82 °F) in August. The temperature seldom drops below 10 °C (50 °F). The lowest temperature was 1 °C (34 °F) in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was 0 °C (32 °F) in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging 1,200 mm (47 in) annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country. The most recent tropical cyclone to come near Havana at hurricane strength was Ian in 2022.\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba. Nonetheless, on the evening of 28 January 2019, a very rare strong EF4 tornado struck the eastern side of Havana. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195. By 4 February the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.\nThe table lists temperature averages:\n\n\nMunicipalities\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities – or boroughs, which are further subdivided into 105 consejos populares (wards)\n\nPlaya: Santa Fe, Siboney, Cubanacán, Ampliación Almendares, Miramar, Sierra, Ceiba, Buena Vista.\nPlaza de la Revolución: El Carmelo, Vedado-Malecón, Rampa, Príncipe, Plaza, Nuevo Vedado-Puentes Grandes, Colón-Nuevo Vedado, Vedado.\nCentro Habana: Cayo Hueso, Pueblo Nuevo, Los Sitios, Dragones, Colón.\nLa Habana Vieja: Prado, Catedral, Plaza Vieja, Belén, San Isidro, Jesús María, Tallapiedra.\nRegla: Guaicanimar, Loma Modelo, Casablanca.\nLa Habana del Este: Camilo Cienfuegos, Cojímar, Guiteras, Alturas de Alamar, Alamar Este, Guanabo, Campo Florido, Alamar-Playa.\nGuanabacoa: Mañana-Habana Nueva, Villa I, Villa II, Chivas-Roble, Debeche-Nalon, Hata-Naranjo, Peñalver-Bacuranao, Minas-Barreras.\nSan Miguel del Padrón: Rocafort, Luyanó Moderno, Diezmero, San Francisco de Paula, Dolores-Veracruz, Jacomino.\nDiez de Octubre: Luyanó, Jesús del Monte, Lawton, Vista Alegre, Goyle, Sevillano, La Víbora, Santos Suárez, Tamarindo.\nCerro: Latinoamericano, Pilar-Atares, Cerro, Las Cañas, El Canal, Palatino, Armada.\nMarianao: CAI-Los Ángeles, Pocito-Palmas, Zamora-Cocosolo, Libertad, Pogoloti-Belén-Finlay, Santa Felicia.\nLa Lisa : Alturas de La Lisa, Balcón Arimao, El Cano-Valle Grande-Bello 26 y Morado, Punta Brava, Arroyo Arenas, San Agustín, Versalles-Coronela.\nBoyeros: Santiago de Las Vegas, Nuevo Santiago, Boyeros, Wajay, Calabazar, Altahabana-Capdevila, Armada-Aldabó.\nArroyo Naranjo: Los Pinos, Poey, Víbora Park, Mantilla, Párraga, Calvario-Fraternidad, Guinera, Eléctrico, Managua, Callejas.\nCotorro: San Pedro-Centro Cotorro, Santa Maria del Rosario, Lotería, Cuatro Caminos, Magdalena-Torriente, Alberro.\n\n\nDemography\n\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana. According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146. The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth. \nHavana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1 million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.\n\n\nEthnic breakdown\nAccording to the 2012 national census of Havana's population (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin color\" instead of \"race\").\n\nWhite: 58.4%, (Spanish descent were most common)\nMestizo or Mulatto (mixed race): 26.4%\nBlack: 15.2%\nAsian: 0.2%\nAs with the other Caribbean nations, there are few mestizos in Havana (and Cuba as a whole), in contrast to many other countries, because the indigenous Taíno population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in the earliest period of the Spanish conquest.\nThe Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure. There is a population of internal migrants to Havana nicknamed \"palestinos\" (Palestinians) who mostly hail from the eastern region of Oriente.\nThe city's significant minority of Chinese, mostly of Cantonese origin, were brought in the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as well) are around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; as reported by the Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.\nBetween 2018, the most recent census, and the mid-Twentieth Century census of 1953, Havana's population has grown by an estimated 87 percent, a growth rate typical of most Caribbean cities.\n\n\nReligion\n\nRoman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camagüey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del Río. Its patron saint is San Cristóbal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a minor basilica, Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jesús Nazareno del Rescate and San Lázaro (El Rincón). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).\nThe Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one Orthodox, and two Conservative: one Conservative Ashkenazi and one Conservative Sephardic), Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the New York Times estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centers in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing slave trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the center of much of the nation's industry.\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centered elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbors of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labor force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.\nHavana's economy is still in flux, despite Raúl Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.\n\n\nCommerce and finance\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.\nIn the late 1990s Vedado, located along the Atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, casinos, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.\nVedado is today Havana's financial district, and the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area. The University of Havana is located in Vedado.\n\n\nTourism\n\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\nWith the deterioration of Cuba – United States relations and the imposition of the trade embargo on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, opposed any considerable development of tourism. In 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code that opened a number of sectors to foreign capital.\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as Cubanacan), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\nHavana has also been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for retinitis pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.\nHavana attracts over a million tourists annually, the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005.\n\n\nPoverty and slums\n\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including Special Period of the 1990s. The national government does not have an official definition of poverty. The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures.\nThe generic term \"slum\" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in solares (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns to be the \"precarious housing stock\" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighborhoods as Atarés in Regla. People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighborhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.\nOver 9% of Havana's population live in cuartería (solares, ciudadela), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% in refugee shelters. This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in \"fair\" or \"poor\" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to Instituto Nacional de Vivienda (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in \"good\" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in \"fair\" condition and 16% in \"poor\" condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, especially the highly populated districts, are in urban decay.\n\n\nTransport\n\n\nAirports\n\nHavana is served by José Martí International Airport. The Airport lies about 11 kilometers (7 mi) south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country's flag carrier Cubana de Aviación. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\nThe city is also served by Playa Baracoa Airport, a small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily Aerogaviota.\n\n\nRail\n\nHavana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalized and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba – Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba, and the Havana Suburban Railway serves the city. The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estación de Tulipán.\nIn 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11 million, but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, some 836 kilometers (519 mi) apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches. New Chinese made and Russian made coaches for distance trains debuted in the 2010s, and some now serve suburban services.\nIn the 1980s there were plans for a Metro system in Havana similar to Moscow's, as a result of the Soviet Union influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s. The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital. In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile (1.6 km) of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the project was later dropped.\n\n\nInterurban\nAn interurban line, known as the Hershey Electric Railway, built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to Matanzas.\n\n\nTramway\n\nHavana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company. Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning the systems in favor of buses and the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952.\n\n\nRoads\nThe city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca. The road network has been under construction and growth since the Spanish era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.\nMotorways (autopistas) include:\n\nA1 – Autopista Nacional, from Havana to Santa Clara and Sancti Spiritus, with additional short sections near Santiago and Guantanamo\nA4 – Autopista Este-Oeste, from Havana to Pinar del Río\nVia Blanca, to Matanzas and Varadero\nHavana ring road (Spanish: Primer anillo), which starts at a tunnel under the entrance to Havana Harbor\nAutopista del Mediodia, from Havana to San Antonio de los Baños\nan autopista from Havana to Melena del Sur\nan autopista from Havana to Mariel\n\n\nEducation\n\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\nThe University of Havana, located in the Vedado section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the Western Hemisphere. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute José Antonio Echeverría where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.\nThe Cuban National Ballet School with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba.\n\n\nLandmarks and historical centers\n\nHabana Vieja: contains the core of the original city of Havana. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nPlaza Vieja: a plaza in Old Havana, it was the site of executions, processions, bullfights, and fiestas.\nFortress San Carlos de la Cabaña: a fortress located on the east side of the Havana bay, La Cabaña is the most impressive fortress from Spanish times, particularly its walls constructed at the end of the 18th century.\nEl Capitolio Nacional: built in 1929 as the Senate and House of Representatives, the colossal building is recognizable by its dome, which dominates the city's skyline. Inside stands the third largest indoor statue in the world, La Estatua de la República. Nowadays, the Cuban Academy of Sciences headquarters and the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural (the National Museum of Natural History) has its venue within the building and contains the largest natural history collection in the country.\nEl Morro Castle: is a fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay; Morro Castle was built because of the threat to the harbor from pirates.\nFortress San Salvador de la Punta: a small fortress built in the 16th century, at the western entry point to the Havana harbor, it played a crucial role in the defense of Havana during the initial centuries of Spanish presence. It houses some twenty old guns and military antiques.\nChrist of Havana: Havana's 20-meter (66 ft) marble statue of Christ (1958) blesses the city from the east hillside of the bay, much like the famous Cristo Redentor in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe Great Theatre of Havana: is an opera house famous particularly for the National Ballet of Cuba, it sometimes hosts performances by the National Opera. The theater is also known as concert hall, García Lorca, the biggest in Cuba.\nThe Malecon/Sea wall: is the avenue that runs along the north coast of the city, beside the seawall. The Malecón is the most popular avenue of Havana, it is known for its sunsets.\nHotel Nacional de Cuba: an Art Deco National Hotel famous in the 1950s as a gambling and entertainment complex.\nMuseo de la Revolución: located in the former Presidential Palace, with the yacht Granma on display behind the museum.\nNecrópolis Cristóbal Colón: a cemetery and open-air museum, it is one of the most famous cemeteries in Latin America, known for its beauty and magnificence. The cemetery was built in 1876 and has nearly 1 million tombs. Some gravestones are decorated with sculpture by Ramos Blancos, among others.\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nSymbols\n\nThe coat of arms of Havana consists of three castles that represent the three castles that defended the city: the Fuerza Castle, the Morro Castle and the Punta Castle. The key represents that Havana was the gateway to the New World. The shield, supported by an oak branch on one side and a laurel wreath on the other, symbolizes the strength of the nation, the laurel wreath, honor, and glory. These symbols represent the rights of man.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nHavana has diverse styles of architecture, from castles built in the 16th century, to modernist high-rise buildings.\nThe present condition of many structures have deteriorated since 1959 or have been demolished, including the demolition of the Plaza del Vapor, built in 1835 by the architect of the Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba, Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra the architect of the El Capitolio of 1929. The Plaza del Vapor was demolished in 1959 by the new, revolutionary government. Numerous building collapses throughout the city have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance.\n\n\nSpanish\n\nRiches were brought from the Spanish into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the New World and Old World. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558–1577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589–1630). This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighborhood of Centro Habana. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's Spanish architecture, with a diverse range of Mudéjar architecture, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Roman. The San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. The Havana cathedral (1748–1777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720–1746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751–1775).\nThe Iglesia del Espíritu Santo was devoted in 1638. The Espíritu Santo contains some notable paintings including a seated, post-crucifixion Christ on the right wall, and catacombs. It is considered one of the oldest temples in Havana and it is said that its main interest lies essentially in the simplicity of the beautiful stone construction. The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1648 and given the rank of a parish. During the Spanish era it had exceptional importance, since by a Papal Bull of 1772 and a Royal Certificate of 1773, of Charles III of Spain, it was declared \"Única Iglesia inmune en esta ciudad, construida en 1855.\" (\"the only immune church in this city, built-in 1855.\"), which meant that any persecuted individual could find Amparo (sanctuary) in it against the action of the authorities or of justice. A metal plaque at the foot of the bell tower attests to this fact. The Iglesia del Espíritu Santo's greatest interest from an architectural point of view lies in the simplicity of the coral stone construction and the lack of lavish decoration. Other elements of great importance are the funerary crypts that were discovered in 1953. The crypt is from times before the Colón Cemetery (1876) in El Vedado was built.\n\nThe Alameda de Paula was the first promenade in Cuba, designed and constructed in 1776 by Antonio Fernández Trevejo, following the instructions of the Laureano de Torres y Ayala, it was created on the site of the old Rincón refuse dump. It was an embankment with two rows of poplar trees and some benches, it became one of Havana's most important social and cultural spaces, it was the model of the Paseo del Prado designed in 1925. It was given the name Alameda de Paula because of its proximity to the old Hospital and Iglesia of San Francisco de Paula. Between 1803 and 1805 the pavement was tiled, a fountain and stone benches, lampposts and the marble column were added, it qualified as a pleasant entertainment for the residents of the Villa de San Cristóbal, lacking recreational sites at that time. In 1841, the stairs that gave access to the promenade were widened and several lampposts were added. In the year 2000, the Havana promenade was restored and extended until it reached the Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula.\nTowards the end of the 17th century, the first stone of what would be the hospital for women and the church of San Francisco de Paula was placed, the buildings were expanded in 1731 with the support and donations from the City Council and orders of the different General Captains in command of the island. In 1776, it was the most important hospital in Havana, there were several generations of famous doctors that trained here. The Presbyter of the Cathedral of Havana, don Nicolás Estévez Borges, in 1664 ordered the construction of a Hospital for Women and an adjoining church devoted to Saint Francis of Paola who was one of the founders of the Roman Catholic Order of the Minims. Both buildings were completely destroyed by a hurricane in 1730 and were rebuilt and enlarged in 1745 in the Baroque style seen today.\n\n\nNeoclassical\nNeoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy Habaneros took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the Aldama Palace built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\nIn 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the Great Depression in 1929. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style.\n\nBuilt in 1875, in the Reparto de las Las Murallas, (wide strip of land that remained after the city walls were demolished in 1863), it was the work of the architect Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino. Around 1880 the mansion was owned by the Count of Casa Moré. The \"La Flor de José Murias\" tobacco factory was installed in the building. Later, through the exploitation of rents, it became a tenement house. In 1951 some of its spaces were dedicated to housing. On its upper floor, the Spanish Center and the Israeli Center of Cuba had their headquarters.\nThe palace of the Marquesa de Villalba and the Mercado de Tacón were designed by the Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino at almost the same time, 1875 and 1876, respectively, each in a style that accommodated the particular typology (residential and commercial) thus conceiving each work with the formal element accommodating different aesthetic requirements. The property is, after the Aldama Palace, the strongest example of Cuban Neoclassicism. The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba is in the neoclassical style, perhaps only comparable in Havana – according to Alina Castellanos – to the Aldama Palace. But while the latter limits the decoration to the natural slenderness of the colonnade, in the most classical way of the Greek Parthenon, the former uses Roman and Renaissance elaborations, hence, the arcade has been projected on pillars, the building was crowned with a considerable cornice. The neoclassical decoration can also be seen in the window covers, which take alternate forms of a triangular or semicircular pediment, and glass over the door, similar to the Plaza del Vapor.\n\nThe Palacio de Aldama is a neoclassical mansion located diagonally opposite to the old Plaza del Vapor (Parque del Curita), and in front of the old Campo de Marte; present day Parque de la Fraternidad, in Havana, Cuba. Built in 1840 by the Dominican architect and engineer Manuel José Carrera, its main facade of columns spans one block on Calle Amistad between Calles Reina and Estrella.\n\nThe Royal Palm Hotel is located on the corner of San Rafael and Industria. It was inaugurated as \"Edificio Luis. E. del Valle\", in honor of the sugar magnate who owned the building. It was soon sold to Canadian Wilbur E. Todgham, however, who turned it into the famed Royal Palm Hotel. The commercial function of the ground floor has been preserved to date, taking advantage of its excellent location on Boulevard de San Rafael. Taking into account the architectural values of this building and its socio-cultural importance within the urban landscape in which it is located, the building received a major restoration in 2000, with the support of the Provincial Council of Seville, Spain.\n\n\nArt deco\n\nThe Bacardi Building (Edificio Bacardí) is Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodríguez-Castells and Rafael Fernández Ruenes and completed in 1930. It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320 sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana. The building is in the art deco style that was popular internationally in the early decades of the 20th century. The Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s. In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm. The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite. It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America.\n\nDesigned by the architect Ricardo Mira in 1929, who in 1941 designed La Moderna Poesia bookstore on Obispo Street for the same owner, the López Serrano Building was the tallest residential building in Cuba until the construction of the FOCSA Building in 1956. The construction of the building was promoted by José Antonio López Serrano, a publisher who ran La Moderna Poesía.\n\n\nModernism\nKnown by buildings of high-quality, modernist architecture transformed much of the city. Examples are the Havana Hilton Hotel of (1958), the Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1955 by Martín Domínguez Esteban architect of the FOCSA Building in 1956, and the Edificio del Seguro Médico, Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.\n\nHotel Tryp Habana Libre is one of the larger hotels in Cuba, situated in Vedado, Havana. The hotel has 572 rooms in a 25-floor tower at Calle 23 (\"La Rampa\") and Calle L. Opened in 1958 as the Habana Hilton, the hotel famously served as the residence of Fidel Castro and other revolutionaries throughout 1959, after their capture of Havana. The Habana Hilton was constructed at a cost of $24 million, under the personal auspices of President Fulgencio Batista. It was built as an investment by the Caja de Retiro y Asistencia Social de los Trabajadores Gastronomicos, the pension plan of the Cuban catering workers' union, with additional financing from the Banco de Fomento Agricola e Industrial de Cuba (BANFAIC). It was operated by the American Hilton Hotels International group and was designed by the well-known Los Angeles architect Welton Becket, who had previously designed the Beverly Hilton for the chain. Becket designed the 27-story Habana Hilton in collaboration with Havana-based architects Lin Arroyo, and Gabriela Menéndez. Arroyo was the Minister of Public Works under Batista. The hotel was constructed by the Frederick Snare Corporation.\nThe Radiocentro CMQ Building complex is a former radio and television production facility and office building at the intersection of Calle L and La Rampa in El Vedado, Cuba. It was modeled after Raymond Hood's 1933 Rockefeller Center in New York City. With 1,650 seats, the theater first opened on 23 December 1947, under the name Teatro Warner Radiocentro, it was owned by brothers Goar and Abel Mestre. Today the building serves as the headquarters of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television (ICRT). For the construction of this building, the Havana building authorities granted a permit in 1947 amending the ordinances that were then in effect in El Vedado prohibiting the construction of buildings of more than three storeys. This statute was modified six years later to expand the construction of up to four floors because many planners and owners claimed the need to authorize them to build taller buildings in the area.\n\nThe FOCSA Building is a residential block in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba. It was named after the contracting company Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, Sociedad Anónima, and the architects were Ernesto Gómez Sampera (1921–2004), Mercedes Diaz (his wife), and Martín Domínguez Esteban (1897–1970), who was the architect of the Radiocentro CMQ Building. The structural engineer was Luis Sáenz Duplace, of the firm Sáenz, Cancio & Martín, and professor of engineering at the University of Havana. The civil engineers were Bartolome Bestard and Manuel Padron. Gustavo Becquer and Fernando H. Meneses were the mechanical and electrical engineers, respectively. It is located on a site bordered by Calles 17 and M and Calles 19 and N in the Vedado.\n The Edificio Focsa (1956) represents Havana's economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and a restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest high-strength concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame).\n\nThe Edificio del Seguro Médico is a commercial building in El Vedado, Havana. Built between 1955 and 1958, it was designed as a mixed use building for apartments and offices for the headquarters of the National Medical Insurance Company by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.\n\n\nCityscape\n\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado, and the newer suburban districts. Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional center of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.\nTo the west a newer section, centered on the uptown area known as Vedado, has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The Capitolio Nacional building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. Barrio Chino and the Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partagás, one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.\nA third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is Marianao, one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centers. Miramar, located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area. The International School of Havana is located in the Miramar neighborhood.\nIn the 1980s many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.\n\n\nVisual arts\n\nThe Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana is a Fine Arts museum that exhibits Cuban and international art. The museum houses one of the largest collections of paintings and sculpture from Latin America and is the largest in the Caribbean region. Under the Cuban Ministry of Culture, it occupies two locations in the vicinity of Havana's Paseo del Prado, these are the Palace of Fine Arts, devoted to Cuban art and the Palace of the Asturian Center, dedicated to universal art. Its artistic heritage is made up of over 45,000 pieces. Since 1995 the capital hosts the headquarters of the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba in Vedado, founded by the German collectors Peter and Irene Ludwig, it is a non-governmental and non-profit organization for the dissemination and protection of Cuban art.\nNotable artists associated with the city include Federico Beltrán Masses, Víctor Manuel García Valdés, and Wifredo Lam.\n\n\nPerforming arts\n\nFacing Havana's Central Park is the baroque Gran Teatro de La Habana, a prominent theater built in 1837. It is now home of the National Ballet of Cuba and the International Ballet Festival of Havana, one of the oldest in the New World. The façade of the building is adorned with a stone and marble statue. There are also sculptural pieces by Giuseppe Moretti, representing allegories depicting benevolence, education, music and theater. The principal theater is the García Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 and balconies. Glories of its rich history; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted.\nAlicia Alonso was a Cuban prima ballerina assoluta and choreographer whose company became the Ballet Nacional de Cuba in 1955. Alonso was born \"on the outskirts\" of Havana in 1920 She is best known for her portrayals of Giselle and the ballet version of Carmen.\n\n\nRadio and television\n\n\nCMQ\n\nCMQ was a Cuban radio and television station located in Havana, Cuba, reaching an audience in the 1940s and 1950s, attracting viewers and listeners with a program that ranged from music and news dissemination. It later expanded into radio and television networks. As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network.\nThe company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and Ángel Cambó. Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of Goar Mestre. In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country.\nPre-revolutionary Cuba was an early adopter of new technology, including TV. Cuba was the first Latin American country to have television. In December 1946 station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi-point live broadcast.\nRegular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 with Gaspar Pumarejo's Unión Radio TV. This was followed by Goar Mestre Espinosa's CMQ-TV on channel 6 on 18 December 1950. CMQ officially launched on 11 March 1951, and would become an NBC affiliate. By 1954, CMQ-TV had expanded into a seven station network. With the CMQ network, Cuba the second country in the world, only after the United States, to have a national TV network.\nAt the beginning of the 1950s with the transmission of the novel El Derecho de Nacer, by Felix B. Caignet, displaced the competing station, RHC Cadena Azul. It is with this leadership that the second Cuban television channel, CMQ TV, Channel 6 is born. It was initially located on Calle Monte, on the corner of Paseo del Prado. On 12 March 1948, the radio studio was moved to the Radiocentro building in La Rampa and Calle L in El Vedado.\n\n\nFestivals\n\n\nFilm Festival\n\nThe Havana Film Festival is a Cuban festival that focuses on the promotion of Latin American filmmakers. It is also known in Spanish as Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano de La Habana, and in English as International Festival of New Latin American Cinema of Havana. It takes place every year during December in the city of Havana, Cuba.\nThe inaugural International Festival of New Latin American Cinema was held on 3 December 1979, and more than 600 film directors of Latin America responded to the first call made by the Cuban Institute of the Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC). Its founders the included President of ICAIC, Alfredo Guevara, and the filmmakers Julio García Espinosa and Pastor Vega.\nAs expressed in its founding convocation, the festival aimed to \"promote the regular meeting of Latin American filmmakers who with their work enrich the artistic culture of our countries (…); ensure the joint presentation of fiction films, documentaries, cartoons and current events (…), and contribute to the international diffusion and circulation of the main and most significant productions of our cinematographies\".\nIn 2013 the Havana Film Festival announced that it was reappointing Iván Giroud as its president. Giroud had previously served as president from 1994 to 2010.\n\n\nHealth\n\nAll Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals, local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each, which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world. Nonetheless, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the Soviet Union subsidies in the early 1990s and the US embargo. Nevertheless, Havana's infant mortality rate in 2009 was 4.9 per 1,000 live births, 5.12 in the country as a whole, which is lower than many developed nations, and the lowest in the developing world. Administration of the health care system for the nation is centered largely in Havana. Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.\n\n\nSports\n\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favor baseball. Havana's team in the Cuban National Series is Industriales, one of the most successful teams in the tournament. In the past, it has also been represented by Habana (in the pre-revolutionary Cuban League) as well as Metropolitanos and La Habana in the National Series.\nThe city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one being the Estadio Latinoamericano, where Industriales play. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.\n\nHavana was host to the 11th Pan American Games in 1991. Stadiums and facilities for this were built in the relatively unpopulated eastern suburbs.\nHavana was host to the 1992 IAAF World Cup in Athletics.\nHavana was an applicant to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics, but was not shortlisted.\nHavana hosted the Centrobasket on three occasions, namely in 1969, 1989 and 1999.\n\n\nNotable people\n\n\nSister cities\n\n\nSee also\n\nHistory of Havana\nOld Havana\nGiuseppe Gaggini\nList of cities in the Caribbean\nHavana Plan Piloto\nWatson and the Shark\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\nAlameda de Paula, old havana, the first promenade that had the capital of Cuba on YouTube\nMartín Domínguez Esteban\nLa sombra del arquitecto Martín Domínguez Esteban\nExploring Havana: The tallest building in Cuba, El Focsa.\nFOCSA Archived 12 December 2021 at the Wayback Machine\nAlicia Alonso entry, Concise Encyclopædia Britannica; accessed 5 May 2014.\nProfile, ABT Original Carmen premiere, abt.org; accessed 5 May 2014.\nABT Original Theme and Variations, abt.org; accessed 5 May 2014.\nVideo: Archive footage, Alonso and Erik Bruhn performing \"Pas de Deux\" from Giselle, Act II (1955) at Jacob's Pillow\nVideo: Witness: The First Lady of Cuban Ballet, interview broadcast on 28 October 2015, from BBC World Service",
    "summary": "Havana (; Spanish: La Habana [la aˈβana] ) is the capital and largest city of Cuba. The heart of La Habana Province, Havana is the country's main port and commercial center. It is the most populous city, the largest by area, and the second largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region. The population in 2021 was 2,142,939 inhabitants, and its area is 728.26 km2 (281.18 sq mi) for the capital city side and 8,475.57 km2 for the metropolitan zone. Its official population was 1,749,964 inhabitants in 2024.\nHavana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century. It served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for Spanish galleons returning to Spain. King Philip III of Spain granted Havana the title of capital in 1607. Walls and forts were built to protect the city. The city is the seat of the Cuban government and various ministries, and headquarters of businesses and over 100 diplomatic offices. The governor is Reinaldo García Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third-highest income in the country.\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThe city attracts over a million tourists annually; (1,176,627 international tourists in 2010, a 20% increase from 2005). Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.",

    "text": "Johann Heinrich Meyer (2 March 1812 in Braunschweig – 4 November 1863 in Braunschweig; also known as Heinrich Meyer) was a German bookseller and publisher.\n\n\nOrigin\nHeinrich Meyer came from an old family of printers who had been active in Lemgo since 1610. His great-great-grandfather Heinrich Wilhelm Meyer had moved to Braunschweig in 1707 and had taken over the printing house from Christoph Friedrich Zilliger in 1716. Heinrich was the eldest son of Johann Heinrich Meyer (1768–1827) and Dorothea Elisabeth née Pfeiffer († 1862), the daughter of a master glazier.\n\n\nLife and work\nAttending school at the Katharineum in Braunschweig inspired Heinrich for the sciences, but the early death of his father prevented him from planning to study. Under the direction of his mother, he joined his father's book printing shop, developed high standards of typography and expanded his knowledge through specialist literature and sightseeing trips to printing houses, machine shops and libraries in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Denmark. In 1834, he founded the Journal für Buchdruckerkunst, of which he remained editor until the end of his life. On 27 October 1838, Meyer received his doctorate from the philosophical faculty of the University of Jena on the basis of his writings and achievements in the typographical field.\nBecause he could not agree with his mother on the management, Heinrich founded a type and stereotype foundry around 1838, and in 1841 with his brother Hermann in the same street as his father's business, the Gebrüder Meyer book printing company, which he expanded in 1843 to include an engraving company. In 1848, his mother handed over his father's business to the brothers. The title \"Hofbuchdruckerei\", which he had received in 1840, was revoked in 1852, presumably because of the printing of democratic writings.\nAfter the death of his brother Hermann on 8 December 1860, Heinrich continued to run the company alone under his father's name. After a long nervous disease and suffering from lung and kidney disease starting from September 1863, he succumbed to the illnesses on November 4 of the same year.\n\n\nFamily and succession\nHeinrich Meyer married Luise Dangers, the daughter of a senior bailiff in Jerxheim, on 27 September 1843, and after her death on 10 April 1858, had a second marriage in 1860 to the merchant's widow Marie Nickel née Mellin, who survived him for many years.\nThe business was only continued under guardianship until his eldest son Stephan (born 2 January 1845) came of age and took over the business. He expanded the Journal für Buchdruckerkunst again, but on 1 October 1881 it was handed over to Ferd. Schlotke in Hamburg and withdrew completely from business life in 1892. The company \"Joh. Heinr. Meyer\" was transferred to Heinrich Kleucker from Hildesheim and has changed hands several times since then.\nThe printing and publishing house Joh. Heinr. Meyer still exists in Braunschweig today. In addition to the Braunschweig address book, the company today mainly publishes literature with a regional reference. In addition, brochures and trade journals are printed.\n\n\nWorks\nAt the age of 22, Meyer founded the Journal for the Art of Printing, Type Foundry and Related Subjects, which soon became the organ of the entire industry. It was published monthly from 1 July 1834, twice a month from 1845 and weekly from 1860.\nReference books from his range were:\n\nHandbuch der Stereotypie, 1838\nGutenberg's album, 1840 – a model achievement of the time, especially in typographical terms, published by Vieweg & Sohn\nAddress Book of the Book Printers of Central Europe, the Lithography, Copper and Steel Engraving Printing Works, etc., 1854\nHe gradually developed the Brunswick Address Book, founded by his father in 1805, into a state handbook.\n\n\nReferences",

She created numerous soprano roles in operas and oratorios by Fux, Caldara, and her second husband, Francesco Bartolomeo Conti and was reputedly the highest paid musician in Vienna at the time.\n\n\nLife and career\nLandini's mother, Francesca Portui, was the maid of Queen Christina of Sweden and married to Francesco Landini, the captain of Christina's guards. However, Francesco Landini was not her biological father. Maria was born from a relationship between her mother and the marquise Orazio Del Monte, Christina's chamberlain. According to 17th-century sources, she was born in Hamburg where Christina's court periodically sojourned, although the date of her birth has variously been given as 1667, 1668, and 1670. Maria spent her entire childhood and youth at the court of Queen Christina where she was trained as a singer and was known by the diminutive \"Mariuccia\". By the late 1680s there are records of her regularly performing in private musical evenings at Queen Christina's court in Rome. She often sang together with another favourite singer of the queen, Angela Voglia (known as \"La Giorgina\").\nAfter Queen Christina's death in 1689, Landini entered the service of Sophia Charlotte of Hanover in Germany. She married an actor named \"Chateauneuf\" in Hannover in 1695 and sometimes appeared under the name \"Landini di Chateauneuf\" or its Italian version \"Castelnovo\". According to Francesco Conti's biographer Hermine Williams, Castelnovo was from an aristocratic family and his full name was Mallo di Castelnuovo. Their marriage would produce three children: Ferdinando, Francesca, and Caterina. Landini was active in the opera houses of Italy from 1698 when she was in the service of the Duke of Mantua. Her earliest appearance in Mantua was in 1698 in Giovanni Bononcini's Camilla. She also appeared in Venice, Genoa, Casale Monferrato, Livorno, Modena, and Bologna before moving to Vienna in 1710 where she became the prima donna of Emperior Charles VI's court theatre. In 1714, following the death of her first husband, Landini married Francesco Bartolomeo Conti in Vienna's Schottenkirche. In her will, written in the year prior to her death, she asked, if she should die in Vienna, to be buried in the Schottenkirche next to her first husband. But she eventually was not buried there, because she died outside of Vienna.\nIn 1725 Conti married Anna Maria Lorenzani who had succeeded Landini as the prima donna at the imperial court.\n\n\nRoles created\nRoles created by Maria Landini include:\n\nClori in Johann Joseph Fux's La decima fatica di Ercole, Habsburg court theatre, Vienna, 1710\nMerope in Francesco Gasparini's Merope, Teatro San Cassiano, Venice, 26 December 1711\nDafne in Johann Joseph Fux's Dafne in lauro, Habsburg court theatre, Vienna, 1714\nEuridice in Johann Joseph Fux's Orfeo ed Euridice, Habsburg court theatre, Vienna, 1715\nAngelica in Johann Joseph Fux's Angelica, vincitrice di Alcina, Habsburg court theatre, Vienna, 1716\nIfigenia in Johann Joseph Fux's Diana plaeata, Habsburg court theatre, Vienna, 1717\nLucinda in Francesco Bartolomeo Conti's Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena, Habsburg court theatre, Vienna, 6 February 1719\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with Dylan Ratigan's Get Money Out campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization. Rootstrikers subsequently became a project of Demand Progress.\n\n\nHistory\nChange Congress was officially launched on March 20, 2008, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., during an event sponsored by the Sunlight Foundation.\nLessig weighed a bid for Congress against incumbent Jackie Speier, but decided against it, citing the importance of staying focused on the Change Congress movement.\nChange Congress's main aim was to fight against \"institutional corruption\" within Congress by encouraging candidates to run on its platform and provide campaign contributions to those who do so. From January 2009 on, Change Congress was focusing its efforts on promoting citizen-funded elections, mainly through its Donor Strike campaign and support for the Fair Elections Now Act, and the three stage strategy had disappeared from its website.\n\n\nTracking candidates\nChange Congress hopes to use volunteers to create a comprehensive list of members of Congress and where they stand on issues of lobbyists, earmarks, public financing, and increased transparency in government.\nAs of January 9, 2009, the candidate tracking feature no longer existed on the Change Congress website.\n\n\nPolitical donations\nChange Congress also hopes to change citizens' campaign contribution habits by giving people the option of only supporting candidates who pledge to honor some or all of Change Congress' pledge commitments.\nAs of January 9, 2009, the political donation feature has been removed from the Change Congress website due to the Donor Strike campaign.\n\n\nDonor strike\nOn January 8, 2009, Lessig appeared on The Colbert Report, and the following day Change Congress announced the Donor Strike.\nThe Donor Strike is an attempt to gain support amongst congressmen for citizen-funded congressional campaigns and in particular the Fair Elections Now Act. By signing up for the strike, supporters pledge \"not to donate to any federal candidate unless they support legislation making congressional elections citizen-funded, not special-interest funded.\" The campaign hopes to strong-arm congressmen into supporting citizen-funded elections by withholding campaign donations.\nAs of May 28, 2009 Change Congress says it has motivated $1,563,920 in pledged campaign donation withholdings through the Donor Strike, although there is no real way to verify these numbers.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nchange-congress.org(archived version at the Wayback Machine, December 18, 2008)",

In November 1983, she ran aground at Newport, Oregon, spilling 265,000 litres of fuel oil into the coastal waters.\n\n\nIncident\nOn 19 November 1983, Blue Magpie was en route to Vancouver, to pick up lumber, after unloading a cargo of Salvadoran coffee in Long Beach, California. Caught up in a storm, the ship attempted to take shelter in Yaquina Bay, but smashed into a coastal rock jetty and broke apart, causing a major oil spill. The vessel's nineteen South Korean crew members were unharmed, and were retrieved from the wreck by helicopter.\nIt transpired from Coast Guard radio logs that the ship's captain, Kim Gap Bong, had been repeatedly warned of the danger of trying to enter the harbor. The captain, however, was insistent that he had to get out of the storm. Blue Magpie's chief officer, Kang Tae Jung, later explained that their situation had been desperate. The ship had spent nine hours on a violent sea, and was in serious danger of capsizing.\n\n\nOil spill\nAn estimated 70,000 gallons (265,000 litres) of Bunker C oil leaked from the wreckage, although most of it was swept out to sea by the wind. The oil that did wash ashore, however, posed a significant threat to the local wildlife. Brown pelicans and other coastal birds were found on the beaches covered in oil, and despite the best efforts of volunteers, over 250 birds did not survive their ordeal. Other marine species, such as razor clams, were also thought to be in danger.\nA Coast Guard Strike Team, specially trained to manage oil spills, was flown in from California. A containment boom was placed around the ship, and some of the oil was vacuumed off the beach. The cost of the cleanup was at least $140,000, and oil continued to wash up for several weeks, up to 100 miles from the crash site.\nA study into the long-term effect of the oil spill on bird numbers found that certain species, in particular the American coot, had shown a significant decline. However, this could have been due to external factors, such as that year's occurrence of El Niño, so the overall impact of the spill was deemed impossible to determine.\n\n\nReferences",

Narrated by Catherine Keener, it is the sixteenth nature documentary to be released under the Disneynature label. The film was released as a Disney+ exclusive on Earth Day April 22, 2022 and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\nPlot\nA mother polar bear and her cub swim across the waters that was once the ice of the Arctic Tundra, as the film tells us the story of how she and her family survived during her youth. She had loved playing with her twin brother as they were watched and protected by their mother, as she goes seal hunting and keeping a look out for male polar bears who threaten the cubs, they even came across a dead whale, and they, along with many other bears, feasted on it. Sadly one day, the polar bear's brother died, and it was only her and her mom left, she successfully hunted a baby walrus abandoned by a panicked mother. The bear's mother knew it's time to fend for herself again, and departs.\nThe polar bear then spent years not seeing another ice bear, until she meets another male her age and they spend a day playing together, as he bids farewell, she realizes she was being tracked by a much bigger male. Thinking he was going to kill her, she stands her ground, but soon realizes she was being courted. As the big male and the female go their separate ways, the polar bear soon becomes a mother of one cub. In the present day, the mother and daughter spend their days surviving in the disappearing Arctic, the mother knows her daughter will have what it takes to become a good ice bear, with a concerned question on what kind of world will she call home. The film ends with a message reading, \"The Arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040, the actions we take today can positively change the future of polar bears.\"\n\n\nProduction\nCatherine Keener served as the narrator of Disneynature's documentary about polar bears. Alastair Fothergill and Jeff Wilson, the directing duo of Disneynature's previous film Penguins (2019), directed the film for producers Keith Scholey, Roy Conli, and Jason Roberts.

John Serba of Decider found that the film provides an effective scientific warning on climate change and its consequences, while claiming that the film manages to highlight the beauty of the world. Robin Holabird of KUNR claimed that the documentary succeeds to highlight climate change and how its impact on the ice cap can be lethal to polar bears, praised the team that worked behind the documentary for being unobtrusive while filming, and found Catherine Keener to be a thoughtful and serene narrator. Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, praised the film for its educational value, stating it focuses on the knowledge and skills of polar bears while highlighting the lethality of climate change, and found the film to contain positive messages and role models, claiming it depicts the challenges encountered when trying to survive in the Arctic wild.\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nPolar Bear on Disney+ \nPolar Bear at IMDb",

    "text": "The Assault on Osu (Danish: Angrebet på Orsu) was an assault on the coastal village of Osu Castle by the Kingdom of Akwamu against local Accrans, who received support from the Danes at Fort Christiansborg. The assault resulted in military failure for the Akwamu, mainly due to Danish artillery, and the Akwamu were forced to retreat.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Akwamu State began its formation of an empire in the latter half of the seventeenth century. The empire's primary expansion route was eastwards, which made it come into confrontations with various local tribes, which in most cases got absorbed or subjugated by the Akwamu. It seems clear that the Akwamu State had extended its dominion to the area of modern-day Akwapim by the middle of the seventeenth century.\nAt the arrival of the Europeans, Great Accra was the strongest power in the region. This is exemplified in the 1670s, when King Okaikoi was able to summon a nine thousand strong army, which no European fortification could pose a challenge against. This meant that if any European nation came in conflict with the Great Accra, it would divert the lucrative Atlantic slave trade to the other European nations also present in the area. Such threat posed by the Great Accra, led to constant attempts by the Europeans to befriend the African Kingdom.\n\n\nWeakening of Accra\n\nAkwamu naturally turned its attention to the lucrative trade market between Accra and the Europeans. The initial Akwamu policy appears to be, to achieve control of the trade routes leading from the interior to the coast, which would guarantee a substantial amount of money from tolls.\nIn 1646, Accra attacked Larteh. In response, Akwamu blockaded Accra and the trading routes controlled by Akwamu were sealed. This led to serious damage to the Accran economy. This, together with an ongoing civil war, would guarantee the ultimate collapse of Accra, yet this would only be shown sound 30 years later.\nAkwamu launched its major offensive against Accra in 1677, under king Ansa Sasraku II. The initial offensive was directed at Great Accra, the capital city. The Accra king, Okaikoi I, offered resistance, but was captured and beheaded with his eldest son. Additionally, Great Accra was sacked and burned.\n\n\nAssault\n\n\nOfori I's strategy\nAccran resistance was not over with the loss of their capital, however. A young son of Okaikoi named Ofori, had escaped the sack of Great Accra, moving the state capital to Little Accra and assumed leadership, succeeding his beheaded father. Ofori sought the assistance of the Danes, Dutch and English in holding back further Akwamu expansion on the coast. By this time Accran towns had already started to grow around each of the European forts. These towns must have received a sizeable number of refugees from Great Accra. It is likely that Akwamu hesitated to launch attacks upon the Accran coastal towns.\nOne of these Accran towns which got attacked was Osu, which was located in close proximity to the Danish fort and capital of the Danish Gold Coast, Christiansborg. In 1678, the Akwamu State's warrior army launched an attack on Osu as a part of their campaign against Accra. The close and compacted warriors must have been an easy target for the cannons at Christiansborg Castle. In any case, the Akwamu army was forced to retreat because of the heavy fire dealt by the Danish artillery, and abandon their attack on Osu.\nSince the Danes had forced the Akwamu armies to retreat from Osu, it may be supposed that as long as the Danes at Christiansborg and the Accrans at Osu, could pose and constitute a hostile left flank for the Akwamu, for as long would the Akwamu not make any significant threat of a frontal attack on Small Accra itself. This became reality when King Ansa Sasraku, the following year, directed a part of his war force to conquer the Kingdom of Ladoku.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nIn the same year as the conquest of Ladoku, the Danish garrison at Fort Christiansborg was discontented in a revolt, led by Pieter Bolt. He mutinied and seized the fort, quickly selling it to the Portuguese governor of St. Tomé, Julião de Campos Barreto.\nNo actual evidence supports the involvement of Akwamu in the mutiny at Fort Christiansborg, yet they certainly welcomed the regime change. The Portuguese takeover led Ansa Sasraku to once more turn his attention to Little Accra. Some sources say that the war between the Akwamu and Accras continued, now taking place near the European fortifications. This resulted in the burning of Little Accra, and Ofori I fled for the second time, now to Afutu, where he was welcomed by the king, Ahen Panyin Ashríve as king-in-exile. Furthermore, the Danes now had their headquarters in Afutu at Fort Frederiksborg. The Danish governor, Magnus Prang, and Ofori both had interests in regaining their Accran possessions, and agreed to afford each other every assistance.\nIn 1682 the Portuguese garrison revolted and imprisoned Julião de Campos, and the following year the king of Portugal, Afonso VI, ordered the evacuation of the fort. The Danes in response, reoccupied the fort, and withdrew their alliance with Ofori in order not to further antagonize the Akwamu.\n\n\nSee also\nSagbadre War – 1784 Danish punitive expedition in Gold Coast\nDano-Dutch War – War between the Dutch and Danish, 1661–1665Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nKing Okaikoi\nAshanti Empire – Former Akan empire centred on present-day GhanaPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nSiege of Dansborg (1644) – Siege in Tranquebar, India 1644\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Etenna (Ancient Greek: Ἔτεννα) was a city in the late Roman province of Pamphylia Prima. Centuries earlier, it was reckoned as belonging to Pisidia, as by Polybius, who wrote that in 218 BC, the people of Etenna \"who live in the highlands of Pisidia above Side\" provided 8,000 hoplites to assist the Seleucid usurper Achaeus.\n\n\nCoinage\n\nThere is no other mention of Etenna in extant documents until the record of the participation of bishops of Etenna in the ecumenical councils of the 4th century AD and later. However, there are examples of its fine silver coinage of the 4th and 3rd century BC and of its bronze coins dating from the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD.\n\n\nBishopric\nThe Christian bishopric of Etenna was ecclesiastically  a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Side, the capital of the province of Pamphylia Secunda. Known Bishops include:\n\nTroilus was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381,\nEutropius at the Council of Ephesus in 431.\nEudoxius at the Council of Chalcedon in 451,\nIoannes at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and\nPetrus at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879).\nSeeing Etenna as no longer a residential bishopric, the Catholic Church lists it as a titular see, although the area around Etenna was never actually of Catholic confession. Among the titular bishops of Etenna were \n\nFrancis Xavier Ford (18 June 1935 – 11 April 1946, later bishop of Kaying, martyred for his faith),\nJames Byrne (10 May 1947 – 16 June 1956, later bishop of Boise),\nThomas Holland (31 October 1960 – 28 August 1964, later bishop of Salford).\nHenri-Louis-Marie Mazerat (1 Sep 1958 Appointed - 30 Jun 1960)\nThe town and bishopric of Cotenna, also given as belonging to the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima, is by some reckoned to be the same as Etenna, but appears in the Notitiae Episcopatuum side by side with Etenna and distinct.\n\n\nRemains\nOn the basis of the preponderance of locally minted coins Etenna and the presence of potsherds of the Classical period in Greece, unusual inland elsewhere, Etenna has been identified with the rather undistinguished ruins on a steep hillslope 250–500 metres north of the modern village of Sirt, which lies north of Manavgat, Antalya Province, Turkey. They have not been systematically excavated, but include remains of city walls, a roofed reservoir, baths, two basilicas, a church and rock tombs.\nThe identification of Etenna with Gölcük, near the modern village of Sarraçlı, further east beyond the river Melas, is considered less likely.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nGernot Lang: Classical ancient sites in Anatolia.

During his second time in Brazil. he spent approximately two years performing extensive exploration of the country, having the support of Emperor Pedro II.\nIn 1859 he returned to Lübeck, where he practiced medicine and became the author of numerous books. He published several books on his experiences in Brazil, including two major works; Reise durch Süd-Brasilien im Jahre 1858 (Journey through Southern Brazil in 1858) and Reise durch Nord-Brasilien im Jahre 1859 (Journey through Northern Brazil in 1859). In 1882 he published a book on the life of 17th century polymath Joachim Jungius, titled Das Leben des Dr. med. Joachim Jungius 1587–1657.",

    "text": "The coracoacromial ligament is a strong triangular ligament between the coracoid process and the acromion. It protects the head of the humerus. Its acromial attachment may be repositioned to the clavicle during reconstructive surgery of the acromioclavicular joint (shoulder joint).\n\n\nStructure\nThe coracoacromial ligament originates from the summit of the acromion of the scapula, just in front of the articular surface for the clavicle. It inserts by its broad base along the whole length of the lateral border of the coracoid process of the scapula.\nThe clavicle and under surface of the deltoid muscle are above it. The tendon of the supraspinatus muscle (and its bursa) are below it.\nIts lateral border is continuous with a dense lamina that passes beneath the deltoid muscle upon the tendons of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle.\nThe ligament is sometimes described as consisting of two marginal bands and a thinner intervening portion, the two bands being attached respectively to the apex and the base of the coracoid process, and joining at the acromion.\nWhen the pectoralis minor is inserted, as occasionally is the case, into the capsule of the shoulder-joint instead of into the coracoid process, it passes between these two bands, and the intervening portion of the ligament is then deficient.\n\n\nFunction\nTogether with the coracoid process and the acromion, the coracoacromial ligament forms a vault or arch that protects the head of the humerus.\n\n\nClinical significance\nThe coracoacromial ligament may impinge and compress rotator cuff muscle or tendon. It may be damaged during a shoulder injury.\nThe attachment of the coracoacromial ligament may be moved from acromion to the end of the clavicle when reconstructing the acromioclavicular joint. This often fails. It has lower strength than the coracoclavicular ligament.\n\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 316 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\n\nExternal links",

    "text": "The Watts Labor Community Action Committee (WLCAC) is a non-profit, 501 (c) 3 organization incorporated in the State of California, in 1965. Its mission \"is to improve the quality of life for the residents of Watts and neighboring communities.\"\nThe WLCAC was established by Ted Watkins, who was part of the United Automobile Workers Union shortly before the Watts riots in 1965 Watts, California.\nTheodore Watkins, better known as Ted Watkins, founded the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. Watkins was born in Meridian, Mississippi in 1912. He moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of 13 after receiving a lynch threat, and soon began working for Ford Motor Company. Shortly thereafter he joined the United Auto Workers, quickly gaining prominence within the union. Throughout his years of involvement with the local chapter of the United Auto Workers, Watkins witnessed many instances of discrimination towards workers in the community. Eventually, with the help of the United Auto Workers, he founded the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. It grew to prominence as a community self-help agency aiding thousands of residents in gaining employment and essential services.\nThrough the WLCAC, Watkins initiated various programs aimed at alleviating poverty in Watts and generally improving the quality of life for members of the community. During his lifetime, Watkins was involved in the construction of a financial institution and hospital in Watts, as well as the development of low-income housing and youth programs. Following the 1981 riots in London, England, the British prime minister contacted Watkins to fly out to London and help the British government by applying methods used by the WLCAC in the aftermath of the Watts riots. Aided by the relationships he was able to form with public officials and policymakers, Watkins implemented a multitude of programs through the WLCAC.\nRight before his death in 1993, Watkins helped to rebuild the WLCAC after it was burned down in the Los Angeles riots of 1992.\n\n\nOrganization\nWLCAC was initiated largely due to the absence of essential infrastructure in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles such as: Intra-community transportation, housing, senior programs, employment training, job placement, homeless services, health services, and businesses. Watts lacked an advocate to advance concerns regarding the high unemployment rates, poverty, and inadequate living conditions.\nThe WLCAC's headquarters is located at 109th and Central Avenue in Watts, California.\n\n\nWar on poverty\nThe War on poverty, proposed by Lyndon B. Johnson to address the national poverty rate of about nineteen percent, led to the creation of the Economic Opportunity Act, which then established the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty. OEO was created to fix the high unemployment rates rising in poverty areas. But from \"1965 until 1970, OEO scrambled for an average of about $1.7 billion per year\" which \"the amounts never amounted to more than around 1.5 percent of the federal budget.\" The War on Poverty failed to provide the funds and services it promised to areas such as Watts, which led to the creation of many local programs to aid their communities.\n\n\nFormation\nThe significant challenges in unemployment, housing, transportation and low education levels of the Watts area highlighted the urgent need for an effective community organization in the Watts area. By 1965, the unemployment rate in the Watts area escalated to \"10.7 percent, compared to only 4.2 percent for the city as a whole.\"\nIn the summer of 1965, under the leadership of Ted Watkins, local activists and labor union representatives officially founded WLCAC. UAW was instrumental in the creation of the WLCAC as UAW president Walter Reuther and western regional director Paul Schrade \"helped build a core of support for the new organization.\" They saw the War on Poverty as an \"opportunity in which long-standing policies and practices were open to question and change\" and believed that the way to \"create change…is by building community organizations.\"\nTo further emphasize the crisis in Watts, the Watts Riots in August 1965 led the federal and local governments as well as private organizations to pay attention to the inadequate living conditions and lack of federal and local support in the Los Angeles area. It is alleged that those who participated in the Watts Rebellion \"were prompted as much by unemployment, bad housing, and lack of decent education\" as they were by the mistreatment of the \"white-dominated LAPD.\"\n\n\nTed Watkins\nWatkins was born in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1923. At the age of fifteen he moved to the Los Angeles area in flight from a lynch mob that targeted him for allegedly disobeying a white resident. After high school, Watkins landed a job  on the assembly line at the Ford Motor Company. There he joined the local chapter of the UAW and in 1949 became the \"international representative for UAW.\" Aside from union activities, Watkins also involved himself \"in various civil rights organizations, including the Watts chapter of the NAACP and the United Civil Rights Committee.\" These programs protested against poor housing conditions and the lack of services in inner-city Los Angeles. Watkins active participation made him an adequate candidate to lead the WLCAC. When, in 1966, UAW sought a leader for the WLCAC, Watkins had the experience and organizational skills to lead the Watts community.\nTwo main objectives Watkins sought to accomplish was the establishment of a hospital and a financial institution. The necessity for a hospital near the Watts area prompted Mr. Watkins to work with County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn to build community support for the construction of a local hospital. As a result, the Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, California was built in 1972.\n\n\nFunding\nFrom its establishment, WLCAC had an advisory board composed of major labor unions that provided financial assistance. In specific the labor unions consisted of the United Auto Workers (UAW), the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, Building Service Employees, the International Association of Machinists, the Teamsters, the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen, United Packinghouse Workers, and others. These unions alone \"contributed a combined $100,000\" the first two years of WLCAC existence.\nIn 1971, WLCAC utilized a $2 million loan from UAW-Chrysler to purchase property in order to expand on the initial \"thirty homes built with funds from the state of California.\" In addition, grants from the Ford Foundation served as a great contribution to the organization. The money from the Ford Foundation grant went \"to pay administrators and project staff and also to establish a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Corporation.\" \nAs a non-profit, 501 (c) 3 organization, WLCAC continues to compete for and administer awarded funds from various programs at the City, County, State and federal and local level.\n\n\nCurrent Activities\nThe WLCAC campus centers around WLCAC's main headquarters, which include a youth center, employment training programs, family wellness programs, as well as the Ted Watkins Center for Communications, which includes a theater, galleries, exhibition spaces, and civil rights history museum. Within a 1-mile radius are additional sites providing senior and child care services, permanent supportive housing, employment training and more.\nIn April 2012, California State Parks announced the award to WLCAC of $4.9 Million in Proposition 84 grant funds for a new urban farm park and community center in Watts. The urban farm park is named MudTown Farms in honor of the historic name for the area, MudTown. It is a self-sustaining community center with education, job training, community gardening, farming, and entrepreneurship for stakeholders of all ages and backgrounds. Construction on the project is slated to begin in 2017.\nToday, WLCAC employs more than 200 local residents, with an annual operating budget of approximately $10 million.\n\n\nSubsidiaries\nThe Greater Watts Development Corporation was formed to move homes affected by the construction of the Century Freeway (Interstate 105), which began in 1981, to Watts as part of a low-income home ownership program in partnership with the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\nThe Center\nWatts Labor Community Action Committee in the Present Day \nToday the Watts Labor Community Action Committee is headed by Tim Watkins, son of the late Ted Watkins. A seven-acre complex located in Watts dubbed \"The Center\" serves as its hub. According to the WLCAC's website, the Center is meant to \"dispel and redefine misperceptions\" about Watts. The facility is used as an administrative center for staff as well as a tourist attraction, showcasing various permanent and temporary exhibits throughout the year.\nThe main exhibit at the Center is the three-part Civil Rights Tour. The tour features a scale model slave-hold as well as an array of photographs memorializing the Civil Rights Movement. It features the photographic collections Countdown to Eternity by Benedict Fernandez, The Panthers by Howard Bingham, a sixteen and a half foot bronze statue by Nigel Binns named The Mother of Humanity, and an exhibit named \"Americana: The Hall of Shame\" that contains images and documentation of \"the unauthorized commoditization of the Black Image.\" According to the Watts Labor Community Action Committee's website, \"Americana: The Hall of Shame\" is meant to \"expose the uses of these images as an extension of slavery.\" There are also multiple murals displayed, including The Resurrection of Watts by Ras Ammar Nsoroma, Concrete Jungle by Richard Franco and Toni Love, Space Station by Richard Arturo, and Danny Franco, Mound Bayou by PeQue, BrowHands by Rondell, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali by EnkOne, Central Avenue Jazz by an unknown artist and Community Heroes by Elliot Pinkney.\nApart from a multitude of permanent exhibits that can be viewed year-round, the WLCAC has built a number of facilities at the Center that cater to community members of Watts and the surrounding cities within South Los Angeles. The Center includes a play space named \"Kaboom\" as well as a skate park, and even holds arts classes for kids. The Howard Bingham Multimedia Institute is open to people of all ages, and allows community members access to technology they can utilize for a variety of purposes. For the more artistically inclined, the Cecil Fergerson Gallery provides a space for artists and art viewers to convene and hold exhibits, signings, lectures, or any other type of gathering. The gallery is located in the Ted Watkins Center for International Communication, a thirty-five thousand square foot building that also includes Phoenix Hall, a theatre, and Freedom Hall. The Universal Access Theatre provides a variety of resources for young people, including laundry machines, computers with internet, help with phone calls/mail to potential employers, snacks, games, books and magazines, an entertainment system, as well as tutoring, mentoring, and counseling.  The Watts International Marketplace houses studios for embroidery, silk-screening, ceramics, fine arts, glass blowing, wood working, and photography. The Watts Labor Community Action Committee is currently developing a retail restaurant, library, and farmer's market for the marketplace. On the last Friday of every month, the Center holds Bones and Blues in its Phoenix Hall. This event presents adult residents with live music as well as other performances.\n\n\nHousing\nThe Dolores McCoy Villa I housing complex for homeless families was created in 2011 by the partnership between the Watts Labor Community Action Committee and Affordable Housing CDC Inc. The project was funded by a $3 million loan by the PSP Lending Program and the California Community Reinvestment Fund. The sixty-four unit complex is located near the intersection of 92nd Street and Compton Avenue, not far from the WLCAC center itself. It provides housing for tenants earning less than 60% of the median income (other source says 30%, 35%, and 50%) in the surrounding area. The housing complex Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles' Permanent Supportive Housing Program receives Section 8 rental subsidies for each unit, and rent is 30% of tenants' household incomes. \nThe Dolores McCoy Villa was created with homeless people as well as the formerly incarcerated in mind, given that certain housing practices prevent formerly incarcerated people from eligibility. The website states that the project was developed in an effort to provide \"much needed housing and on-site support services for single mothers re-entering the community after being incarcerated.\" According to the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits of the United States' website, The Dolores McCoy Villa provides various services to its residents, including case management, financial management, employment training and placement, academic counseling, access to health care, substance abuse services and other opportunities focused on families and independent living skills.\nThe Watts Labor Community Action Committee provides an array of services for the community members of Watts and surrounding South Los Angeles aimed at alleviating poverty and fostering economic growth.\nThe WLCAC also funds a number of programs for youth and their families. Among these are The Greater Watts Child Care Center, which provides low-cost childcare; the Family Source Center, which provides social services such as job training and health services among many others; Gang Reduction and Youth Development, which provides preventative programs for younger members of the community; WorkSource center, which provides employment training, support placement and retention services for thousands of job seekers and multiple local employers.\nThe WLCAC operates a senior citizen program providing recreational activities, educational programs, health screenings, field trips, day care, in-home care, transportation and escort assistance for shopping or medical appointments, and referrals to other social service providers. It also includes a program that delivers meals to senior at its satellite sites.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Website\nWatts Labor Community Action Committee\n\n\nFurther reading\nBauman, Robert. 2008.

    "text": "Saint Patroclus of Bourges  (c. 496–576) was a Merovingian ascetic, who was a native of the province of Berry, France. A deacon at Bourges, he withdrew to become a hermit.\n\n\nLife\nIn his childhood Patroclus guarded sheep while his older brother, Antonius, pursued an education. Eventually, his parents allowed him to go to school. He continued his education under Nunnion, a man greatly esteemed by King Childebert.\nIn his Historia Francorum, Gregory of Tours writes that Patroclus became a deacon at Bourges in his youth. He was so absorbed in prayer that he did not appear at the table for meals with the other clergy, which annoyed the archdeacon, who felt it unseemly that he did share meals with those with whom he shared ecclesiastical responsibilities.\n\nPatroclus withdrew to Néris, where he built a small chapel dedicated to Martin of Tours and began to teach the children. The sick came to him and were cured. His virtue becoming conspicuous, he resolved to retreat to greater solitude; but first he established a small monastic community for women.\nPatroclus built himself a cell in a place called Moichant. He would drink nothing stronger than water that had been sweetened with honey. He ate only bread, water, and salt, and devoted long periods to prayer, being credited with healing powers. In this place he restored health to an enormous number of possessed people by the imposition of his hands and the sign of the cross.\nLater, he built a monastery at Colombier and served as its first abbot. He died at La Celle, aged eighty years old, and was buried at the monastery. His tomb became a destination of pilgrimages.\nPatroclus is a patron saint of cattle. He is commemorated in the Roman Catholic Church on November 18; in the Orthodox Church on November 17.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n(in English) Church Calendar: November Archived 2006-08-13 at the Wayback Machine",

    "text": "A Circle line party is a type of subway party occasionally held on the Circle line of the London Underground.\n\n\nDescription\nAlthough the time and place of these parties is planned, the event itself occurs spontaneously, as each participant decides for themselves what sort of revelry, costume, decorations, snacks, libations and guests to bring to the party. The participants decorate the carriages festively, and play music, either live or on portable sound systems, disguised to appear as normal luggage. \nOther activities include setting up pole-dancing poles on the trains. Free drinks, snacks and sweets are provided, often being provided from well-stocked portable bars and snack tables, which disappear as the train arrives at the station. Commuters are invited to participate in the parties.\nTo maintain a low profile while the trains are in the stations, most participants only revel and frolic once the trains are in tunnels. Permission is not sought from London Underground or the British Transport Police for Circle line parties, and police sometimes stop trains for long periods to break the parties up. However, their organisers, typically linked to anarchist groups such as the Space Hijackers, claim that Circle line parties are not meant to disrupt travel, but to \"reclaim the public space from the advertisers and give it back to the people to whom it belongs\".\n\n\nMay 2008 party\n\nOn 7 May 2008, the newly elected Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced that the drinking of alcohol would be banned on all public transport services run by Transport for London from 1 June. Three independent Facebook groups were set up to organise another Circle line party to celebrate the last night of legal drinking on the London Underground, who quickly merged into one event called \"Last Orders On The Underground\". The plan quickly received media attention and was mentioned in several newspapers.\nOn 31 May, the night itself, thousands of people attended, the largest Circle line party ever. Some dressed in costumes ranging from 1920s prohibition figures to Boris Johnson himself. The line was suspended after several trains were damaged during the party, and a number of London Underground staff and police officers were assaulted. Seventeen people were arrested due to disorderly behaviour and six tube stations were closed as they became overcrowded.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nLast Orders on the Underground\nCircle Line Party website",

    "text": "An active volcano is a volcano that is currently erupting, or has the potential to erupt in the future. Conventionally it is applied to any that have erupted during the Holocene (the current geologic epoch that began approximately 11,700 years ago). A volcano that is not currently erupting but could erupt in the future is also known as a dormant volcano. Volcanoes that will not erupt again, or is thought to never erupt again, are known as extinct volcanoes. \n\n\nOverview\nThere are 1,650 potentially active volcanoes around the world, 500 of which have erupted in historical time. Many active volcanoes are located along the Pacific Rim, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. An estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes.\nHistorical time (or recorded history) is another timeframe for active. The span of recorded history differs from region to region. In China and the Mediterranean, it reaches back nearly 3,000 years, but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, it reaches back less than 300 years, and in Hawaii and New Zealand it is only around 200 years. The incomplete Catalogue of the Active Volcanoes of the World, published in parts between 1951 and 1975 by the International Association of Volcanology, uses this definition, by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes. As of March 2021, the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program recognizes 560 volcanoes with confirmed historical eruptions.\nCountries with the most Holocene volcanoes, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (as of 2023):\n\nUnited States: 165\nJapan: 122\nRussia: 117\nIndonesia 117\nChile: 91\nCountries with the most volcanoes active since 1960 (as of 2023):\n\nIndonesia: 55\nJapan: 40\nUS: 39 (mostly volcanic areas in and around Hawaii, Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington State and Pacific territories)\nRussia: 27\nChile: 19\nPapua New Guinea: 13\nEcuador: 12\nAs of 2025, the following are considered Earth's most active volcanoes:\n\nKīlauea, the famous Hawaiian volcano, was in nearly continuous, effusive eruption (in which lava steadily flows onto the ground) between 1983 through 2018, and had the longest-observed lava lake.\nMount Etna and nearby Stromboli, two Mediterranean volcanoes.\nPiton de la Fournaise, in Réunion, erupts frequently enough to be a tourist attraction.\nOther highly active volcanoes include:\n\nMauna Loa in Hawaii is the largest active volcano in the world. Its summit is more than 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) above sea level, and 17 kilometers (11 mi) above its base in the sea floor.\nMount Nyiragongo and its neighbor, Nyamuragira, are Africa's most active volcanoes.\nErta Ale, in the Afar Triangle, has maintained a lava lake since at least 1906.\nMount Erebus, in Antarctica, has maintained a lava lake since at least 1972.\nMount Merapi\nWhakaari / White Island, has been in a continuous state of releasing volcanic gas since before European observation in 1769.\nOl Doinyo Lengai\nMount Ibu, a stratovolcano in Indonesia. Constant volcanic eruptions since 2012.\nAmbrym\nBarren Island (Andaman Islands)\nSangay\nArenal Volcano\nPacaya\nKlyuchevskaya Sopka\nSheveluch\nSemeru\nHolocene volcanoes with large populations within 5 km (3.1 mi):\nMichoacan-Guanajuato volcano in Mexico and Tatun Volcanic Group in Taiwan both have more than 5 million people living within 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) of the volcano. Campi Flegrei in Italy and Ilopango in El Salvador both have populations of over 2 million people living within 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) of the volcanoes. Hainan Volcanic Field in China, San Pablo Volcanic Field in the Philippines, Ghegham Volcanic Ridge in Armenia, Dieng Volcanic Complex, in Indonesia, and Auckland Volcanic Field in New Zealand all have over 1 million people living within 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) of each volcano.\n\n\nBy country\n\n\nArgentina\nArgentina is part of the Andes Mountains volcanic belt along the western South American Pacific coast.

    "text": "Laurence Zitvogel (born 25 December 1963) is a French physician-scientist specializing in oncology and immunology. Zitvogel is a clinical oncologist, a researcher in the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, and a professor at Paris-Saclay University. She has studied the correlation between the immune system and the success of cancer treatments for over 30 years. Her primary research experience lies in exosomes, studying the biological impact of structural abnormalities on malignant neoplasms, and anti-tumor therapy. Through her work as a professor and researcher, Zitvogel discovered that chemotherapy could delay the growth of tumors in mouse models. Her team reported the first anticancer probiotic, Enterococcus hirae. As of 2020, she is researching an effective and inexpensive diagnostic test to predict dysbiosis and is investigating the promising lead on the role of gut microbiotes in anti-tumour immunotherapy.\nThroughout her career, she has received numerous honors and awards ranging from the Bob Pinedo Cancer Care Award to the ESMO Award for Immuno-Oncology.\n\n\nPersonal life\nLaurence Zitvogel was born in Suresnes, France. Zitvogel has worked with her spouse, Guido Kroemer, since 2001.\n\n\nEducation\nZitvogel earned her degree in medical oncology from the University of Paris in 1992. Zitvogel started her scientific career in 1993 at the University of Pittsburgh (USA) in Michael Lotze's laboratory. She received her Ph.D. in Immunology at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and the Gustav Roussy Cancer Center in 1995.\n\n\nCareer and leadership\nZitvogel supervised work in 2013 that analyzed the multifaceted modes of action of the anticancer probiotic, Enterococcus hirae. Zitvogel leads the French RHU Torino-Lumière and European Oncobiome consortia for the development of tests for gut dysbiosis associated with frequent cancers. She has authored over 350 publications and is the editor-in-chief and founder of one of the first journals in immune-oncology, OncoImmunology.\nShe is a professor of immunobiology at the University of Paris XI Medical School and is a scientific director at the Department of Immuno-Oncology at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center in Villejuif, France. She is also the director of U1015 Inserm Tumour Immunology and Immunotherapy Laboratory and co-director of the Center for Clinical Investigation in Biotherapies of Cancer at Inserm. Zitvogel co-founded EverImmune, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing live biotherapeutic products as adjuncts to cancer immunotherapy. Zitvogel's research team found that bacteria in the gut had a major effect on the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in mice.\n\n\nResearch\nZitvogel's work focuses on intestinal bacterial flora. Her primary research objectives are to identify cell adhesion molecules that serve as actionable checkpoints for tumor surveillance. The research group she directs has been focused on the discovery and validation of antibody combination therapies.\nZitvogel discovered that cancer therapies with long-term beneficial effects may have limited impact on local disease, but should activate a relevant adaptive immune reaction. Pioneering work by Zitvogel and Kroemer revealed that chemotherapy could slow the growth of tumors growing on immunocompetent mice, but had no effect on tumors established on immunodeficient mice. Zitvogel set up a patient diagnosis platform that allows the patient's tumor to be removed when performing the operation. Zitvogel hypothesized that disrupting the MAdCAM-1–α4β7 interaction might cause Treg17 cells to migrate from the gut to the tumors, thereby compromising the anticancer effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Accompanying this, she saw that the relocation of enterotropic and immunosuppressive Treg17 cells to cancerous tissue (tumors and tdLNs) is repressed by the molecular interaction between the HEV addressin MAdCAM-1 and the integrin α4β7 expressed by Treg17 cells. Zitvogel's research also revealed that antibiotics administered before or during treatment may worsen the efficacy of immunotherapy. She examined the connections between nutrition, inflammation, and the immune system's impact on cancer. Correspondingly, Zitvogel found that nutritional interventions are emerging as novel strategies for improving the outcome of treatments with PD-1/PD-L1–targeting ICIs. Continuing on with Zitvogel's cancer research, she found that probiotics used as a complement to the existing therapeutic arsenal (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy) could become a sixth therapeutic modality against cancer. Zitovgel's ongoing research falls into three main categories: studying the modes of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors, seeking predictors of response to immunomodulators, and defining the role of the gut microbiome in cancer immunosurveillance.\n\n\nAwards\nZitvogel's awards include:\n\nINSERM prize for Research in Clinical and Therapeutic Approaches to Cancer (2007)\nSwiss Bridge Award (2014)\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) for Immuno-Oncology (2017)\nASCO-SITC Award (2017)\nCharles Rodolphe Brupbacher Prize for Cancer Research (2017)\nBaillet Latour Prize (2018)\nJakob-Herz Prize (2018)\nARC Griffuel Prize (2019)\nBob Pinedo Cancer Care Award (2022)\n\n\nReferences\n\nJalinière, Hugo (20 March 2016). \"Laurence Zitvogel: l'ennemie intime du cancer\" [Laurence Zitvogel.

The station closed with the line on 1 July 1864, but was reopened on 9 October 1871, under government ownership. Like the suburb itself, the station is believed to have gotten its name from either the Moonee Ponds Creek, which resembled a chain of ponds in dry weather (the creek was noted as \"Mone Mone Creek\" in 1837 by government surveyor Robert Hoddle, during a survey of the area), an Indigenous Australian who was attached to the mounted police, or John Moonee, who had land near the present day Moonee Valley Racecourse.\nIn 1882, the station building on Platform 1 was provided, with a signal box provided in 1889 to control interlocked gates at the Puckle Street level crossing. In 1969, these gates were replaced with boom barriers.\nOn 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Moonee Ponds to a premium station, along with nineteen others.

    "text": "Hydrogenolysis is a chemical reaction whereby a carbon–carbon or carbon–heteroatom single bond is cleaved or undergoes lysis (breakdown) by hydrogen. The heteroatom may vary, but it usually is oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. A related reaction is hydrogenation, where hydrogen is added to the molecule, without cleaving bonds. Usually hydrogenolysis is conducted catalytically using hydrogen gas.\n\n\nHistory\nThe term \"hydrogenolysis\" was coined by Carleton Ellis in reference to hydrogenolysis of carbon–carbon bonds. Earlier, Paul Sabatier had already observed the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol to toluene, and as early as 1906, Padoa and Ponti had observed the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol. Homer Burton Adkins and Ralph Connor were the first to call the carbon–oxygen bond cleavage \"hydrogenolysis\".\n\n\nIn the petrochemical industry\n\nIn petroleum refineries, catalytic hydrogenolysis of feedstocks is conducted on a large scale to remove sulfur from feedstocks, releasing gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The hydrogen sulfide is subsequently recovered in an amine treater and finally converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit. In those industries, desulfurization process units are often referred to as hydrodesulfurizers (HDS) or hydrotreaters (HDT). Catalysts are based on molybdenum sulfide containing smaller amounts of cobalt or nickel. Hydrogenolysis is accompanied by hydrogenation.\nAnother hydrogenolysis reaction of commercial importance is the hydrogenolysis of esters into alcohols by catalysts such as copper chromite.\nThe hydrodeoxygenation reaction used in the Neste Renewable Diesel process, the vegetable oil refining process of largest production capacity, is a hydrogenolysis of triglycerides into alkanes.\n\n\nIn the laboratory\nIn the laboratory, hydrogenolysis is used in organic synthesis.  Debenzylation is most common and involves the cleavage of benzyl ethers:\n\nR−OCH2C6H5 + H2  →  R−OH + CH3C6H5\nThioketals undergo hydrogenolysis using Raney nickel in the Mozingo reduction.\nLaboratory hydrogenolysis is operationally similar to hydrogenation, and may be accomplished at atmospheric pressure by stirring the reaction mixture under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen gas, having flushed the apparatus with more of this gas. The hydrogen may be provided by attaching a balloon to a needle, filling it from a bottle, and inserting the needle into the reaction flask via a rubber septum. At high pressure, a hydrogenation autoclave (i.e., a Buchi or Parr hydrogenator) or similar piece of equipment is required.\n\n\nReferences",

Since 2002, Kipelov leads his own metal band, Kipelov.\n\n\nEarly life\nKipelov was born in 1958 in Kapotnya, Moscow, Soviet Union.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nAria\nKipelov was among the founding members of Aria, alongside Vladimir Holstinin and Alik Granovsky, although he initially played a less active role in songwriting and the development of the band's style than the other two. For the first four albums, he only composed three songs (two of them slow ballads).. After the breakup in 1987, Kipelov and Holstinin were the only two members who remained with their producer Vekshtein.\nDuring the Germany tour 1994, Kipelov's relations with Holstinin and Dubinin became tense. He ceased appearing at Aria's studio and was fired from the band. Then Mavrin refused to play without Kipelov and left the band, too. After participating in a few of Master's concerts, Kipelov tried to form a band of his own, but later returned to Aria following the threat from Moroz Records to sue the band for breach of contract.\nIn 2002, after the release of 'Himera', Kipelov refused to start recording the new album, already written by Dubinin and Holstinin. He stated his wish to start a solo career.This disagreement broke Aria apart after 'Judgement Day', August 31, 2002.\n\n\nKipelov (band)\n\nOn September 1, 2002, the day after Kipelov left Aria, Kipelov, Terentyev, Mavrin and Maniakin launched a new band named Kipelov (named at Terentyev's suggestion as the bandmembers couldn't come up with any better name). In 2003, they released the live album Put Naverh (Way to the Top), recorded in Saint Petersburg.\n\n\nPersonal life\nKipelov is married to Galina Kipelova. He is Orthodox Christian.\n\n\nViews on Ukraine\nKipelov expressed support of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and said it should have been returned to Russia in 1991. He performed at music festivals celebrating the event in Crimea. In July 2022, Kipelov performed in the hospital in front of Rosgvardiya servicemen wounded during the war in Ukraine.\nIn January 2023, Ukraine imposed sanctions on Valery for his support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "KroniK was an American professional wrestling tag team in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), composed of Brian Adams and Bryan Clark in the early 2000s.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (2000–2001)\nAdams and Clark first joined together as a duo in April 2000 in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Upon joining together as a tag team, KroniK (originally spelled Kronic) assisted Vince Russo in his vision of a clean sweep for his New Blood alliance at the 2000 Spring Stampede pay-per-view. Adams and Clark interfered in the WCW World Tag Team Championship match, allowing the team of Buff Bagwell and Shane Douglas to win the title.\nWhile in WCW, KroniK moved between babyface and heel roles several times - holding the WCW World Tag Team Championship twice. In the final months of WCW, KroniK became hired muscle, adopting the catchphrase \"breakin' necks and cashin' checks\", similar to the WWF's popular APA tag team. Their contracts were not picked up by the WWF when WCW was sold by AOL Time Warner.\n\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation (2001)\nIn September 2001, Brian Adams and Bryan Clark each made their re-debut as a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) tag team. Recruited by Stevie Richards, KroniK was called in to settle past differences Richards had with The Undertaker, stemming from the disbanding of Richards' stable, \"Right to Censor\" earlier that year. KroniK wrestled their first tag team match defeating Kaientai on the September 20, 2001 episode of SmackDown! and their last tag team match for the WWF a few days later at Unforgiven, losing to then WCW Tag Team Champions The Brothers of Destruction (Kane and The Undertaker).\nAfter two dark matches, four appearances on Raw and SmackDown! and a pay-per-view appearance, Clark was released from his contract for being unconditioned and unsafe during their PPV match, while Adams began working for the Heartland Wrestling Association, which served as WWF's developmental territory, for conditioning. Adams requested his release from the WWF in November 2001.\n\n\nWWA, All Japan Pro Wrestling, and retirement (2002–2003)\nFollowing their WWF departure, KroniK made appearances for World Wrestling All-Stars, their debut match with promotion taking place at Revolution, defeating the Navajo Warrior and Ghost Walker in less than five minutes.\nKroniK then joined All Japan Pro Wrestling in the summer of 2002 during the Pro Wrestling Love era, making an immediate impact by defeating Keiji Mutoh and Taiyo Kea for the AJPW World Tag Team Championship on July 17, 2002. \nOn the July 20, 2002 edition of AJPW TV, KroniK participated in the Stan Hansen Cup Four Way initiative. KroniK would eliminate the team of George Hines and Johnny Smith, before being eliminated by \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams and Mike Rotunda after Williams pinned Adams after delivering the Doctor Bomb. Mike Barton and Jim Steele would go onto win the tournament. Despite KroniK's failure in winning the Stan Hansen Cup, after the match they would cut a confident and rather cocky promo talking about how they were still the AJPW World Tag Team Champions, calling everyone in the initiative \"losers\", \"stupid\" and \"not smart enough\" to be the champions.\nKroniK would only make one successful title defense against Barton and Steele on August 30, 2002 as part of a two day pay-per-view. On the second day of the pay-per-view on August 31, KroniK defeated Tomoaki Honma and Yuto Aijima in a non-title match. KroniK was later stripped of the titles in October as they canceled the rest of their appearances in 2002, as Adams suffered a shoulder injury while training for a boxing career.\nThey returned for the WRESTLE-1 show on January 19, 2003 in what would be KroniK's last match, losing to Keiji Muto and Goldberg. Along with Goldberg, Steve Williams and Mike Rotunda, KroniK left AJPW during a gaijin exodus, which occurred after Mrs. Baba's last appearance behind the scenes in AJPW. In that match, Adams suffered a spinal injury that forced him into retirement, and Clark decided to leave during the exodus. This was also when AJPW's sale finalized, the company having been in the process of being sold in late 2002.\nAdams died on August 13, 2007, after mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol, as well as the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. Though the Hillsborough County medical examiners determined that each drug was found to be at therapeutic levels, the combination of the drugs together were enough to impede Adams' respiratory system and cause his death.\n\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nAll Japan Pro Wrestling\nWorld Tag Team Championship (1 time)\nWorld Championship Wrestling\nWCW World Tag Team Championship (2 times)\nWrestling Observer Newsletter\nWorst Worked Match of the Year (2001) vs. The Brothers of Destruction at Unforgiven\nWorst Tag Team (2000, 2001)\n\n\nReferences",

Royal runs down through the French Quarter, Faubourg Marigny, Bywater, and Lower Ninth Ward neighborhoods to the Jackson Barracks. The Industrial Canal forms a gap in the street between the Bywater and Lower Ninth Ward neighborhoods.\nThe portion of Rue Royale in the upper French Quarter (toward Canal Street) is known for its opulent antique shops and art galleries. The prices at those shops tend to be high; indeed, the area has been listed as one of the world's most expensive places to shop. The finer antique stores display not simply items that are old, but such rare items as pieces of fine furniture owned by royalty of past centuries. The 800 block of Royal has traditionally been similar to the 700 Block, featuring various art galleries. Art galleries still line this block; however, the recent openings of The Vampire Cafe, Voodoo Bone Lady, and Sassy Magick Noir have transformed the block into a haven for the spiritual and spooky inclined. The 700 block of Royal features the galleries of New Orleans–based artists Ally Burguieres and George Rodrigue.\nEach afternoon, three blocks of Royal Street in the Quarter, between St. Louis and St. Ann Streets, are closed to traffic to create a pedestrian zone.  At that time numerous street performers set up. Outstanding, up-and-coming New Orleans jazz musicians can be heard in the vicinity, although performers vary widely. Royal Street also contains restaurants and hotels, notably the Hotel Monteleone, a family-owned high-rise established in the late 19th century.\nDespite catastrophic effects of 2005's Hurricane Katrina in much of New Orleans, Royal Street was spared the flood, other than in the lower ninth ward. The French Quarter, originally the city itself, was built upon naturally-higher ground next to a curve in the Mississippi River.\n\n\nSee also\nBrennan's\nHaunting of the Octoroon Mistress\nDowntown New Orleans\nThe Historic New Orleans Collection\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Orleans Parish, Louisiana\nList of streets of New Orleans\n\n\nReferences",

He spent one season with the club in the Serbian League Vojvodina, before securing a transfer to Spanish club Toledo in the summer of 1996. On his league debut, Divić netted a hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over Écija. He, however, managed to score just one more goal in the remainder of the 1996–97 Segunda División.\nIn the summer of 1997, Divić returned to his homeland and joined First League of FR Yugoslavia club Rad. He failed to make an impact with the Građevinari and switched to Serbian League Vojvodina side ČSK Čelarevo in the 1998 winter transfer window, immediately helping them win promotion to the Second League.\nIn the summer of 1999, Divić signed with OFK Beograd. He enjoyed a successful stint with the club, becoming the First League of FR Yugoslavia top scorer in the 2000–01 campaign with 27 goals. During his two and a half years with the Romantičari, Divić scored a total of 56 league goals in 76 appearances.\nIn December 2001, Divić moved abroad for the second time and joined Union Berlin. He scored seven times in 18 league games until the end of the 2001–02 season. Six months later, Divić was transferred to fellow Zweite Bundesliga club Eintracht Trier. He failed to score any goals in 15 league appearances.\n\n\nInternational career\nAt international level, Divić earned two caps for FR Yugoslavia, both at the Kirin Cup in 2001. He initially came on as a half-time substitute for Milivoje Ćirković in a 2–0 loss to Paraguay on 28 June. Six days later, on 4 July, Divić played the full 90 minutes in Dragan Stojković's national team farewell against Japan, as they lost 1–0.\n\n\nManagerial career\nIn April 2017, Divić was appointed as caretaker manager of OFK Beograd for the final weeks of the 2016–17 season. He was hired on a permanent basis in June 2017, following the club's relegation to the Serbian League Belgrade. In April 2018, Divić resigned from the position.

    "text": "Morse Micro is a Sydney-based developer of Wi-Fi HaLow microprocessors; chips that enable high data rates, with long range and low power consumption. Amongst all Wi-Fi HaLow systems on a chip, Morse Micro processors are reported to be the smallest, fastest, longest-range with lowest-power-use.\nThe main application of the technology is machine-to-machine communications. With the Internet of things expected to extend to 30 billion devices by 2025, this represents a steeply growing number of users of the technology. The founders plan to be part of \"expanding Wi-Fi so it can go into everything, every smoke alarm, every camera.\"\nThe firm has its global HQ in Sydney, which is also its main base for R&D, with additional centres in the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom and, from 2024, an operations centre in Taiwan. As of 2022, Morse Micro was producing more semiconductors than any other Australian-based tech company.\n\n\nTechnology\nAfter eight years' development, the company's Wi-Fi HaLow processor was reported to deliver 10 times the range of conventional Wi-Fi technology, and able to function for several years before needing battery change.\n\n\nData rates and range\nThe microprocessor allows for a range of data rates, depending on the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) used. This can be as low as 150 kilobits per second (kbit/s) using MCS 10 with BPSK modulation, to a top rate of 43.3 megabits per second (Mbit/s) using MCS 9 at 256 quadrature amplitude modulation.\nThe chip uses low-bandwidth wireless network protocols, operating in the 1 GHz spectrum, while providing a communications range of 1,000 metres. In one field test, researchers found the technology could sustain high speed data transmission between a device placed by the north end of Sydney Harbour Bridge and a device across the harbour at Sydney Opera House. The company claims their chip provides 10 times the range, 100 times the area and 1000 times the volume of data offered by traditional wi-fi.\n\n\nConnectivity and energy\nTo enable networked communications between machines, a single Wi-Fi HaLow Access Point can securely connect up to 8,191 devices. Applications for the WiFi HaLow technology includes the Internet of things, which may include solutions for in the home (such as lighting, monitoring and smart door locks) and in industry (such as vehicle management, high-end security and supply chain asset tracking. Looking at its scalability, one American technical review made this assessment:That's ample capacity to connect every LED bulb, light switch, smart door lock, motorized window shade, thermostat, smoke detector, solar panel, security camera, or any imaginable smart-home device for the foreseeable future. Physically, the company's microchip is one-fifth the size of a traditional Wi-Fi processor. It uses very little energy, consuming a fraction of the power consumed by traditional chips, which is achieved by periodically waking and reporting. As such, the chips can operate for several years on a single coin-size battery. In 2020, the first generation of Morse Micro microchips went into production in Taiwan. The company has onshore design and fabrication of composite semiconductors in Australia, which has been assessed as a strategic capability.\nAs of late 2022, the market for Wi-Fi HaLow products appeared to be expanding, from those developing industrial IoT in the Japanese market which, \"deploy thousands of devices in warehouses which use sensors and actuators.\"\n\n\nHistory\n\"Wi-Fi was invented over 20 years ago in Australia and over that time we have seen it go into every laptop, phone and tablet, and all of that came from people in Australia. Today we are opening it up and expanding Wi-Fi so it can go into everything, every smoke alarm, every camera.\" — Andrew Terry, founder, speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald in 2017The founding partners of Morse Micro, Andrew Terry and Michael De Nil met while working for Broadcom, the largest supplier of integrated circuits for communications. De Nil said they noticed that chips designed for phones and laptops were being used for machine-to-machine communication and \"that wasn't working very well.\" They decided to create a new kind of microprocessor, specifically for the Internet of things.\nMorse Micro Pty Ltd was established as a private company, limited by guarantee, in August 2016. The founders were later joined by several significant engineers, including:\n\nProfessor Neil Weste the founder of Radiata Networks who had created the first 802.11a Wi-Fi chip\nDr. John O'Sullivan (engineer) radio astronomer who led the team who invented Wi-Fi at CSIRO in the 1980s\nDr. David Goodall, a design engineer at Radiata, which created the first commercial WiFi chip\nBy late 2023, the company employed 180 people across Australia, the United States, China, India, UK, Singapore and Taiwan. From this point the focus of market expansion became Japan, through its Japanese investor MegaChips. Security cameras became a key application, which was recognised with the global industry award, the IoT Product of the Year, in 2022 and 2023. The Australian Financial Review reported from 2024 that Morse Micro was ameliorating for geopolitical risk by maintaining two supply chains for chips and components, one from mainland China, the other Taiwan, with assembly and warehousing in Singapore. The Singapore facility began operations in August 2023, and had produced over 2 million chips by November of that year. \n\n\nInvestors\nThe Australian Government provided the founders with seed funding in 2017 as they believed Morse Micro has the \"first WiFi HaLow silicon chip that securely connects smart devices over long distances.\" It is reported to be the best-funded Wi-Fi HaLow technology companies, with large investors from Japan, the United States and a spread of Australian retirement funds. By 15 February 2023, the company had an estimated value of US$700 million, just over A$1 billion.\n\n\nSeries A investment, 2019\nIn May 2019, Series A funding was provided in by a suite of investors. These included the Clean Energy Innovation Fund and CSIRO Innovation Fund, part of the Australian scientific research agency credited with inventing Wi-Fi in 1997. Investment also came from American entrepreneur Ray Stata of Analog Devices, Blackbird Ventures, Main Sequence Ventures, Right Click Capital, Kim Jackson and her husband Scott Farquhar through Skip Capital, Lucy and Malcolm Turnbull; and Uniseed, the venture fund of UniSuper. This tranche totalled A$42 million.\n\n\nSeries B investment 2022\nBy September 2022 the company had announced its Series B round of A$140 million, later extended to A$170 million, attracting intense investor interest. The investment round was led by Japanese chip design and manufacturing giant MegaChips, with further investment from its incumbent investors, which is known to include several Australian superannuation groups, such as TelstraSuper, HESTA, Hostplus and NGS (managed by Blackbird Ventures) and UniSuper (managed by Uniseed).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Benny & Joon is a 1993 American romantic comedy-drama film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer about how two eccentric individuals, Sam (Johnny Depp) and Juniper (\"Joon\") (Mary Stuart Masterson), find each other and fall in love. Aidan Quinn also stars, and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.\nThe film features Depp's physical comedy routines (which are based on silent film comics Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd). In the United States, it popularized the song \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" by The Proclaimers. Benny & Joon was shot primarily on location in Spokane, Washington, while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near Metaline Falls, Washington.\n\n\nPlot\nBenjamin \"Benny\" Pearl and his mentally ill sister Juniper (\"Joon\") live together following the deaths of their parents. A mechanic who owns a garage, Benny has little time for socializing due to his business and his caretaking of Joon, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic. Joon has driven away a series of housekeepers/caregivers who have declared her \"unmanageable\". Unable to leave Joon alone, Benny takes her to his poker game at a friend's house, where Joon loses a bet to Mike, a poker regular, that compels Benny to take charge of Mike's eccentric cousin, Sam. Initially angry at having Sam foisted on him, soft-hearted Benny becomes sympathetic upon learning that Mike has been compelling Sam to sleep in a cabinet under a sink.\n\nAn avid Buster Keaton movie fan, Sam charms servers and patrons at a diner with a classic Charlie Chaplin routine using two bread rolls on forks to mimic dancing feet as well as a slapstick routine juggling plates. There Sam recognizes the waitress, Ruthie, a former actress, from a starring role in a low-budget horror film that Sam can quote verbatim. Impressed with Sam, Benny asks him to take care of Joon, as well as taking on housekeeping chores, which Sam does eccentrically but effectively. Joon has a hard time adjusting to Sam’s unusual housecleaning methods, which involve loud music while riding a chair with wheels to reach high spots with a broom. Though Joon kicks Sam out of the house, a conscientious Sam returns with a peace offering to appease her. Warming to him, Joon aids Sam, who is illiterate, when he struggles with writing to his mother.\nAfter fixing her car, Benny asks out Ruthie, who has a second job as manager of an apartment building, but Benny abruptly ends the date when Ruthie seems to want intimacy. Benny still believes his obligations to Joon preclude his having a love life. When Benny attempts a second date, Ruthie now cuts the date short when Benny again hedges at intimacy while attempting to explain that his life is \"complicated.\"\nBenny, Joon, and Sam go to a park, where Sam starts doing more Chaplin-style slapstick tricks with his hat, a handkerchief, and physical acrobatics, attracting an appreciative crowd. Later that evening, while Benny is away convincing a client who is a talent agent to audition Sam, Sam and Joon are physically intimate and express love for each other. Upon returning, Benny suggests that Sam turn professional with his comedy routines. At the suggestion that Sam go on the road, Joon becomes agitated and makes Sam explain that he and Joon are romantically involved. Benny throws Sam out, yells at Joon, and shows her a pamphlet about a group home that the doctor suggested would be a more stable home for her. Joon starts hitting Benny and screaming, and he pushes her away. Later, to make amends, Benny leaves to get her favorite pudding. While Benny is away, Sam returns, and he and Joon pack suitcases and leave on a bus together. Stressed out, Joon begins to hear voices in her head and argues aloud with them, causing a commotion that stops the bus. Two paramedics arrive to restrain Joon. When Benny arrives at the hospital, the doctor tells him Joon does not want to see him. After telling Benny off, Sam goes to stay with Ruthie. Meanwhile, Benny feels guilty about his treatment of Joon.\nSam now works at a video store, where Benny finds him and asks for his help. They go to the hospital. Benny apologizes to Joon, who accuses him of needing her to be ill. Benny agrees to let her set up her own apartment in Ruthie's building and tells her that Sam has come back for her. The siblings reconcile, and Sam and Joon are reunited. Sam and Joon move into the apartment complex that Ruthie manages, where Joon can be assisted. Later, Benny brings roses to Ruthie, telling her that his life is now \"a lot less complicated\". He takes another bouquet to Joon's apartment but leaves the flowers in the doorway when he sees Sam and Joon making grilled cheese sandwiches with a clothing iron on an ironing board.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\nWoody Harrelson was originally cast to play the role of Benny, while Laura Dern was considered for the role of Joon. Dern passed on the role, and Harrelson quit to take a role in Indecent Proposal. Aidan Quinn was brought in at the last minute to replace Harrelson. A lawsuit later ensued with Winona Ryder, who was dating Johnny Depp at the time and was slated to play Joon after Dern quit. Depp and Ryder broke up, leaving the role of Joon open, which was given to Masterson just days before production began.\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nCritical reception\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, \"The story wants to be about love, but is also about madness, and somehow it weaves the two together with a charm that would probably not be quite so easy in real life.\" Owen Gleiberman gave the film a grade of \"B\", saying \n\n...the movie is full of absurdist fripperies we're meant to find magically funny; mostly they're just cute (Sam cooking up grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron, a poker game in which a snorkel mask and baseball tickets are used as stakes). Beneath the domesticated surrealism, though, Benny & Joon becomes genuinely touching–a love story about separation anxiety. Benny, the saintly grease monkey, thinks he has to devote his life to Joon in order to keep her out of an institution. Can he give her the space she needs to fall in love (and then take said space for himself)? You already know the answer, but Quinn and Masterson – now gentle, now sniping – let it play out with tender conviction.\nJanet Maslin wrote:\n\nIn a more realistic film (and to some degree this film recalls Dominick and Eugene, which also dealt with a hard-working brother taking care of a mentally impaired sibling), troubling issues might well shade the story. But Benny and Joon succeeds in remaining blithe and sunny, directed by Jeremiah Chechik (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) with a commercial liveliness and a suitable sense of the absurd. The film's greatest asset is the obvious conviction of its actors, who never condescend to their roles. Mr. Depp may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life. As Mr. Depp and the rest of the film makers surely must have known, an impersonation like that is an all-or-nothing proposition. Ms. Masterson, a remarkably incisive and determined actress, never sentimentalizes Joon despite many ripe opportunities to do exactly that. She remains fierce, funny and persuasive even when the film conveniently soft-pedals the reality of Joon's situation. Mr. Quinn, often in the position of playing straight man to the other two leads, still makes Benny a touchingly sincere and sympathetic figure.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Benny & Joon holds an approval rating of 76% based on 41 reviews, with an average score of 5.80/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\nBox office\nIn spite of its \"commercially improbable story\", the film became a sleeper hit, evidence of the resurgence of date movies \"after a decade dominated by action film and horror films.\" In the first two weeks of a limited release, Benny & Joon grossed $8 million. Its domestic box office total reached over $23.2 million. It grossed $7 million internationally for a worldwide total of $30 million.\n\n\nPortrayal of schizophrenia\nRoger Ebert writes that Joon is \"schizophrenic, although the screenplay doesn't ever say the word out loud.\"\nDavid J. Robinson remarks, \"More convincing features of schizophrenia (undifferentiated type) soon follow. We are told that Joon experiences auditory hallucinations, does well with a stable routine, and takes medication on a daily basis. Her use of language is one of her most interesting attributes. She uses the last housekeeper's surname (\"Smail\") to refer to anyone who might fill the position, which is how Sam (Johnny Depp) enters her life.\" E. Fuller Torrey calls the film \"a beautifully filmed, but unrealistic story about a brother who is the sole caretaker of his kid sister, who has schizophrenia. ... While the film addresses such issues as noncompliance with medication and disputes over independent living arrangements, the bad times are never too severe or long-lasting. Reviewers Mick Martin and Marsha Porter remarked \"[Although] most viewers will enjoy this bittersweet comedy ... Folks coping with mental illness in real life will be offended by yet another film in which the problem is sanitized and trivialized\".\n\n\nMusical adaptation\nA stage musical adaptation of the movie premiered at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California, from September 2 to October 22, 2017. The musical features music by Nolan Gasser, lyrics by Mindi Dickstein, book by Kirsten Guenther, choreography by Scott Rink and direction by Jack Cummings III. The show ran at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, from April 4 to May 5, 2019. The Paper Mill production featured Claybourne Elder as Benny, Hannah Elless as Joon and Bryce Pinkham as Sam.\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBenny & Joon at IMDb\nBenny & Joon at Rotten Tomatoes \nBenny & Joon at Box Office Mojo",

It is surrounded by Ginninderra Drive on the north, Florey Drive on the west, Southern Cross Drive on the south, and Kingsford Smith Drive on the east.\nLatham has a primary school, a neighbourhood oval and a number of children's playgrounds. Ginninderra Creek runs through Latham, and there are open areas of grassland adjacent, such as the Umbagong district park. Traces of Aboriginal culture remain along the Creek with a marked site of axe-grinding grooves. Latham also has an ACTEWAGL/Evoenergy substation.\nFrom the mid-1970s Latham had a local shopping centre (supermarket, butcher, Chinese restaurant, chemist (later a school uniform/limited sportswear store), hair dresser, bakery, newsagent, doctor's surgery (later physiotherapist) and post office), and a petrol/service station (closed in early 1993).\nThe shopping centre wound down between 1996 and 1998 after a fire that destroyed the supermarket and caused roof damage to the rest of the centre. The schoolwear shop, which had occupied the old chemist shop, also took in the local post office function. After the fire, the owners moved the schoolwear and post office business to the vacant petrol station site.  The post office shop was authorised to limited \"corner store\" duties from early 1998. The butcher, restaurant and physiotherapist left 12–18 months after the fire, with the restaurant the last to leave and the complex finally fenced off in May 1998. The complex no longer exists: a townhouse development now occupies the site.

    "title": "History of cross-strait relations",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=73690111",
    "text": "The history of cross-strait relations introduces the historical changes in the relationship between China and Taiwan since the beginning of time. Suspected records of Taiwan in the history of China date back to the earliest times, when the legendary region of \"Yizhou\" was mentioned in the \"Three Kingdoms\", or Liuqiu in the \"Book of Sui\". During the Song dynasty and the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, there was trade between the two sides of the Strait, and in 1281, Kublai Khan established the Penghu Inspection Division, which began to exercise administrative jurisdiction over Penghu. In 1349, Wang Dayuan documented in Island Yi Zhi Lu that Penghu belonged to Jinjiang County, Quanzhou, and that Liuqiu was one of the overseas countries. The \"Dongfan Ji\", written by Chen Di in the Ming Dynasty, depicts the customs of the aborigines in southwest Taiwan. Since the 1620s, cross-strait relations have been influenced by the Dutch, the Spanish, the Han Chinese, the Manchus, and the Japanese, and mainland China and Taiwan have either unified or separated, with ups and downs.\nIn 1945, World War II ended and the Republic of China took over Taiwan. Cross-strait relations developed in a tortuous manner in response to changes in the domestic and international situation. In the second Chinese Communist Revolution, the Nationalist Army led by the Kuomintang was defeated by the Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 1949, the People's Republic of China was established and gradually took control of the entire Chinese mainland. The Republic of China, on the other hand, retreated to Taiwan, Penghu, Jinma, and other islands. The CCP tried to liberate Taiwan, and the Kuomintang prepared to counter-attack the mainland. A military confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait began and many armed clashes took place.\nAfter the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 1971, the foreign relations of Taiwan were limited. On January 1, 1979, the People's Republic of China established diplomatic relations with the United States and, at the same time, announced the end of the shelling of Kinmen and proposed a policy of \"peaceful reunification\" under one country, two systems. In 1987, after the Republic of China lifted the curfew and opened up cross-strait family visits, cross-strait relations became smoother. But in 1995, when President Lee Teng-hui visited the United States, cross-strait relations became tense again. After entering the 21st century, the economic relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait became quite close, and, in 2018, when the KMT returned to power in Taiwan, cross-strait relations eased. The meeting of the top leaders across the Taiwan Strait in Singapore in 2015 was seen as a major breakthrough in the history of cross-strait relations. And since the return of the Democratic Progressive Party to power in 2016, cross-strait relations have become tense again.\n\n\nHistorical Stages\nThere is no universally accepted standard regarding the beginning of cross-strait relations or historical chronology. In his book \"History of Cross-Strait Relations,\" Professor Zhang Chunying, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, divides the history of cross-strait relations into four periods: the first stage is from the prehistoric period to the Dutch occupation of Taiwan in the 1620s; the second stage is the period from the Dutch, Ming Zheng, Qing, and Japanese rule of Taiwan, to the takeover of Taiwan by the Republic of China in 1945; the third stage is the cross-strait military confrontation formed after the withdrawal of the central government of the Republic of China from mainland China in 1949; the fourth stage is the end of the military confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the 1980s and the de-escalation and development of relations. Professor Shao Zonghai of the Institute of Zhongshan and mainland China Studies at the Chinese Culture University divides the history of cross-strait relations after 1949 into five periods: military confrontation, legal disputes, exchange and détente, ideological confrontation, and reciprocal consultation.\n\n\nPre-modern Times\n\n\nPeriod of the Three Kingdoms (suspected)\n\nThe Chinese history book, \"Records of the Three Kingdoms - Wu Zhi\" records that in the first month of spring in the second year of Huanglong (230), Eastern Wu sent generals Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi with 10,000 soldiers to cross the sea from Zhang'an in Linhai County in search of Yizhou, and thousands of them landed on Yizhou and returned. In addition, the book \"Linhai Water and Land\" written by Shen Ying, the governor of Danyang in Eastern Wu, records that Yizhou is 2,000 miles southeast of Linhai County, where \"the land is free of frost and snow, and the grass and trees do not die; on all sides are mountains, where many mountain barbarians live.\" Some scholars believe that Yizhou refers to Taiwan but there is controversy, while others believe that Yizhou refers to the Ryukyu Islands.\n\n\nSui and Tang dynasties (suspected)\nAccording to the Book of Sui, Liuqiu was located on a sea island, east of Jian'an County, and could be reached by boat in five days. There is also a record of Emperor Yang of Sui sending troops to attack Liuqiu, three times in total. The first time was in 607, but because of the language barrier, only one person was \"swept away and returned\". The following year, Zhu Kuan made a second attack, but they only \"took his armor and returned\". The third time was in 610, when Chen Rong and Zhang Zhenzhou led an army and captured thousands of men and women, and returned. Some scholars believe that the Riuqui Kingdom recorded in the Sui Shu is today's Taiwan, but others believe that the Riuqui Kingdom refers to the Ryukyu Islands.\n\n\nSong and Yuan dynasties\nIn 1171, Wang Dayou was the governor of Quanzhou, an area under the jurisdiction of Emperor Xiaozong, who had an island called Penghu, where many Han Chinese lived. In order to prevent harassment, every year when the south wind rose, Wang Dayou sent troops to defend, costing the army money, but it was still too much to handle. So he built 200 houses and dispatched generals to reside in them. There are few records about the cross-strait trade during the Song and Yuan dynasties, but from the large number of ceramics excavated during the Song and Yuan dynasties, Penghu should have been an important stopover for the foreign trade of mainland China at that time. According to the records, during the Song and Yuan dynasties, iron was a high-priced commodity in Taiwan, and the aborigines in Taiwan often had to wait for merchant ships from mainland China to dock and exchange food for iron from the people on board. In his \"Journal of the East of the Sea\", Zhu Jingying of the Qing Dynasty said that he had received hundreds of Song money at the Chiayi port.\nIn 1225, the Book of Barbarian Nations anecdotally indicated that Penghu was attached to Jinjiang, Quanzhou Prefecture. A group of Quanzhou immigrants lived on Penghu.\nIn 1281, Kublai Khan sent an envoy to invade Japan, and most of his ships were sunk by a typhoon, and the remnants drifted to the west coast of Taiwan and Penghu. In 1292, Yuan Shizu sent an ambassador to appease Liuqiu, but after arriving, he could not speak the language with the locals and returned without success. In the third year of Temür Khan's reign (1297), Fujian Province's Pingshang Minister of State was pleased to send provincial governor Zhang Hao and Fuzhou's new army Zhang Jin to the Ryukyu Kingdom, capturing more than 130 people and returning. In the first month of the next year, the captured Ryukyu people were released and asked to submit to the Yuan Dynasty, but nothing happened after that. In 1330 and 1337, Wang Dayuan left from Quanzhou twice to trade with other countries. He recorded in the \"Island Yi Zhi Lu\" that Penghu belonged to Jinjiang County of Quanzhou, and Ryukyu was one of the overseas countries.\n\n\nModern times\n\n\nMing dynasty\n\nIn 1384, the Ming dynasty abolished the Penghu inspection division, and in 1563, the Penghu inspection division was reinstated to send troops to guard.\nIt is recorded in the \"Dongfanji\" (An Account of the Eastern Barbarians) by Chen Di that Zheng He visited Taiwan during his expedition in the early years of Yongle, when the Dongfangyi (aborigines of Taiwan) hid and did not want to obey the restrictions, so Zheng He gave each family a brass bell to tie around their necks. The bronze bell was treated as a treasure by them. It is recorded in the \"Taiwan Prefecture Gazetteer\" by Gao Gongqian that during the Xuande period, Zheng He's fleet went to Taiwan to draw water at the head of Dajingfang, and he also threw medicine into the water to heal the sicknesses of the local indigenous people.\nThe territory of Taiwan is described in the \"History of Ming Dynasty\" by Zhang Tingyu of the Qing Dynasty as \"its land, from the north to the highest peak in the south, can be more than 1,000 miles; in the east from Doroman, in the west to Wangcheng, can be more than 900 miles\". It is worth noting that Jigong, together with Ryukyu, Luzon, and Brunei, was included in the chapter of \"The Fourth of the Two Hundred and Eleven Foreign Countries\", which was not included in the Ming Dynasty's territory.\n\n\nTrade\nBy the early 16th century, increasing numbers of Chinese fishermen, traders and pirates were visiting the southwestern part of the island. Some merchants from Fujian were familiar enough with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan to speak Formosan languages. The people of Fujian sailed closer to Taiwan and the Ryukyus in the mid-16th century to trade with Japan while evading Ming authorities. Chinese who traded in Southeast Asia also began taking an East Sea Compass Course (dongyang zhenlu) that passed southwestern and southern Taiwan. Some of them traded with the Taiwanese aborigines. During this period, Taiwan was referred to as Xiaodong dao (\"little eastern island\") and Dahui guo (\"the country of Dahui\"), a corruption of Tayouan, a tribe that lived on an islet near modern Tainan from which the name \"Taiwan\" is derived. By the late 16th century, Chinese from Fujian were settling in southwestern Taiwan.\nIn 1593, Ming officials started issuing ten licenses each year for Chinese junks to trade in northern Taiwan. Chinese records show that after 1593, each year five licenses were granted for trade in Keelung and five licenses for Tamsui. However these licenses merely acknowledged already existing illegal trade at these locations.\nInitially Chinese merchants arrived in northern Taiwan and sold iron and textiles to the aboriginal peoples in return for coal, sulfur, gold, and venison. Later the southwestern part of Taiwan surpassed northern Taiwan as the destination for Chinese traders. The southwest had mullet fish, which drew more than a hundred fishing junks from Fujian each year during winter. The fishing season lasted six to eight weeks. Some of them camped on Taiwan's shores and many began trading with the indigenous people for deer products. The southwestern Taiwanese trade was of minor importance until after 1567 when it was used as a way to circumvent the ban on Sino-Japanese trade. The Chinese bought deerskins from the aborigines and sold them to the Japanese for a large profit.\nWhen a Portuguese ship sailed past southwestern Taiwan in 1596, several of its crew members who had been shipwrecked there in 1582 noticed that the land had become cultivated and now had people working it, presumably by settlers from Fujian. When the Dutch arrived in 1623, they found about 1,500 Chinese visitors and residents. Most of them were engaged in seasonal fishing, hunting, and trading. The population fluctuated throughout the year peaking during winter. A small minority brought Chinese plants with them and grew crops such as apples, oranges, bananas, watermelons. Some estimates of the Chinese population put it at 2,000. There were two Chinese villages. The larger one was located on an island that formed the Bay of Tayouan. It was inhabited year-round. The smaller village was located on the mainland and would eventually become the city of Tainan. In the early 17th century, a Chinese man described it as being inhabited by pirates and fishermen. One Dutch visitor noted that an aboriginal village near the Sino-Japanese trade center had a large number of Chinese and there was \"scarcely a house in this village . . . that does not have one or two or three, or even five or six Chinese living there.\" The villagers' speech contained many Chinese words and sounded like \"a mixed and broken language.\"\n\n\nPiracy\nIn the 42nd year of Jiajing (1563), Lin Daoqian, a pirate of Quanzhou origin, gathered against the Ming Dynasty and was pursued by Yu Dayou, the Ming Governor, and fled to Taiwan to settle in Jigong via Penghu. He led hundreds of followers and enslaved the aborigines in Taiwan. The Aborigines were so angry that they agreed to kill Lin Daoqian, but the news leaked out and they were killed by Lin Daoqian in a night attack. After Lin Daoqian, Lin Feng, the leader of the Chaozhou pirates, was chased by Hu Shouren, the Ming Dynasty's chief soldier, in 1574 and fled to Penghu, and then to Taiwan's Sprite Harbor (Bajang Xi Kou) as his base. When Hu Shouren sent an order to the pirates to attack, Lin Feng and the others fled. He later returned to Wankan on 27 December 1575 but left for Southeast Asia after losing a naval encounter with Ming forces on 15 January 1576.\nAccording to legend, in 1621, Pedro Yan Shiqi, a Zhangzhou citizen, came to Taiwan from Nagasaki, Japan, and set up a fortress in the area of Zhu Luo Mountain, engaging in farming, hunting, and trading activities. When the news spread back to the mainland, it attracted a large number of poor people from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou to come across the sea and join them, numbering as many as 3,000 people. In 1625 Yan Shiqi died of illness, and Zheng Zhilong (Koxinga's father) succeeded him. In 1628 (the first year of Chongzhen) in September, Zheng Zhilong was recruited by the Ming court and returned to the mainland with more than 30,000 men and more than 1,000 ships as the \"Five Tiger Guerrilla General\" and was stationed in Anhai. During the Fujian disaster, Zheng Zhilong sent tens of thousands of starving people to Taiwan to earn a living, and the related expenses were then returned to Zheng Zhilong in the form of rent and taxes. In addition, Zheng Zhilong broke the Haijin and almost monopolized the trade between the coast of mainland China and Taiwan, Macau, Japan, and the Philippines.\n\n\nWokou\n\nAccording to Shen Yourong of Wuyu, a Ming coast guard general, who wrote in the \"Minhai Gift\", he had \"entered Dongfan three times to destroy the Japanese and drive away the Dutch\". In July 1602, the Wokou plundered the coastal areas of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, and then fled to Dongfan as their lair. On the one hand, Fujian Quanzhou defender Shen Youyong Duji sent people to scout the enemy, understand the climate, wind direction and sea current, build ships, train troops and store food. In the winter of the same year, Zhu Yunchang, the governor of Fujian, issued a secret order to \"fight against the Japanese in the East\" and Shen Youyong led 24 ships across the sea to Taiwan and defeated the Japanese. He burned and sank 6 Japanese ships, beheaded 15 heads and took back more than 370 captives. Shen Youyong was stationed in Da Ren for more than 20 days. After Shen defeated the wokou, he met with the chieftain Damila, who presented gifts of deer and liquor as thanks for getting rid of the pirates. Chen Di, who was accompanying him, witnessed these events and wrote an account of Taiwan known as Dongfanji (An Account of the Eastern Barbarians).\n\n\nEuropeans\n\nIn 1604, when Wybrand van Warwijck, the Dutch Vice admiral, occupied Penghu, Shen Youyong, the Ming Dynasty's chief minister of Wuzhou, led 50 ships (about 2,000 men) to Penghu and asked Wei Malang to leave. Due to the disparity in strength between the two sides, Wei Malang left Penghu on December 15 and went to Taiwan to find a stronghold. This incident is recorded on the monument of Shen Youyong's advice to the retreat of the Red Maoists in the Penghu Tianhou Temple.\nIn 1622, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the governor of the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia, sent Lei Yosheng to Penghu and established Fengguiwei Fort as a trading base.\nIn 1624, Ming General Yu Dayou led an army to surround the Dutch and after eight months of fierce battle, the Dutch evacuated Penghu and moved to Taiwan to set up Fort Zeelandia as a base. The Dutch East India Company recruited Han Chinese from the coast of Fujian Province of China and Penghu to cultivate in Taiwan, and many of them later settled in Taiwan. The genealogy of the Yan clan in Anhai and the genealogy of the Guo clan in Fenyang, and Dongshi both contain records of the migration of families into Taiwan.\nIn 1626, the Spaniard Vardes led a fleet of ships from Manila, Philippines, along the east coast of Taiwan to Keelung Island in Keelung City to establish the city of San Salvador as the center of rule. Although the Spaniards were not allowed to start official trade with the Ming Dynasty, they attracted smugglers to do business in Jilong by exempting them from customs duties, tariff, and even entry inspection.\nIn 1633 (the sixth year of Chongzhen), the Dutch East India Company used Taiwan as a base to blockade and plunder the coast of Fujian on the mainland. The Ming navy under the leadership of Zheng Zhilong defeated the Dutch East India Company and the pirate alliance, which is known as the Battle of Liaoluo Bay. The Han Chinese in Taiwan also rebelled against Dutch rule, the better known being the Guo Huaiyi rebellion in 1652. At that time, 4,000 to 5,000 Han Chinese participated, about a quarter of the total number of Han Chinese in Taiwan, and were suppressed after 12 days, with 3,000 to 4,000 Han Chinese dead.\n\n\nKoxinga fights against the Dutch\n\nIn 1644, the Ming Dynasty fell, and the Ming clans of Zhu Yousong, Zhu Yihai, and Zhu Yujian established the Southern Ming regime. Among them, Zhu Yujian of Tang was crowned emperor by the brothers Zheng Zhilong and Zheng Hongkui in 1645 in Fuzhou. In 1646, the Qing army entered Fujian, Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, and Zheng Chenggong left for Kinmen. In 1647, Zheng Chenggong formally swore to rebel against the Qing Dynasty under the name of House of Zhu and recruited and claimed the surname of the sinful subjects of the great general, and fought for more than ten years in the southeast coast of China, and helped the Ming clan and the people to cross the sea and settle in Taiwan. Since the Dutch often robbed Chinese merchant ships, Zheng Chenggong warned the Dutch twice between the tenth (1656) and fourteenth (1660) years of the Yongli era to stop robbing merchant ships or they would not trade with them. In April 1661, Zheng Chenggong led 25,000 soldiers and hundreds of warships into Taiwan under the name of \"Great General of the Ming Recruiting Army\" and forced the Dutch East India Company to sign a contract of surrender on February 1, 1662, after the Battle of Jelanzai. Zheng Chenggong set up Chengtianfu in Taiwan and tried to rebel against the Qing Dynasty and restore the Ming Dynasty, but he died soon afterward. After Cheng Cheng succeeded to the throne, due to the fear of insufficient legitimacy of his rule, he welcomed the Great Ming King of Ningjing, Zheng Jing, from Kinmen to Taiwan in 1663 and renamed Taiwan as Dongning, still serving the Ming dynasty in name and setting up the Tainan Confucian Temple in 1665.\nOn April 21, 1674, Geng Jingzhong, the King of Jingnan of the Qing Dynasty, rose against the Qing Dynasty and invited Zheng Jing across the sea for a western expedition. After Zheng Jing crossed the sea, he asked Geng Jingzhong to claim Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, but after being refused, he sent troops to occupy Haicheng and Tong'an District, and the two sides began to fight. In 1675, Geng Jingzhong negotiated with Zheng Jing to settle the war with Fengting as the boundary, the north belonged to Geng and the south to Zheng. In 1676, Zheng Jing defeated the Pingnan King Shang Zhixin and occupied Huizhou. After Zheng Jing had the four state capitals of Zhang, Quan, Chaozhou, and Huizhou, he captured Tingzhou, and Geng Jingzhong had to surrender to the Qing Dynasty. After Geng Jingzhong surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, Zheng Jing, who faced the Qing army alone, was defeated and finally retreated to Xiamen.\nIn 1677, the Qing Dynasty started peace talks with Zheng Jing again, and Prince Kang of the Qing Dynasty promised in a letter that if Zheng Jing retreated from the islands off the coast of China, he would promise to make Dongning a vassal of the Qing Dynasty in the same way as Korea, and to trade with Dongning without suspicion forever. In 1678, a letter from the Qing general Lai Ta to Zheng Jing claimed that if Zheng's army was willing to retreat to Taiwan, then Zheng could stay in Taiwan forever, with the same status as Joseon and Japan, without having to shave his hair and change his clothes, and pay tribute to his subjects all by his own will. In 1680, Zheng Jing was defeated and retreated from Xiamen to Taiwan. On March 17, 1681, when Zheng Jing died, the important officer Feng Xifan killed Zheng Kezang and established his brother Zheng Keshuang, which led to the deterioration of the state and the disintegration of the people.\n\n\nQing Dynasty included Taiwan in its map\n\nOn July 10, 1683 (the 22nd year of Kangxi), the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty sent Shi Lang to attack Taiwan with more than 20,000 troops and 200 ships on land and water. After seven days of fierce fighting, the elite of Zheng Keshuang's army was completely wiped out. On July 20, the King of Ningjing, Zhu Jungui, committed suicide and martyred himself, while Zheng Ke-chiao formally submitted his surrender on September 17, and on October 3, Qing troops entered Taiwan to accept the surrender. In the following year, Taiwan was established as Taiwan Prefecture, which was under the jurisdiction of Taiwan, Fengshan and Zhu Luo counties, and was subordinate to Taixia Province of Fujian Province, and promulgated the \"Rules of Taiwan for the Investigation of Exile\" to strictly control the number of mainland Han Chinese crossing into Taiwan. At the early stage of the establishment of Taiwan, the Qing court authorized the Fujian governor to transfer officials from the mainland of Fujian Province to Taiwan from each other. Therefore, most of the officials in Taiwan during the Qing Dynasty were from Fuzhou.\nIn 1721, Zhu Yigui made himself king of Taiwan and named his country \"Da Ming\", but he was soon destroyed by the Qing army, and in late 1731 (the ninth year of the Yongzheng era of the Qing Dynasty), the Taokas people, the aborigines of Taiwan, launched an armed resistance against the government. Hao Yulin, the acting governor of Fujian at that time, sent Wang County, the chief soldier of Taiwan, to supervise the conquest, and more than 6,000 soldiers were recruited from mainland China to conquer Taiwan. The incident lasted for seven months, and finally, the chiefs of Taiwan surrendered at the head of the army. Thirteen chiefs, including Lin Li, were executed in accordance with the Qing law, and the Shalong chief was found guilty of abetting the conspiracy and was sentenced to death.\nAfter the Qing court ruled Taiwan, trade between Taiwan and the mainland became more prosperous. At that time, Taiwan's main exports were rice, deer skins, and sugar, and imports were textiles, herbs, and other daily necessities, and the three main trading ports were Fucheng (now Tainan Anping), Lugang (now Changhua Lugang), and Monga (now Taipei Wanhua). The common name \"One Fu, Two Lu and Three Monga\" describes the most prosperous trading ports during this period. In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, a large number of immigrants came to Taiwan, and there were many conflicts of interest between the first and second arriving groups. For example, there were Min-Yue armed battles between the He-lo people of Fujian and the Hakka and Chaozhou people of Guangdong; Quan-Zhang armed battles between the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou people of Fujian; and Xipi-Fulu armed battles between the Xiqu schools. However, there were also collaborations among the various ethnic groups in Taiwan during this period. For example, in 1796, when Wu Sha was reclaiming Clam Chai, there were Zhang, Quan and Hakka people who joined the reclamation.\n\n\nGovernance of Taiwan in the late Qing Dynasty\nAfter the Second Opium War in 1860, the Qing government agreed to open Taiwan to trade in Anping and Danshui, and soon opened the two ports of Dog and Jidong. 1874, Japan sent troops to Taiwan to create the Mudangsha Incident. 1875, the Qing government sent Shen Baozhen as the Minister of the Imperial Household to Taiwan for inspection, and transferred 6,500 men from Tang Dingkui's army stationed in Xuzhou to Taiwan for garrisoning. In the end, it was settled by the signing of the Beijing Treaty between China and Japan. This diplomatic incident prompted the Qing court to lift the ban on mainland Chinese people crossing to Taiwan for cultivation, and Taiwan was fully opened up.\nDuring the Sino-French War in 1884, French Admiral Lupo occupied Keelung, attacked Danshui, blocked the Taiwan Strait, and harassed the Chinese coastal provinces. On July 29, 1885, Zuo Zongtang explained the reasons for the rapid transformation of Taiwan into a province in his \"Request for the transfer of the governor of Fujian to Taiwan to take charge of Taiwan's defense\". In October of the same year, the Qing court established the Fujian Province of Taiwan to control the former Fujian Province of Taiwan and Taipei Province. During his tenure as governor of Taiwan, Liu Ming Chuan expanded the number of provinces, created new counties, and promoted a series of foreign affairs reforms, making Taiwan the most modernized province in the Qing Empire at that time.\n\n\nQing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan\n\nQing Dynasty was defeated by Japan in the Sino-Japanese War and signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki on April 17, 1895, ceding Taiwan and Penghu to Japan. The news reached Taiwan, and the then governor of Taiwan, Tang Jingsong, issued the \"Declaration of Independence of Taiwan Democracy\" on May 25, but still held the Qing Dynasty as the suzerain state. on June 2, both Qing and Japan completed the handover of Taiwan, and the Japanese army entered Tainan on October 21 to exterminate the regime of Taiwan Democracy. Taiwan became a Japanese colony and a base for the Japanese invasion of mainland China. The Taiwan Governorate, as the vanguard of the Japanese Empire's implementation of its southward policy, formulated policies specifically for Fujian and carried out cultural infiltration by founding schools, setting up hospitals, building shrines and operating newspapers on the mainland, which had a profound impact on the development of modern Fujian society.\nAround 1896, the then governor of Taiwan, Kodama Gentarō, sent the then abbot of Lanyang Temple in Yilan, Taiwan, Venerable Gasshohiro to Xiamen to preach. On August 24, 1900, the temple was burned down and on August 25, the Japanese governor of Taiwan sent an army to cross the sea and prepare to occupy Xiamen. The Western powers reacted strongly, and the British, Germans, Americans and Russians all brought their warships into the Port of Xiamen, and the British marines landed in the British Concession. This is known as the \"Xiamen Incident\" in history.\nAfter the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, Taiwan's Chiang Wei-Shui, Tu Tsung-ming and Weng Chun-Ming joined the Taiwan branch of the Tongmenghui one after another. 1928 saw the establishment of the Taiwan Communist Party in the Shanghai French Concession under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which advocated the overthrow of Japanese rule in Taiwan and the establishment of the Taiwan Republic. After September 1931, the Taiwan Communist Party ceased operations due to the arrest and imprisonment of a large number of party members. In 1934 and 1936, the Fujian provincial government twice organized delegations to Taiwan for inspection. when Japanese rule over Taiwan began in 1895, Taiwan's economy was not yet as large as that of Fujian. However, after nearly 40 years of Japanese operation, Taiwan had far surpassed Fujian. Therefore, the Taiwan Study Tour Report recommended Fujian learn from Taiwan's economic model.\nAfter the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Taiwanese civilians living in China, under the leadership of Li Youbang, formed the Taiwan Volunteer Force to fight against Japan. On February 23, 1938, the Soviet Volunteer Group bombed the Taihoku Air Strike in Taipei in the name of the First Brigade of the Republic of China Air Force. on December 9, 1941, the National Government of the Republic of China officially declared war on Japan and declared all treaties against Japan null and void. On November 25, 1943, the 14th Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces in China and the First Brigade of the Chinese-American Composite Wing launched 14 B-25 bombers from Suichuan, Jiangxi Province, China, and bombed the Japanese air base at Hsinchu, destroying 52 Japanese planes, In July 1945, China, Britain and the U.S. issued the Potsdam Declaration, which made it clear that \"the terms of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented\" as one of the necessary conditions for Japan's surrender. on September 2, Japan formally accepted the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation and surrendered to the Allies.\n\n\nThe Republic of China takes over Taiwan\n\nOn August 29, 1945, Chiang Kai-shek. appointed Chen Yi, then chairman of Fujian Province, as the chief executive of Taiwan Province, and on October 15, Kuomintang troops disembarked at Keelung Harbor, and on October 25, the Republic of China formally took over Taiwan and Penghu, designating that day as Taiwan's Retrocession Day. At the end of February 1947, there was a series of civil-military conflicts in Taiwan, and Chen Yi secretly requested Chiang Chung Cheng to send more troops from mainland China to suppress them.\nFrom 1948 onward, as the Republic of China Armed Forces lost successive battles in the Second Nationalist-Communist Civil War, Chiang began to relocate the National Government, military units, military dependents, National Palace relics, treasury assets and related archives to Taiwan. from 1945 to 1950, nearly two million military and civilians from all over mainland China moved to Taiwan. These mainland immigrants were called foreigners in Taiwan to distinguish them from the earlier immigrants to Taiwan from the province.\n\n\nThe present age\n\n\nMilitary confrontation\n\nFrom 1928 to 1942, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) maintained that Taiwan was a separate nation. In a 1937 interview with Edgar Snow, Mao Zedong stated \"we will extend them (the Koreans) our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence. The same thing applies for Taiwan.\"\nOn March 15, 1949, the Xinhua News Agency published an editorial titled \"The Chinese People Must Liberate Taiwan\", raising the slogan of \"Chinese unification\" for the first time. After the government of the Republic of China moved to Taipei following the defeat of the Chinese Communist Revolution, it put forward slogans such as \"counter-attacking the mainland\", \"eliminating communist bandits\", and \"rescuing compatriots\", and promulgated the \"Ordinance on the Suppression of Bandits and Spies during the Counterinsurgency Period\", which strictly restricted the interaction between Taiwanese and mainlanders. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait went through the Battle of Gulingtou in 1949, the Battle of Dongshan Island in 1953, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1954, the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands in January 1955, the Battle of Dachen Archipelago in February 1955, and the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, with both sides winning and losing.\nDuring that time, the Korean War broke out and U.S. troops moved into Taiwan, while noting that Taiwan's status was undetermined. As a result, the People's Republic of China complained to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 87 about the armed aggression against Taiwan, while protesting the exclusion of the People's Republic of China from the United Nations, but the case was eventually rejected. In the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan renounced all rights, rights names and claims to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but neither the ROC nor the People's Republic of China participated in the signing of the peace treaty. The ROC and Japan then signed the Treaty of Taipei in 1952, and the signing of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty also made the PLA wary. in April 1955, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, went to Indonesia to attend the Bandung Conference and issued a statement that \"the Chinese government is willing to negotiate with the U.S. government to strive for the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means\". After learning of this in the U.S., Li Zongren responded by publishing \"Proposals on the Taiwan Question\" in August of the same year, while the ROC government blocked the news of the publication of this article.\nIn early October 1958, the PLA announced that it would give up its blockade of Kinmen, and later changed to a \"single strike and no strike\" to gradually reduce its offensive, and the cross-strait wrestling turned to a legal-unification dispute over Greater China's representation in the international community. In 1972 Nixon visited China and signed the Three Communiqués, and in September of the same year China and Japan established diplomatic relations; on January 1, 1979, the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, while breaking diplomatic relations with the ROC, replacing the U.S.-China Mutual Defense Treaty with the Taiwan Relations Act, and withdrawing troops from Taiwan. On January 1, 1979, Xu Xiangqian, Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, issued the \"Statement of the Ministry of National Defense on the Cessation of Artillery Fire on the Greater Kinmen Islands\", which officially put an end to the 21-year Kinmen artillery war.\n\n\nDe-escalating communication\n\nOn January 1, 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued the \"Letter to Taiwan Compatriots\", replacing the original \"liberation of Taiwan\" with \"peaceful reunification and \"one country, two systems\", and moving from a hard-line to a more moderate attitude toward Taiwan. In response, Chiang Ching-kuo proposed the Three Noes \"no contact, no negotiation, no compromise\" policy on April 4, and on May 29, the Taiwan Strait resumed navigation. On October 1, 1981, Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, proposed nine policies for the \"peaceful reunification\" of Taiwan, stating that \"after the country is reunified, Taiwan can be a special administrative region with a high degree of autonomy and can retain its military forces. The central government (meaning Beijing) will not interfere in Taiwan's local affairs.\" On July 24, 1982, Liao Chengzhi, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to President Chiang Ching-kuo, calling for peace talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to \"put away grudges when they meet\"; the ROC government did not respond, and in 1984, the mainland refrained from returning fire when it shelled Jiao-Yu Island, which was under PLA control.\nOn November 2 of the same year, Taiwan opened up for people to visit their relatives on the mainland, and cross-strait private economic and trade activities heated up rapidly. in August 1988, the Mainland Working Committee of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China was established to coordinate cross-strait economic and trade exchanges. in June 1989, the Taiwan region officially opened up for indirect imports of goods from the mainland. On October 7, 1990, the then President of the Republic of China, Lee Teng-hui, announced the establishment of the National Unification Council, and on February 23, 1991, the Guidelines for National Unification were adopted, advocating the unification of China based on the principles of \"democracy, freedom, and equal wealth\". An amendment to the Constitution divided the Republic of China into a \"mainland area\" and a \"free area\". The \"Mainland Region\" is defined in the Cross-Strait Act as \"the territory of the Republic of China outside of Taiwan\".\nIn 1991, the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits became operational one after another, and talks were held in Hong Kong in 1992, but to no avail. In April 1993, the cross-strait Wang–Koo summit was held on the basis of the 1992 Consensus. In January 1995, Jiang Zemin, then the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, put forward eight propositions for developing cross-strait relations and advancing Chinese unification. In response, President Lee Teng-hui put forward six proposals on April 8, known as Lee's six articles.\n\n\nConscious opposition\n\nThe Min Ping Yu No. 5540 incident in 1990 and the Qiandao Lake incident and the Xiaojinmen anti-aircraft artillery misfire on Xiamen in 1994 triggered discontent among people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. in June 1995, then ROC President Lee Teng-hui visited Cornell University in his private capacity and proposed the national positioning of the Republic of China on Taiwan, triggering the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. In August 1996, the Chinese mainland opened the Fuzhou and Xiamen On September 14, 1996, President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) proposed the idea of \"using patience and urgency\" at the Taiwan Businessmen's Conference, restricting the Taiwanese business community's investment in mainland China. In 1997, Fujian established the \"Cross-Strait (Fuzhou) Agricultural Cooperation Pilot Zone\" and the \"Cross-Strait (Zhangzhou) Agricultural Cooperation Pilot Zone\", and in May 1999, the Democratic Progressive Party Plenum passed the \"Resolution on Taiwan's Future\". In July of the same year, President Lee Teng-hui put forward the two-state theory, advocating that the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China was \"state-to-state\" or \"at least a special state-to-state relationship\".\n\nIn 2000, when the Democratic Progressive Party became the ruling party of the Republic of China (ROC) for the first time, Chen Shui-bian proposed Four Noes and One Without at his inauguration ceremony, namely, \"As long as the Chinese Communist Party has no intention to use force against Taiwan, I promise that during my term of office, I will not declare independence, I will not change the national symbol, I will not promote the constitutionalization of the two-state theory, I will not promote a referendum on unification and independence that would change the status quo, and there is no question of abolishing the national platform and the National Unification Council. In 2001, Matsu Islands, Kinmen, Mawei District, and Xiamen were connected to each other by trade, air, and mail. On August 2, 2002, Chen proposed \"One\nCountry on Each Side\" through a video conference at the World Taiwan Clansmen's Association, saying that Taiwan and China are not the same countries. On February 22, 2004, Chen said that\nthe mainland was aiming 496 missiles at Taiwan, with an additional one every six days. As a result, Taiwan held the 228 Million Hands for Taiwan campaign to oppose the deployment of China's missile facilities against Taiwan.\nIn March 2005, President Chen Shui-bian told members of the European Parliament and the news media that he could not change the ROC's national name to the Republic of Taiwan. On March 26, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Federation of Trade Unions (TUF) organized a march in protest. On August 2, 2005, Chen proposed a four-stage theory, namely \"the ROC is on the mainland, the ROC is in Taiwan.\" Four days later, Chen proposed one principle, three insistencies and five objections as the guidelines for handling cross-strait affairs, and in 2006 Chen announced that the \"National Unification Plan\" would \"cease to apply\". There is no left-right route in Taiwan, only the issue of unification and independence. However, this did not cause a strong reaction from China and the U.S., and cross-strait economic and trade exchanges continued to develop. 974,000 passengers were carried on the \"Little Three Links\" in 2008.\n\n\nReciprocal consultation\n\nOn March 22, 2008, Ma Ying-jeou won the 2008 Taiwanese presidential election, and on May 20, the Chinese Kuomintang returned to power, advocating no unification, no independence, and no military force, that is, \"during Ma's term of office, he pledged not to promote cross-strait unification, nor to declare Taiwan's independence, and no military war between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. In October and November of the same year, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) Vice President Zhang Mingqing and President Chen Yunlin, who had served as Director and Assistant Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, visited Taiwan and were attacked and besieged by protesting people in Taiwan. On December 31 of the same year, Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the CCP, put forward the \"Hu Six Points\" at the 30th anniversary of the publication of the \"Letter to Taiwan Compatriots\". Cross-strait relations have continued to develop on the basis of the \"1992 Consensus\", and the SEF and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have held eleven \"leaders' meetings\" and signed twenty-three agreements and two joint statements, including the Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), the launch of regular cross-strait direct flights, and cross-strait cooperation in combating crime. In 2013, the first time the Mainland Affairs Council was allowed to participate in APEC Indonesia 2013 meetings was considered a major breakthrough in the progress of cross-strait relations.\nThe Sunflower school movement in Taiwan in 2014 curbed the momentum of cross-strait economic integration. In June of the same year, DPP's Tainan Mayor Lai Ching-te said during a visit to mainland China that \"the future of Taiwan is to be decided by the 23 million people together\". The Taiwan Affairs Office responded that \"any issue involving China's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be decided by the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots,\" and stressed that its stance against Taiwan's independence would remain unchanged. In September, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the CCP invited more than 20 Taiwan unificationist groups to visit Beijing, and the General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, Xi Jinping, reiterated that \"peaceful unification and one country, two systems\" is the basic policy of the mainland in resolving the Taiwan issue. In response, Executive Yuan President Jiang Yi-huah said, \"The Republic of China has never accepted the policy of one country, two systems, and our proposition is to maintain the status quo under the constitutional framework of the Republic of China. For its part, mainland China continues to roll out new unification strategies. On November 7, 2015, top cross-strait leaders Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou met in Singapore, the first meeting of top leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the 66 years since the political separation in 1949, and the two sides exchanged views on advancing the peaceful development of cross-strait relations. DPP Chairman and presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen criticized the meeting as \"an attempt to use a political framework to limit the future choices of the people in cross-strait relations\".\n\n\nCurrent status of the Taiwan Strait\n\nSince her inauguration as president of the Republic of China on May 20, 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, has advocated maintaining the status quo and not recognizing the 1992 Consensus, and successfully made a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in late 2016. The Xi Jinping–Li Keqiang Administration has continuously pressured the Presidency of Tsai Ing-wen in the hope that Tsai would return to the 1992 Consensus. For her part, in an open letter to members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as party chairman on the occasion of the party's 30th anniversary, Tsai said she would resist pressure from mainland China, develop relations with other countries, and get rid of her overdependence on China. Most Taiwanese people are dissatisfied with the suppression of mainland China in the international community, while on the other hand half of the public is dissatisfied with Tsai's performance in handling cross-strait relations.\nXi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered the \"Xi Five Articles\" at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during the \"40th Anniversary Commemorative Meeting of the Letter to Taiwan Compatriots\" on Jan. 2, 2019. Focusing on the Political status of Taiwan, Xi reiterated \"the 1992 Consensus that both sides of the Strait belong to the same China and work together for national reunification\". In the afternoon of the same day, Tsai Ing-wen, President of the Republic of China held an impromptu press conference, saying that she \"rejects the 1992 Consensus\" and \"resolutely opposes one country, two systems\". Since March 2019, the People's Liberation Army has continuously conducted drills in the Taiwan Strait. On April 30, 2021, R.O.C. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ou Jiang'an said that China's actions had jeopardized the security and status quo in the Taiwan Strait, and on May 12, 2021, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Zhu Fenglian said that \"Taiwan independence\" stubborn elements who malign the mainland and incite cross-strait confrontation will be severely punished and held accountable for life under the law. .... On November 5 of the same year, the Taiwan Affairs Office named Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, Legislative President You You Si-kun and Executive President Su Tseng-chang as \"Taiwan independence stubborn elements. In response, Wu said it was an honor, while Yau felt honored and thanked him, and Su said he was not intimidated.\nOn August 2, 2022, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and the PLA immediately conducted a series of military exercises around Taiwan, firing several ballistic missiles. On August 10, 2022, the Taiwan Affairs Office and the State Council Information Office jointly released the third White Paper on Taiwan, \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era\" referring to the \"One Country, Two Systems Taiwan Program\" and the \"Taiwan Special Administrative Region. On August 16, 2022, the Taiwan Affairs Office added Hsiao Bi-khimn, Gu Li-hsiung, Tsai Chi-chang, Ko Chien-ming, Lin Fei-fan, Chen Chiu-hwa, and Wang Dingyu to the list of recalcitrant Taiwan independence activists for sanctions.\nOn April 7, 2023, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said that the Vision Foundation and the Asian League for Freedom and Democracy have been peddling Taiwan independence ideas internationally and creating incidents that violate the One China principle, such as \"one China, one Taiwan\" and \"two Chinas\".

    "summary": "The history of cross-strait relations introduces the historical changes in the relationship between China and Taiwan since the beginning of time. Suspected records of Taiwan in the history of China date back to the earliest times, when the legendary region of \"Yizhou\" was mentioned in the \"Three Kingdoms\", or Liuqiu in the \"Book of Sui\". During the Song dynasty and the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, there was trade between the two sides of the Strait, and in 1281, Kublai Khan established the Penghu Inspection Division, which began to exercise administrative jurisdiction over Penghu. In 1349, Wang Dayuan documented in Island Yi Zhi Lu that Penghu belonged to Jinjiang County, Quanzhou, and that Liuqiu was one of the overseas countries. The \"Dongfan Ji\", written by Chen Di in the Ming Dynasty, depicts the customs of the aborigines in southwest Taiwan. Since the 1620s, cross-strait relations have been influenced by the Dutch, the Spanish, the Han Chinese, the Manchus, and the Japanese, and mainland China and Taiwan have either unified or separated, with ups and downs.\nIn 1945, World War II ended and the Republic of China took over Taiwan. Cross-strait relations developed in a tortuous manner in response to changes in the domestic and international situation. In the second Chinese Communist Revolution, the Nationalist Army led by the Kuomintang was defeated by the Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 1949, the People's Republic of China was established and gradually took control of the entire Chinese mainland. The Republic of China, on the other hand, retreated to Taiwan, Penghu, Jinma, and other islands. The CCP tried to liberate Taiwan, and the Kuomintang prepared to counter-attack the mainland. A military confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait began and many armed clashes took place.\nAfter the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 1971, the foreign relations of Taiwan were limited. On January 1, 1979, the People's Republic of China established diplomatic relations with the United States and, at the same time, announced the end of the shelling of Kinmen and proposed a policy of \"peaceful reunification\" under one country, two systems. In 1987, after the Republic of China lifted the curfew and opened up cross-strait family visits, cross-strait relations became smoother. But in 1995, when President Lee Teng-hui visited the United States, cross-strait relations became tense again. After entering the 21st century, the economic relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait became quite close, and, in 2018, when the KMT returned to power in Taiwan, cross-strait relations eased. The meeting of the top leaders across the Taiwan Strait in Singapore in 2015 was seen as a major breakthrough in the history of cross-strait relations. And since the return of the Democratic Progressive Party to power in 2016, cross-strait relations have become tense again.",

    "text": "KLOK (1170 kHz \"Punjabi Radio USA 1170 AM\") is a commercial AM radio station based in San Jose, California, that broadcasts Punjabi-language talk shows and music. It serves the San Francisco Bay Area and has focused on programming for the South Asian community since June 2009.\nBy day, KLOK is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for American AM stations. At night, it reduces power to 9,000 watts.  It uses a directional antenna in the daytime, helping it cover most of the Bay Area.\n\n\nHistory\nE.L. Barker founded KLOK and began broadcasting on October 13, 1946. Initially, the station broadcast with a 5,000-watt daytime signal, later adding a 1,000-watt nighttime signal in 1952. The power increased to 10,000 watts in the daytime and 5,000 watts in the night time on June 29, 1964. Mr. Barker sold KLOK Radio to Davis Broadcasting (which later became the Weaver Davis Fowler Corporation) in 1967. On August 10, 1969, KLOK increased the daytime power to its current 50,000 watts. These historical dates were memorialized on a plaque near the entrance of the station's former studios and transmitter site on South King Road in San Jose.\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, the station broadcast \"oldies\" pop music, eventually switching to Adult Contemporary. By the early 1980s, KLOK's parent company also owned KLOK-FM (San Francisco), KWIZ (Santa Ana), and KFIG (Fresno). According to Ad Week, all five stations eventually shared the same stunt format, a \"Yes/No Radio\" format, which was developed by KLOK Executive VP and GM, Bill Weaver. This allowed the station to leverage branding, advertising, and jingles by JAM Creative Productions until August 1988. In this format, listeners would respond to the \"KLOK Yes/No Music Poll\" by calling into the station and voting \"Yes\" if they would like the song added to the playlist or \"No\" to have a certain song removed from the playlist. The last song played on KLOK as an Adult Contemporary station was \"When Will I See You Again\" by The Three Degrees.\nKLOK became a Spanish-language station on August 9, 1988. KLOK was purchased by brothers Danny Villanueva and James Villanueva, owners of Radio América, Inc., Bahia Radio, and KBRG 104.9, as the Spanish-language music talk format \"KLOK Radio Reloj.\" The first song played on Radio Reloj was Argentine singer, Ricardo Ceratto's \"El Sol Nace Para Todos.\" In 1989, EXCL Communications bought KLOK and KBRG from Radio América, Inc. and flipped to a Regional Mexican format under the name \"KLOK Con la Música de México\" and later Tricolor. In 2000, Entravision acquired both KLOK and KBRG from EXCL. The station flipped to Cumbia 1170 AM format, now consisting of Cumbia music. On January 1, 2006, Univision Radio Network purchased both KLOK and KBRG from Entravision and switched it to a Spanish Talk format, no longer consisting of any more music. The station maintained this format until 2009 when its sale by Univision Radio to Principle Broadcasting Network was followed by a change to a format billed as \"New International Community Radio\" and later \"Desi 1170 AM\" generally consisting of South Asian music.\nOn May 1, 2018, KLOK adopted the \"Radio Zindagi\" format, focusing on Indian talk and music after KZDG (1550 AM) discontinued the format. On July 4, 2021, KLOK began broadcasting under the \"Mirchi\" brand, catering to the South Asian audience in the Bay Area.\nOn January 24, 2023, Punjabi American Media's \"Punjabi Radio USA\" announced the acquisition of KLOK from Tron Dinh Do for US$2.85 million, with the sale completed on March 24, 2023.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFCC History Cards for KLOK\nFacility details for Facility ID 41339 (KLOK)   in the FCC Licensing and Management System\nKLOK in Nielsen Audio's AM station database",

    "text": "The Athletic Grounds was a stadium in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. It was the home of Rochdale Hornets Rugby League Football Club for over 90 years until 1988. It has also been used for speedway, BriSCA F1 Stock Cars and greyhound racing.\n\n\nOrigins\nThe Athletic Grounds east of Rochdale opened in 1894 and the new stadium soon became the home of the Rochdale Hornets rugby league club. Situated alongside the Oldham & Rochdale branch railway on its south side the stadium could be accessed from Milnrow Road.\n\n\nRugby league\n\nRochdale Hornets moved to the Athletic Grounds in 1894, their first game took place in September 1894 against Crompton. Between 1896 and 1900, Rochdale Association Football Club played at the Athletics Grounds. Hornets became tenants of the ground in 1900, incidents from the game played on 22 March 1901 resulted in the ground being suspended by the Northern Union.\nIn 1905, following a disastrous investment into Rochdale Town A.F.C., the Athletic Grounds company went into liquidation, and the premises were bought by a William Watson \"and another gentleman\" for £100. \nIn the 1911–12 season, the railway stand was covered and a new covered side on the enclosure side was built. Rochdale Hornets purchased the ground in 1913.\nThe highest attendance at the Athletic Grounds was the 1924 Challenge Cup final between Oldham and Wigan when 41,831 saw Wigan win 21–4.\nA fire destroyed the main stand, dressing rooms and offices on 18 September 1935. A new stand built over the ashes of the old was opened on Saturday 7 March 1936 for the match against Liverpool Stanley.\nOn 1 April 1939, seventeen spectators were taken to the hospital and two were killed, following the collapse of part of the centre railway stand roof during the Salford versus Wigan Challenge Cup semi-final. The Athletic Grounds holds the distinction of being the scene of the world record for the longest goal kick in rugby league when Swinton, Cumberland and Great Britain second rower Martin Hodgson landed a penalty goal from 77¾ yards in a Hornets v Swinton match played in gale force conditions on 13 April 1940.\nIn January 1947, a Supporters' Club bar opened under the main stand. This was followed by a Supporters' Club tea bar on 24 September 1949. A food licence was granted on appeal. This was the first tea bar since before the Second World War. Later, a small tea bar was set up on the railway side of the ground, but was destroyed by vandalism.\nHornets borrowed £3,000 from the Rugby Football League in 1954 to build a new covered outer boundary wall and new turnstiles for the main entrance and Waithlands. The highest attendance for a league match was set on Saturday 16 October 1954, Hornets lost 4–18 to local rivals Oldham in front of 19,654 spectators.\nA new popular side stand was built by the Supporters' Club in 1958–59 which increased the covered areas to a capacity of 5,000 spectators and the old railway stand, which had been damaged by vandals, was rebuilt in 1970 with the Supporters' Club contributing £1,400 towards the repairs.\n\n\nRugby league Test matches\nThe list of international rugby league matches played at the Athletic Grounds is:\n\n\nRugby league tour matches\nThe Athletic Grounds also saw the Rochdale Hornets play host to various international touring teams from Australia (sometimes playing as Australasia) and New Zealand from 1907 to 1967. Rochdale never won a match against a touring team.\n\n\nSpeedway\n\nSpeedway was first held at the Athletic Grounds on 4 August 1928.Speedway arrived in Rochdale at the Athletic Grounds on 25 August 1928 The first speedway death in Britain occurred at the track, when Clifford Mawson was fatally injured on 21 October 1928.\nThe last meeting took place on 29 August 1930, Rochdale Speedway Limited decided to go into voluntary liquidation, with \"waning interest in the sport\" being cited as the reason for failure.\nOn Sunday 29 March 1970, speedway returned to the Athletics Grounds as Rochdale Hornets speedway team took on Crewe. The team moved to Ellesmere Port at the end of the 1972 season.\n\n\nGreyhound racing\nA greyhound racing syndicate brought greyhound racing to the stadium in 1932 with the opening meeting held on 18 June 1932 under British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) rules, the BGTCS were the main rival to the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) at the time.\nIn 1935 the BGTCS disbanded and the track switched to the NGRC and in 1938 the company failed in an attempt to purchase the ground from the rugby league club. Rochdale Greyhounds Ltd had earned significant profits from their tote deductions alone putting them in a strong financial position as the war approached.\nThe track had a 450-yard circumference and the racing kennels and paddock were set well behind the main grandstand with the 120 resident kennels further behind these quite near to housing that had been constructed since the opening of the stadium. Race distances were 319, 500 and 530 yards in addition to a 465-yard handicap. The Racing Manager during the 1950s was T H Mitchell assisted by J Edden.\nIn December 1962 the track decided to leave the NGRC due to falling profits and they went independent (unaffiliated to a governing body), J\nDickinson was the Racing Manager but Mitchell & Edden remained at the track. However, during December 1969 the greyhound racing stopped with the Rochdale Greyhounds Ltd citing unsustainable losses  and the landlords refusing to renew the lease.\n\n\nStock car racing\n\nBriSCA F1 Stock Cars racing was introduced to Rochdale in May 1970. The track was used until 1972, the big criticism being the height of the inner granite kerb stones. designed to protect the rugby pitch. It returned in 1974 under the promotion of Mike Parker Promotions until 1984 when it finally closed. It was a big fast shale track, 440 yds in length. Rochdale also produced 2 of the sports biggest stars, 391 Stuart Smith and 396 Doug Cronshaw.\n\n\nClosure\n\nIn 1987, both Rochdale Hornets and Rochdale A.F.C. were in financial trouble. First to receive an offer for their ground, Hornets accepted Morrison's £2.6m offer for the Athletic Grounds and, following the sale of the land bought a half share in Rochdale A.F.C.'s Spotland Stadium, thus saving both clubs. A Morrisons supermarket now stands on the site.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nHornets centenary booklet",

    "text": "Shabaka Hutchings (born 1984), also known simply as Shabaka, is a British jazz musician, composer and bandleader. He leads the band Shabaka and the Ancestors, and formerly led Sons of Kemet before its dissolution in 2022. He was also a member of The Comet Is Coming, performing under the stage name King Shabaka. Hutchings has played saxophone and other wind instruments with the Sun Ra Arkestra, Andre 3000, Floating Points, Mulatu Astatke, Polar Bear, Melt Yourself Down, Heliocentrics, London Brew and Zed-U.\n\n\nBackground and early years\nHutchings was born in 1984 in London, England, but moved to Birmingham at the age of two. From the age of six, he was raised in his parents' native Barbados. There, as a nine-year-old, he picked up the clarinet and practised along to the hip hop verses of Nas, Notorious BIG and Tupac, as well as the rhythms of Crop Over. Hutchings' father, Anum Iyapo, is a graphic designer who worked on albums by artists including King Tubby and Jah Shaka, and recorded a reggae poetry album called Song of the Motherland in 1985.\nReturning to England, at the age of 19 he went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he received a classical-music degree on the clarinet. In London, he joined the Tomorrow's Warriors programme, a blues workshop led by British bassist Gary Crosby, Janine Irons and expat New Orleans trumpeter Abram Wilson, where Hutchings met many of his future collaborators in the burgeoning South East London jazz scene.\nHutchings was a BBC New Generation Artist from 2010 to 2012. He has also spent time in South Africa.\n\n\nCareer\nHutchings and many of his contemporaries shrug off the \"jazz\" label, eschewing the restriction especially as the many groups reflect influences ranging from acid house and drum & bass, to hiphop and soca, with less of a blues influence than jazz, which reviewers have noted marks a distinction between the London scene as represented by Hutchings and American jazz music.\n\nShabaka and the Ancestors debuted in 2016 with the album Wisdom of Elders on Gilles Peterson's Brownswood Recordings label. The Comet Is Coming, a trio with keyboardist Dan Leavers and drummer Max Hallett, received a Mercury Prize nomination for their debut album Channel the Spirits, released on The Leaf Label in April 2016. Sons of Kemet, a quartet of saxophone, tuba and two drummers, launched with the album Burn in 2013, followed up with Lest We Forget What We Came Here to Do in 2015, both on the Naim Jazz label, before moving to Impulse! for Your Queen Is a Reptile in 2018, which coincided with a breakout into wider public consciousness of the UK jazz scene, captured by the attention on the Hutchings-directed compilation We Out Here on Brownswood. In November the same year, Hutchings curated part of the programme for the Dutch Le Guess Who? festival.\nIn March 2020, Shabaka and the Ancestors released We Are Sent Here by History under Impulse! Records. Hutchings was due to take part in a series of concerts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, but these were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, a group was assembled under the name London Brew in December 2020 to record an improvised set inspired by the 1970 album. This would go on to be released in March 2023.\nAlso in 2020, Hutchings launched the London-based record label Native Rebel Recordings. The idea for the label was conceived by Hutchings and music industry publisher Matt Smith. Hutchings drew inspiration from ECM Records, its founder Manfred Eicher, and the idea that a label could have an overriding aesthetic. All of the label's releases are recorded at RAK Studios over a three-day period, with rehearsal incorporated into that time in order to emphasize first experiences with the music. The label has released albums from such artists as Chelsea Carmichael, Confucius MC and Kwake Bass, the Brother Moves On, Ganavya Doraiswamy, and Kofi Flexxx. The label also released a 10th anniversary reissue of Sons of Kemet's Burn, and a remaster of the 1985 album Song of the Motherland by Hutchings' father AnkAnum.\nIn May 2022, Hutchings released his debut solo EP, Afrikan Culture, under the mononym Shabaka. On New Year's Day in 2023, Hutchings issued a statement on his Instagram page, that he would take a hiatus from playing the saxophone from the end of 2023. He later clarified his reasons for doing so, citing the physical and emotional strain that comes from performing on the saxophone on tour. His final live saxophone performance took place on 7 December 2023, where he played John Coltrane's A Love Supreme at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.\nHutchings' solo debut album, Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace, was released in April 2024 by Impulse!\n\n\nAwards and honours\nHutchings has won a MOBO Award for best jazz act with the Sons of Kemet in 2013, the Paul Hamlyn Composer Award in 2014, and Jazz Innovation awards from Jazz FM.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\nAfrikan Culture (Impulse!, 2023)\nPerceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace (Impulse!, 2024)\n\n\nAs leader and co-leader\n\n\nwith Sons of Kemet\nBurn(Naim, 2013)\nLest We Forget What We Came Here to Do (Naim, 2015)\nYour Queen Is a Reptile (Impulse!, 2018)\nBlack to the Future (Sons of Kemet album) (Impulse!, 2021)\n\n\nwith Melt Yourself Down\nMelt Yourself Down (album) (Leaf, 2016)\nLast Evenings on Earth (album) (Leaf, 2016)\n\n\nwith The Comet Is Coming\nChannel The Spirits (Leaf/Revolver, 2016)\nTrust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery (Impulse!, 2019)\nThe Afterlife (as King Shabaka) (Impulse!, 2019)\nHyper-Dimensional Expansion Beam (as King Shabaka) (Impulse!, 2022)\n\n\nwith Shabaka & the Ancestors\nWisdom of Elders (Brownswood, 2018)\nWe Are Sent Here by History  (Impulse!, 2020)\n\n\nwith others\nNight Time on the Middle Passage (Zed-U) (Babel, Bandcamp, 2009)\nThe Ragging Of Time(SFS) (Bruce's Fingers,Bandcamp, 2015)\nA.R.E.(Association for Research & Enlightment) Project (Hieroglyphic Being, Sarathy Korwar, Shabaka Hutchings) (Bandcamp, 2017)\nLondon Brew (Concord, 2020)\n\n\nAs sideman\nDay to Day(Sarathy Korwar) (Ninja, 2017)\nLa Saboteuse(Yazz Ahmed) (Naim, 2017)\nUnit(e)(Alexander Hawkins) (Alexander Hawkings Music, Bandcamp 2017)\nThe Sunshine Makers The Heliocentrics (Soundway, 2017)\nThe Rich Are Only Defeated When Running For Their Lives (Anthony Joseph) (tracks 1 (Kamau), 5 (Swing Praxis) (Heavenly Sweetness, Bandcamp 2021)\nBreak a Vase (Alexander Hawkins Mirror Canon) (Intakt, 2022)\n\n\nAs featured artist\nSoho Live (Shez Raja Collective)(track 1 - Adrenalize) (33 Records, 2014)\nArise (track 10 - Silhouette) (Brownswood, 2017)\nUniversal Beings (Makaya McCraven (tracks 7-11) (International Anthem, 2018)\nCelia (Angélique Kidjo (tracks 7-11) (Verve, 2019)\nYellow Ochre (Vels Trio) (track 1 - 40 Point) (Rhythm Section International, Total Refreshment Centre, Bandcamp, 2021)\nShout Out!

    "text": "A partial solar eclipse will occur at the Moon's descending node of orbit between Wednesday, September 24 and Thursday, September 25, 2098, with a magnitude of 0.7871. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.\nThe partial solar eclipse will be visible for parts of the Russian Far East, Hawaii, and western North America.\n\n\nEclipse details\nShown below are two tables displaying details about this particular solar eclipse. The first table outlines times at which the Moon's penumbra or umbra attains the specific parameter, and the second table describes various other parameters pertaining to this eclipse.\n\n\nEclipse season\n\nThis eclipse is part of an eclipse season, a period, roughly every six months, when eclipses occur. Only two (or occasionally three) eclipse seasons occur each year, and each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months (173 days) later; thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. In the sequence below, each eclipse is separated by a fortnight. The first and last eclipse in this sequence is separated by one synodic month.\n\n\nRelated eclipses\n\n\nEclipses in 2098\nA partial solar eclipse on April 1.\nA total lunar eclipse on April 15.\nA partial solar eclipse on September 25.\nA total lunar eclipse on October 10.\nA partial solar eclipse on October 24.\n\n\nMetonic\nPreceded by: Solar eclipse of December 7, 2094\nFollowed by: Solar eclipse of July 15, 2102\n\n\nTzolkinex\nPreceded by: Solar eclipse of August 15, 2091\nFollowed by: Solar eclipse of November 6, 2105\n\n\nHalf-Saros\nPreceded by: Lunar eclipse of September 19, 2089\nFollowed by: Lunar eclipse of October 2, 2107\n\n\nTritos\nPreceded by: Solar eclipse of October 26, 2087\nFollowed by: Solar eclipse of August 26, 2109\n\n\nSolar Saros 126\nPreceded by: Solar eclipse of September 13, 2080\nFollowed by: Solar eclipse of October 6, 2116\n\n\nInex\nPreceded by: Solar eclipse of October 15, 2069\nFollowed by: Solar eclipse of September 6, 2127\n\n\nTriad\nPreceded by: Solar eclipse of November 25, 2011\nFollowed by: Solar eclipse of July 26, 2185\n\n\nSolar eclipses of 2098–2101\nThis eclipse is a member of a semester series. An eclipse in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours (a semester) at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit.\nThe partial solar eclipse on October 24, 2098 occurs in the previous lunar year eclipse set.\n\n\nSaros 126\nThis eclipse is a part of Saros series 126, repeating every 18 years, 11 days, and containing 72 events. The series started with a partial solar eclipse on March 10, 1179. It contains annular eclipses from June 4, 1323 through April 4, 1810; hybrid eclipses from April 14, 1828 through May 6, 1864; and total eclipses from May 17, 1882 through August 23, 2044. The series ends at member 72 as a partial eclipse on May 3, 2459. Its eclipses are tabulated in three columns; every third eclipse in the same column is one exeligmos apart, so they all cast shadows over approximately the same parts of the Earth. \nThe longest duration of annularity was produced by member 11 at 6 minutes, 30 seconds on June 26, 1359, and the longest duration of totality was produced by member 45 at 2 minutes, 36 seconds on July 10, 1972. All eclipses in this series occur at the Moon’s descending node of orbit.\n\n\nMetonic series\nThe metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years (6939.69 days), lasting about 5 cycles. Eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date. In addition, the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years (1387.94 days). All eclipses in this table occur at the Moon's descending node.\n\n\nTritos series\nThis eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle, repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months (≈ 3986.63 days, or 11 years minus 1 month). Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee), but groupings of 3 tritos cycles (≈ 33 years minus 3 months) come close (≈ 434.044 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.\nThe partial solar eclipses on April 8, 1902 (part of Saros 108) and January 5, 1935 (part of Saros 111) are also a part of this series but are not included in the table below.\n\n\nInex series\nThis eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle, repeating at alternating nodes, every 358 synodic months (≈ 10,571.95 days, or 29 years minus 20 days).

However, groupings of 3 inex cycles (≈ 87 years minus 2 months) comes close (≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nhttp://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEplot/SEplot2051/SE2098Sep25P.GIF",

    "text": "Bruce William Hayward  (born 1950) is a New Zealand geologist, marine ecologist, and author. He is known as a leading expert on living and fossil foraminifera.\n\n\nEducation and career\nAt the University of Auckland, Hayward graduated in geology with B.Sc. (Hons) in 1971 and Ph.D. in 1975. In 1976–1977, he was a postdoc at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\nFrom 1978 to 1991, Hayward was a micropaleontologist for the New Zealand Geological Survey, Lower Hutt. In March 1991, Hayward became the curator of marine invertebrates at the Auckland Institute and Museum, after the retirement of Walter Olivier Cernohorsky. From 1997 to 2002, he was a self-employed research associate in the Geology Department of the University of Auckland, as well as from 1998 to 2000, a James Cook Research Fellow at the University of Auckland. In 2003, he became the founder and principal scientist of Geomarine Research, located in Auckland. He was the principal scientist for three Marsden Fund grants: from 2000 to 2002 \"Foraminifera and paleoceanography of Bounty Trough, east New Zealand\", from 2003 to 2005 \"The last global marine extinction: causes and consequences for global biodiversity\", and from 2007 to 2010 \"Causes of evolution and global extinction in the deep sea\". In addition to his research on foraminifera, he has done research on \"northern New Zealand geology and landforms, marine invertebrate ecology, industrial archaeology and lichens.\"\nHayward was, from 1980 to 1989, an editor for the Geological Society of New Zealand, from 1988 to 2012, an associate editor for the Journal of Foraminiferal Research, and from 2010, chief editor for Foraminifera, World Register of Marine Species. He is founder and convenor (1984–present) of the New Zealand Geopreservation Inventory and from 1990 to 1993, a member of the New Zealand Conservation Authority and from 1993 to 1996 a member of the Auckland Conservation Board.  He co-founded the Offshore Islands Research Group in 1977 and co-founded the Auckland Geology Club in 1993. He is the author or co-author of \"over 1000 publications, including more than 280 peer-reviewed papers, hundreds of popular articles, 13 scientific monographs and more than 20 popular books.\"\n\n\nLegacy\nThe New Zealand foliose lichen species Pseudocyphellaria haywardiorum was named after Bruce and Glenys Hayward in 1988 by David Galloway, after the pair collected the type specimen of the species in 1971, on Red Mercury Island.\nAlso the lichens: \nFlavoparmelia haywardiana Elix and Johnston 1988  \nLecanora haywardiorum Lumbsch 1994  \nBuellia haywardii Elix, A.Knight & H.Mayrhofer, 2017\nForaminifera:\nPalliolatella haywardi Kawagata, 2016 \nTubulogenerina haywardi Gibson 1989   \nRhombobolivinella haywardi Popescu & Crihan, 2005\nQuinqueloculina haywardi Parker & Le Coze, 2025\nOstracoda:\nMicrocytherura haywardi Milhau, 1993\nRadiolarian:\nLophocyrtis (Lophocyrtis) haywardi O’Conner, 1999.\n\n\nAwards and honours\n1978 — McKay Hammer Award of Geological Society of NZ for publications on \"Waitakere Ranges geology\"\n1988 — New Zealand Association of Scientists Research Medal\n1989–1991 — President of the Geological Society of New Zealand\n2001 — elected Honorary Life Member of New Zealand Marine Sciences Society\n2003 — elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Te Apārangi\n2006 — Hochstetter Lecturer of the Geological Society of New Zealand\n2006 — appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit (MNZM) in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to earth science and conservation\n2013 — McKay Hammer Award of Geoscience Society of NZ for publications on \"The last global extinction (Mid-Pleistocene) of deep-sea benthic foraminifera\"\n2013 — elected Honorary Life Member of Geoscience Society of New Zealand.\n2017 — Joseph A.

    "text": "Cosquer Cave ([kɔskɛʁ]) is located in the Calanque de Morgiou in Marseille, France, near Cap Morgiou. The entrance to the cave is located 37 m (121 ft) underwater, due to the Holocene sea level rise, and contains various prehistoric rock art engravings. Its submarine entrance was discovered in 1985 by Henri Cosquer, a professional diver. The underwater passage leading to the cave was progressively explored until 1990 by cave divers, without the divers being aware of the archaeological character of the cave.\nOnly in the last period (1990-91) of the progressive underwater explorations did the cave divers emerge in the non-submerged part of the cave. The prehistoric paintings were not immediately discovered by the divers to first emerge from the other side of the sump. The cave was named after Henri Cosquer when its existence was made public in 1991, after three divers became lost in the cave and died.\n\n\nDescription\nThe cave can now be accessed by divers through a 175 m (574 ft) long tunnel; the entrance is located 37 m (121 ft) below sea level, which has risen since the cave was inhabited. During the glacial periods of the Pleistocene, the shore of the Mediterranean was several kilometers to the south and the sea level up to 100 m (330 ft) below the entrance of the cave.\n\n\nDiscovery and history\nHenri Cosquer, a professional diver from Cassis, discovered the submerged entrance to a cave in 1985, guided by a tip from a fellow diver. That year, he began exploring the underwater passage alone and later with a friend and diving instructor from his club. The passage narrowed and turned sharply before leading to an underground lake. On one solo dive, a malfunctioning lamp forced Cosquer to retreat, leaving him shaken.\nIn June 1990, Cosquer enlisted Belgian cave divers Bernard and Marc Van Espen, who located the entrance 37 meters below the Pointe de la Voile near Cap Morgiou. They followed the gallery carefully to avoid disturbing silt and reached the underground lake Cosquer had seen, but their guide line ran out, forcing them to turn back. At this point, the dry section of the cave remained unexplored.\nIn June 1991, Marc Van Espen returned and, on June 24, installed the final section of the guide line during a dive with Cosquer. Their exploration lasted only 30 minutes, providing a brief view of the first chamber beyond the submerged passage.\nOn July 9, 1991, Cosquer explored the cave further with his niece, Cendrine Cosquer, and diving club members Yann Gogan and Pascale Oriol. They examined the dry section in more detail and discovered what appeared to be a handprint on the wall, suggesting prehistoric art. This finding spurred several dives in July and August, leading to the discovery of additional cave paintings and the production of photographs and films with the help of Thierry Pelissier and Gilles Sourice.\nTragedy struck on September 1, 1991, when three divers from Grenoble became lost in the access gallery and perished. Cosquer and Gogan helped recover their bodies. Two days later, on 3 September 1991, Cosquer declared the cave to the Maritime Affairs Department in Marseille.\nThe discovery was referred to the Regional Archaeological Service under the Ministry of Culture. From September 18-20, 1991, an expedition led by prehistorian Jean Courtin and cave art specialist Jean Clottes took place aboard the DRASM vessel Archéonaute. Initial skepticism about the authenticity of the artwork arose but was later addressed.\nIn June 1992, another mission resulted in the production of a film, The Secret of Cosquer Cave. Between 2001 and 2005, and again from 2010 to 2015, a series of archaeological research operations led by Luc Vanrell, with contributions from Michel Olive, further studied the cave.\nA legal dispute emerged between Cosquer and the Ministry of Culture regarding compensation under a 2001 law on preventive archaeology. This law entitles discoverers to financial rewards based on the site's archaeological value. Cosquer sought a reward and a share of profits from book sales featuring cave photographs. Henri Cosquer also claimed a reward and the recovery of part of the proceeds from the sale of books of photographs of the cave.\n\n\nPrehistoric paintings\n\nFour-fifths of the cave were permanently or periodically submerged by sea water destroying any cave wall art in those locations. Nearly 500 instances of cave art remain which date back to two distinct periods during the Upper Paleolithic. The first phase, from around 27,000 years ago (the Gravettian Era), is represented by art consisting of 65 hand stencils, 44 in black and 21 in red. Art from the more recent period dates to around 19,000 years ago (the Solutrean Era) and features much more complex depictions of various animals and human figures. In total there are 177 animals drawings found in the cave; these include 63 horses, 28 ibex, 17 deer, 10 bison, and 7 aurochs. There is also the more unusual depiction of 16 marine animals including 9 seals and 3 great auks as well as some jellyfish and various figures which could be either fish or cetaceans. Of the human figures there are numerous sexual symbols but also one example of \"the killed man\" motif which can be seen in other caves such as at Lascaux.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Stone Age art\nGreat auk (in cave art)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\nCosquer’s Cave Grotto Cosquer\nPrehistory and coastal karst area: Cosquer Cave and the “Calanques” of Marseille Archived 2011-09-28 at the Wayback Machine\nOfficial French Ministry of Culture pages on Submarine archaeology\nFrench Ministry of Culture (2022). \"Cosquer cave | Archéologie sous-marine\". archeologie.culture.gouv.fr.

He served as the fourth Governor of Arizona Territory and was nominated to become Governor of Idaho Territory but declined the position.  In his later life he served as President of Washington's constitutional convention and as a justice of the Washington Supreme Court.\n\n\nBackground\nHoyt was born on October 6, 1841, to David and Susan (Fancher) Hoyt in Austinburg Township, Ohio. He was educated in public schools and at the Grand River Institute. Upon completing his education, Hoyt worked as a teacher until the outbreak of the American Civil War.\nOn May 27, 1862, Hoyt enlisted as a private in the 87th Ohio Infantry. After one month of service he was made a commissary sergeant and then he and his regiment were captured by Confederate forces at the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Hoyt was mustered out on October 3, 1862, and he reenlisted as a commissary sergeant in the 2nd Ohio Heavy Artillery. Later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Ohio Light Artillery and on January 15, 1866, was mustered out as the rank of captain. After the war he was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic.\nHoyt married Lettie J. Lewis of Adams, New York, on December 27, 1869. The couple had one daughter, June, and two sons, Harold and Arthur.\n\n\nEarly political career\nUpon his return to civilian life, Hoyt began studying law at a law firm in Jefferson, Ohio, before enrolling at the Ohio State & Union Law School in Cleveland, Ohio.  He graduated in July 1867 and moved to Vassar, Michigan.  In 1868 and 1870, Hoyt was elected a prosecuting attorney for Tuscola County, Michigan.  This was followed by election to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1872 and 1874 where he served as Speaker of the House in 1875.\n\n\nArizona Territory\nPresident Ulysses S. Grant nominated Hoyt to be Secretary of Arizona Territory on May 22, 1876. The new Secretary arrived in the territorial capital of Tucson on July 8, 1876, and was sworn in the same day. While in his new position he continued to practice law, being admitted to the Arizona bar on November 13, 1876, and admitted to practice law in the Territorial Supreme Court on January 3, 1877.  His primary accomplishment as Secretary was compiling a new legal code for the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature  This legal code, the \"Hoyt Code\", expanded the earlier \"Howell Code\" while retaining the same structure of the earlier work.\nHoyt was commissioned to replace the retiring Anson P.K. Safford as governor on April 5, 1877.  Due to several lawsuits at the time naming Hoyt in his official capacity as Secretary, he asked to defer his assumption of the governor's office until a replacement could take his former position and represent Arizona Territory. The incoming Secretary, John J. Gosper, arrived on May 30, 1877, and Hoyt was sworn in as governor the same day.  Hoyt suspended his practice of law due to a decision by Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz that he should not practice while serving as governor.\nUpon his ascension to the governorship, Hoyt had two major rivalries to deal with. He was able to help heal a bitter relationship between the territory's civilian and military leadership which had developed under Governor Safford, with General Irvin McDowell commending Hoyt on his attitude.  He had less success addressing the rivalry between the northern and southern portions of the territory, but was seen as a neutral party unaffiliated with either part of the territory.  Hoyt's term saw the opening of the Bisbee and Tombstone mining districts, construction of a dependable civilian telegraph system, and the connection of Yuma to California by the eastward building Southern Pacific Railroad.\nDespite the citizens of Arizona being generally happy with his performance as governor, Hoyt learned on June 12, 1878, that he had been replaced by John C. Frémont.  The outgoing governor initially wished to leave the territory but was convinced to remain on the job until the arrival of his replacement.\n\n\nIdaho Territory\nFollowing the appointment of Frémont as Governor of Arizona, Hoyt was offered the governorship of Idaho Territory.  He declined the nomination because he felt that Governor Mason Brayman was being improperly replaced.  Hoyt was also worried that the manner of his appointment and Senate confirmation would prejudice the citizens of Idaho Territory against him to the point that he could not effectively serve.  Hoyt instead wrote to Interior Secretary Shurz requesting a different assignment.  When a comparable position did not present itself, Hoyt temporarily left federal service.\n\n\nWashington\nAfter leaving office in Arizona, Hoyt traveled to Washington, D. C., and requested an appointment as a territorial chief justice. In January 1879, he was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory, a position Hoyt held until 1887. In May 1887, he became manager of the territory's largest bank and in 1889 he was President of Washington's constitutional convention.\nFollowing Washington's statehood, Hoyt was elected a justice of the Washington Supreme Court from 1889 until 1897. From 1898 till 1902, he was a regent for the University of Washington and a law professor at the school from 1902 till 1907. Hoyt died in Seattle, Washington, on August 27, 1926, and his ashes were interred in his family plot at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\nJohn Philo Hoyt at Find a Grave",

The congregation moved to 840 St. Clair Avenue West in 1937, beginning, as many congregations both Jewish and Christian have done, by constructing a basement space, today the social hall, but first used as a worship space. The building was finally completed in 1947.\nThe congregation moved to its present building, 470 Glencairn Avenue, in 1966. Around 2005, the mechitza in the building's sanctuary was raised; the wood-and-glass mechitza now rises 48 inches (120 cm) above the women's section. Around 2010, part of the building was renovated. In 2013, the sanctuary, main lobby and banquet hall were renovated, creating the Sharp Sanctuary.\nIn 1980, Machzikei B'nai Israel Synagogue (the Dovercourt Shul) merged with Shaarei Shomayim bringing with it the McCowan Street Cemetery.\n\n\nClergy\nSenior Rabbi: Rabbi Sam Taylor\nRabbi: Rabbi Elliot Diamond\nRabbi Jared Anstandig\nChazan: Rabbi Chaim Freund\nShamash and Baal Kriyah: Ralph Levine\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nClergy Page",

Due to boundary changes, all 60 seats on Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council were up for election.\nThe council remained in no overall control following the election, however the Labour Party, with the support of Horwich and Blackrod First and One Kearsley, were able to displace the Conservative Party's minority administration and install their group leader Nick Peel as the new leader of the council.\n\n\nBackground\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created a two-tier system of metropolitan counties and districts covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire starting in 1974. Bolton was a district of the Greater Manchester metropolitan county. The Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan counties, with metropolitan districts taking on most of their powers as metropolitan boroughs. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority was created in 2011 and began electing the mayor of Greater Manchester from 2017, which was given strategic powers covering a region coterminous with the former Greater Manchester metropolitan county.\nIn December 2022 the Local Government Boundary Commission for England made The Bolton (Electoral Changes) Order 2022, which officially abolished all 20 existing wards and established 20 new wards with new boundaries. Because of this change all 60 seats on the council, three per ward, were contested.\n\n\nPre- election composition\n\n\nElectoral process\nThe election took place using the plurality block voting system, a form of first-past-the-post voting, with each wards being represented by three councillors. The candidate with the most votes in each ward will serve a four year term ending in 2027, the second-placed candidate will serve a three year term ending in 2026 and the third-placed candidate will serve a one year term ending in 2024.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Bolton aged 18 or over were entitled to vote in the election. People who lived at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, were entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations took place from 07:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters were able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\n\n\nResults\n\nAsterisks (*) denote incumbent councillors seeking re-election.\n\n\nAstley Bridge\n\n\nBradshaw\n\n\nBreightmet\n\n\nBromley Cross\n\n\nFarnworth North\n\n\nFarnworth South\n\n\nGreat Lever\n\n\nHalliwell\n\n\nHeaton Lostock and Chew Moor\n\n\nHorwich North\n\n\nHorwich South and Blackrod\n\n\nHulton\n\n\nKearsley\n\n\nLittle Lever and Darcy Lever\n\n\nQueens Park and Central\n\n\nRumworth\n\n\nSmithills\n\n\nTonge with the Haulgh\n\n\nWesthoughton North and Hunger Hill\n\n\nWesthoughton South\n\n\nBy-elections\n\n\nKearsley\nA by-election was held on 16 November 2023 following the resignation of Paul Heslop on 2 October 2023.\n\n\nWesthoughton North and Hunger Hill\nA by-election will be held on 16 November 2023 following the resignation of Bernadette Eckersley-Fallon on 2 October 2023.\n\n\nReferences",

Both countries are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, NATO and the United Nations. There is a strong Greek community living in Canada.\n\n\nHistory\nGreek immigration to Canada began in 1843 when Greek migrants began arriving and settling in Montreal. Small numbers continued to arrive throughout the 19th century, often working as laborers, peddlers, or in the restaurant trade. By 1911, there were approximately 2,000 Greeks in Canada, a figure that increased during the early 20th century as migrants left Greece due to political instability, economic hardship, and military conflicts such as the Balkan Wars and World War I. Many settled in rapidly growing urban centres including Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, forming the foundations of Canadian Greek communities.\nBetween the 1920s and the 1930s, Greek-owned businesses — particularly diners, cafés, and confectioneries — became common, establishing a lasting cultural presence in Canadian cities. By 1941, over 5,000 Greek migrants resided in Canada.\nDuring World War II both nations fought alongside each other during the Italian Campaign. In 1942, Canada established diplomatic relations with the Greek government-in-exile.  Soon afterwards, the two nations opened diplomatic missions in each other's respective capitals.\nA much larger wave of Greek immigration took place after the war. From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, tens of thousands of Greeks arrived in Canada, driven by the devastation of the []Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949), economic challenges, and later the military junta (1967–1974). This period transformed Greek communities across the country, particularly in Toronto’s Greektown on the Danforth and Montreal’s Park Extension, which became major centres of Hellenic culture in North America.\nBy 1971, the Greek-origin population in Canada exceeded 100,000. Greek Canadians became active in business, trades, the arts, academia, and politics, while retaining strong cultural traditions through the establishment of Orthodox churches, language schools, newspapers, and cultural organizations.\nToday, over 243,000 Canadians claim Greek descent. The relationship between the two countries continues to be strengthened through trade, tourism, academic exchange, and cultural ties. In 2012, both nations celebrated 70 years since the establishment of mutual diplomatic relations, highlighting a history of cooperation and shared democratic values.\n\n\nList of agreements\n\nAgreement on Taxation of Shipping companies (1929)\nAgreement on Social Security (1981)\nAgreement on Regular Air Transport (1987)\nRevised Agreement on Regular Air Transport\nAgreement on the Avoidance of double taxation\n\n\nTrade relations\nCanada's main exports to Greece are paper, furs, machinery, vegetables, aircraft and pharmaceutical products. Canadian merchandise imports from Greece include preserved food products, aluminium, fats and oils, and fertilizers.\nGreece's business community with relations to Canada and Canadian companies operating in Greece set up the Hellenic-Canadian Chamber of Commerce in 1996, whose mission is to foster the development of business relations between the two countries in trade, finance, services and investments.\nBilateral merchandise trade between Canada and Greece totalled $256.3 million CAD in 2011. Canadian exports to Greece totaled $117 million CAD, led by furs, vegetables and pharmaceutical products. Greek exports to Canada totaled $186 million CAD in 2014, led by food products, fats, oil (not crude) and iron/steel.\n\n\nResident diplomatic missions\nCanada has an embassy in Athens.\nGreece has an embassy in Ottawa and consulates-general in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.\n\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of Canada\nForeign relations of Greece\nEmbassy of Greece in Ottawa\nGreek Canadians\nComprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nGreek Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the relation with Canada",

    "text": "Freegate is a software application developed by Dynamic Internet Technology (DIT) that enables internet users to view websites blocked by their governments. The program takes advantage of a range of proxy servers called Dynaweb. This allows users to bypass Internet firewalls that block web sites by using DIT's Peer-to-peer (P2P)-like proxy network system. FreeGate's anti-censorship capability is further enhanced by a new, unique encryption and compression algorithm in the versions of 6.33 and above. Dynamic Internet Technology estimates Freegate had 200,000 users in 2004. The maintainer and CEO of DIT is Bill Xia.\nFreegate was one of a dozen circumvention tools evaluated by a Freedom House-funded report based on user experience from China in 2010, which include Hotspot Shield, Tor, and Ultrasurf. The tool is free to download.\n\n\nDynaweb\nDynaWeb is a collection of anti-censorship services provided by Dynamic Internet Technology Inc. (DIT). DynaWeb is a web-based anti-censorship portal. Once users point their web browser at one of the DynaWeb URLs, a web page will be presented similar to the original, with most blocked websites as links. In addition, a user can type in any URL in the box on this page and DynaWeb will fetch the pages for him or her instantly. No software is needed, nor are any settings tweaked on a user's computer. Since the Chinese net police watch DynaWeb's portal websites closely and block them as soon as they identify them, DynaWeb must be dynamic. It has hundreds of mirror sites at any time, and each with a varying IP and DNS domain names to defeat IP blocking and DNS hijacking. On the backend, DynaWeb also has mechanisms to proactively monitor the blocking status of each of its mirror sites, and as soon as blocking is detected, it will change the IP and DNS domain name instantly.\nTo keep users connected to such a dynamic infrastructure, DynaWeb has a variety of channels to keep users updated. For example, a user can send a message to one of DynaWeb's instant messenger (IM) accounts, and will get an instant reply showing the newest addresses of DynaWeb portals. Similar things are being done with emails. By these many, dynamic channels, DynaWeb outsmarts any attempt to collect all DynaWeb addresses by the censors, because each user receives only a (different) subset of DynaWeb's addresses. Automatic blocking detection combined with quick reaction apparently frustrates the blocking efforts on the China side of the Great Firewall of China (GFW).\nDIT also releases a tiny piece of software, FreeGate, which directly taps into DynaWeb's backbone and keeps a user connected to the dynamic channels automatically.\nToday DynaWeb offers the widest range of options for users to access Internet freely, and supports more than 50 million web hits per day on average from Chinese users alone.\n\n\nCreation and funding\nDIT was founded in 2001 to provide email delivery services to China for US government agencies and NGOs. In 2002, DIT started to provide anti-censorship services under the framework of DynaWeb, and like UltraSurf, DynaWeb became a top contender of the GFW-penetration effort.\nFreegate was created by Falun Gong practitioners and has been financed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a US governmental agency. Freegate also receives funding from  Human Rights in China, which is also one of its clients and which receives some funding from the American non-profit organization  the National Endowment for Democracy. According to a US Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, the US government gave funding of $685,000 to Freegate in 2005.\n\n\nFeature\nFreegate Android VPN\n\n\nMalware reports\nIn 2004, the Financial Times, citing a member of staff at Symantec in mainland China, reported that Norton AntiVirus identified Freegate as a Trojan horse. There were initial fears that the reports may be a ploy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authorities to encourage removal of the software from computers, but it was soon delisted as a threat. Symantec explained that its detection was based on the software operating similarly to various Trojan horses, based on the use of proxies to penetrate firewalls used to block web sites, but that it had modified its detection to exclude Freegate.\nIn 2013, it was reported that \"pro-government electronic actors\" in Syria sent electronic messages to rebels encouraging them to download a file named Freegate which was claimed to be designed to help dissidents circumvent state surveillance agencies, but actually it was a malware and the intruder was able to monitor what the victims were typing on their computers and read or remove the files.\nIn August 2013 while Freegate was testing a new proxy program, some people thought it was a phishing attack. Reports from Iran said the users who used Freegate to pass Internet censorship in Iran, were led to a fake page instead of Facebook's main website. Freegate published a note saying they were testing a new proxy program, and the fake Facebook page was a tunnel. Although IT experts warned users to be careful with the tunnel link because it doesn't use SSL security so users' information is not encrypted.\n\n\nSee also\nInternet censorship circumvention\nUltrasurf\nGolden Shield Project\nInternet censorship\nInternet censorship in the People's Republic of China\nTor (anonymity network) – a free product sponsored by the Tor Project that implements onion routing where web connections are repeatedly encrypted and then sent through several proxies making tracing more difficult.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFreegate's main page\nDynamic Internet Technology, Inc.

The route was served by FTR articulated buses in an attempt to relieve traffic congestion and provide alternative transport to cars, before they were withdrawn in 2015 in favour of smaller-capacity buses.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Welsh Assembly Government provided £2.2m in funding to help launch the scheme, and the local bus operator First Cymru paid for the fleet at a cost of £300,000 per vehicle. The buses, built by Northern Ireland-based Wrightbus, each had 37 seats. Stops were placed about every 500 m and passengers paid for tickets on-board from a conductor rather than from the driver.\nThe bus ran along a route from Morriston Hospital to Singleton Hospital, via Morriston, Swansea railway station, Kingsway, Swansea bus station, Civic Centre and Swansea University. The off-peak journey time between Morriston Hospital and Swansea University was timetabled to take 50 minutes.\nAlterations were made to a number of roads to provide a dedicated bus lane. Orchard Street and The Kingsway were converted to a one-way streets for cars with a separate two-way bus lane. West Way was altered to accommodate a two-way bus lane and new access roads were developed near the Civic Centre. Further road developments included a bus lane along parts of Oystermouth Road and a bus bypass road past the Hafod area.\nPhase 1 of the road development scheme, for Orchard Street and Kingsway, was completed. The service between Morriston Hospital and Singleton started on bus route 4, using a single ftr vehicle, on 1 June 2009 with official launch of service in September 2009.\nCritics of the scheme attacked the disruption caused by roadworks to accommodate the vehicles and the impact of changes to the road network.\nOn 24 June 2015, First Cymru announced that it was to remove all FTR articulated buses from service on 28 August 2015, replacing them with standard single deck buses. Later in 2015, the dedicated two-way FTR bus lane on the Kingsway was removed and replaced by a standard one-way system, in response to high-profile accidents.\nSubsequently, three bendy buses were brought back into use, transferring students from the main Swansea University campus on Oystermouth Road to the new Bay Campus.\n\n\nSee also\nList of guided busways and BRT systems in the United Kingdom\nTransport in Wales\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nFirst Group – ftrmetro Swansea (official site of operator)\nCity and County of Swansea – Swansea metro project\nVideo of Ftr Metro buses in Swansea in August, 2015",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=23359426",
    "text": "The Quino checkerspot (Euphydryas editha quino) is a butterfly native to southern California and northwestern Baja California. It is a subspecies of the common Edith's checkerspot (Euphydryas editha) and the second such subspecies to be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThis taxon, like many others, has undergone several changes in nomenclature and classification. It was originally described as Melitaea quino in 1863 by Hans Hermann Behr, based on specimens collected by Dr. Cooper in San Diego, and was named after Eusebio Kino, or \"Padre Quino, the first European that ever succeeded in erecting a permanent settlement in California, and at the same time contributed very considerably by his learned writings to a more exact knowledge of these then scarcely discovered regions.\" In 1929 it was reduced to a subspecies of Euphydryas chalcedona. In 1998 it was concluded through Behr's 1863 description that it should be classified as E. editha, not E. chalcedona.  Moreover, the subspecies E. editha wrighti was demoted to a junior synonym for E. editha quino.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nAppearance\nA member of the brush-footed butterfly family, Nymphalidae, the Quino checkerspot is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 3 cm. The dorsal wing surfaces are a colorful checkerboard of brown, red and yellow spots. The Quino differs from other E. editha subspecies in that its spots tend to be a darker red.\nIt also differentiates itself through its size and larval and pupal phenotypes. The ventral side of the butterfly are dominated by a checkered red and cream pattern. Its abdomen has red stripes across the dorsal side. After a second molt, the Quino checkerspot is recognized by the dark black coloration and row of 8 to 9 orange tubercles on their back. Before the larvae first molt they are mostly yellowish. After first molt and before their second molt they are gray with black markings. The pupae are mottled black on a blue-gray background.\nThe Quino checkerspot is easily confused in the field by inexperienced butterfly searchers. It is generally confused with three other co-occurring butterfly species, the Chalcedon or variable checkerspot (Euphydryas chalcedona), Gabb's checkerspot (Chlosyne gabbii) and Wright's checkerspot (Thessalia leonira wrighti).\n\n\nLife cycle\nThe life cycle of the Quino checkerspot closely mirrors that of the close Bay checkerspot. They share the same host plant and similar chronology of developmental stages. Sometimes, organisms molt seven times before reaching adulthood. There are typically only one generation of adults every year. The flight period is between February through May.\n\n\nHost plants\nFemale butterflies only lay eggs on species they recognize as host plants. The larval food sources for the Quino checkerspot butterfly are:\n\ndwarf plantain (Plantago erecta)\nwhite snapdragon (Sairocarpus coulterianus)\nwoolly plantain (Plantago patagonica)\nChinese houses (Collinsia concolor)\nLarval Quino checkerspot butterfly may also use other species of native plantain (Plantago sp.), as well as purple owl’s clover (Castilleja exserta) and thread-leaved bird's beak (Cordylanthus rigidus), as secondary host plants. The use of purple owl's clover and thread-leaved bird’s beak is rare. These species alone do not support Quino breeding.\n\n\nHabitat\nThe obvious factor in the decline of the Quino checkerspot is urban development. Much of the historic scrub land that it occupied, much like the Mission blue butterfly, also endangered, has been built over. The persisting habitat faces other threats. Invasive species, in the form of non-native plant life and overgrazing are just two of the hurdles facing the recovery of the Quino checkerspot. Today, there are eight populations of the Quino known.\n\n\nRange\nHabitat declined and, thus, distribution and population of the Quino checkerspot has been greatly reduced during the last 100 years, likely around 75%. Nearly all of the blame lies in agricultural and urban development in southern California. The other impactors to the decline include non-native grasses and fire suppression practices as well as grazing. The Quino checkerspot became the second subspecies of Euphydryas editha to be listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The first was the Bay checkerspot.\nCurrently, the Quino checkerspot is only found in a very few locales: Western Riverside County, southern San Diego County along California State Route 125 and northern Baja California, Mexico. The animal's historic range once included much of coastal California south of Ventura County as well as the inland valleys south of the Tehachapi Mountains. Regardless, more than 75% of the butterfly's original range has been lost. The range loss translates directly into population decline. Quino checkerspot butterfly populations appear to have decreased by more than 95% range wide.\n\n\nImpact of barrier construction along Mexico-United States border\nAmerican President Donald Trump proposed expansion of the border wall between Mexico and the US to prevent illegal entry by foreign nationals through Mexico into the US during his presidential campaign and upon being elected. The construction of additional border walls in new locations would likely have adverse effects on many species, including the Quino checkerspot. Because the range of the subspecies is so reduced and threatened already, the construction of a wall would separate the organisms in Mexico and the US, which would reduce the genetic diversity between the populations. In addition, the proposed wall could harm the native vegetation the butterflies need and may spread invasive species in areas disturbed by the construction.\n\n\nSee also\nNational Butterfly Center\n\n\nReferences",

Both his parents, Ferdinand Rahmer and Charlotte Landshut, were murdered in the Holocaust.\nBetween 1943 and 1947 Rayner served in the British Army. In October 1947 he took up an open scholarship in modern languages that he had previously won at Emmanuel College, Cambridge five years earlier. In his second year he switched to Moral Science which comprised philosophy, logic, ethics and psychology and graduated in 1950 with First Class Honours. In his third year Rayner specialised in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac and Semitic Epigraphy.  In his sixth year Rayner began working as a research student on a thesis about Maimonides' conception of Revelation.\n\n\nCareer\nRayner was ordained in the Liberal Jewish ministry on 21 June 1953 and served the South London Liberal Synagogue, in Streatham until 1957. He then worked at St John's Wood Liberal Synagogue until in 1963 he left for Cincinnati, Ohio, in the United States. Rayner had been invited to the Hebrew Union College to take up a graduate fellowship. He returned to the UK to serve as Minister at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in June 1965.\nHe wrote books on diverse topics including halakha, marriage, ethics, Zionism, theology and Jewish-Christian relations. He also gave a large number of sermons. He was voted one of the best preachers in Britain by Harpers and Queen magazine in 1976. During the late 1960s and 1970s Rayner made several appearances on national television and radio.\nWorking with American Rabbi Chaim Stern, Rayner was the main liturgist of British Liberal Judaism. They compiled the Sabbath and Festivals and High Holidays liturgy used by all Liberal Synagogues, Service of the Heart and Gates of Repentance, continuing their editorial partnership to co-edit Siddur Lev Chadash. He was the teacher of liturgy at Leo Baeck College in London.\nHe was an active participant in inter-faith work as co-chairman of the London Society of Christians and Jews. As a result of this work in 1993 he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\nHis thought emphasises the importance of ethics and the need for a more halakhic approach to Progressive Judaism.\n\n\nPersonal life\nRayner married Jane Heilbronn in 1955 and had two sons and a daughter together.\nOn 19 September 2005 he died, at home, at the age of 81, after a long illness.\n\n\nWorks\nThe Practices of Liberal Judaism (1958).\nService of the Heart (1967)\nGates of Repentance (1973)\nGuide to Jewish Marriage (1975).

    "text": "The 2008 Kentucky Democratic presidential primary took place May 20, 2008, and had 51 delegates at stake. The winner in each of Kentucky's six congressional districts was awarded all of that district's delegates, totaling 34. Another 17 delegates were awarded to the statewide winner, Hillary Clinton. The 51 delegates represented Kentucky at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Nine other unpledged delegates, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.\nKentucky had a closed primary, meaning it was open only to registered Democrats. Those wishing to participate in the primary had to register as Democrats 28 days prior to the primary.\nThere were 3,545 precincts in 120 counties with 1,629,845 Democratic registered voters, and the turnout was 43.0% of the registered voters.\n\n\nPolls\n\nAccording to a poll from Rasmussen Reports taken before the primary, Hillary Clinton led Barack Obama 56-31 percent in Kentucky with 13 percent undecided.\nAs of April 30, two superdelegates had pledged support for Obama while three had endorsed Clinton.\n\n\nResults\n\nPrimary Date: May 20, 2008\nNational Pledged Delegates Determined: 51\n\n\nAnalysis\nHillary Clinton won a decisive two-to-one victory in Kentucky, a state located in the Appalachian region which had many of the demographics in her favor. According to exit polls, 89 percent of voters in the Kentucky Democratic Primary were white and they opted for Clinton by a margin of 72–23 compared to the 9 percent of African American voters who backed Obama by a margin of 90–7. Clinton won all age groups, all socioeconomic/income classes and educational attainment ladders of voters. Registered Democrats, who comprised 84 percent of the turnout, backed Clinton by a margin of 68–30. She also won all ideological groups. Regarding religion, Clinton dominated all major denominations by two-to-one margins, including Protestants which backed her 66–28, Roman Catholics supported her 66–31, and other Christians favored Clinton by a margin of 66–30. It was a conclusive landslide victory for Clinton.\nClinton performed extraordinarily well throughout the state of Kentucky, carrying all but two counties: Jefferson County, which contains Louisville, and Fayette County which contains Lexington. Her best performance was in Southeast Kentucky, located in the heart of Appalachia, an area made up of less educated, lower-income, working-class whites. In fact, it was here where Clinton received her largest margin of victory in a county nationwide: Magoffin County gave Clinton 92.98 percent of the vote while Obama only received a meager 5.00 percent.\nKentucky was another state that highlighted Barack Obama's growing problem among working-class whites, a swing voting bloc also referred to as Reagan Democrats who Clinton claimed were crucial to Democrats winning back the White House. Exit polls in Kentucky supported Clinton's claim – of Kentucky voters who voted for Clinton, only one-third of voters said they would vote for Obama should he become the nominee while another one-third said they would vote for presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain and another one-third said they would not vote at all.\n\n\nSee also\nDemocratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008\nKentucky Republican primary, 2008\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Eileen Southgate is a British biologist who mapped the complete nervous system of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), together with John White, Nichol Thomson, and Sydney Brenner. The work, done largely by hand-tracing thousands of serial section electron micrographs, was the first complete nervous system map of any animal and it helped establish C. elegans as a model organism.  Among other projects carried out as a laboratory assistant at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC-LMB), Southgate contributed to work on solving the structure of hemoglobin with Max Perutz and John Kendrew, and investigating the causes of sickle cell disease with Vernon Ingram.\n\n\nCareer\nSouthgate spent her entire career as a laboratory technician at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB). She began working there in 1956, at the age of 16, after being given the option by a career officer who came to her school.\nSouthgate initially worked for Max Perutz and John Kendrew studying hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the bloodstream, and the related protein myoglobin. Among other jobs, she was tasked with helping prepare hemoglobin and myoglobin for x-ray crystallography, a technique used to determine the structures of crystallized molecules such as proteins, based on how they interact with x-ray beams to produce a diffraction pattern. Thanks in part to Southgate's assistance, Perutz and Kendrew solved crystal structures of hemoglobin and myoglobin, winning them the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry for \"for being the first to successfully identify the structures of complex proteins.\" Southgate carried out additional research on hemoglobin with Vernon Ingram, assisting with his research on sickle cell disease, a genetic disease in which a mutation in hemoglobin causes it to form chains (polymerize) and block blood vessels.\nIn 1962, Southgate briefly worked with Reuben Lebermen on his studies of plant viruses; she grew the plants, which were then infected by viruses he wanted to study, then she harvested them and purified out the viral particles. She then went to work for Tony Stretton, where after initial work involved helping him investigate β-galactosidase, she aided in his exploration of the nervous system of the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides using light microscopy. When Stretton left for the University of Wisconsin in 1971, Southgate went to work with John White, who was then a PhD student under Sydney Brenner.\nBrenner was interested in establishing C. elegans as a model organism at MRC LMB, and using it to study the nervous system and its connection to genetics. In pursuit of this goal, he wanted to obtain a complete map of the C. elegans nervous system, and Southgate was tasked with helping John White and electron microscopist Nichol Thomas achieve this. C. elegans is around 100 times smaller than Ascaris (~1mm compared to ~10 cm), so they had to use a higher-resolution imaging technique, electron microscopy. Nichol Thomson helped prepare thousands of serial transverse sections of C. elegans worms, which Southgate imaged, printed out, and traced. She labeled the cell bodies, processes, and connections in each image and worked with John White to trace each neuron's journey through the worm. The process took close to 15 years and culminated in a 340-page-long paper published in 1986 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Officially titled \"The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,\" it is commonly referred to by its running title, \"The Mind of a Worm.\" They identified 302 neurons in the hermaphrodite C. elegans worm, which they grouped into 118 classes, and they discovered that the layout and connections were virtually the same in genetically-identical worms. They found close to 8,000 total synapses (cell to cell connections) which included around 2000 neuromuscular junctions, 5000 chemical synapses & 600 gap junctions (where communication is through electrical signals). Having the map helped establish C. elegans as a model organism and allowed for further research into neural circuitry and the genes involved in establishing C. elegans' neural layout. Additionally, it aided researchers in studying analogous nerves other nematodes, including Ascaris, which, due to its larger size, is more amenable to electrophysiological investigation. Southgate retired in 1993.\n\n\nBibliography\nWhite, John Graham; Southgate, Eileen; Thomson, J.

    "text": "A skeleton clock is any clock or wristwatch, though typically mechanical in nature, in which the parts that usually conceal the inner workings of the mechanism have been removed or significantly modified so as to display these inner parts.\nIt is considered to be a showcase design and intentionally exposes to plain view the various gears, wheels and springs within the movement itself.  There is no official definition of a skeleton clock per se, but a major portion of the main parts of the timepiece should be openly visible from the front of the clock and most often from the back as well in order for it to be considered and accepted as a skeleton clock.  The parts most commonly showcased by a skeleton design are those exhibiting either the most movement or the most attractive design.  These may include, but are not limited to the escapement, balance wheel and balance spring, mainspring, and tourbillon.  Generally there is either no dial present in a skeleton clock, the dial is clear, or it has been limited to a ring around the edge of the case to provide a mounting surface for the hour markers.  In the case of skeleton wristwatches, the back will usually be made of sapphire crystal or another clear material that affords easy examination of the parts protected within both from the front and from behind.\n\nIn addition, several authors have published construction manuals on skeleton clocks in clockmaking and model engineering journals in the UK and USA, several of which (UK) have ceased operations. However, the best known of these authors had the manuals reprinted in comb bound format and these are still available (2012). John Wilding in the UK wrote manuals on Large Wheel, Elegant Scroll Frame, Chrystal Wheel and Scissors. Bill Smith in the US wrote on Lyre, Grasshopper and Epicyclic skeleton clocks.\nThe Nomenclature for Skeleton clocks is somewhat different from for cased clocks, for example, part of the brass framework of a tall clock is called a plate, for skeletons, a frame.\nFrames of British skeleton clocks are listed by Roberts: Rafter (Including inverted “Y” frame), Gothic, Scroll (including lyre), Floral (ivy leaf and arabesque) and Architectural.\nThe photos are of some relatively simple commercial skeleton clocks with architectural frames, specifically of cathedrals in Great Britain: Litchfield and York Minster. The last is based on the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England. Maker is unknown, all have passing strike.\nFrance: Rafter (especially inverted “Y” a typical French design), Glass and Keyhole (Roberts’ term) as well as ornate designs.\nThe Escapement of a skeleton clock is typically different from one used in a tall case, mantle and wall clock. In Great Britain, anchor (recoil), dead beat, balance wheel and tic tac. In France, pinwheel, coup perdu, (both dead beat), crossbeat or variant of Dutretre’s escapement.\nThe motive power is typically with a spring and, in Britain Fusee, or, in France, a Going Barrel although weight-driven clocks were made in these small sizes with durations up to a month usually with two weights wound around the same barrel. British clocks sometimes used a Remontoire to power the strike. Tall case clocks most often had a time and strike train, later a chime train was added. A skeleton clock would utilize a passing strike that struck just once on the hour.\nNowadays the term skeleton clock is also used to describe modern skeleton clocks for wall. Unlike the 18th century skeleton clocks most of those contemporary timepieces are powered by the battery-operated quartz mechanism. The quartz movement used is a low cost, mass produced, plastic mechanism of no decorative value. It is disguised within the clock’s body therefore skeleton design is expressed in the open form of the clock face. Modern skeleton wall clocks have no visible back-plate. The wall background can be seen between the numbers or framework. Majority of the timepieces have minimalist design that can be easily manufactured on a large scale. This makes them inexpensive and popular. Higher valued timepieces with artistic value are usually handmade of wood or wrought iron.\n\n\nReferences\n\nSource for construction manuals by England's John Wilding\nSource for construction manuals by America's Bill Smith\nSource for skeleton clocks for wall by Peak Art\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nRoberts, Derek.

However, he is best known for his role as the Slovak ambassador to Hungary during the Second World War.\n\n\nEarly life\nSpišiak was born on 12 January 1901 in České Brezovo. He graduated from the Charles University in Prague faculty of law. From 1 April 1929, he worked as the legal representative of Tatra banka.\n\n\nAmbassador to Hungary\nFrom 1 January 1940 to 1 October 1944, he was the Slovak ambassador to Hungary, for which he received no remuneration. In November 1939 at a meeting in Budapest, he told the United States ambassador that Slovakia enjoyed considerable independence under German protection. Spišiak believed that a German victory would be disastrous for its allies in southeastern Europe, but he did not think that it was a likely outcome. In early 1941 in a meeting with Soviet diplomat Nikolai Sharonov, he predicted the German invasion of the Soviet Union before it occurred, but said that Slovakia preferred friendly relations between Moscow and Budapest.\nFollowing the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, he issued letters of protection to 3,000 Slovak Jews who had fled to Hungary in 1942, allowing them to legally cross the border and return home. Spišiak also helped Poles in Hungary by providing them with false Slovak papers enabling them to enter Slovakia.\n\n\nAfter the war\nAfter the Siege of Budapest ended in a Soviet victory, he was arrested by SMERSH on 8 February 1945 and deported to Moscow. Following his arrest, he claimed that he had been working for the Czechoslovak government-in-exile throughout the war. He was allowed to return to Czechoslovakia in order to give evidence against the leadership of the wartime Slovak State. A criminal case was opened against him in 1947 but dropped later that year, as a result of his testimony against the Slovak State government and a recommendation by the Slovak resistance movement.\nSpišiak returned to his position at Tatra banka and also lectured at Comenius University, while writing books on business law. He helped to organize the merger of Tatra banka into Slovenská banka and later into Štátna banka československá. Following his retirement in 1961 (even though he would have preferred to keep working), Spišiak lived on a pension until his death in Bratislava on 14 November 1981.\nSpišiak's memoir, Spomienky z Budapešti 1939 - 1944 (Memories of Budapest 1939–1944) was published by Slovak Academic Press in 2010.\n\n\nReferences",

The company and others were accused of routinely submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests on blood samples that physicians had never ordered. In addition, charges for the tests billed to the government were significantly higher than what the company charged private insurers.

The attack resulted in delays, but no data was believed to have been stolen. The malware was blocked on the network by midnight on July 14, 2018.\n\n\nFaulty paternity tests\nLabcorp has been criticized over faulty paternity tests, many of which have resulted in lawsuits. The most notable case was the 2005 false accusation of Washington hairdresser Andre Chreky, who spent $200,000 and years in court proving, despite a false-positive test, that he was not the father. In the trial, it was determined that only five people at Labcorp reviewed data and made paternity determinations, including during 10 hour shifts that required making determinations every 4 minutes.\n\n\nSharing of patient data\nIn 2024, Labcorp faced a class action lawsuit for allowing Google to collect confidential patient information such as appointments made and website login details.\n\n\nLabor concerns\nEmployees have criticized the company's productivity goals, in which they say volume and speed of work done is prioritized over quality. Labs face staffing shortages and employees say they are overworked.\nLabcorp has been criticized for its process of having all employees terminated upon hospital laboratory management acquisitions, and making them reapply with LabCorp, thereby losing accrued employee benefits, including employee eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) in the case of non-profit hospitals.\nIn 2024, Labcorp stated that its goal is to \"operate the company in a non-union environment.\" After Labcorp became the manager of laboratories of Legacy Health, outsourced laboratory personnel unionized with the Oregon Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals.\n\n\nAircraft\nLabcorp (ICAO: SKQ, call sign: SKYLAB) utilizes a fleet of 12 Pilatus PC-12 and a single Pilatus PC-24 aircraft on nightly runs from Burlington for use on the East Coast. Prior to the acquisition of PC-12 aircraft Labcorp utilized seven PA-31-350s.\n\n\nNotable employees\nMark Elliott Brecher, retired Chief Medical Officer of LabCorp, Emeritus Professor University of North Carolina\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nBusiness data for Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings: \nLabcorp Profile at Wikinvest",

    "title": "2009 Burlington, Vermont mayoral election",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=23533217",
    "text": "The 2009 Burlington mayoral election was the second mayoral election since the city's 2005 change to instant-runoff voting (IRV), also known as ranked-choice voting (RCV), after the 2006 mayoral election. In the 2009 election, incumbent Burlington mayor (Bob Kiss) won reelection as a member of the Vermont Progressive Party, defeating Kurt Wright in the final round with 48% of the vote (51.5% excluding exhausted ballots).\nThe election created controversy as a result of several election pathologies. Unlike the city's first IRV election three years prior, Kiss was neither the plurality winner nor the majority-preferred candidate (Democrat Andy Montroll), and Kiss was declared winner as a result of 750 votes cast against his candidacy (ranking him last). The election is a well-known example of a center squeeze, a kind of spoiler effect in IRV that favors more-extreme candidates over more-moderate ones.\nThe controversy surrounding the election ended in a successful 2010 citizen's initiative which repealed IRV by a vote of 52% to 48%.\n\n\nBackground\n\nSince Bernie Sanders' election as mayor in 1981, his allies and the Vermont Progressive Party had continuously held the mayoralty except for two years. The number of registered voters in Burlington rose from 24,991 in 2006, to 33,200 in 2009.\nThe city of Burlington, Vermont, approved IRV for use in mayoral elections with a 64% vote in 2005, at a time when IRV was used only in a few local elections in the United States. The 2006 Burlington, Vermont mayoral election was decided by two rounds of IRV tallying, selecting candidate Bob Kiss of the Vermont Progressive Party (VPP). In the election, Kiss prevailed over Democrat Hinda Miller and Republican Kevin Curley. With his election Kiss became the second member of the VPP to be elected to the office after Peter Clavelle.\n\n\nNominations\n\n\nProgressive\nKiss officially launched his campaign on January 7, 2009.\n\n\nDemocratic\nOn December 3, 2008, the Democrats unanimously selected to give their nomination to Montroll, who was nominated by Representative Johannah Leddy Donovan. Montroll's website was hacked two times during the campaign to feature materials about Turkey and the statements \"Oooo Yeah\" and \"DumansaL Was Here\" before being signed by \"White Devil\".\n\n\nRepublican\nKurt Wright, president of the city council, announced his campaign on December 11, 2008.\n\n\nOther\nDan Smith, the son of Peter Plympton Smith, announced that he would run as an independent on December 2, 2008. His cousin Emily served as his campaign manager.\n\n\nCampaign\nDuring the campaign raised $50,986 and spent $51,193, Wright raised $39,365 and spent $34,585, Montroll raised $24,202 and spent $23,021, and Kiss raised $20,265 and spent $19,946. In the last ten days of the campaign Wright raised and spent more than his opponents. Kiss received $5,000 from family members, Montroll received $4,875, Smith received $3,800, and Wright received nothing.\n5 of the 7 city councilors up for reelection declined to run, including Montroll and Wright who ran for mayor instead. The Republicans lost a seat while the Democrats gained one resulting in a composition of 7 Democrats, 3 Progressives, 2 Republicans, and 2 independents.\n\n\nResults\nA recount was requested by Wright, but he withdrew his demand on March 10, after 43% of the votes were recounted.\n\nThe elimination rounds were as follows:\n\n\nAnalysis\nFairVote touted the 2009 election as one of its major success stories, with IRV helping the city avoid the cost of a traditional runoff election (which likely would not have changed who won). They also argued IRV prevented a spoiler effect that would have occurred under plurality. \nLater analyses stated the race was spoiled, however, with Wright acting as a spoiler pulling moderate votes from Montroll, who would have defeated Kiss in a one-on-one race. (However, when Montroll's votes were transferred, they went largely to Kiss, not to Wright.)\nFairVote also claimed the election as a success story because 99.9% of voters filled out at least one preference on their ranked-choice ballot. 16.5% of voters only selected one candidate, with 28.5% of Wright's and 29% of Kiss' voters doing so. 37.8% of the voters did not select a third candidate. 7% of ballots did not rank either of the candidates in the last round, leaving them unrepresented.\nSome mathematicians and voting theorists criticized the election results as revealing several pathologies associated with instant-runoff voting, noting that Kiss was elected as a result of 750 votes cast against him (ranking Kiss in last place).\nSeveral electoral reform advocates branded the election a failure after Kiss was elected despite 54% of voters voting for Montroll over Kiss, violating the principle of majority rule.\n\n\nTournament matrix\nThe results of every possible one-on-one election can be completed as follows:\n\nThis leads to an overall preference ranking of:\n\nMontroll – defeats all candidates below, including Kiss (4,064 to 3,476)\nKiss – defeats all candidates below, including Wright (4,313 to 4,061)\nWright – defeats all candidates below, including Smith (3,971 to 3,793)\nSmith – defeats Simpson (5,570 to 721) and the write-in candidates\nMontroll was therefore preferred over Kiss by 54% of voters, preferred over Wright by 56% of voters, over Smith by 60%, and over Simpson by 91% of voters.\n\n\nHypothetical results under various voting systems\nBecause all ballots were fully released, it is possible to reconstruct the winners under other voting methods. While Wright would have won under plurality, Kiss won under IRV, and if they voted again the same way that they marked their preferential ballot, he would have won under a two-round vote or a traditional nonpartisan blanket primary.\nMontroll, being the Condorcet winner, would have won if the ballots were counted using ranked pairs (or any other Condorcet method). Analyses suggested Montroll also would have won under most rated voting methods, including score voting, approval voting, majority judgment, or STAR voting.\n\n\nEffect on IRV in Burlington\n\nThere was post-election controversy regarding the IRV method, and in March 2010 a citizen's initiative resulted in the repeal of IRV in Burlington. The initially \"stagnant\" repeal campaign drew renewed interest as Kiss became embroiled in a series of controversies. In December 2009, a group called \"One Person, One Vote\", made up of Republicans and Democrats unhappy with the election outcome, held a press conference to announce that they had collected enough signatures for an initiative to repeal IRV. According to a local columnist, the vote was a referendum on Kiss's mayoralty; Kiss had allegedly become a \"lame duck\" because of a scandal relating to Burlington Telecom and other local issues. However, in an interview with Vermont Public Radio, Kiss disputed that claim, and those gathering signatures for the repeal stated that it was specifically a rejection of IRV itself.\nLocals argued the system was convoluted, turned the 2009 election into a \"gambling game\" by disqualifying Montroll for having won too many votes, and \"eliminated the most popular moderate candidate and elected an extremist\".\nDavid Zuckerman stated that the success of the repeal was due to Kiss' unpopularity and scandals in his administration. Rob Richie, the executive director of FairVote, said that ranked choice would have been more popular had it been used for the city council as well.\nThe IRV repeal initiative in March 2010 won 52% to 48%. It earned a majority of the vote in only two of the city's seven wards, but the vote in those 2009 strongholds for Kurt Wright was lopsided against IRV. Republican Governor Jim Douglas signed the repeal into law in April 2010, saying \"Voting ought to be transparent and easy to understand, and affects the will of the voters in a direct way. I'm glad the city has agreed to a more traditional process.\"\nThe repeal reverted the system back to a 40% rule that requires a top-two runoff if no candidate exceeds 40% of the vote. Had the 2009 election occurred under these rules, Kiss and Wright would have advanced to the runoff. If the same voters had participated in the runoff as in the first election and not changed their preferences, Kiss would have won the runoff.\nThe following decade saw continuing controversy about voting methods in Burlington. In 2011, for example, an initiative effort to increase the winning threshold from the 40% plurality to a 50% majority failed by 58.5% to 41.5%, while in 2019, instant-runoff voting was once again proposed for Burlington by Councilor Jack Hanson but went unapproved by the Charter Change Committee for the March 2020 ballot.\nOne year later, in July 2020, the city council voted 6–5 in support of a measure to reinstate IRV, but it was vetoed by Mayor Miro Weinberger the following month. The council then amended the measure to apply only to the council itself, which the Mayor accepted, and on March 2, 2021, Burlington voters voted in favor of IRV for its city council by 64% to 36% (8,914 to 4,918). The charter change required approval by the Vermont legislature, which enacted it in May of 2022, and which the governor allowed to become law without his signature. The council in September 2022, the voters in March 2023, and the legislature in May 2023 approved the expansion of use of IRV for mayor, school commissioners, and ward election officers, with first use in March 2024.\n\n\nEndorsements\n\n\nSee also\nCenter squeeze\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\"IRV By The Numbers\".

    "summary": "The 2009 Burlington mayoral election was the second mayoral election since the city's 2005 change to instant-runoff voting (IRV), also known as ranked-choice voting (RCV), after the 2006 mayoral election. In the 2009 election, incumbent Burlington mayor (Bob Kiss) won reelection as a member of the Vermont Progressive Party, defeating Kurt Wright in the final round with 48% of the vote (51.5% excluding exhausted ballots).\nThe election created controversy as a result of several election pathologies. Unlike the city's first IRV election three years prior, Kiss was neither the plurality winner nor the majority-preferred candidate (Democrat Andy Montroll), and Kiss was declared winner as a result of 750 votes cast against his candidacy (ranking him last). The election is a well-known example of a center squeeze, a kind of spoiler effect in IRV that favors more-extreme candidates over more-moderate ones.\nThe controversy surrounding the election ended in a successful 2010 citizen's initiative which repealed IRV by a vote of 52% to 48%.",

A1-CM Furia UAVs are used in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nCapabilities\nAccording to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, its latest modification, the A1-CMX, is able to correlate and pinpoint visual map data with GPS and GLONASS coordinates in realtime, and can reliably beam a laser target designator up to 7 km away onto an area of 2x2m - even in harsh weather conditions. The CMX version was dubbed a new \"Wunderwaffe\" in the fight against Russia due to its ability to give final guidance correction to the M982 Excalibur artillery shells.\n\n\nDesign\nAirframe is based on the RVJet RC plane by RangeVideo. \nAnalysis of destroyed versions that floated on Russian social-network VK at the end of August 2023 showed custom FPGA and NVIDIA chips on tailor-made motherboards and daughterboards, expensive industrial grade ball-bearings, multiple 830/905nm laser range finders and laser designators as well as precision electric motors and stepper-motors from Northrop Grumman Corporation, Honeywell International Inc., L-3 Technologies, and ABB.\nFeatures included multi-band long-range digital radio, backup gyroscopes, designated chipsets for satellite reception and a secondary high-resolution IR camera. Almost all electronic parts were enclosed in individual hardened shock-proof casings with Mu-metal EMI and RFI shielding. Members of the Russian hacker-group Killnet commented that they were \"severely impressed\" and attributed \"high quality\" and \"an obvious technological advantage\".\nThe A1-CMX is claimed to have assisted in precision strikes to destroy over 43 Russian tanks and 181 assorted armored and support vehicles during the first half of the Counter-Offensive in the Robotyne region alone. It was described by General Yevhen Moisiuk as an \"absolute game changer“ that \"leads to spotted targets getting destroyed in under 15 minutes at a 95% probability“.\n\n\nReferences",

It has a natural shivalinga in the cave, which became a place of reverence for the local people. \nIt is also believed that this was used as a residence by Dronacharya, the teacher of the Pandavas and Kauravas in the Hindu epic Mahabharata; the cave is called Drona Cave after him. Dronacharya's wife Kalyani was unable to breastfeed their newborn son Ashwatthama. As Dronacharya was unable to afford a cow or cow's milk, Ashwatthama prayed to Shiva, who then fed him milk dripping from the shivalinga in the cave.\n\n\nOperations\nThe temple is popular as both a tourist destination and a pilgrimage site in Dehradun. Pilgrims bathe in the nearby sulphur-water springs before entering the temple.\nDrona Cave, surrounded by hills, is a popular site for picnickers from Dehradun and nearby districts.\n\n\nEvents\nEvery year during Mahashivratri, a fair is held in Tapkeshwar Mahadev temple for over a week. On this day, Shiva devotees come here from far and wide. On the day of Mahashivratri, the temple is decorated with lighting and flowers. Mahaprasad is organized for the devotees visiting here by the temple trust. On this auspicious occasion, the form of Mahadev \"Aghori\" is also seen here. Who come from Kedarnath and Badrinath. Apart from Mahashivratri, devotees also visit this temple for darshan in the month of Shravan. This temple is open every day from 6 am to 7 pm, but in Shravan the temple is kept open day and night, so that all the devotees can get darshan of Mahadev ji.\nThe temple hold a large festival on Shivratri.

She performed extensively in Egypt, Lebanon, and Europe, which helped introduce Egyptian belly dance to global audiences.\n\n\nCareer\nMona El Said rose to prominence in Cairo during the 1970s and 1980s, performing at major venues such as the Nile Hilton and Sheraton Hotels. She became a headline performer at elite nightclubs, securing her place among Egypt’s most celebrated dancers. Her fame extended internationally with performances in Lebanon, Europe, and London's top cabarets.\nIn the 1980s, Mona El Said’s performances were among the first Egyptian Raqs Sharqi shows to be widely available on videotape, helping to transmit Egyptian dance culture globally. She later participated in prestigious international dance festivals, including the Mediterranean Delight Festival in Greece.\nAfter living abroad for several years, Mona returned to Egypt in the 1990s and continued to perform at elite venues.\n\n\nDance philosophy\nMona El Said emphasized the emotional and musical connection in her dance. She was renowned for embodying \"dalaʿ,\" a sweet yet confident sensuality expressed through subtle shoulder movements, facial expressions, long flowing hair, and sincere musical interpretation.\nShe believed that authentic dance required not only technical skill but also feeling and connection to the music. As a mentor, she inspired dancers such as Camelia to prioritize emotional expression over rigid choreography.\n\n\nStyle\nMona El Said’s style combined technical precision with improvisational freedom. She integrated graceful upper body isolations, hip work, intricate footwork, and emotional storytelling into her performances. Her style reflected both classical Egyptian raqs sharqi traditions and the evolving popular music influences of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\nLegacy\nMona El Said remains a major influence on both Egyptian and international belly dancers. Her early videotapes contributed to the globalization of Egyptian belly dance culture, and her performances continue to inspire dancers worldwide.

    "text": "Bresenham's line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in historically common computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm, and one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. An extension to the original algorithm called the midpoint circle algorithm may be used for drawing circles.\nWhile algorithms such as Wu's algorithm are also frequently used in modern computer graphics because they can support antialiasing, Bresenham's line algorithm is still important because of its speed and simplicity. The algorithm is used in hardware such as plotters and in the graphics chips of modern graphics cards. It can also be found in many software graphics libraries. Because the algorithm is very simple, it is often implemented in either the firmware or the graphics hardware of modern graphics cards.\nThe label \"Bresenham\" is used today for a family of algorithms extending or modifying Bresenham's original algorithm.\n\n\nHistory\nBresenham's line algorithm is named after Jack Elton Bresenham who developed it in 1962 at IBM. In 2001 Bresenham wrote:\n\nI was working in the computation lab at IBM's San Jose development lab. A Calcomp plotter had been attached to an IBM 1401 via the 1407 typewriter console. [The algorithm] was in production use by summer 1962, possibly a month or so earlier. Programs in those days were freely exchanged among corporations so Calcomp (Jim Newland and Calvin Hefte) had copies. When I returned to Stanford in Fall 1962, I put a copy in the Stanford comp center library.\nA description of the line drawing routine was accepted for presentation at the 1963 ACM national convention in Denver, Colorado. It was a year in which no proceedings were published, only the agenda of speakers and topics in an issue of Communications of the ACM. A person from the IBM Systems Journal asked me after I made my presentation if they could publish the paper. I happily agreed, and they printed it in 1965.\n\n\nMethod\n\nThe following conventions will be applied:\n\nthe top-left is (0,0) such that pixel coordinates increase in the right and down directions (e.g. that the pixel at (7,4) is directly above the pixel at (7,5)), and\nthe pixel centers have integer coordinates.\nThe endpoints of the line are the pixels at \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}\n  \n, where the first coordinate of the pair is the column and the second is the row.\nThe algorithm will be initially presented only for the octant in which the segment goes down and to the right (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ≤\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{0}\\leq x_{1}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ≤\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{0}\\leq y_{1}}\n  \n), and its horizontal projection \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1}-x_{0}}\n  \n is longer than the vertical projection \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{1}-y_{0}}\n  \n (the line has a positive slope less than 1).\nIn this octant, for each column x between \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{0}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1}}\n  \n, there is exactly one row y (computed by the algorithm) containing a pixel of the line, while each row between \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{0}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{1}}\n  \n may contain multiple rasterized pixels.\nBresenham's algorithm chooses the integer y corresponding to the pixel center that is closest to the ideal (fractional) y for the same x;

it keeps an error bound at each\nstage, which represents the negative of the distance from (a) the point where the line exits the pixel to (b) the top edge of the pixel. \nThis value is first set to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        −\n        0.5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{0}-0.5}\n  \n (due to using the pixel's center coordinates), and is incremented by m each time the x coordinate is incremented by one. If the error becomes greater than 0.5, we know that the line has moved upwards\none pixel, and that we must increment our y coordinate and readjust the error to represent the distance from the top of the new pixel – which is done by subtracting one from error.\n\n\nDerivation\nTo derive Bresenham's algorithm, two steps must be taken.  The first step is transforming the equation of a line from the typical slope-intercept form into something different; and then using this new equation to draw a line based on the idea of accumulation of error.\n\n\nLine equation\n\nThe slope-intercept form of a line is written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        m\n        x\n        +\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=f(x)=mx+b}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n is the slope and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  \n is the y-intercept. Because this is a function of only \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n, it can't represent a vertical line.

The black point (3, 2.5) is the midpoint between the two candidate points.\n\n\nAlgorithm for integer arithmetic\nAlternatively, the difference between points can be used instead of evaluating f(x,y) at midpoints. This alternative method allows for integer-only arithmetic, which is generally faster than using floating-point arithmetic. To derive the other method, define the difference to be as follows: \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        f\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        −\n        f\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{i}=f(x_{i}+1,y_{i}+{\\tfrac {1}{2}})-f(x_{0},y_{0})}\n  \n\nFor the first decision, this formulation is equivalent to the midpoint method since \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x_{0},y_{0})=0}\n  \n at the starting point.

This decision can be generalized by accumulating the error on each subsequent point.\n\nAll of the derivation for the algorithm is done.  One performance issue is the 1/2 factor in the initial value of D.  Since all of this is about the sign of the accumulated difference, then everything can be multiplied by 2 with no consequence.\nThis results in an algorithm that uses only integer arithmetic.\n\nplotLine(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n    dx = x1 - x0\n    dy = y1 - y0\n    D = 2*dy - dx\n    y = y0\n\n    for x from x0 to x1\n        plot(x, y)\n        if D > 0\n            y = y + 1\n            D = D - 2*dx\n        end if\n        D = D + 2*dy\n\nRunning this algorithm for \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        x\n        −\n        2\n        y\n        +\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x-2y+2}\n  \n from (0,1) to (6,4) yields the following differences with dx=6 and dy=3:\n\nD=2*3-6=0\nLoop from 0 to 6\n * x=0: plot(0, 1), D≤0: D=0+6=6\n * x=1: plot(1, 1), D>0: D=6-12=-6, y=1+1=2, D=-6+6=0\n * x=2: plot(2, 2), D≤0: D=0+6=6\n * x=3: plot(3, 2), D>0: D=6-12=-6, y=2+1=3, D=-6+6=0\n * x=4: plot(4, 3), D≤0: D=0+6=6\n * x=5: plot(5, 3), D>0: D=6-12=-6, y=3+1=4, D=-6+6=0\n * x=6: plot(6, 4), D≤0: D=0+6=6\n\nThe result of this plot is shown to the right.  The plotting can be viewed by plotting at the intersection of lines (blue circles) or filling in pixel boxes (yellow squares).  Regardless, the plotting is the same.\n\n\nAll cases\nHowever, as mentioned above this only works for octant zero, that is lines starting at the origin with a slope between 0 and 1 where x increases by exactly 1 per iteration and y increases by 0 or 1.\nThe algorithm can be extended to cover slopes between 0 and -1 by checking whether y needs to increase or decrease (i.e. dy < 0)\n\nplotLineLow(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n    dx = x1 - x0\n    dy = y1 - y0\n    yi = 1\n    if dy < 0\n        yi = -1\n        dy = -dy\n    end if\n    D = (2 * dy) - dx\n    y = y0\n\n    for x from x0 to x1\n        plot(x, y)\n        if D > 0\n            y = y + yi\n            D = D + (2 * (dy - dx))\n        else\n            D = D + 2*dy\n        end if\n\nBy switching the x and y axis an implementation for positive or negative steep slopes can be written as \n\nplotLineHigh(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n    dx = x1 - x0\n    dy = y1 - y0\n    xi = 1\n    if dx < 0\n        xi = -1\n        dx = -dx\n    end if\n    D = (2 * dx) - dy\n    x = x0\n\n    for y from y0 to y1\n        plot(x, y)\n        if D > 0\n            x = x + xi\n            D = D + (2 * (dx - dy))\n        else\n            D = D + 2*dx\n        end if\n\nA complete solution would need to detect whether x1 > x0 or y1 > y0 and reverse the input coordinates before drawing, thus\n\nplotLine(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n    if abs(y1 - y0) < abs(x1 - x0)\n        if x0 > x1\n            plotLineLow(x1, y1, x0, y0)\n        else\n            plotLineLow(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n        end if\n    else\n        if y0 > y1\n            plotLineHigh(x1, y1, x0, y0)\n        else\n            plotLineHigh(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n        end if\n    end if\n\nIn low level implementations which access the video memory directly, it would be typical for the special cases of vertical and horizontal lines to be handled separately as they can be highly optimized.\nSome versions use Bresenham's principles of integer incremental error to perform all octant line draws, balancing the positive and negative error between the x and y coordinates.\n\nplotLine(x0, y0, x1, y1)\n    dx = abs(x1 - x0)\n    sx = x0 < x1 ? 1 : -1\n    dy = -abs(y1 - y0)\n    sy = y0 < y1 ? 1 : -1\n    error = dx + dy\n    \n    while true\n        plot(x0, y0)\n        e2 = 2 * error\n        if e2 >= dy\n            if x0 == x1 break\n            error = error + dy\n            x0 = x0 + sx\n        end if\n        if e2 <= dx\n            if y0 == y1 break\n            error = error + dx\n            y0 = y0 + sy\n        end if\n    end while\n\n\nSimilar algorithms\nThe Bresenham algorithm can be interpreted as slightly modified digital differential analyzer (using 0.5 as error threshold instead of 0, which is required for non-overlapping polygon rasterizing).\nThe principle of using an incremental error in place of division operations has other applications in graphics. It is possible to use this technique to calculate the U,V co-ordinates during raster scan of texture mapped polygons. The voxel heightmap software-rendering engines seen in some PC games also used this principle.\nBresenham also published a Run-Slice computational algorithm: while the above described Run-Length algorithm runs the loop on the major axis, the Run-Slice variation loops the other way.

    "summary": "Bresenham's line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in historically common computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm, and one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. An extension to the original algorithm called the midpoint circle algorithm may be used for drawing circles.\nWhile algorithms such as Wu's algorithm are also frequently used in modern computer graphics because they can support antialiasing, Bresenham's line algorithm is still important because of its speed and simplicity. The algorithm is used in hardware such as plotters and in the graphics chips of modern graphics cards. It can also be found in many software graphics libraries. Because the algorithm is very simple, it is often implemented in either the firmware or the graphics hardware of modern graphics cards.\nThe label \"Bresenham\" is used today for a family of algorithms extending or modifying Bresenham's original algorithm.",

    "text": "Archduke (1796 – after 1814) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a career that lasted from April to October 1799 he ran four times and won two races. On his second racecourse appearance he won The Derby defeating his more fancied stable companion, Eagle. Archduke was beaten in two races at Newmarket later that year and did not race again. He was later exported to stand at stud in the United States.\n\n\nBackground\nArchduke was a brown horse bred by his owner Sir Frank Standish of Duxbury.  Archduke's sire, Sir Peter Teazle (or simply \"Sir Peter\") won the Epsom Derby in 1787 and became the most successful stallion of the time, winning the title of Champion sire on ten occasions between 1799 and 1809. Archduke was the tenth foal of Horatia, a highly successful broodmare, who had previously produced the double Doncaster Cup winner Stamford and went on to produce the 1806 Derby winner Paris, both sired by Sir Peter .\n\n\nRacing career\n\n\n1799: three-year-old season\nUntil 1946 British racehorses did not have to be given an official name when racing and the colt who later became Archduke was unnamed for his debut on 10 April 1799. Running as \"Sir F. Standish's c. by Sir Peter out of Horatia\", he ran in a 100 guinea Sweepstakes at the Newmarket Craven meeting. He was made 6/4 favourite and won from Lord Grosvenor's John Bull filly and two others.\nThe colt was officially named Archduke when he appeared at Epsom for the Derby on 9 May. His stable companion, Sir Frank Standish's \"Brother to Spread Eagle\" (later named Eagle) was the even money favourite, while Archduke was a relative outsider at odds of 12/1 in a field of eleven runners. Ridden by the veteran jockey John Arnull, Archduke won from Lord Egremont's Precipitate colt, with Eagle only third and Vivaldi fourth. The result was similar to the 1796 race, in which Standish's Didelot won the race with his favoured stablemate Mr. Teazle unplaced.\nAfter a break of well over four months, Archduke returned for the autumn meetings at Newmarket, where he had three engagements. On 30 September he started favourite for a Sweepstakes over the two mile \"Ditch In\" course, but finished third of the four runners behind Chippenham and Buzzard. Eagle finished last. Two days later, Archduke ran in the Town Plate over the same course and finished last of the three runners behind Hornby Lass and Humbug. This proved to be his last racecourse appearance: he was withdrawn from a valuable Sweepstakes on 14 October (won by Eagle), and from a scheduled match race against Mr Heathcote's horse Schedoni at Newmarket the following April.\n\n\nStud career\nAfter two seasons at stud in England, Archduke was sold in 1803 to John Hoomes and exported to stand as a stallion in Virginia. Before he was exported he sired Roseden, who became a successful sire in Ireland. After the death of Hoomes in 1805, Archduke was sold and stood in 1807 in Chesterfield County, Virginia for Thomas Branch.\n\n\nPedigree\n\n* Archduke is inbred 4S x 3D to the stallion Blank, meaning that he appears fourth generation on the sire side of his pedigree and third generation on the dam side of his pedigree.\n^ Archduke is inbred 5S x 4S x 4D to the stallion Regulus, meaning that he appears fifth and fourth generation once each on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation once on the dam side of his pedigree.\n~ Archduke is inbred 5S x 6S x 5S x 5D x 4D to the stallion Godolphin Arabian, meaning that he appears fifth generation twice and sixth generation once on the sire side of his pedigree and fifth and fourth generation once each on the dam side of his pedigree.\n\n\nReferences",

The NLA ambushed a Macedonian convoy, after they were defeated and forced to withdraw by KFOR troops in the village of Tanuševci.\n\n\nAttack\nAfter the Tanuševci operation, a Macedonian police convoy was sent to establish presence near the border to Kosovo and to try to prevent an Albanian insurgency by the NLA from taking hold in the area, but found itself trapped in an ambush by the NLA in 9 March. The officials trapped were deputy interior minister Refet Elmazi, state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs Ljube Boškoski and Macedonian police general Aleksandar Dončev. According to Macedonian police estimates, there were around 30 insurgents. Immediately after the ambush an hour-long battle involving artillery and heavy mortars erupted, after which most of the Macedonian convoy managed to escape. The fighting left one dead from the Macedonian security forces. After the firefight the NLA established control in Molino and Brest and the insurgency spread to wider parts of the country.\n\n\nAftermath\nWhile the Macedonian convoy was able to break through the ambush, they were forced to seal off the village. The NLA took control of Molino and Brest, and the insurgency spread to wider parts in Macedonia.\nAccording to the Macedonian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the main motive behind the attack by the NLA was their resentment over the Ministry's establishment of cooperation with the local population, among whom there were those who volunteered to work in the planned reserve police stations.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "David William St John Heath  (born 16 March 1954) is a British optometrist and Liberal Democrat politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Somerton and Frome from 1997 to 2015. He served as the Minister of State for Agriculture and Food from September 2012 to October 2013 in the Cameron–Clegg coalition government.\n\n\nEarly life\nHeath was born in Westbury-sub-Mendip in the Mendip Hills of Somerset. He was educated at Millfield Preparatory School and then Millfield School, an independent school in Street, Somerset. He then studied at St John's College at the University of Oxford, where he was awarded an MA in Physiological Sciences. He went on to study Ophthalmic Optics at the City University, London.\n\n\nEarly career\nHeath worked as a practising optometrist for seventeen years from 1979. He is also an honorary fellow of the College of Optometrists. He became a parliamentary consultant to the World Wide Fund for Nature in 1990, before joining Age Concern in the same capacity in 1991. He has worked for various other charities as a consultant since 1995.\n\n\nPolitical career\nHe was elected as a Liberal member of Somerset County Council in 1985, becoming the leader of the council 1985–1989. At the age of 31, he was the youngest ever leader of a county council. He remained as the Liberal Democrat group leader until 1991 and stood down from the council in 1997.\n\n\nWestminster career\nHe unsuccessfully contested Somerton and Frome at the 1992 General Election where he was defeated by the new Conservative MP Mark Robinson by 4,341 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election when he ousted Robinson at Somerton and Frome by just 130 votes and remained the MP until standing down in 2015. He made his maiden speech on 21 May 1997.\nIn Parliament he served on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee for two years from 1997 and at the same time was appointed as a frontbench spokesman on foreign affairs by Paddy Ashdown. He became an agriculture, fisheries and food spokesman under the new leadership of Charles Kennedy in 1999.

Currently managing partner at Valence Strategic, LLC and a fellow at the New America Foundation, he is also the author of the 2015 book, The Great Race: The Global Quest For The Car Of The Future (Simon and Schuster). Levi was also the lead author of the report Revolution Now, which he published while working in President Barack Obama's Department of Energy. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic primary in the 2018 election in Colorado's 6th congressional district.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nTillemann's father, Timber Dick, was a businessman, inventor, and administrator at the University of Denver's School of Engineering and Computer Sciences. Timber, who was the son of Colorado's first female lieutenant governor, Nancy E. Dick, died from burn wounds following a 2008 automobile accident. Levi, with his brothers Corban and Tomicah, accepted the NASA \"Create the Future\" award for their work with their father on an ultra high-efficiency engine.\nTillemann's mother, Annette, is a Jewish convert to Mormonism and daughter of Tom Lantos. While serving on a mission, Levi left the faith when he was unable to reconcile the logical and liberal outlook his parents had instilled in him with perceived inconsistencies in church doctrine. \nAt fifteen, Tillemann started college at Regis University, transferring to Yale University at 16 where he graduated with honors. He then earned a PhD from Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Japan and China studies. He speaks Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese.\n\n\nCareer\nWhile in graduate school, Tillemann served as a researcher for Pulitzer Prize-winning economic writer Daniel Yergin. and, with his brother Corban, continued his father's efforts to develop radical new engine design that is much more efficient than a traditional internal combustion engine. In 2009, their startup, IRIS engines, won a $100,000 investment prize from venture firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. The IRIS Engine also won numerous other awards, including in NASA's annual \"Create the Future\" design competition, ConocoPhillips' Energy Prize competition, and several university sponsored competitions.\nThe engine uses the walls of the chamber as a working surface, rather than the floor of the chamber, and in turn increases its working surface area from about 25% to more than 70%. Levi holds multiple U.S. and international patents for the IRIS design.\nHe served as a Special Advisor for Policy and International Affairs at the Department of Energy and chaired the Department's Autonomous and Connected Vehicles Energy Working Group. His is currently a Jeff and Cal Leonard Fellow at the New America Foundation and Managing Partner at Valence Strategic, LLC.\n\n\nThe Great Race: The Global Quest For The Car Of The Future\nTillemann's book, published in 2015 by Simon & Schuster, explains the $2 trillion global automotive industry and the competition between the U.S., Japan, and China to create the next generation of automobiles. He argues that strategic government policy plays a critical role in car development.\n\n\n2018 U.S. House campaign\nIn May 2017, Tillemann announced the formation of an exploratory committee and the beginning of a listening tour to examine the feasibility of a congressional bid in Colorado's 6th congressional district. After a six-week listening tour, he officially announced his candidacy.\nTillemann was endorsed by state senator and speaker pro-tempore Rhonda Fields as well as the Denver chapter of the Progressive Democrats of America.\nIn April 2018, it emerged that Congressman Steny Hoyer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee were supporting Tillemann's opponent, lawyer Jason Crow. In a recorded conversation, Hoyer urged Tillemann to drop out of the race. Hoyer acknowledged that the DCCC had already identified Crow as their choice candidate and discouraged a candid discussion about his weaknesses. Crow went on to win the primary and defeat Republican incumbent Mike Coffman in the general election.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCampaign website\nU.S. State Department (March 23, 2015). \"The Great Race\".

The antennae nearly three fourths the length of the body, slender and filiform. The thorax is scarcely longer than broad, the sides straight and parallel from the base to just behind the middle, then obliquely converging to the apex, the anterior angle armed with a short obtuse tooth. The upper surface is closely covered with large irregular foveolate punctures, the space immediately behind the apical margin however, is impunctate. There is a blackish-piceous narrow vitta on the medial disc, as well as a few of punctures on the extreme lateral margin in the same colour. On the vitta is a very narrow and slightly raised longitudinal line. The elytra are elongate and parallel, the sides very slightly sinuate and constricted in the middle and the apex obtusely rounded, the hinder angle armed with a short, acute, flattened spine, the apex of which looks directly backwards. The upper surface is convex on the sides and apex, flattened along the suture. The humeral callus is produced laterally, its apex extending slightly beyond the lateral margin. Each elytron has ten, at the extreme base eleven, regular rows of large deep punctures, which cover nearly the whole surface. The fourth interspace obsoletely costate. There is a narrow vitta, extending from the apex of the humeral callus nearly to the middle of each elytron, less distinct and sometimes entirely obsolete posteriorly, together with the spine at the hinder angle, blackish-piceous, tinged with violaceous.\n\n\nLife history\nNo host plant has been documented for this species.\n\n\nReferences",

Jatinder worked on a documentary film on cross-border train Samjhauta Express as a researcher with filmmaker Gerry Troyna For BBC.\n\n\nEarly life and background\nJatinder Mauhar hails from Village Bhutta, District Fatehgarh Sahib (Punjab).Jatinder took to literature under the influence his mother and maternal family. His mother was an avid reader of literature herself. Jatinder first wrote a play while studying in the sixth standard. It was on this play that he adapted his first screenplay in 2005. The project named Tandeera never materialized on screen.\n\n\nEducation\nJatinder did his primary education from village school and then he moved to Govt. High school Farour for his secondary education and even during this period, he remained a film buff. He would skip school often and watch films instead in local theatre and on VCR which was a common trend in 90s in villages.\nHe completed a three-year diploma in knitting technology from Government Institute of Textile Chemistry and Knitting Technology, Ludhiana. He worked as a knitting technician in different Knitting Mills in Ludhiana for two years. He couldn't fit himself into this space so gave with this profession.\n\n\nCareer\nHe started his career with directing music videos. Simultaneously he completed diploma in film direction from Zee Institute of Media Arts, Mumbai In 2005, he made his directorial debut with Mitti, which earned critical success. He has created a separate niche in Punjabi Film Industry. His cinema leaves a social impact. His films talk about social and political issues of the state and the call of youth about it. He has also worked as a researcher with filmmaker Gerry Troyna on a documentary film on cross-border train Samjhauta Express\nHe is a frequent contributor to various blogs and various newspapers as well. Many of his writings got published in different newspapers.\n\n\nStyle themes and influences\nThe movie \"Mitti\" came at such a time when Punjabi cinema was reviving well in business but lacked any critical commentary on the social concerns. The name of Jatinder Mauhar left its imprint with this movie and further came into reckoning as a director with meaningful movies. Jatinder regularly writes about the Indian and World cinema. His films adorn the anti-establishment tone and his writings give the picture of someone who is well versed with the concrete realities of the society. His cinema has put the cinema of issues on forefront and crafted a niche of its own.\nA collection of various articles by Jatinder Mauhar is also going to be published soon.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nMitti (2010)\nMitti engages with youth in an intense but complex dialogue. Through this dialogue, the youth approaches history through earlier generations and the history is full of rebelliousness. Their efforts to stand in continuity of rich historical tradition expose the nexus of politics, profit and religion. This nexus is depriving people of respectable life and resources of livelihood by advancing its own interests. Here the source of livelihood is Land, also called Mitti. \nRabbi, Gaazi, Laali and Tunda has been suspended from the university years ago but they are still staying in Chandigarh, in a bungalow which has been forcibly occupied. They are helping Harmel Singh in his business of politics and liquor. Laali's brother is a peasant leader who wants to familiarize them to the harsh realities of life. They don't have time or patience to listen. He is trying to build the association but they are hell-bent on detachment. \nWith the passage of time and ugly turn of events they realize that their life is worst then beasts. Their struggle for rehabilitation as better human being is an achievement of the film. Tactically unskilled, they realize that the socio-political dynamics is complex and struggle against nefarious nexus is more difficult than they imagined. The story moves, as experience demands patience and precision whereas youthful energy wants to produce immediate results. What an interaction between experience and youthful energy. It can't be always inclusive or antagonistic. \nIn the film the word Mitti keeps expanding in meaning and scope. Through instances it travels from a noun to metaphor, which means history, tradition, culture, values, honesty, responsibility and sense of belonging.\n\n\nSikander (2013)\nIn Panjab University Chandigarh, there are two rival groups of students are fighting for hegemony, one led by ‘Harjang’ and other by ‘Fateh’. Both have been patronized by political leaders. Patronization keeps on shifting with changing political scenario. Politicians use students as muscle power to capture booths, businesses and settle political scores. University has been turned into a minuscule of the bigger political scene.  ‘Sikander’ belongs to a backward village and has come to study in Panjab University Chandigarh. After the Murder of Fateh he takes refuge to cold-blooded violence. Sikander's group corporatized the illegal businesses under political patronage. They capture cable network, sand mining and real estate. Their rival group is equally violent and competes against them on every front. They negotiate their animosity in student elections. Their public narrative is voluble but they win elections with brutal force of money and muscle. Here the use of money and muscle may not be at the scale of general politics but it sounds that university is a perfect theatre for political rehearsals. Meanwhile, Sikander has a soft corner for his former girlfriend ‘Beant’.\nBeant is a confident girl studying in University. She wants to live life on her own terms i.e. equal terms with everyone. Her life-style symbolizes her conviction towards life.  She continues to live her way despite being victim of emotional break up and crude gender violence. Beant thinks that main reason of violence is rooted in society, contemporary political culture and insensitive educational institutions. She intends to change the atmosphere which is congenial for violence. In the passage of struggle she realizes that she is not alone as victim or as crusader.\nBeant and her friends challenge both groups in elections. They respond to their voluble narrative with logic. The small minority comprises diversity of students. For them questioning the political hierarchy is a response to call of history. They are sure that they can avoid this call but morally they are bound to respond. Their response questions the basic nature of educational institutions and role of youth in politics. They link their response to historical events and process which have contributed to make our society humane and compassionate. The film leaves the audience with lots of unanswered questions.  Audience all over world can relate to the film as it represents contemporary Punjab in finer details which is not very different from other regions\n\n\nSarsa v/s Sikander Controversy\nJatinder disowned his second film ‘Sikandar’ which was initially ‘Sarsa’. He objected to edit which was suggested by producers and upon their disagreement he and the co-writer Daljit Ami claimed that they disassociated themselves before the release. And the film was released with the changed title (Sikandar) and with considerable interference with the edit that changed what he wanted to convey.\n\n\nQissa Panjab (2015)\nThe film tells the story of youth of Punjab which is deep entrenched in problems like drugs, unemployment etc. The films revolves around the lives of six lead characters which took an ugly when they cross each other. The film received acclaim for its story and depiction of contemporary problems of society.  The film traces the story of Deep, a basketball player who along with Arjun (who is son a rich urban landlord), gets into drug trade. On the other side is Kismat, who is a theatre artist and dancer and shares a relationship with Heera, who is a local singer. Speed is a petty thief who falls in love with Sukhjeet, who is raised by her Uncle and Aunt after the death of her father and has a drug addict for brother. The film through the lives of these characters exposes the cruel realities of how lack of meaning opportunities is pushing the youth into the trap of drugs.\nThe film drew critical response and was selected as the opening film at IFFSA/PIFF Toronto, the Official Selection for Ritz International Film Festival Florida and Official Selection for Seattle South Asian Film Festival.\n\n\nMaurh\nMaurh is based on the lives of Jeon and Kishna Maurh, who had risen against the oppression of both the British and zamindars in pre-partition Punjab. Unable to tolerate humiliation of their family, Kishna joins the bandits. When Kishna is executed by the Brits, Jeona takes up arms to fight for his people. Maurh is a tale of revenge, betrayal and valour.\n\n\nAdh Chanani Raat (Crescent Night)\nThe film is based a novel by Gurdial Singh and he writes about character Modan, who just returned from prison after many years and he is trying to rebuild his life. Jatinder Mauhar has played Modan and film is directed by Gurvinder Singh.\n\n\nSaade Aale\nFirst look of the film unveiled at Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2018. Jatinder Mauhar directed the film and stars Deep Sidhu whose previous film Jora 10 Numbaria was critically acclaimed. Saade Aale film is based on Kabbadi and set in rural Punjab. Film is about people's attachment with Kabbadi sport in Punjab.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJatinder Mauhar at IMDb\nAdh Chanani Raat at IMDb\n[2]\n[3]\nPunjabi Kalaware",

The short is directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, composed by Scott Bradley, and animated by Kenneth Muse, Ray Patterson, Ed Barge, and Irven Spence. It won the 1952 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, the seventh and last Oscar given to a Tom and Jerry short.\n\n\nPlot\nIn 19th century Vienna, Tom Cat and Johann Mouse played by Jerry Mouse live in the house of composer Johann Strauss. Whenever Strauss plays the piano, Johann comes out of his hole to dance to the music, and Tom will repeatedly try to catch him to no avail. One day, Strauss goes away on a journey, much to Tom's dismay. Tom realizes that the key to catching Johann would be through music, so he begins teaching himself how to play the piano using Strauss' written tutorial, \"How to Play the Waltz in Six Easy Lessons.\" As Tom plays the piano, he is able to lure out and capture Johann, but his playing is immediately praised by the house servants, and so he lets go of Johann and happily continues his performance.\nTom's piano playing and Johann's dancing spread by word-of-mouth across Vienna, eventually reaching the Emperor of Austria Franz Joseph I. Tom and Johann are then commanded to perform at the palace before the emperor. Tom and Johann perform with vigor and delight at the palace, but Tom eventually succumbs to his instincts and tries to chase after Johann, only to fail once again and making the audience clap once again.\n\n\nProduction\nAs with every short of Tom and Jerry during its first two decades, Johann Mouse is directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, with its score composed by Scott Bradley. The piano arrangements for the short was created and played by Jakob Gimpel, a Polish-born concert pianist. Within the Tom and Jerry series, Johann Mouse is unique for having a record album directly adapted from the short itself, released in May 1953 and with Bret Morrison substituting Hans Conried as narrator.\n\n\nReception\nBen Simon of Animated Views praised Johann Mouse for its \"extraordinarily exquisite watercolor production values\", and noted that Hans Conried was \"having fun as the narrator\". Writer and historian Michael Samerdyke considered the short to be \"simply adorable\", and observed that continues \"Tom and Jerry's romance with classic music.\" Samerdyke also wrote that the short has \"a lovely, bittersweet feel. The storybook narration and the darling action is all sweet, but beneath it all lies the awareness that the world of Strauss waltzes and their elegance is over.\"\nJoseph Barbera later considered Johann Mouse, alongside The Cat Concerto, to be his favorite Tom and Jerry cartoon.\n\n\nHome media\n\"Tom & Jerry Cartoon Festival Featuring Academy Award Winner Johann Mouse\" (1985)\n\"Tom & Jerry's 50th Birthday Classics III\" (1990)\n\"Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases, Vol. 1\" (2000)\n\"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection\" (2004)\n\"Warner Bros.

    "title": "Hardware code page",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=39171547",
    "text": "In computing, a hardware code page (HWCP) refers to a code page supported natively by a hardware device such as a display adapter or printer. The glyphs to present the characters are stored in the alphanumeric character generator's resident read-only memory (like ROM or flash) and are thus not user-changeable. They are available for use by the system without having to load any font definitions into the device first. Startup messages issued by a PC's System BIOS or displayed by an operating system before initializing its own code page switching logic and font management and before switching to graphics mode are displayed in a computer's default hardware code page.\n\n\nCode page assignments\nIn North American IBM-compatible PCs, the hardware code page of the display adapter is typically code page 437. However, various portable machines as well as (Eastern) European, Arabic, Middle Eastern and Asian PCs used a number of other code pages as their hardware code page, including code page 100 (\"Hebrew\"), 151 (\"Nafitha Arabic\"), 667 (\"Mazovia\"), 737 (\"Greek\"), 850 (\"Multilingual\"), encodings like \"Roman-8\", \"Kamenický\", \"KOI-8\", \"MIK\", and others. Most display adapters support a single 8-bit hardware code page only. The bitmaps were often stored in an EPROM in a DIP socket. At most, the hardware code page to be activated was user-selectable via jumpers, configuration EEPROMs or CMOS setup. However, some of the display adapters designed for Eastern European, Arabic and Hebrew PCs supported multiple software-switchable hardware code pages, also named font pages, selectable via I/O ports or additional BIOS functions.\nIn contrast to this, printers frequently support several user-switchable character sets, often including various variants of the 7-bit ISO/IEC 646 character sets such as code page 367 (\"ISO/IEC 646-US / ASCII\"), sometimes also a couple of 8-bit code pages like code page 437, 850, 851, 852, 853, 855, 857, 860, 861, 863, 865, and 866. Printers for the Eastern European or Middle Eastern markets sometimes support other locale-specific hardware code pages to choose from. They can be selected via DIP switches or configuration menus on the printer, or via specific escape sequences.\n\n\nSupport in operating systems\nWhen operating systems initialize their code page switching logic, they need to know but have no means to determine the previously active hardware code page by themselves. Therefore, for code page switching to work correctly, the hardware code page needs to be specified.\nUnder DOS and Windows 9x this is accomplished by specifying the hardware code page as a parameter (hwcp) to the device drivers DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS:\n\nDEVICE=…\\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(type,hwcp,n|(n,m))\nDEVICE=…\\PRINTER.SYS PRN=(type,hwcp,n)\n\nIf multiple hardware code pages are supported in OEM issues, the first hardware code page (hwcp1) in the list specifies the default hardware code page:\n\nDEVICE=…\\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(type,(hwcp1,hwcp2,…),n|(n,m))\nDEVICE=…\\PRINTER.SYS PRN=(type,(hwcp1,hwcp2,…),n)\n\nIf no hardware code page(s) are specified, these drivers default either to a dummy code page number 999 or assume the hardware code page to be equal to the primary code page (the first code page listed in COUNTRY.SYS files for a particular country with the country code either specified in the CONFIG.SYS COUNTRY directive or assumed to be the operating system's internal default, usually 1 (US) in Western issues of DOS).\nIn many English-speaking countries, the primary code page is either 437 (f.e. in the US) or 850 (f.e. in the UK, Ireland and Canada), so that, without specifying a different code page, the system would often assume one of these to be the corresponding device's default hardware code page as well.\nIf a hardware code page does not match one of those with official code page assignments, an arbitrary number from the range 57344–61439 (E000h–EFFFh) for user-definable code pages or 65280–65533 (FF00h–FFFDh) for private use code pages could be specified per IBM CDRA to give the operating system a non-conflictive \"handle\" to select that code page.\nArabic and Hebrew MS-DOS do not use DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS, but provide similar facilities using ARABIC.COM, HEBREW.COM, and SK_HGC.COM.\n\n\nOEM code pages\nHardware code pages are also OEM code pages. The designation \"OEM\", for \"original equipment manufacturer\", indicates that the character set could be changed by the manufacturer to meet different markets.\nHowever, OEM code pages do not necessarily reside in ROM, but include so called prepared code pages, (aka downloadable character sets or downloadable fonts), character sets loaded as raster fonts into the font RAM of suitable display adapters (like Sirius 1/Victor 9000, NEC APC, HP 100LX/200LX/700LX, Persyst's BoB Color Adapter, Hercules' HGC+, InColor and Network Plus with RAMFONT, and IBM's MCGA, EGA, VGA, etc.) and printers as well. Hence, the group of OEM code pages is a superset of hardware code pages.\n\n\nSee also\nPC-9800 series\nAlt codes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Non-US character ROMs from MDA/CGA/Hercules cards?\". 2015-09-14.

    "text": "HMS Alonzo was a ship launched at Shields in 1800 that the British Royal Navy purchased in 1801. During the Napoleonic Wars she served in the Channel and the Baltic. At the end of the war she served as a hulk in various capacities prior to being scuttled off Leith in 1842.\n\n\nMercantile origins\nAlonzo entered Lloyd's Register in 1801 with J. Gardner, master, and Brown, owner. Her trade was London-Jamaica. Later that year the Royal Navy purchased her. 373 tons bm\n\n\nHMS Alonzo\nThe Navy purchased Alonzo from John Dudman on 8 February 1801. She then underwent fitting at Deptford until 25 March.\nCommander Robert Cathcart commissioned her in February for the Downs. Commander Hassard Stackpole replaced Cathcart before, in May 1802, Commander W. H. Falknor (or Faulknor) replaced him in turn. On 31 October Alonzo arrived at Portsmouth from Jersey with stores from Pomone, which had wrecked there. On 30 November Alonzo sailed to \"open a rendezvous at Dublin, for the entry of seamen.\"\nIn June 1803 Faulkner recommissioned Alonzo for service at Dublin for recruitment and impressement.\nIn October 1803 Commander John Impey was in command. That month, Alonzo was off Bognor when a three-day long gale resulted in her losing her masts and rudder, springing a dangerous leak, and coming close to being lost. Midshipman James Hervey Price managed to get ashore with dispatches on the third day and convey them to a signal station, which transmitted news of Alonzo's plight to Portsmouth.\nThen on 10 March 1804 Alonzo came into Portsmouth. A few days earlier she had been driven aground at Chichester Park but assistance from the dockyard had gotten her off. At Portsmouth she was to undergo repairs for the damage she had received. On 2 April Alonzo sailed from Deal with a British squadron that was to escort some \"stone ship' to Boulogne where they were to be scuttled to block the harbour. The attempt was abandoned and most of the squadron was back at Dungeness two or three days later.\nOn 12 June 1804 Alonzo returned to Portsmouth from Selsey where she had been serving as a guard ship.\nIn July 1804 Commander James Watson replaced Impey, with Alonzo serving on the Downs station.\nBetween May and August 1808 she was at Chatham undergoing fitting as a defence ship for Gibraltar. In May Commander Cuthbert Featherstone Daly recommissioned her, but in June Commander William Buckley Hunt replaced Daly, and in July William Knight replaced Hunt.\nAlonzo never sailed to Gibraltar. Instead, she next underwent fitting, between August and April 1809, for service in the Baltic. In April 1809 Commander Edward Barker recommissioned her.\nIn 1809 the ship James, Gregg, master, ran aground in the Great Belt whilst on a voyage from Liverpool, Lancashire to Stockholm, Sweden. Alonzo sent in her boats to set fire to James to prevent Danish gunboats capturing her.\nIn early July 1810, during the Gunboat War with Denmark-Norway, HMS Dictator, in company with Alonzo and Edgar, sighted three Danish gunboats. The gunboats (Husaren, Løberen, and Flink) sought refuge in Grenå, on eastern Jutland, where a company of soldiers and their field guns could provide cover. However, the British mounted a cutting out expedition of some 200 men in ten ships’ boats after midnight on 7 July, capturing the three gunboats.\nOn 9 July Alonzo recaptured Jusfrow Frederica.\nBetween April and May 1810 Alonzo was at Northfleet undergoing repairs.\nAlonzo, Gorgon, Victory, and the gun-brig Martial shared in the proceeds of the capture on 24 October 1810 of the brig Hoppet.\nIn November 1810 Commander James Veitch recommissioned Alonzo for the Channel Islands. He received promotion to post-captain on 12 August 1812.\nIn September 1812, Commander John Baily (or Bally, or Bailey), replaced Veitch. On 6 December 1813 Commander Thomas Dutton replaced Bailey.\n\n\nPost-war\nAlonzo was placed in ordinary at Deptford in 1814. Dutton remained at Plymouth after the end of the war on a three-year term of service with the Ordinary.\nBetween September and March 1815 Alonzo was at Woolwich undergoing fitting for service as a hospital ship for convicts. She served in that role between 1817 and 1822. In October 1828 Alonzo was recorded as serving as a convict ship at Portsmouth. Between May and August 1835 she underwent fitting as a chapel ship. The Navy lent her to the Leith Seamen's Society between 1835 and 1840.\n\n\nFate\nIn February 1842 Alonzo was scuttled outside Leith harbour at 56°0′0″N 3°10′0″W.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\nMarshall, John (1829). \"Veitch, James\" .

Also playing bass Knapp helped Bilderback establish the original line up of SixTwoSeven in 2016. After bringing in Drummer David Cook, Bilderback & Knapp brought in siblings Jason and Matt Bilderback before heading into the studio. In spring of 2016 SixTwoSeven recorded their first EP with DubSeven Records at A Soundhouse Studio in Seattle Washington with Legendary Sub Pop Producer Jack Endino. The release of the EP titled Some Others Day came in August that same year. After their first West Coast Tour with Texas band Drive On Mak they headlined Rock Shows from Portland to L.A., including a stop in Roswell New Mexico for the International Film Festival of 2017 (where the band was nominated for a ROSSI Award for Best Rock Band). Tour plans took the band back to L.A. in the summer of 2017 appearing at the world famous Whisky a Go Go with Agent Orange. DubSeven Records subsequently released a promotional video of this entire 30 minute performance. Plans were leaked from DubSeven Headquarters that a full-length LP was to be released in winter of 2018. The LP titled Already Gone / Dead on the Table was released in September (29th) after a string of singles and B sides throughout the summer of 2018, which included an \"on-board\" music video for New Solutions where Bilderback is seen skateboarding. The record debuted at #497 on the College Radio Charts, and broke into the top 150 the first week of October at #141, reaching as high as #135. It was produced by illfunk, mastred by Endino, and released on DubSeven Records. In late 2020 DubSeven Records and SixTwoSeven dropped a series of singles and videos starting with The Mistrial / Motormouth, Small Craft Advisory / An Engineer's Lament (Halloween Video), and One Night Stand / Escape Clause.\n\n\nHistory\nSixTwoSeven released their debut EP Some Other's Day courtesy of DubSeven Records, on August 5, 2016. SixTwoSeven is a five-piece rock band composed of Greg \"illfunk\" Bilderback on guitar and vocals, Jason \"J Danger\" Bilderback on rhythm guitar, Mike \"MK Ultra\" Knapp on the bass, Dave \"Dee Cee\" Cook on Drums, and another Bilderback brother, Matt \"the Machine\" Bilderback on keys and vocals.\nThe band formed in 2016 after \"illfunk\" had been pushing the Self Produced Demo \"Allow me for a moment...if you will...to be Frank\" on the web for several years. The demo, featuring 7 songs recorded and played entirely by Bilderback (Greg) himself, began gaining notoriety online, and prompted him to put together a live show line up, and by mid March 2016 videos began surfacing of the 3-piece performing live. By the end of March a decision was made to add J Danger to the line up for the recording and ensuing tour. A few short weeks later, while in the studio recording \"Some Other's Day\" with Nirvana Producer Jack Endino at Soundhouse Studios in Seattle (also known for his work with Mudhoney, and Soundgarden), another Bilderback was brought in. Initially thought just to provide support for backing vocal tracks on the CD, the band and Endino fell in love with Matt's harmonic contributions, and shortly thereafter a Nord Stage Keyboard Sponsorship was awarded to the Machine so that he could join the band on stage. The album was mastered by Grammy Award Nominee Joe Lambert (The Revenant).\nA West Coast Tour with Austin TX Punk-a-billy Drive On Mak, took place in the Summer of 2016, with stops in Seattle, Olympia, San Jose, Los Angeles and Portland. The band shared the stage with Drive on Mak, as well as Portland up and comers the Welkin Dim.\nIn early 2017, the band parted ways with drummer David Cook, and Matt \"The Machine\" Bilderback moved from keys to full time drummer of the band. The band is currently a 5-piece with the addition of Nat Linville.\nOther projects involving members of SixTwoSeven over time have included, Wheelchair, Five Hoss Cartwrights, Test Proof Positive, the Phil Bilderback Trio, Alpine Frequency, Victor Cutoff, Drive on Mak, Jason and the ArgoScotts, illfunk and MC MD, illfunk and DJ Mindbender, and Bork Laser\n\n\nMusical Influences\nThe band has been known to describe their sound with the line \"The attitude of an Underdog, with the punch of a champion\". Bilderback is a self proclaimed Muse and Foo Fighters fanatic, and influences can be heard in his music from Dinosaur Jr, Queens of the Stone Age, Weezer, Radiohead, and Royal Blood. They have been described as blue collar rock and roll band, with a heavy guitar riff driven sound not unlike that of AC/DC of stadium rock lore. The band has also described their sound as \"A precisely measured combination of elements: Equal parts Punk, Grunge, Alt and Stadium Rock, with a dash of smashed computer parts and broken glass. Garage Filtered for your listening pleasure.\" Others say it is \"Major League Rock and Roll.\"\n\n\nBand members\n\n\nCurrent\nGreg Bilderback – lead guitar, lead vocals (2010–present)\nMike Knapp – bass, backing vocals (2016–present)\nMatt Bilderback – drums, backing vocals (2017–present), Keyboards (2016)\nJason Bilderback – guitar, backing vocals (2016–present)\nNat Linville - guitar (2019–present)\n\n\nFormer\nDavid Cook – Drums (2016-2017)\n\n\nDiscography\nAllow me for a moment...if you will...to be Frank - 2011 DubSeven Records\nWreckless Soul (Single) - Digital Only - 2016 DubSeven Records\nSome Other's Day - 2016 - DubSeven Records\nSome Other's Day (Deluxe Edition) - 2017 DubSeven Records\nHeaven Knows / Runnin' with the Big Kids (single) - 2018 DubSeven Records\nAlready Gone / Dead on the Table (single) - 2018 DubSeven Records\nNew Solutions / A Winter in Palmyra (single) - 2018 DubSeven Records\nAlready Gone / Dead on the Table (LP) - 2018 DubSeven Records\nThe Mistrial / Motormouth (Single) - 2020 DubSeven Records\nSmall Craft Advisory / An Engineer's Lament - 2020 DubSeven Records\nOne Night Stand / Escape Clause - 2020 DubSeven Records\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nSixTwoSeven at Dubseven Records",

His works are sought by collectors and riders.\n\n\nCareer\nHerse was born in Caen.  He started working on prototype aircraft at the aircraft maker Breguet. In 1938, he introduced lightweight aluminum bicycle components: pedals, cranks, cantilever brakes and stems. In 1940, he began making complete bicycles. Herse was a \"constructeur\", meaning he built not just the frame but the entire bike.\nHis hand-built bicycles were described as \"the pinnacle of French cycling\" from the 1940s until his death.  Herse died in Paris.\n\n\nCompetition successes\nHerse bikes won technical trials in wartime and post-war France.  His riders and especially his daughter Lyli Herse (see below) won numerous times in the Polymultipliée de Chanteloup hillclimb races. Herse's riders won the Challenge des Constructeurs for the builder with the three best-placed riders in the Paris-Brest-Paris randonneur event every time from 1948 until 1971, and again in 1975. Six victories out of ten times the trophy was attributed has never been equalled.\nHis frames were ridden to victory by racers including Louison Bobet. Geneviève Gambillon won the world championships (female) on René Herse in 1972 and 1974.\n\n\nFamily\nHis daughter, Lyli, won eight national female cycling championships in France. After René Herse's death, Lyli Herse and her husband Jean Desbois, who was one of Herse's best framebuilders, continued the René Herse company until 1986. They also completed back orders of bicycles, so the last classic René Herse bikes were made in 1988.\n\n\nToday\nIn the early 2000s, Lyli approached Jan Heine, the editor of Bicycle Quarterly magazine and founder of Compass Bicycles, with the request of taking over the René Herse trademark and assets in order to safeguard them for the future. In late 2018, Compass Bicycles officially changed the company name to Rene Herse Cycles, to fully safeguard the trademark and legacy.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nRené Herse Project Photo gallery of René Herse bicycles\nResource including original catalog and pictures",

There the Dominican troops had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire at 08:00 hours. Under the cover of this fire, the Marines launched a bayonet charge on the defenders' first line of defense, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The Marines came under heavy but inaccurate rifle fire, which caused some casualties. The Dominican troops were forced to retreat to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and had to retreat again as the American field guns resumed their shelling of the hill. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines had forced the Dominicans to fall back.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Harter Fell is a fell in the western part of the English Lake District, located between the Eskdale and Duddon valleys. Its height is 653 metres (2,142 ft) There are several walking routes to the summit.\n\n\nTopography\nThe headwaters of the Esk and Duddon are separated by a ridge falling south west from the summit of Crinkle Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for 15 miles, finally meeting the sea on the slopes of Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fells on this ridge are Hard Knott and Harter Fell, separated by Hardknott Pass. From Harter Fell the ridge continues over Green Crag, Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow and Black Combe. Alfred Wainwright considered the latter hills unworthy of inclusion in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, stating that \"south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. This summit has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country.\" Later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding and the remainder of the range to their main volumes. Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.\nFrom the top of the pass a complex series of grassy knolls firms up into a ridge bearing south westward. This steps upward, first over Horsehow Crags and then the impressive gable-end of Demming Crag, before reaching the summit area. Further outcropping rock occurs on all sides, although little of it is of interest to climbers. Notable features are Maiden Castle, Brandy Crag and Mart Crag to the south east and Kepple Crag to the south. To the southwest is a broad and marshy saddle leading onto Green Crag and the moorlands of Birker Fell, the ongoing watershed. The southern and eastern flanks are heavily forested with conifers, legions of Forestry Commission trees sweeping down into the Duddon valley.\nHarter Fell appears in most views as a conical hill, unsurprising given its broadly circular contours. Wainwright paid it perhaps the ultimate accolade, stating that \"Not many fells can be described as beautiful, but the word fits Harter Fell, especially so when viewed from Eskdale.\".\n\n\nSummit\nThe summit area bears three rocky tors, the middle one of which is the highest. An Ordnance Survey triangulation column stands on the western outcrop. From its summit each of the ring of fells known as the Eskdale Horseshoe can be clearly seen: Sca Fell, Scafell Pike, Broad Crag, Great End, Esk Pike, Bow Fell and Crinkle Crags. To the south are the sands of the Duddon estuary and Morecambe Bay, and to the west the Irish Sea and Isle of Man.\n\n\nGeology\nHarter Fell offers excellent insights into the structure and composition of the Birker Fell formation of the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group. The fell is dominantly composed of composite andesite lava flows, with autobrecciated upper surfaces developed in some locations. These are often seen in the field as flat surfaces above steep crags, the crags themselves being formed due to the more crystalline, lower portions of each flow. The dip slope on these flows (~24° WSW) suggests that the formation is in nearly the same orientation now as when it formed. The summit of the fell is composed of one such lava flow, but only a few metres down slope the underlying lava flow is a portion of the Great Whinscale Dacite. This local marker unit conformably overlies an andesitic lapilli tuff and the Little Stand Tuff, a nodular rhyolitic ignimbrite. Below these distinctive rock units the andesite lava flows are seen again. On the northern side of the fell, at approximately 520 – 540 m elevation, a volcaniclastic sandstone unit is intercalated between the flows. Also on the northern slopes of the fell, and lower still at between 450 – 500 m, the lava flows switch to dacitic composition, with distinctive euhedral plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts (1 – 4 mm). The southern slopes of the fell again display the Great Whinscale dacite-tuff sequence, owing to extensive faulting. The very lowest slopes of the fell again revert to andesitic lava flows. In the north-western corner, near the Spothow Gill, a small vein of copper mineralisation has been worked out, and some of the evidence of this Victorian-era mining activity can still be seen.\n\n\nAscents\nFrom Eskdale Harter Fell can be climbed from Jubilee Bridge in the west or from the summit of Hardknott Pass in the east. From the Duddon, walkers can make use of the car parking at Birks Bridge. This provides a reasonably direct line from the west. An alternative is to start from Fickle Steps and circuit clockwise around the fell to join the path from Jubilee Bridge. Harter Fell forms the final challenge in the Woolpack walk when tackled in its usual direction.\n\n\nReferences",

In Buddhist scriptures, Guan Yin is recognized as Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe temple is directly accessible from Persiaran Endah that connects to Jalan Robson towards the north, but has an incredibly steep gradient for private vehicles and minivans to both ascend and descent on. A much shorter and narrower road also indirectly connects to the temple's car park to the northwest, but instead cuts through residential units near Bukit Robson.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nArchitectural\nThis syncretic temple with elements of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism is a grandiose structure and represents a successful combination of modern architectural techniques and authentic traditional design featuring imposing pillars, spectacular roofs, ornate carvings and intricate embellishments. Its grand architecture has made it as one of the tourist destination. The front entrance of the temple features a multi-arched gateway with red pillars, the colour symbolic of prosperity and good fortune. Souvenir stalls and a canteen are found on the first level. The second-level houses the multi-purpose hall while offices are located on the third level. The fourth level has three tiers and the prayer hall is located here.\n\n\nPrayer hall\n\nThe prayer hall houses three altars, each altar with a large statue of one particular deity or goddess. The altar on the right is dedicated to Guan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy. Tian Hou Niang Niang is in the centre while Shui Wei Sheng Niang (the Goddess of the Waterfront) is at the left. In the middle of the hall and between the altars are two pairs of Kau Cim oracles that can be used by visitors. Despite the dedication to Tian Hou, worship of Guan Yin is a recurrent theme at the temple.\n\n\nExternal\nIn addition to her altar in the prayer hall, there is a smaller statue of Guan Yin to the right of the hall, set amongst rocks and falling water. Here one can kneel and receive a blessing of water from the statue. Outside the temple at the entrance to the grounds, there is a larger statue, similarly set amongst rocks and falling water. Other features include a Chinese Medicinal Herbs Garden, a Wishing Well as well as a Tortoise Pond. There is also a large statue of the goddess opposite the temple, along with a collection of other large statues that include representations of the twelve animals of Chinese astrology.\n\n\nActivities\n\n\nReligious and cultural\nActivities such as the grand birthday celebrations for Goddess Tian Hou, Goddess Kuan Yin and the Goddess of the Waterfront are conducted at Thean Hou Temple. Buddhist activities include Buddhist chanting sessions and Wesak Day celebrations. Cultural activities include the annual Mid-Autumn Festival during the eighth lunar month and the Chinese New Year celebration. In 2019, the temple was allocated RM30,000 by the federal government to encourage them to hold more cultural events.\n\n\nOthers\nThe temple also offers fortune-telling and marriage registration services and traditional Chinese exercise and martial arts activities such as qigong, tai chi and wushu classes are conducted at the temple compound.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Thean Hou Temple at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

His family moved to a ranch in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles when Lazar was young. By the time he was 12, Lazar was keeping the books for his father's accounting business. He graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1943, took a job at Lockheed, and enrolled pre-law at University of California, Berkeley. He was drafted into the Army Air Corps, served two years, and then returned to his studies. In 1949, he graduated from Berkeley with a degree in economics, and in 1951, from University of Southern California with a law degree.\nHis first marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage, to Alyce Lou, lasted until his death. He has three children from his two marriages.\n\n\nEntertainment law\nEarly on in Lazar's career he specialized entertainment law. His clients included Bob Dylan, Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, Lenny Bruce, and the Beatles. He dated Maya Angelou when she was working as a cabaret singer. She later stated that he helped launch her career as a poet.\n\n\nStock trading\nIn the 1960s, Lazar began investing in oil wells in Texas and Louisiana, a Spanish-language newspaper, timberland in Indonesia, and stocks. According to New York Magazine, he became \"the single largest individual stock trader during the sixties\", buying and selling more tham $300 million in stocks in 1967 alone. Most of these investments were related to mergers and acquisitions. He had a few big losses, including a proposed merger between Armour and General Host (owner of Frank's Nursery & Crafts) that fell through in 1969.\n\n\nThe Latter-day Saint will\nIn 1976, Lazar joined a group that was trying to prove that a will found in the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City was the final will of Howard Hughes. Lazar invested $250,000 in the investigation. A Nevada jury ruled that the will was a fake.\n\n\nMilberg Weiss kickback scheme\nLazar developed a professional relationship with Milberg Weiss, a New York law firm known for handling class-action lawsuits. Over a period of about 25 years, he and members of his family participated, as plaintiffs, in over 50 class-action suits against companies like Hertz and United Airlines. In 2005, a federal investigation of these activities led to an indictment against Lazar for taking $2.6 million in kickbacks from Milberg Weiss. He was charged with mail fraud and money-laundering. In 2007, Lazar plead guilty to obstruction of justice, filing a false tax return and making a false declaration; he was sentenced to six months of home detention and ordered to pay a $600,000 fine, on top of a previously ordered $1.5 million forfeiture.\nLazar died at his home in Palm Springs in 2016.\nIn 2016, Lazar's daughter, Tara Lazar, opened a speakeasy in Palm Springs and named it Seymour's after her father.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Roger Doyle (born 17 July 1949) is an Irish composer best known for his electro-acoustic work, for which he was made a Saoi of Aosdána, and for his piano music for theatre.\n\n\nEducation\nBorn in Malahide, County Dublin, Doyle studied piano from the age of nine. After leaving school he attended the Royal Irish Academy of Music for three years, studying composing, during which time he was awarded two composition scholarships. He also studied at the Institute of Sonology at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the Finnish Radio Experimental Music Studio on scholarships.\n\n\nEarly work\nAs a performer Doyle began as a drummer with the groups Supply Demand and Curve and Jazz Therapy, playing free improvisatory and fusion music. He released his first LP, Oizzo No, in 1975, and his second, Thalia, in 1978 on CBS Classics. Rapid Eye Movements (1981) was his third LP, and his attempt at a \"masterpiece before the age of thirty\".\n\n\nElectro-acoustic and other work\nDoyle began his magnum opus, Babel, in 1989 – a 5-CD set that took ten years to compose. Each track corresponds to a 'room' or place within an imagined giant tower city, a kind of aural virtual reality. It celebrates the multiplicity of musical language. 103 pieces of music were composed for it and he worked with 48 collaborators. From 2002 to 2007 he worked on the three-volume electronic work Passades. 27 albums of his music have been released.\nDoyle has also composed scores for several films including Budawanny, Pigs and the documentary Atlantean by Bob Quinn.\nIn 2013 he founded META Productions  with opera director Eric Fraad, committed to exploring new forms of opera for the 21st century. Their first production was the electronic opera Heresy. Originally titled The Death by Fire of Giordano Bruno, A 40-minute 'in development' version was performed as part of a fully staged concert of Doyle's works at both the Kilkenny Arts Festival and in the Dublin Theatre Festival 2013. The 2 hour Heresy was presented as part of 'Project 50', a season of work celebrating 50 years of Project Arts Centre in November 2016. The opera is based on episodes from the life and works of Giordano Bruno. It was broadcast on RTÉ Lyric fm in September 2017 and released as a double album on Heresy records on 2018. Recent album releases are: The Thousand Year Old Boy (explorations in imagined world musics - 2013); Time Machine (music composed around telephone messages from the 1980s - 2015);  Frail Things In Eternal Places (electronic sounds with the scored and/or improvised vocal collaborations of 8 singers - 2016), The Heresy Ostraca (a remix album which fragments audio files of the Heresy opera and makes new pieces from the re-assemblage - 2019).\n\n\nTheatre\nDoyle set up the music theatre company Operating Theatre with Irish actress Olwen Fouéré. They produced site-specific productions, including Passades, Here Lies and Angel/Babel, all featuring Doyle's music as an equal partner in the theatrical environment. Operating Theatre performed in conventional and site-specific venues in Ireland, England, Holland, France, Venezuela and the US and released several records. With Icontact Dance Company, Doyle produced Tower of Babel – Delusional Architecture, featuring as much of Babel as he had composed by then. This work was originally performed in a whole wing of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in 1992. Arguably Doyle's most famous theatre work is the music he wrote and performed on piano onstage for the Steven Berkoff version of the Oscar Wilde play Salome which played in Dublin's Gate Theatre, in London's West End and on three world tours. The Irish Times noted that \"his name is revered in the realm of theatre\".\n\n\nCritical reception\nDoyle's works Four Sketches and All the Rage were awarded second and first prizes in the Dublin Symphony Orchestra composition competition in 1970 and 1974 respectively. He has won the Programme Music Prize (1997) and the Magisterium Award (2007) at the Bourges International Electro-Acoustic Competition in Bourges, France. He also received the Irish Arts Council's Marten Toonder Award in 2000 in recognition of his innovative work as a composer. Doyle is a member of Aosdána, and has recently been made Adjunct Professor of Music at Trinity College Dublin.\nPresident Michael D. Higgins conferred the honour of Saoi on Roger Doyle on 16 August 2019 by placing  a gold torc around his neck. This is the highest honour of Aosdána that can be bestowed by fellow Aosdána members. No more than seven living members can be so honoured at one time. The Irish Times described his album Chalant – Memento Mori as  \"a richly rewarding work that runs the full, glorious gamut of human emotion\". It was Album of the Week on 30 March 2012 in the same paper.\nBabel was re-released in 2013 and received this review from Fanfare Magazine (USA), January 2014: \"This is a phenomenal listening experience of Wagnerian dimensions ─ and, arguably, Wagnerian ambitions. The whole concept is amazing [...] an impeccably imagined alternative world experience. Fascinating, and well worth the time required to properly immerse oneself in the weird and wonderful contents of Roger Doyle's head.\"\n\n\nInfluences\nAs a teenager Doyle was influenced by Stravinsky, Debussy, Pierre Henry and The Beatles.\n\n\nSelected discography\nFairlight Memories\nBaby Grand\nCool Steel Army\nBabel\nThe Ninth Set\nPassades – Volumes 1 & 2\nRapid Eye Movements\nThalia/Oizzo No\nThe Room in the Tower\nChalant – Memento Mori\nThe Thousand Year Old Boy\nTime Machine\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nhttp://rogerdoyle1.bandcamp.com/\nRoger Doyle at IMDb\nhttp://cmc.ie/composers/pdfs/35.pdf\nhttp://www.metaproductions.ie",

    "text": "The Berlin Papyrus Collection (German: Papyrussammlung Berlin) of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin is the oldest and foremost collection of papyri in Germany and one of the five largest collections worldwide.\nIt is mainly housed in the Neues Museum and is part of the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection of Berlin. It comprises tens of thousands of papyri alongside 7,000 ostraka and further inscribed items. The texts appear in a wide range of scripts and languages including hieroglyphs, hieratic, Demotic and Greek.\nThe collection originated in 1823 and grew through purchases and excavations, especially under the Prussian Papyrus Enterprise (1901–1910) led by Otto Rubensohn and later Friedrich Zucker.\nNotable manuscripts include Papyrus Berlin 3022, a manuscript of the Story of Sinuhe, Papyrus Berlin 3033 (the Westcar Papyrus), narrating five miraculous tales and Papyrus Berlin 25239, which arguably contains an autograph of Cleopatra.\n\n\nCollection and important individual papyri\n\n\nOverview of the collection\nThe Berlin Papyrus Collection includes tens of thousands of papyri, 7,000 broken pieces of pottery with inscriptions (ostraka), more than 1,000 parchment and around 500 paper items, 200 textiles bearing inscriptions, more than 100 wooden and wax tablets, a number of leather manuscripts and bindings and a small quantity of lead tablets. The items bear inscriptions in Hieroglyphs, Hieratic, Demotic, Coptic, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Pehlevi, Arabic, Samaritan, Hebrew and Syriac. They stem from the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2700–2200 BC) up to the Middle Ages.\nThe papyri of the collection are numbered and are usually cited as \"Papyrus Berlin [item number]\" (\"Berlin Papyrus\", \"pBerlin\", \"Pap. Berl.\", \"Berl. Pap.\" and \"P.Berl\" are also sometimes used). Famous individual papyri of the collection include:\n\n\nThe Story of Sinuhe – Papyrus Berlin 3022\n\nThe collection contains a manuscript (Papyrus Berlin 3022) of the Story of Sinuhe, possibly the best-known literary work of ancient Egypt. The manuscript – a papyrus roll of about 5 m (16 ft) – is written in hieratic on papyrus and stems from c. 1800 BC during the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt.\n\n\nWestcar Papyrus – Papyrus Berlin 3033\n\nThe Westcar Papyrus (Papyrus Berlin 3033) is a manuscript of the collection containing five stories about miracles. The text is written on papyrus and is dated to the end of the 17th century BC. It is named after Henry Westcar (1798–1868), a British adventurer, who discovered the papyrus in Egypt.\n\n\nThe Persians by Timotheus of Miletus – Papyrus Berlin 9875\n\nThe Papyrus Berlin 9875 from the 4th century BC contains part of the poem The Persians by Timotheus of Miletus. It is the oldest known papyrus roll in Greek.\n\n\nFurther individual papyri\nPapyrus Berlin 3038\nPapyrus Berlin 6619\nPapyrus Berlin 6774\nPapyrus Berlin 8502\nPapyrus Berlin 8683\nPapyrus Berlin 11529\nPapyrus Berlin 13447\nPapyrus Berlin 16388\nPapyrus Berlin 17213\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n19th century\nThe roots of Berlin Papyrus Collection stem from a lot of 55 papyri purchased in Egypt in 1823 by the Prussian officer and adventurer Heinrich Menu von Minutoli for the Prussian Academy. In 1837, further papyri were added from the collection of Giuseppe Passalacqua, the director of the Berlin Egyptian Museum, including the important medical papyrus \"Collection for Relieving Pains\". In the beginning, the papyri were housed in the Monbijou Palace.\nOther documents of importance were acquired in 1837 from the collection of Bernardo Drovetti, an Italian diplomat and, explorer. In 1853, the Berlin Papyrus Collection was furthered for the first time not by the purchase of papyri, but by papyri found during excavations at Saqqara headed by Heinrich Karl Brugsch. In 1857, Karl Richard Lepsius, who succeeded Passalacqua as the director of the museum, acquired papyri from the collection of Giovanni Anastasi including two important magical formularies.\nIn 1877/1878 the purchases of papyri continued. Under the instigation of the German consul Gustav Travers some papyri recently found in Fayum were acquired for the collection, while the main body of the Fayum papyri went to form the basis for the Rainer collection in Vienna.\nThe Westcar Papyrus was acquired in 1885 from the private collection of Karl Richard Lepsius.\n\n\n20th century before World War I\nIn 1897, a leading German papyrologist, Ulrich Wilcken, made an appeal during a congress of the precursor of the German Philologists' Association for German excavations of papyri. This appeal together with a Prussian push for new papyri lead to the formation of the Prussian Papyrus Enterprise (Preußische Papyrusunternehmen) in 1901, which was set up to engage in excavations in Egypt; its fruits were added to the Berlin collection. Otto Rubensohn was chosen as its head 1901.\n\nRubensohn headed excavations for the Prussian Papyrus Enterprise from 1901–1907. He started with excavations in 1901/1902 in Fayum, which were not very successful. From 1902–1905, Abusir el-Meleq was the place of his explorations. During this successful excavation, the Papyrus Berlin 25239 was found, which the historian Peter van Minnen argues contains an autograph of Cleopatra, while other scholars (e.g. Antonia Sarri) remain unconvinced. From 1903–1906, Hermopolis was the place of excavations. These resulted in 30 tin boxes full of papyri. From 1906–1907 the Nile island of Elephantine was chosen. Many papyri were found, including the oldest Greek papyri in Egypt, a marriage contract from 310 BC (Papyrus Berlin 13500). Other important papyri include the archive of Jedaniah, son of Gemariah, the head of a Jewish congregation.\nConcurrently, at the turn of the century, Prussia wanted to improve the literary part of the collection and set up and capitalised the Commission for the Purchase of Greek literary papyri from Egypt (Commission zur Erwerbung griechisch-litterarischer Papyri aus Egypten). Its aim was to secure the position of Berlin as a leading cultural city especially vis-à-vis London. To achieve this, the purchase of literary papyri was deemed necessary, because Berlin had lots of documentary Greek papyri – from 1895 onwards published in Berliner griechische Urkunden (Berlin Greek Documents, BGU) – but only few literary Greek papyri, for which in 1904 the publication series Berliner Klassiker Texte (Berlin Classics Texts, BKT) was formed.\nIt was feared, however, that competition from within the German Empire, namely from Leipzig (Leipziger Papyruskommission), from the National Academic Library in Strasbourg, from Ernst Kornemann (capitalised by a rich patron) and from the University of Würzburg, would drive up the prices for papyri in Egypt, therefore a cartel was formed in 1903 (back-dated to 1 October 1902): the Papyrus-Kartel (Papyrus cartel). The cartel had two sections, one for Greek documentary papyri (section A) and one for Greek literary papyri (section B). Because the Berlin collection had already enough documentary papyri the collection was only part of section B of the cartel and managed this section. As it used the Prussian Papyrus Enterprise to facilitate its business, Otto Rubensohn was not only responsible for the excavations but also for the purchases of papyri for the collection.\nAll the papyri purchased by the cartel for section B were catalogued by the authorities of the Berlin museums and every 6 month (later every 12 month) an index was sent to all members of the cartel, and everyone could choose which papyri they wanted to acquire. If only one cartel member wanted to acquire the papyrus, they had to pay the price for which the papyrus had originally been purchased in Egypt. If more than one member was interested, than the winner was chosen at random.\nOtto Rubensohn's time at the Prussian Papyrus Enterprise ended on 31 March 1907 and he was succeeded by Friedrich Zucker. Zucker headed the Prussian Papyrus Enterprise until its demise and the end of excavations in 1910. Important excavations were made by Zucker in Philadelphia (Faiyum) in 1908–1909 and Dimê 1909–1910. In 1912, Berlin left the cartel and with the outbreak of World War I, the cartel ceased to exist.\n\n\nAfter World War II\nAfter the end of World War II, the collection was furthered with the collection of Hugo Ibscher (1962 and 1967), a Coptic evangelium (Papyrus Berlin 22220) in 1967 and the repurchase of documents lost during the war.\n\n\nEditions and database\n\n\nEditions\nThe Berliner griechische Urkunden (BGU) has been published in 22 volumes since 1895 and is currently published by De Gruyter. The series is devoted to publishing the around 3400 documents in Greek.\nThe Berliner Klassiker Texte (BKT) is a series devoted to publishing the literary papyri and other documents; its current publisher is also De Gruyter. It has been published since 1904. 10 volumes have been published.\n\n\nDatabase\nThe Berlin Papyrus Database (Berliner Papyrusdatenbank, BerlPap) is a project of the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection of Berlin sponsored by the German Research Foundation to digitize the papyri of the collection in Greek and Latin and since 2023 also the Coptic literary texts. The digitized papyri can be accessed freely online.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\nBrashear, William (2001). \"Berlin Papyri: Past, Present and Future\".

    "text": "Michael Groce is a poet and community worker. His mother, Cherry Groce, was shot and paralysed by police during a dawn raid on her home starting the 1985 Brixton riot in London, England.  He is now a published poet, having won the Cheltenham Poetry Prize, and actively engages with young people to inform them of his own experiences.\n\n\nEarly biography\nMichael Groce was brought up in Tinworth House, on a housing estate in Vauxhall, London. This area at the time showed high levels of deprivation. Much of his life from age six was spent in residential care.  He was involved with street gangs, and had been exposed to guns during his childhood.  He spent time in and out of prison; throughout his life, he accrued 50 convictions and 15 different spells in prison.\n\n\nRole in the riots\nA few days before the riots, Michael Groce was involved in a domestic dispute with his girlfriend during which he fired a gun. Shortly afterwards, he heard a knocking on the door, and went down to answer it, believing it to be a neighbour complaining about the gunshot.  Instead, he found a police officer, enquiring if he was Michael Groce.  Groce attempted to close the door, but the police officer would not let him, and only left after Groce put the gun into the officer's mouth.\nFollowing this incident, Groce fled his mother's house, and took up residence with his sister.  After three days of hiding, when he turned on the television, he was presented with a picture of his mother accompanying a news story about her shooting and subsequent paralysis from the waist down.  She had been shot in a police raid in search of him.\nHer shooting triggered the riots.  Groce handed himself in to the police shortly afterwards.\n\n\nCommunity work\nFollowing the riots, Michael Groce attempted to help the community recover - he ran a youth football team, trying to provide a fun alternative to crime.\nHe now runs poetry, personal development and motivational workshops in schools, and gives talks to dissuade others from making mistakes similar to those he made.\n\n\nPolitical activity\nIn May 2018, Groce ran as the Green Party candidate in the Lambeth Council Elections where he stood in the Coldharbour ward. He polled 761 votes (15.3%) finishing the runner up in fourth place out of thirteen candidates.\nLater that year, Groce was selected as the Green candidate for the Coldharbour by-election where he again finished in second place with 31% of the vote (912 votes), with an increase of almost 16%.\n\n\nPoetry\nGroce is also a poet.  He wrote poetry in prison, often at the request of other inmates to send in letters to partners or family. He won the Cheltenham Festivals, and owns his own performance club.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\"A Brixton Renaissance\". Retrieved 16 November 2006.\n\"'My mum got caught in the crossfire'\".

    "text": "The English national framework for  NHS continuing healthcare came into force on 1 October 2007 as a development in the light of the case of Coughlan which established that where a person's need is primarily for health care then the health service must fund the whole cost of nursing home placement. People who qualify are entitled to care paid for by the NHS, for which they do not have to pay, rather than social care, which is means-tested. Most of those who qualify need nursing home care. It is in the interests of local social services departments to establish entitlement to continuing healthcare as this relieves them of any financial responsibility. This system has existed in one form or another since the creation of the NHS.\nPayments until 2013 were administered by primary care trusts, and this was transferred to clinical commissioning groups. Many CCGs found towards the end of 2014 that they were in financial difficulties facing the combination of an ageing population with complex health needs and increasingly expensive care packages.\nA comprehensive assessment of the person's care qualifications needs must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, including relevant specialist and non-specialist assessments. An eligible person must establish that they have a complex medical condition and substantial and ongoing care needs. The framework replaced PCTs' individual policies for assessing eligibility for continuing care and local care planning and review processes, with the intention that the same criteria would be used throughout England. Funding already in place may be withdrawn following a joint reassessment of health and social care needs. A CCG's decision that someone is not eligible can be appealed through local resolution and then by an Independent Review Panel through NHS England. The final opportunity to challenge a decision is through the ombudsman. The decision can be challenged on grounds of process or application of the eligibility criteria.\nIn October 2014 the Northern, Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group found they were seeing an average of 34 CHC claims each month and planned to save up to £4.5 million by reviewing the decision-making thresholds for these claims. It also aimed to bring the prices paid into line with other areas and possibly bring assessment of claims carried out by community providers back in house.\nIn 2015-16, about £3.1 billion was spent. From November 2018 new guidance, issued without any public consultation, comes into force.  37 CCGs have introduced policies to cap the cost of providing support in a person's home at the cost of a residential care placement.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission wrote to thirteen clinical commissioning groups which is considered to have placed “arbitrary caps” on funding and failed to consider patients' individual needs. It threatened judicial review proceedings over such illegal discriminatory funding policies for people with serious long-term health conditions. The chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: “It is utterly unacceptable that anyone should be forced into residential care when they are healthy enough to live independently and with their families. We will use our powers to ensure that the NHS thinks about this again.”\nA new decision-making framework came into force on 1 October 2018, although there was no change to the eligibility criteria.\nThe assessment process was suspended at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, replaced by emergency funding, but restarted in September 2020, including all those discharged over the previous five months.  This was greeted with protests from clinical commissioning groups  as it is expected that eligibility will be assessed on patients' current needs rather than needs when they were first referred.\nAs of 2025, post-Covid, NHS England expects face-to-face continuing healthcare assessments to be offered, although if the patient prefers it, online assessments should also be available. In the 2024-2025 financial year, 51,981 assessments were made in England for funding, with 41,806 (80.5%) being rejected.\nThe Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman produced a report in 2020 outlining common failings in the scheme. This found failings often resulted in families funding care when the NHS should have done so.  It found people were often unaware of their entitlements and the processes to challenge decisions where they believed shortfalls were occurring in funding.\n\n\nRetrospective continuing healthcare claims\nOn 15 March 2012, the Department of Health announced a deadline of 30 September 2012 for individuals to request an assessment of eligibility for continuing healthcare funding, for cases during the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2011.  Retrospective claims for previously unassessed periods of care can be considered regardless of whether the patient is still alive. Assessments of eligibility for CHC are the responsibility of the CCG, and are sometimes carried out by commissioning support units. The claim period dates from the completion of the initial screening checklist.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Amietia hymenopus is a species of frog in the family Pyxicephalidae. It is found in the Drakensberg Mountains and Lesotho Highlands in northeastern Lesotho and adjacent South Africa. This species has many common names: Phofung river frog, Berg stream frog, Drakensberg river frog, Natal Drakensberg frog, Drakensberg frog, and Drakensberg rana.\n\n\nDescription\nThe maximum reported size for this species is 65 mm (2.6 in) in snout–urostyle length. In a smaller sample, the largest male was 41 mm (1.6 in) and the largest female was 49 mm (1.9 in) in snout–urostyle length. The back is very warty but there are no longitudinal skin ridges; a white glandular ridge runs from below the eye to the arm insertion. The tympanum is dark. The lips are marbled. The gular region is speckled or mottled while the belly is immaculate. There are two common dorsal patterns. One pattern is characterized by a pale background with olive markings; there are two dark \"V\" markings; a backward-facing one between the eyes, and another, forward-facing one at the level of the pectoral girdle. There is a white or grey, slightly elongated blotch located on the midline within this mark. The other pattern consists of a brown background with dark brown markings. The warts are slightly paler, and there is a pale patch on the midline, just behind the pectoral girdle.\n\n\nHabitat and conservation\nAmietia hymenopus inhabit high-altitude riverine grasslands at elevations of 1,800–3,000 m (5,900–9,800 ft) above sea level. Adults may be observed basking on rocks. Breeding takes place throughout the year in seepage areas on rocky stream banks or near the edges of pools. The eggs are laid in water. Tadpoles can be active even under ice.\nThis species is suffering from chytrid infections. Drying of streams and severe freezing in winter can cause large die-offs of tadpoles. Trampling and grazing are also threats. The species' range includes the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park in South Africa.\n\n\nReferences",

He also transmitted teachings in the name of Rav Nachman, R. Matna, and R. Hamnuna the Elder.\nHe was a contemporary of Rava, and a judge probably at Pumbedita. His strict honesty is shown by his teaching that a judge may not borrow anything from those who are under his jurisdiction, unless he is in a position to lend something in return, since otherwise he may be bribed by the kindness which has been done to him in the making of the loan.\nSeveral of his interpretations of Biblical passages have been preserved, some being his independent opinions, while others were derived from his predecessors.\nIt is told that he once met Elijah and asked him: \"What is the Holy One, blessed be He, doing?\" Elijah answered: \"He utters traditions in the name of all the Rabbis, but in the name of Rabbi Meir He does not utter... because he learnt traditions at the mouth of Aher.

    "text": "Mark McCain is a fictitious character who is the son of rancher Lucas McCain in the ABC Western television series The Rifleman, starring Chuck Connors, which ran from 1958 to 1963. Singer/actor and former Mouseketeer Johnny Crawford was cast in the role and was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1959 as Best Supporting Actor (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series. However, Dennis Weaver, then portraying Chester Goode on CBS's Gunsmoke, won the honor.\nMark McCain was more than just a supporting player in The Rifleman, as the boy's bond with his father was a core element of the show. In many ways he was the co-lead of the series and appeared in nearly every episode and in a majority of scenes.\n\n\nFamily drama\nThe McCains had previously lived in Enid, long before Oklahoma statehood in 1907. While there, Lucas' wife Margaret died in a smallpox outbreak (Season 5, \"The Guest\"). Mark meets the spirit of his dead mother (played by Marian Seldes) in The Vision  (Season 2, Episode 26, originally aired March 22, 1960) when the boy is suffering from typhoid and in a heavy fever.\nDespite the legendary Lucas McCain's use of his lightning rifle to settle disputes, the program is family-oriented. Lucas struggles to instill proper values in his young son, and most episodes end on an uplifting note.\nIn the episode, \"The Sister\", Mark asked Lucas if he would remarry. Lucas replied that it was \"only natural\" for him to consider a second marriage. Mark asked when Lucas might marry again. He reassured Mark: \"When I find the right woman\". Mark asked what the qualifications would entail. Lucas told Mark that he would know the right woman when he met her. With a big grin on his face, Mark asked, \"What will she be like\"? Lucas replied, \"Well, she'll have to cook and sew and scrub. Her hands gotta be soft, she's gotta have hair like the crimson of the setting sun. Eyes as brown as chestnuts. She's gotta wear a flower because that's womanly. Ride a horse like a man\". Mark suggested such a woman would be \"kinda hard to find\". Lucas agreed: \"Very hard to find, son\". As it turns out, Lucas did not remarry during the run of the program. However, in the last season, he was for a time smitten by a beautiful hotel owner named Lou Mallory.\nIn the fifth episode of the series entitled \"The Brother-in-Law\" (October 28, 1958), Jerome Courtland plays Johnny Gibbs, the brother of Luke's late wife Margaret. In the story line, Johnny, a former rodeo rider, visits the McCain ranch and asks Lucas for money so that Gibbs can repay creditors. Lucas then finds a wanted poster on Johnny for robbing an express office. Johnny is trying to raise money in competition to remain on a bucking bronco for thirty seconds. Johnny exerts considerable influence over his nephew, Mark. Though Lucas is initially displeased, he soon finds that Johnny has redeeming qualities though headed to prison when he leaves the McCain ranch.\nWestern film and TV scholar Holly George-Warren has said, \"With its father-son dynamic, The Rifleman bridged the early, innocent Westerns like Hopalong Cassidy and The Gene Autry Show with the more violent, adult Westerns such as Gunsmoke and Bonanza. It was a wonderful family show but had its dramatic elements, too.\"\n\n\nSam Peckinpah\nSam Peckinpah, the author of the first episode of The Rifleman, \"The Sharpshooter,\"\nis generally acknowledged as one of the creators of the series. He wrote five episodes (three of which he also directed) in the first season, and he wrote and directed an episode in the second season.\nAccording to Christopher Sharrett in his 2005 book The Rifleman, \"Peckinpah apparently wanted the series to focus on Mark, so that the series would be kind of bildungsroman, showing, in Peckinpah’s words, Mark’s  'discovery of what it’s all about.' Peckinpah’s vision, which would later show up in his films, was an “... essentialist, reductionist view of a violent world, one beset by the vile appetites of a new technocracy that was opposed by the hopelessly compromised yet relatively moral few. Such a vision … was not acceptable in any form to 1950s commercial television.\"\nTo have realized Peckinpah's vision would have necessitated … \"Mark's growth, maturation, possible disillusionment. The Rifleman indeed dealt with Mark's growing up ... but rather than show a consistent series of bitter trials from Mark's point of view, the show's stories often were constructed as lessons in growing up.\"\nAccording to Arnold Laven, \"… Peckinpah's departure from the show was based less on philosophical differences than on Peckinpah’s insistence on a level of violence that the producers felt distasteful and unsuited to their concept.\"\nIn a Playboy Magazine interview with Peckinpah published in August 1972, William Murray, in his introduction, said that Peckinpah \"... resigned when 'The Rifleman' became a 'children's program'....\"\n\n\nFathers and Sons\n\nThe Rifleman was unique for its time in making its protagonist a widower with a son, and thus burdening him with family responsibilities. This theme became more emphasized as the show developed in its five seasons, not only as a counterpoint to the violence of the show (the F.C.C. began pressuring networks to tone down violence in 1961 ), but to elucidate the theme of the introduction of civilization to the West, as Lucas brings Mark up with a respect for the rule of the law and fair play as part of the process of instilling moral values in his son.\nThe emphasis on the father-son relationship also was a result of the popularity of Johnny Crawford's portrayal of Mark and his chemistry with his father. Holly George-Warren recalled, \"I remember me and all my girlfriends having crushes on Johnny.\"\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Designed by Yuichi Kanai the Kyosho Inferno is a  1/8 scale, four-wheel-drive, off-road competition buggy which was first released in late 1991 as the successor to the Kyosho Turbo Burns. As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every IFMAR 1:8 IC Off-Road World Championship during its production run. With eight world titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\"-themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the Kyosho Burns in 1988.\n\n\nGeneral history\n\n\nBackground\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the Kyosho Turbo Burns. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance. Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design characteristics which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, Kyosho also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full-option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at Kyosho for the Burns series and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\" and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008. The ST series is still going strong today although the components used bare little resemblance to the current Inferno buggy. The classic Inferno also had a smaller sibling in 1:10 scale call the Kyosho Inferno 10 which in turn lead to other \"mini\" versions of the Inferno in later years.\n\n\nTimeline\n\nSource:\n\n\nClassic Inferno (late 1991–1996)\n\n\nModels and specifications\nAs with its predecessor, Kyosho released an intermediate-level car first which contained several performance parts. Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version. The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby. Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates, etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\" and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995.\n\n\nInferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 – late 1993)\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n\nDifferentials (however Burns had two bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had four, see comparison table below)\nThe inferno rear bulk head (though redesigned) is a direct fit for all burns series chassis.\nWing and wing mount\nShock absorbers\nWishbones, hubs and axles\nFuel tank\nEngine mount\n\nMost screws, nuts, washers, etc.\nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n\nSingle radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)\nStronger shock mounts with more mounting options\nDifferentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)\nTwo part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts), also the inferno both bulkheads eliminates the top lexan covered opening for better protection against dirt and debri.\nNew wheels and tires\nWide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\nMicro spike tires instead of regular spikes\nLighter wheels with narrower spokes\nSeparate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n\nInferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992–1994)\nJust like the Burns series, the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car.\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n\nTurbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994–1995)\nContinuing the model naming of the Burns series, the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n\nInferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995–1996)\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n\nThe plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\nThe metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\nThe plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\nThe Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR. The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl) to match the other blue plates on the car.\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999.\n\n\nOverview of main differences between classic Inferno models\n\n*Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.\n** Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 for later models\n*** Kyosho later changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213. The color codes and colors for all wings are the same with the exception of IFW-213KY which is a neon yellow instead of the regular yellow of part BSW-71KY.\n**** This chassis was not available as an official spare part. Instead BSW-60 Special Main Chassis was listed. This chassis was not blue anodized.\n***** BSW-78 shock boots were  included in the BSW-72 und BSW-73 sets. The part number for the boots changed to IFW-154 for later models.\n\n\nNotable optional parts\nSeveral of the optional parts which were available for the Turbo Burns could also be used on the first Inferno series, and vice versa. Most notable of which was the BSW-50 front carbon shock tower which was available an optional part for Turbo Burns, and was a part of the Turbo Burns SCC. Although this part was never listed as an official optional part for this car, it was actually used on the Inferno which won the 1992 IFMAR championship.\nThe most sought after optional parts are those which were unique to this first edition of Inferno, including the BSW-55 special diff housing which added rigidity, the BSW-86 special servo saver which offered more responsive and accurate steering, and the BSW-82 One Way Diff.\nThe later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which, however, were not compatible with the classic Inferno.\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears. It is also the only series of infernos that had three different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.\nThe Inferno chassis was also used for the Esprit, Landmax and Inferno ST series of cars which also had a few optional parts which were compatible with the Inferno, but were not included in its optional parts list. They also had GTW instead of BSW or IFW part numbers.\nThere were a few 3rd party manufacturers of aftermarket parts at the time making it possible to replace some standard parts for which Kyosho did not provide an option.\n\n\nBox art and marketing material\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n\nCollectibility and current popularity (1996–)\nAs with the Burns, the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires. The blue anodized version of the chassis with part number BS-108 was not available as spare part which makes it particularly difficult to find new. The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint-condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars at the time of writing in 2018. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original Kyosho engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts.\nDue to the low re-sale value, an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts. Scans of the original instruction manuals for the various Inferno models are also available online.\nIn lieu of noise restrictions and the advances of battery and brushless technology, some cars are also being converted to an electric powertrain.\n\n\nInferno MP5 & MP6 (1995–2002)\n\n\nModels and specifications\nThe MP5 was the first of kyosho's 1:8 buggy line up to use the \"MP\" (Model Project), name in public and was largely a clean break from its predecessors as far as the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" parts compatibility is concerned. The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n\nUpward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis\nSplash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every IFMAR title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions. The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track. Prior to the MP6 this relatively small change was also available on the MP5 in form of a long wheelbase conversion kit.\n\n\nMP5, item no. 31551 (1995–1998)\nAs with the previous Burns and Inferno models Kyosho released an intermediate level car first. Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced.\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production.\n\n\nMP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996)\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, which also included a manifold and muffler. This version of the Inferno MP5 is identified by a sticker on the button right corner of the box.\n\n\nMP5 EVO1, item no. 31664 (1996–1997)\nWith the \"EVO\" branding Kyosho distanced itself from the \"Turbo\" nomenclature used for the marketing of previously upgraded vehicles. It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n\nMP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997–1998)\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6. The chassis extension was also available as an upgrade package for previous MP5s. Unlike the previous 2 models, this car was not supplied with wheels or a wing.\n\n\nMP6, item no. 31891 (1998–2002)\nThe MP6 was essentially a standard MP5 with the longer chassis and wishbones used for the MP5 EVOII, and stronger, blue anodized shock towers. In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold-anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International.\n\n\nMP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999–2002)\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl). Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3 mm chassis instead of the 2.5 mm of the standard MP6. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5 mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n\nMP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998–2002)\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option. As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n\nOverview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models\n\n* Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 on later models\n** Kyosho later changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213. The color codes and colors for all wings are the same with the exception of IFW-213KY which is a neon yellow instead of the regular yellow of part BSW-71KY.\n*** BSW-78 shock boots were included in the BSW-72 und BSW-73 sets. The part number for the boots changed to IFW-154 for later models.\n\n\nNotable optional parts\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8. It was very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\nAt this time there was an increasing number of manufacturers which provided aftermarket parts for RC cars. The Italian manufacturer Nuova Faor made a complete kit for the MP6, which replaced many of the plastic parts with machined aluminum parts, or replaced original aluminum parts with stronger versions. GPM was also a prominent supplier of aftermarket aluminum parts, as well as carbon graphite parts. As with many other suppliers in the 80s and early 90s, both Nuova Faor and GPM distinguished their aluminum parts by anodizing them purple.\nOther suppliers at the time included Fioroni from Italy, Team Magic from Taiwan and RC Treff in Germany. Team Fiorini supplied competitive drivers with parts ranging from chassis plates to differentials for the MP5/MP6 and are still active today.\nSelected 3rd party suppliers were also able to sell parts under the official Kyosho \"Team\" brand\n\n\nBox art and marketing material\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box.\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box.\n\n\nCollectability and current popularity (2002–)\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status but are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors. As with the Burns and earlier Inferno models, third party suppliers provide aftermarket bodies and decals to help builders complete their restorations.\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection if these are in good, original condition. As with the Inferno DX this is relatively rare as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts in favour of performance pars as their skill increased.\n\n\nInferno MP7.5  (2000–2004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models)\n\n\nModels and specifications\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the five consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.\n\n\nMP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000–2004)\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.\n\n\nMP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001–2005), v2 item no. 31276 & 31277SG (2005–2009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009)\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car. It was largely pre-built (often branded as a \"Ready Set\"), and was supplied with Kyosho's own GX-21 engine, a pre-painted body and the necessary remote control hardware. A notable exception was the 31277SG which was released with the higher performance GXR28SG engine.\nIt was set up to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers. In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry-level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. During its production cycle there were four different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\nAs there was no entry-level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n\nMP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000–2001)\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward  and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n\nMP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001–2002)\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes.\n\n\nMP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002–2004)\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws.\n\n\nCollectibility and current popularity (2008–)\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho and many third-party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n\nInferno MP777 (2004–2008)\n\n\nModels and specifications\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate six successive wins at the IFMAR world championships. The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.\n\n\nMP777, item no. 31777 (2004–2008)\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles. The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axles on muddy tracks. Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.\n\n\nMP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004–2005)\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction.\n\n\nMP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005–2006)\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as they used pictures of the SP1. These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics.\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold.\n\n\nMP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006–2008)\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.\n\n\nCollectability and current popularity (2008–)\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho, and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n\nInferno MP9  (2008–2018)\n\n\nModels and specifications\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of a Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only required six months. A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine. It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before.\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016.\n\n\nMP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008–2010)\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry-level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components. There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.\n\n\nMP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010–2012)\nWith the ever-increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the Turbo Burns back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit.\nAnother first was the launch of limited-edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and Jared Tebo who was the top qualifier. They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.\n\n\nMP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1 (2012–2016)\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost. There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics. The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n\nMP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898, KYO33011B, and KY33013(2016–2018)\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho. This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the tenth anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). Ten years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4. This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33013. Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the MP1 Burns series which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n\nInferno MP10  (2019–)\n\n\nModels and specifications\n\n\nMP10, item no. 33015 and 33020 (2019–2021)\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10, marking an end to the ten-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33020.\n\n\nMP10 TKI2, item no. 33022 (2021-2022)\n\n\nMP10 30th Anniversary, no.33024 (2022)\n\n\nMP10 TKI3, no.33026 (2023-)\n\n\nExternal references and citations\n\n\nExternal references\nVintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com\nKyosho Thread on Retromodelisme\nKyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com\nVintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com\nKyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de\n\n\nWorks cited",
    "summary": "Designed by Yuichi Kanai the Kyosho Inferno is a  1/8 scale, four-wheel-drive, off-road competition buggy which was first released in late 1991 as the successor to the Kyosho Turbo Burns. As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every IFMAR 1:8 IC Off-Road World Championship during its production run. With eight world titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\"-themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the Kyosho Burns in 1988.",

    "text": "Windsor Racecourse, also known as Royal Windsor Racecourse, is a thoroughbred horse racing venue located in Windsor, Berkshire, England. It is near the M3 and the M4 and the town has two railway stations. It is one of only two figure-of-eight courses in the United Kingdom, the other being at Fontwell Park.\n\n\nDescription\nWindsor Racecourse is located on the banks of the River Thames and occupies a large island between the main channel of the River and the Clewer Mill Stream backwater.\nAlthough the course is shaped like a figure-of-eight, the full circuit is never used, so in races of 1m, 1m 2f and 1m 3f 99y (the longest distance at Windsor) the runners turn only right-handed. The full circuit is a little over 1m 4f, although it was about 1m 6f until the late 1970s. The 6f course is almost straight. \n\n\nHistory\nThe local area has links to horse racing that date back to the time of Henry VIII, whose Privy Purse Accounts contain records of payments to Thomas Ogle, Master of Horse at Windsor, where there was a stud and stable inside the Castle grounds, and Signor Pollo, a trainer, charged the king 7s 2d for a horse bath there. By the time of Charles II there were race meetings at Datchet Ferry, where a bet of 500 guineas was made on a race in 1682. \nIn 1865, Mr John Frail drew up plans for a racecourse on Rays Meadows, and the following year on 5th and 6th June, the first meeting was held. One of the spectators was Admiral Rous, who devised racing's weight-for-age scale, which (with some changes) is still used today.\nIn 1926, the bookmakers at Windsor were so angry at the betting tax introduced by Stanley Baldwin's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, that they refused to trade. The crowd watched the racing in silence. The tax was soon abolished.\nIn 1944, a German V1 flying bomb landed in a field near the racecourse just as the runners for a race were about to leave the parade ring. Local servicemen attended meetings with radar but failed to detect the danger on this occasion. Racegoers appeared to be unruffled. Windsor was one of three southern courses allowed to stage racing during the Second World War (the others being Newmarket and Salisbury).\nIn 1947, the course, bounded by the Thames and a mill stream, was flooded three feet deep in the stands, causing £100,000 worth of damage.\nWinston Churchill attended Windsor races in 1949 to watch his Colonist II win the Lime Tree Stakes. \nIn 1987 David Thompson acquired a majority interest in Windsor Racecourse and Richard Thompson became chairman from 1987 until the sale to Arena Leisure plc in 1999.\nWindsor abandoned National Hunt jump racing in December 1998, switching entirely to Flat racing.  However, the course occasionally held National Hunt meetings since, such as when it took over some of nearby Ascot's jump meetings during its refurbishment in the mid-2000s. In July 2023 Arena Racing Company announced a plan for jump racing to return to the course from the 2024–25 season. National Hunt racing resumed at the course on 15 December 2024.\nOn 15 October 2012 jockey Richard Hughes won 7 races out of the 8 races on the day.\n\n\nNotable races\n\n\nOther events\nWindsor Racecourse was the location for scenes in the film Last Orders.\nWindsor Racecourse was also the location for the filming of Midsomer Murders Season 8 episode Bantling Boy.\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics a temporary bridge linked the Racecourse with Dorney Lake, the rowing and canoeing venue. The Racecourse served as a pick-up and drop-off point for spectators travelling to and from Dorney Lake.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nCourse guide on GG.COM\nCourse guide on At The Races",

The track was released on 19 February 2016 with 100% of net profits from the song to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.\nIt was shortlisted for Song of the Year at the APRA Music Awards of 2017.\n\n\nBackground\n\"Oh Canada\" tells the story of the three-year-old boy who was found dead in September 2015 after fleeing Syria for Canada, with his brother and their parents. Alan's father Abdullah was the only survivor.  \"Their ultimate goal was to get to Canada because his sister lived over there,\" Higgins said, \"Their application had been rejected, so they thought getting a boat was their only choice\"\nHiggins explained to The Guardian her emotional reaction—including anger—to seeing the photo of Kurdi from her living room. She said she wanted to write about it. \"I tried not to take the moral high ground or point the finger at anyone, but rather tell the story as it happened. That [story] in itself, I think, is powerful and devastating enough.\"\nWhile Canada is mentioned in the lyrics, she uses the country as a way to draw light on the way other countries deal with refugees, including Australia.  Higgins says; \"It's not preaching anything, in particular, it's simply my attempt to make sense out of senselessness.\"\nThe lyrics of the song allude to the family's dreams of a new life in Canada, sung through Kurdi's father's perspective, which were spoiled when Kurdi, along with his mother and older brother, drowned while trying to make the journey from Turkey to Greece. \"Oh Canada, if you can hear me now, won't you open up your arms to the sea? / Oh Canada, if you can help me out, all I ever wanted was a safe place for my family.\"\n\n\nMusic video\nThe music video was created by animation director Nicholas Kallincos and Natasha Pincus. It was produced by stark raving productions and features drawings by children affected by the crisis in the Middle East, accompanied by picture-book-like animation narrating the story of the Kurdi family.\nPincus said, \"I first heard the song as an iPhone-recorded demo that Missy sent me. I was driving while I listened to it and had to pull over. I literally broke down in tears. The video concept needed to bring the song and Alan's story to life sensitively, boldly, but also without overwhelming either of them.\" Pincus said she spent weeks planning the clip, \"But when I discovered drawings online that had been made by refugee children as part of rehabilitation programs around the world, I knew I had stumbled on the concept I needed to focus on.\"\nThe music video was published on YouTube on 18 February 2016.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nReferences",

He is also the first official chairman of political coalition party in Sabah, the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah Party (GRS Party) and 3rd President of the Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (GAGASAN).\nHe was appointed Chief Minister in late September 2020 after his coalition, Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS), won 38 out of the 73 seats, in which 37 seats needed for a simple majority in the 2020 state election. His administration was further strengthened after three independent members of state legislative assembly (MLAs) pledged their support for the state government. \n\n\nEarly background\nHajiji was born in Kampung Serusup, Tuaran as the second of three children of Noor Harun and Teruyah Omar (both now deceased). He firstly attended the Serusup Native Primary School (SK Serusup) for his primary education in 1961 before going for his secondary education in Tuaran District Government Secondary School – now known as Badin Secondary School (SMK Badin) – in 1967. After getting 15 aggregates in Lower Certificate of Education examination, he was transferred to St. John's Secondary School in 1972 and excelled in Malaysian Certificate of Education examination as one of the best students in Tuaran after his high school graduation in 1974.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nPublic service\nHajiji started his career as a public servant in 1976. He was tasked to be a radio announcer at Radio Televisyen Malaysia before being appointed as Assistant Development Officer at Tuaran District Office from 1977 to 1982.\n\n\nPolitics\nHajiji entered politics in 1990 as he contested in the 8th general election as a candidate for Sulaman state constituency representing United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) and subsequently won. He was appointed as Political Secretary to Deputy Prime Minister Ghafar Baba from 1992 to 1993. He was also member of the Bank Rakyat's board of directors from 1991 to 1994.\nHe joined United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in 1994 following the dissolution of USNO. He became Tuaran Division Chief a year after until 2018 as well as Treasurer of UMNO Sabah from 2001 to 2018. He remained as an Assembly Member for Sulaman for six terms and is currently serving the seventh term after defeating two other candidates from Sabah Heritage Party (Warisan) and Love Sabah Party (PCS) in the recent state election.\nHe was appointed as Assistant Minister of State at the Ministry of Youth and Sports (for some times in 1994), Ministry of Industrial Development (1994 to 1996, and then 1999 to 2001), Chief Minister's Department (1996 to 1999) and Ministry of Finance (2001 to 2004). He was promoted as Minister of State for Housing and Local Government from 2004 to 2018 and as Deputy Chief Minister in the Ministry of Infrastructure Development for two days post 14th general election.\nFollowing the fall of BN in Sabah in 2018, he was appointed Sabah UMNO Liaison Chairman. He later joined Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU) in 2018 and serves as the State chairman for Sabah since 2019. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin nominated Hajiji as Chief Minister if PN win the next state election. Consequently, GRS, in which PN is a member, won the recent state election and moved to Governor Juhar Mahiruddin to name Hajiji as the next Chief Minister, in which the nomination was affirmed by Juhar the day before Hajiji's swearing-in.\nIn March 2022, Hajiji became the first official chairman of the registered political coalition party in Sabah, named Gabungan Rakyat Sabah Party (GRS Party). The GRS under Hajiji's leadership then formed a unity government with Pakatan Harapan (PH), Barisan Nasional (BN), Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) and other parties in the aftermath of the 15th Malaysian General Election. On 10 December 2022, Hajiji and other BERSATU Sabah leaders leave BERSATU and become direct members of GRS.\nOn 7 January 2023, a political crisis began when Hajiji Noor lost support from 13 Sabah UMNO member due to the breach of agreement of GRS-PN-BN thus his is no longer the Chief Minister of Sabah with confirmed majority support from the Sabah House of Legislative Assembly and will be continuing to hold this position until the new Chief Minister is elected. On 29 January 2023, Hajiji Noor announced to lead Sabah People's Idea Party (PGRS). He said PGRS will be used to continue the struggle as a local party in Sabah. He added, this is also intended to ensure that no more people deny the existence of the Chief Minister of Sabah and to stop the 2023 Sabah political crisis. PGRS was also accepted by the GRS coalition as a component party on 9 December 2022. In May 2023, Hajiji Noor become the first Chief Minister of Sabah that successfully got the full majority to approved the Anti-Party Hopping Bill in Sabah for both Parliament and State Legislative Assembly.\n\n\nFamily\nHajiji is married to Juliah Salag and has four children namely Mohd.

Its products include real-time 3D graphics systems, 3D reconstruction, visualized sports analysis, media asset management, and integrated workflow systems for the digital broadcast industry.\nVizrt has a customer base in more than 100 countries, and some 600 employees are distributed across 40 offices worldwide.\nViz software includes the tools Viz Pilot and Viz One, aimed at news organisations and digital broadcasters. Intended users include journalists whose traditional role as pure news-gatherers is extended to include controlling the flow of their story from a single point.\nVizrt products connect to newsroom control systems like Octopus Newsroom, iNews and ENPS. The software allows users to edit graphic templates, locate and edit archived video content, build playlists for on-air use, and distribute online content and maintain content on social media sites.\nThe company typically provides deliveries comprising software, hardware, consulting, installation, and support. Its head office is situated in Bergen, Norway.\nVizrt's usual customer base is composed of broadcasters and publishing houses. Vizrt is a privately owned company by Nordic Capital Fund VIII.\n\n\nHistory\nTV 2 Norway, a terrestrial television channel in Bergen, Norway, needed software to produce newsroom graphics. A spin-off company called Pilot Broadcast Systems AS was established in 1997, where the first template-based graphics system was created.\nIn 1999, Norway-based Pilot Broadcast Systems AS merged with the Austrian company, Peak Software Technologies GmbH (founded by Christian Huber, Karl-Heinz Klotz and Hubert Oehm), to form Peak Broadcast Systems. Peak Software was a developer of software for real-time 3D graphics and animation, virtual sets and playback control systems. The business fusion Peak Broadcast Systems, could now offer software for real-time 3D graphics creation and virtual sets, together with playout control.\nThe following year marked the formation of Vizrt when Peak Broadcast Systems merged with RT-SET (Real Time Synthesized Entertainment Technology) Ltd, an Israeli virtual studio system developer. RT-SET, founded in 1994, utilized Flight Simulator technology originally developed for the Israeli Air Force, transforming it to a virtual set and on-air graphics systems that could benefit the television broadcast industry. In 1999, RT-SET had an initial public offering on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, raising $48 million. The combined company continued to be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (under ticker symbol VIZ), until 2009 when it delisted its shares.\nIn 2005, the company acquired London-based Curious Software, developers of 2D and 3D animated maps for broadcast television, corporate presentations and online applications. The same year Vizrt listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange\nLater in 2005, Vizrt acquired 19 percent of Adactus AS, a Norwegian company specializing in the transportation of content to mobile phone platforms. Together, Vizrt and Adactus developed Viz 3G, a graphics engine for mobile telephones and other mobile devices. Based on Vizrt's Viz Engine renderer and Adactus' MPEG-21 standards-based multimedia delivery platform, it was the first integration of a graphics engine for mobile phone video viewing applications. Vizrt acquired the rest of the shares in the company in 2010.\nIn 2006, Vizrt acquired Ardendo, a digital asset management company serving the television broadcast industry, based in Sweden.\nIn 2008, Vizrt acquired Escenic, a Norwegian developer of content management software for digital media publishing. Escenic technologies are used by many news media websites, including The Globe and Mail, the Times Online, The Daily Telegraph, and Welt Online.\nIn October 2010, Vizrt formalized its strategic collaboration with Stergen Hi-Tech Ltd. Stergen develops 2D to 3D video conversion technologies for the TV sports market.\nIn November 2010, Vizrt entered into a terms sheet with Swiss company LiberoVision AG, a developer of virtual sports enhancements. Vizrt fully acquired LiberoVision in 2012. Liberovision was then rebranded to Viz Libero. The CEP of LiberoVision, Stephan Würmlin Stadler, was appointed EVP Sports, managing Vizrt's sports production tools.\nOn November 13, 2013, Vizrt announced plans to sell its online production tools, formerly Escenic, to CCI of Denmark. As of January 7, 2014, Vizrt has completed sale of 75.5 percent of Escenic's outstanding share capital.\nOn the same day, November 13, 2013, Vizrt announced intentions to acquire Mosart Medialab from TV 2 Norway. The acquisition brought the Mosart control room automation system into the Vizrt product line. The system was renamed Viz Mosart and facilitated the creation of the Viz Opus control room in a box system.\nOn 10 November 2014, the company entered into a merger agreement with Nordic Capital. The merger was approved by an extraordinary general meeting of the company on 18 December 2014. On 19 March 2015, it was announced that all pre-closing conditions set out in the merger agreement had been fulfilled, and the merger was subsequently consummated on 19 March 2015. The acquisition removed Vizrt from the Oslo stock exchange.\nIn May 2019, Vizrt acquired all shares of the company NewTek for a sum of US$95.25 million, disclosed in their Q2 report.\n\n\nNoteworthy events\nVizrt's Viz Virtual Studio software and Viz Engine renderer were an integral part of the success of the first remote “holographic” live interviews conducted by CNN during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Tracking data from the cameras in CNN's Election Center was processed by Viz Virtual Studio software. From the images captured, a specially developed Viz Engine plug-in, created a full 3D representation of the person. CNN also uses Vizrt for its award-winning MAM system, for broadcast graphics and for streaming to mobile.\nAlso in 2008, Vizrt technology powered a play-along version of “Who Wants to Be A Millionaire,” which aired on TV2 Norway. The show featured web-interactive elements. Viz Multi Platform Suite delivered real-time 3D graphics to the show's online participants. PGA Tour Productions selected Viz Ardome media asset management software to manage its HD and SD content in 2009.\nAlso in 2009, ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen), a German public-service broadcaster, began broadcasting using Vizrt's Virtual Studio and graphics systems.\nIn 2010, GMA Network, a Philippine commercial broadcast network, implemented Vizrt technology for the coverage of the Philippine national elections.\nIn 2011, Escenic and Sveriges Television (SVT) demonstrated the world's first professional website using on responsive design in the Escenic Content Engine.\nIn 2012, Vizrt provided graphic, video and online tools for three major events; the London Olympic Games, Euro2012 and the U.S. Presidential Election. For the U.S. Presidential Election, Vizrt graphics and video tools were used by almost all of the major U.S. broadcasters including ABC, CBS, Fox News, CNN, Univision. Global Broadcasters using Vizrt to cover the election included BBC, Sky News, CBC, Al Jazeera and many others.\nIn 2014, Vizrt provided virtual graphics and on-air graphics for Fox Sport's coverage of the Super Bowl and Daytona 500. Vizrt also provided graphics systems for the Olympics in Sochi for customers such as TV 2 Norway, Viasat in Sweden and Sky Italia as well as provided Viz World customers access to satellite imagery that were continuously being collected during the games.\n\n\nSee also\nChyron Corporation\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The cayenne pepper is a type of Capsicum annuum. It is usually a hot chili pepper used to flavor dishes. Cayenne peppers are a group of tapering, 10 to 25 cm long, generally skinny, mostly red-colored peppers, often with a curved tip and somewhat rippled skin, which hang from the bush as opposed to growing upright. Most varieties are generally rated at 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville units.\nThe fruits are generally dried and ground to make the powdered spice of the same name. However, cayenne powder may be a blend of different types of peppers, quite often not containing cayenne peppers, and may or may not contain the seeds.\nCayenne is used in cooking spicy dishes either as a powder or in its whole form. It is also used as an herbal supplement.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word cayenne is thought to be a corruption of the word kyynha, meaning \"capsicum\" in the Old Tupi language once spoken in Brazil. The town Cayenne in French Guiana is related to the name, and may have been named for the pepper or the Cayenne River.\nEnglish botanist Nicholas Culpeper used the phrase \"cayenne pepper\" in 1652, while the city was only renamed as Cayenne in 1777.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe cayenne pepper is a type of Capsicum annuum, as are bell peppers, jalapeños, pimientos, and many others. The genus Capsicum is in the nightshade family, (Solanaceae). Cayenne peppers are often said to belong to the frutescens variety, but frutescens peppers are now defined as peppers which have fruit which grow upright on the bush (such as tabasco peppers), thus what is known in English as cayenne peppers are by definition not frutescens. Culpeper, in his Complete Herbal from 1653, mentions cayenne pepper as a synonym for what he calls \"pepper (guinea)\". By the end of the 19th century \"Guinea pepper\" had come to mean bird's eye chili or piri-piri, although he refers to Capsicum peppers in general in his entry.\nIn the 19th century, modern cayenne peppers were classified as C. longum, this name was later synonymised with C. frutescens. Cayenne powder, however, has generally been made from the bird's eye peppers, in the 19th century classified as C. minimum.\n\n\nVarieties\nCayenne peppers are long, tapering, 10 to 25 centimetres (4 to 10 in) long, generally skinny, mostly red-colored peppers, often with a curved tip and somewhat rippled skin, which hang from the bush as opposed to growing upright.\nThere are many specific cultivars, such as Cow-horn, Cayenne Sweet, Cayenne Buist's Yellow, Golden Cayenne, Cayenne Carolina, Cayenne Indonesian, Joe's Long, Cayenne Large Red Thick, Cayenne Long Thick Red, Ring of Fire, Cayenne Passion, Cayenne Thomas Jefferson, Cayenne Iberian, Cayenne Turkish, Egyptian Cayenne, Cayenne Violet or Numex Las Cruces Cayenne. Although most modern cayenne peppers are colored red, yellow and purple varieties exist, and in the 19th century yellow varieties were common. Most types are hot, although a number of mild variants exist. Most varieties are generally rated at 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville units, although some are rated at 20,000 or less.\n\n\nIn cuisine\n\nCayenne powder may be a blend of different types of chili peppers. It is used in its fresh form, or as dried powder on seafood, all types of egg dishes (devilled eggs, omelettes, soufflés), meats and stews, casseroles, cheese dishes, hot sauces, and curries. In North America, the primary cultivar in crushed red pepper is cayenne.  It is also used in some varieties of hot sauce in North America, such as Frank's RedHot, Texas Pete and Crystal.\n\n\nSee also\nChili powder\nList of Capsicum cultivars\nSialagogue\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nNutrient Data Laboratory; et al. \"99369: Peppers, cayenne, raw (Capsicum annuum)\" (PDF).

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1372520",
    "text": "Dion Phaneuf (born 10 April 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenseman who played for the Calgary Flames, Toronto Maple Leafs, Ottawa Senators and Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted ninth overall in the 2003 NHL entry draft by Calgary and made his NHL debut in 2005 after a four-year junior career with the Red Deer Rebels of the Western Hockey League (WHL), in which he was twice named the Defenceman of the Year.\nPhaneuf set a Flames record for most goals by a first-year defenceman and was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie in 2005–06. Two years later, he was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman. During his career, Phaneuf was involved in two blockbuster trades. The first came in late 2009, when he was involved in a seven-player trade that saw him move from Calgary to Toronto. Six years later, Phaneuf was the centrepiece of a nine-player trade that saw him sent to Ottawa. He was traded to Los Angeles nearing the trade deadline in February 2018.\nPhaneuf was a three-time NHL All-Star. He represented Canada internationally five times in his career, winning a silver medal and a gold medal at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004 and 2005, respectively, as well as a gold medal at the 2007 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.\nPhaneuf is active in the community; the Flames honoured Phaneuf for his role as an ambassador to the Alberta Children's Hospital, where he participated in events that help sick and injured children during his time in Calgary. Phaneuf was a common sight at Toronto events, often appearing at fundraisers, promotional activities or visiting patients at Sick Kids Hospital.\n\n\nEarly life\nDion Phaneuf was born 10 April 1985, in Edmonton, Alberta, to Paul, a construction worker, and Amber, a nurse, both originally from the province of Prince Edward Island. Dion attended Harry Ainlay Composite High School before Hunting Hills High School while with the Red Deer Rebels. Dion has a younger brother, Dane, who played for the P.E.I. Rocket of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Paul and Amber Phaneuf describe their family as close-knit.\nPaul Phaneuf maintained a backyard rink each winter on which the young Phaneuf practiced. His mother, a former figure skater who competed for Prince Edward Island at the 1975 Canada Winter Games, taught him to skate. Phaneuf also practised his shot relentlessly in the basement of his family's home, frequently breaking the nets his father bought. As a youth, he played in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Edmonton.\n\n\nPlaying career\n\n\nJunior\nThe Red Deer Rebels selected Phaneuf in the third round of the 2000 WHL Bantam Draft. One year later, he joined the Rebels for the 2001–02 season and recorded 17 points in 67 games. He added two assists in 21 games as the Rebels lost in the WHL Final against the Kootenay Ice. He improved to 30 points in 2002–03 as the Rebels again reached the WHL Finals, again losing, this time to the Kelowna Rockets. Phaneuf's development earned him comparisons to Hall of Famer Scott Stevens, as he was lauded by scouts for his physical style and ability to excel both defensively and offensively. Then-Calgary Flames general manager Darryl Sutter valued Phaneuf so highly in the 2003 NHL entry draft that he attempted to trade up from his ninth overall selection in the draft, though to no avail. Nonetheless, he was able to select Phaneuf with Calgary's first selection in the draft.\nPhaneuf established himself as the junior hockey team's top player following the draft, earning the Bill Hunter Memorial Trophy as the top defenceman in the WHL. He was also named an Eastern Conference All-Star by the WHL, and a First Team All-Star by the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). He was considered a candidate to join the Flames in 2004. However, the 2004–05 NHL lockout forced Phaneuf to play one final year of junior hockey. He scored 56 points in 55 games to finish his junior career with 146 total points. He repeated as the WHL's Defenceman of the Year, and was again named to both WHL and CHL All-Star teams. Prospects Hockey rated Phaneuf as the top player in the CHL in both 2004 and 2005, ahead of Sidney Crosby, naming him one of the best junior defencemen of the previous decade.\n\n\nProfessional (2005–2019)\n\n\nCalgary Flames (2005–2010)\n\nPhaneuf joined the Flames for the 2005–06 NHL season after signing his first professional contract in September 2005. He made his NHL debut on 5 October 2005, against the Minnesota Wild. Five nights later, he scored his first career goal and assist against the Colorado Avalanche. He was named the NHL's Rookie of the Month for November after leading all rookie defencemen with nine points and two game-winning goals. By January, Phaneuf was being named alongside Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin as a candidate for the NHL's top rookie. He finished the season with 20 goals, only the third player in NHL history after Brian Leetch and Barry Beck to score 20 as a rookie defenceman. His 20 goals also broke the Flames franchise record for goals by a rookie defenceman, surpassing Gary Suter's total of 18. Phaneuf was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as top rookie, but lost to Ovechkin.\nA 50-point sophomore season earned Phaneuf his first NHL All-Star Game appearance in 2006–07. He participated in the hardest shot competition at the SuperSkills competition, losing to Zdeno Chára, and scored a goal and an assist in the game itself to help the Western Conference defeat the East 12–9. The Flames signed Phaneuf to a six-year, US$39 million contract extension midway through the 2007–08 season. He responded by posting a career-high 60 points, and was voted into the starting line-up by the fans for the 2008 All-Star Game. Phaneuf was named to the NHL first All-Star team following the season, and was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as defenceman of the year, losing to the Detroit Red Wings' Nicklas Lidström.\nThe 2008–09 season was a frustrating one for Phaneuf, as he recorded a career-low 11 goals and 47 points, and his poor plus-minus rating of –11 led fans to question his defensive commitment. His poor season and high salary also led to speculation that Phaneuf might be traded. Despite his struggles, Phaneuf averaged 26 minutes and 31 seconds of ice time per game, the fourth highest in the NHL. He missed the final game of the Flames' 2009 Stanley Cup playoff Western Quarter-final series against the Chicago Blackhawks with broken ribs, after battling a hip injury during the regular season. Flames management defended Phaneuf, claiming the injuries he battled affected his play.\n\n\nToronto Maple Leafs (2010–2016)\nOn 31 January 2010, the Flames dealt Phaneuf, along with Fredrik Sjöström and Keith Aulie, to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Matt Stajan, Niklas Hagman, Ian White and Jamal Mayers.\n\nOn 2 February 2010, Phaneuf made his Toronto Maple Leaf debut, leading all Maple Leafs players in time on ice and ended the night with a fight and given second star of the game honours. He would record his first point, an assist, four nights later in a game against the Ottawa Senators and scored his first goal as a Leaf on 7 April 2010, on Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers. Phaneuf was named an alternate captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs head coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a positive change in the mood in the Toronto dressing room.\nPhaneuf was named the 18th captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs on 14 June 2010, at a press conference held by general manager Brian Burke, succeeding Mats Sundin, who left after the 2007–08 season.\nOn 2 November 2010, in a game against the Ottawa Senators, Phaneuf sustained an injury in the leg by having it cut open with a skate from Peter Regin while crashing into the boards. He was carried off the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to be off the ice for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on 9 December 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.\nOn 5 January 2012, it was announced that Phaneuf would compete in his third All-Star Game, having finished second amongst all defencemen on the fan ballot, gaining 614,933 votes, behind the Ottawa Senators' Erik Karlsson. On 21 April 2013, Phaneuf and the Leafs clinched a Stanley Cup playoff spot, the first time for Phaneuf since the 2008–09 season with the Calgary Flames. On 10 December 2013, Phaneuf received a two-game suspension on a boarding hit on Boston Bruins defenceman Kevan Miller, which occurred on 8 December 2013, in Toronto. Phaneuf forfeited the amount of US$66,666.66 for his action.\nThe Maple Leafs, struggling once again, decided to start a rebuild in early 2015. Thus Phaneuf, a veteran defenceman with a lengthy contract, began being shopped around. On 2 March 2015, Phaneuf was almost traded to the Detroit Red Wings, however the deal fell through at the last minute when Toronto refused to retain a large portion of Phaneuf's salary. He would play the rest of the year in Toronto. When Toronto hired head coach Mike Babcock the following season, Phaneuf excelled, experiencing fewer penalty minutes and better defensive play under his reduced minutes.\n\n\nOttawa Senators (2016–2018)\nAfter parts of seven seasons with Toronto, Phaneuf was traded to the Ottawa Senators on 9 February 2016, in a blockbuster nine-player trade. Both fans and media alike viewed the trade with shock, as a significant deal between the arch-rivals was viewed as very unlikely to happen. Phaneuf, Matt Frattin, prospects Casey Bailey, Ryan Rupert and Cody Donaghey were sent to the Senators in exchange for Jared Cowen, Colin Greening, Milan Michalek, prospect Tobias Lindberg and Ottawa's 2017 second-round draft pick. Due to the Battle of Ontario rivalry, this was the first time the Maple Leafs and Senators had made a trade since 17 March 1998, when Per Gustafsson was sent to Ottawa in exchange for an eighth-round pick. As his usual jersey number 3 was already in use on the team by Marc Methot, Phaneuf took up jersey number 2. Phaneuf played a shortened 2015–16 season due to an \"oblique injury and soreness in his right foot\" after blocking a shot during a game against the Maple Leafs on March 12, ending the season with 20 games played with the Senators, amassing one goal and eight points.\nPhaneuf was named an alternate captain of the Senators at the beginning of the 2016–17 season. Phaneuf scored the overtime winner in game two of the Senators' first-round playoff series against the Boston Bruins in the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The team would be eliminated in the seventh game, double-overtime of the Eastern Conference final by the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nIn the following off-season, Phaneuf was asked by the Senators to waive his no-move clause in his contract for the 2017 NHL expansion draft. He declined and the Senators had to place Phaneuf on its protected list for the draft.\nIn the following season, the Senators stumbled out of the gate. This was later attributed to dissension in the dressing room. After a trade to bring Matt Duchene to Ottawa was followed by poor performances, the team's management started dismantling the team to rebuild. On 13 February 2018, Phaneuf and Nate Thompson were traded to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for forwards Marian Gaborik and Nick Shore. To complete the deal, Phaneuf had to allow a trade to the Kings under the no-move clause in his contract. As part of the deal, the Senators retained 25% of the remainder of Phaneuf's contract.\n\n\nLos Angeles Kings and retirement (2018–2019)\nDuring the 2018–19 season, Phaneuf played in his 1,000th career game on 17 November 2018 in a 5-3 loss to the Nashville Predators. He finished his second season with the Kings recording a career-low one goal and six points and a plus-minus of -21 through 67 games. On 15 June 2019, the Kings bought out the final two years of Phaneuf's contract, making him an unrestricted free agent.\nOn 16 November 2021, Phaneuf announced his retirement from professional ice hockey, over two years after his final game in the NHL. He had spent parts of the previous two seasons job-shadowing with Maple Leafs president Brendan Shanahan. The Maple Leafs honoured Phaneuf later that day in a ceremony ahead of their game against the Nashville Predators.\n\n\nInternational play\n\nPhaneuf made his international debut for the Canadian junior team at the 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Helsinki, earning a leadership role under Head Coach Mario Durocher. A devastating bodycheck to the Czech Republic's Rostislav Olesz led the referee to eject Phaneuf from the semi-final game; he was not suspended, however, and played in the gold medal game. The Canadians lost the final to the United States, while Phaneuf was named a tournament All-Star at defence.\nThe Canadian team at the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships dominated the tournament, outscoring their opposition 35–6 in the games leading up to the gold medal game with Russia. Phaneuf scored a goal and threw a memorable bodycheck that knocked down two Russian players in the game as Canada routed the Russians 6–1 to win their first gold medal in eight years. He was again named a tournament All-Star, as well as being named the outstanding defenceman of the tournament.\nFollowing the Flames' elimination in the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, Phaneuf joined the Canadian senior team at the 2007 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Moscow. He recorded eight assists in seven games to help Canada win the gold medal over Finland. Once considered a virtual lock to join Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics, his struggles in the 2008–09 season placed his candidacy in doubt. Team Canada general manager Steve Yzerman continued to express confidence in Phaneuf during a summer camp held in Calgary, but Phaneuf was not among the seven defencemen ultimately selected for the team.\nAfter the Maple Leafs missed the 2011 playoffs, Phaneuf served as alternate captain of Canada at the 2011 IIHF World Championship in Bratislava, Slovakia, where Canada finished fifth. Phaneuf was once again alternate captain of the Canadian team at the 2012 World Championship in Helsinki and Stockholm. Canada repeated its fifth-place finish of the prior year.\nIn August 2013, Phaneuf attended the summer orientation camp for Canada in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics. However, Phaneuf was not named to the final roster.\n\n\nPlaying style\nIn junior hockey, Phaneuf was known not only for his physical presence, but also his calm demeanour and offensive ability. He was compared to Hockey Hall of Famer Scott Stevens by his former coach, Brent Sutter. Scouts praised his defensive ability, and the poise he showed at both ends of the ice. Praised for his leadership abilities, Phaneuf was named the captain of Team WHL at the 2004 ATD Canada-Russia Challenge, and was counted upon to take a leadership role with the Canadian junior team at the 2004 and 2005 World Junior Championships.\nEntering his sophomore season, Phaneuf's potential impact on a game was compared to that of Russian star Alexander Ovechkin, and a poll released by ESPN in 2008 revealed that 43% of players asked argued Phaneuf was the hardest hitter in hockey, at the age of 22. He was named an alternate captain by the Flames at the start of the 2008–09 season, though Brent Sutter chose to alternate amongst a group of veterans, including Phaneuf, in 2009–10.\nWhile Phaneuf earned a James Norris Memorial Trophy nomination for his defensive play in 2008, he struggled enough during the 2008–09 season that some observers began to question his defensive commitment. Phaneuf's teammates were quick to defend his play and noted that he was among the League leaders in average time on ice per game. His hitting game has also earned criticism at times. The New York Islanders were especially upset at an open-ice charge Phaneuf delivered to Kyle Okposo during a 2009 exhibition game that resulted in the latter suffering a concussion. Phaneuf has also been criticized for occasionally refusing to fight opponents who challenge him after throwing a big hit. For his part, Phaneuf said he does not believe he should be forced to fight after every big hit, though he would do so when necessary. His coaches have praised Phaneuf's mentality. He has also been accused of playing \"dirty\" and \"stupid\" by opponents who feel that he occasionally takes unnecessary liberties with opposing players. A 2010 Sports Illustrated poll of 229 NHL players saw 21% of respondents name Phaneuf as the most over-rated player in the NHL, three times as many votes as any other player. Phaneuf dismissed the poll while several of his current and former teammates expressed their disagreement with the result.\n\n\nPost-hockey career\nOn February 23, 2022 it was announced that Phaneuf had taken a role with the CBD and vitamin supplements company, CaniBrands, as the company's Strategic Advisor.\n\n\nPersonal life\nPhaneuf began dating Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert in May 2008. Their relationship became the centre of controversy in December 2008 when then-Dallas Stars forward Sean Avery, who had dated Cuthbert in the past, commented on how other NHL players, such as Phaneuf — as well as Los Angeles Kings' centre Jarret Stoll, who was dating model Rachel Hunter, another ex-girlfriend —  fell in love with his \"sloppy seconds\". NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman referred to the remarks as \"disgusting\" and subsequently suspended Avery six games. The Stars later cut ties with Avery permanently.\nPhaneuf and Cuthbert announced their engagement in September 2012, and they married on 6 July 2013 at St. James Catholic Church in Summerfield, Prince Edward Island. As of 2013, he was living in Toronto during the hockey season, Phaneuf and Cuthbert spend their summers at Phaneuf's waterfront estate outside of New London, Prince Edward Island, in his parents' home province. Cuthbert gave birth to a daughter in 2017 and a son in 2022. As of November 2021, Phaneuf and his family had moved to Los Angeles.\nWhile with the Flames, he was the official ambassador to the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary and donated tickets to Flames games to help families at the facility. The Flames named him the recipient of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 2008 in recognition of his participation with the Children's Hospital. Phaneuf has appeared on the cover of the NHL 09 video game, and played a role in NHL promotions and commercials.\nPhaneuf is a fourth cousin of Canadian figure skater Cynthia Phaneuf.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nAll-Star Games\n\n\nAwards and honours\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database, or TSN.ca",

    "text": "The 1st Military Police Brigade (1 MP Bde) is a policing formation of the British Army, which is the only one-star command of the Royal Military Police.  The brigade was formed in 2014 and is commanded by a brigadier.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nArmy 2020\nPrior to December 2014, the military police regiments of the Royal Military Police (RMP) were part of their respective commands: 1st Regiment under 1st (UK) Armoured Division; 2nd Regiment under Headquarters Northern Ireland (reformed in 2006, unknown history after 2007); 3rd Regiment under 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division; 4th Regiment under 101st Logistic Brigade; and 5th Regiment under 102nd Logistic Brigade.  However, under the Army 2020 programme announced in 2013, following the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010, the Royal Military Police was rationalised and completely reorganised, among other things.  Under this reform, the 2nd and 5th Regiments were to disband and their companies either disbanded or transferred to the three remaining regiments (1st, 3rd, and 4th).  These three regiments would become 'hybrid' and 'integrated' police units, each with two regular provost companies and one territorial (reserve from 2015) company.  In addition, the new Special Operations Unit, RMP which stood up in 2014.\nOn formation on 1 December 2014, the brigade was organised as follows:\n\nBrigade Headquarters, at Marlborough Lines, Andover\n1st Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Gaza Barracks, Catterick Garrison\n110 Provost Company, at Leuchars Station\n150 Provost Company, at Beach Head Lines, Catterick Garrison\n243 Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Livingston\n252 Platoon, in Stockton-on-Tees\n3rd Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Wing Barracks, Bulford Camp\n158 Provost Company, at Kiwi Barracks, Bulford Camp\n174 Provost Company, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\n116 Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Cannock\n2 Platoon, in Manchester\n4th Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Provost Barracks, Aldershot Garrison\n160 Provost Company\n156 Provost Company, at Goojerat Barracks, Colchester Garrison – supporting 16th Air Assault Bde\n253 (London) Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Tulse Hill\nSpecial Investigation Branch Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Ward Barracks, Bulford Camp\nNo. 1 Investigation Company, at Imphal Barracks, York\nNo. 2 Investigation Company, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\nNo. 3 Investigation Company\n37 Investigations Section, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\nNo. 4 Investigation (Special Crimes Team) Company\n83 Investigations Section (Army Reserve), at Bulford Camp\n84 Investigations Section (Army Reserve), at Bulford Camp\n85 Investigations Section (Army Reserve), at Bulford Camp\nSpecial Operations Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Longmoor Army Camp – later moved to Southwick Park\nService Police Crime Bureau\nRoyal Military Police Close Protection Unit\nMilitary Provost Staff Corps, at Colchester Garrison\nRegimental Headquarters, at Berechurch Hall Camp\nMilitary Corrective Training Centre, Colchester Garrison\nHeadquarters Company\nSCF Company\nDetention Company\nNo. 1 Company (Army Reserve)\nFrom 2014 until the 2019 Field Army reorganisation, the brigade formed part of Force Troops Command, with the 1st Regiment supporting the 1st UK Division and northern UK operations; 3rd Regiment supporting 3rd UK Division and overseas operations; and 4th Regiment supporting Force Troops command and southern UK operations.\nRather unusually the brigade, unlike the other formations of Force Troops Command, only remained under the command for administrative purposes.  Because of the Royal Military Police's special role, the brigade retained investigative independence from the chain of command, thus being part of Army Headquarters operationally.\nOn 1 December 2014, the brigade headquarters was established with the Provost Marshal (Army) taking control at Marlborough Lines in Andover, Hampshire known as the 1st Military Police Brigade.\n\n\nArmy 2020 Refine\nIn 2017, a supplement to the Army 2020 programme was announced entitled the Army 2020 Refine which reversed many of the unit-level changes of the former.  Under the 'Refine', the 4th Regiment RMP was disbanded in late 2019 and its companies dispersed to the other two remaining regiments\nThe brigade's structure by 2021 was now as follows:\n\n1st Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Gaza Barracks, Catterick Garrison\n110 Provost Company, at Leuchars Station\n150 Provost Company, at Beach Head Lines, Catterick Garrison\n174 Provost Company, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\n116 Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Cannock\n2 Platoon, in Gorton, Manchester\n243 Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Livingston\n252 Platoon, in Stockton-on-Tees\n3rd Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Wing Barracks, Bulford Camp\n158 Provost Company, at Kiwi Barracks, Bulford Camp\n156 Provost Company, at Goojerat Barracks, Colchester Garrison – supporting 16th Air Assault Bde\n160 Provost Company, at Provost Barracks, Aldershot Garrison\n253 (London) Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Tulse Hill\nSpecial Investigation Branch Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Ward Barracks, Bulford Camp\nNo. 1 Investigation Company, at Imphal Barracks, York\nNo. 2 Investigation Company, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\nNo. 3 Investigation Company\n37 Investigations Section, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\nNo. 4 Investigation (Special Crimes Team) Company\n83 Investigations Section (Army Reserve), at Bulford Camp\n84 Investigations Section (Army Reserve), at Bulford Camp\n85 Investigations Section (Army Reserve), at Bulford Camp\nSpecial Operations Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Longmoor Army Camp – later moved to Southwick Park\nService Police Crime Bureau\nRoyal Military Police Close Protection Unit\nMilitary Provost Staff Corps, at Colchester Garrison\nRegimental Headquarters, at Berechurch Hall Camp\nMilitary Corrective Training Centre, Colchester Garrison\nHeadquarters Company\nSCF Company\nDetention Company\nNo. 1 Company (Army Reserve)\nIn 2019, under the 2019 Field Army reorganisation, the entirety of the army's forces were reorganised.  With this reorganisation, the 1st and 3rd Regiments RMP were moved to 101st Logistic Brigade, which was later reverted, and the brigade moved to Regional Command, which was also later reverted.  By 2021, the brigade was re-organised into its pre-2019 structure, and the brigade moved under the administrative command of the 1st (United Kingdom) Division.\n\n\nCurrent organisation\nThe Special Investigation Branch Regiment was disbanded in 2022, and was replaced by the new tri-service Defence Serious Crime Unit.\nThe brigade's structure now consists of:\n\n1st Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Gaza Barracks, Catterick Garrison\n110 Provost Company, at Leuchars Station\n150 Provost Company, at Beach Head Lines, Catterick Garrison\n174 Provost Company, at Parsons Barracks, Donnington\n116 Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Cannock\n2 Platoon, in Gorton, Manchester\n243 Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Livingston\n252 Platoon, in Stockton-on-Tees\n3rd Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Wing Barracks, Bulford Camp\n158 Provost Company, at Kiwi Barracks, Bulford Camp\n156 Provost Company, at Goojerat Barracks, Colchester Garrison – supporting 16th Air Assault Bde\n160 Provost Company, at Provost Barracks, Aldershot Garrison\n253 (London) Provost Company (Army Reserve), in Tulse Hill\nSpecial Operations Regiment, Royal Military Police, at Southwick Park\nService Police Crime Bureau\nRoyal Military Police Close Protection Unit\nMilitary Provost Staff Corps, at Colchester Garrison\nRegimental Headquarters, at Berechurch Hall Camp\nMilitary Corrective Training Centre, Colchester Garrison\nHeadquarters Company\nSCF Company\nDetention Company\nNo. 1 Company (Army Reserve)\n\n\nCommanders\nCommanders of the brigade have all been Provost Marshals and held the title of Provost Marshal (Army) & Commander, 1st Military Police Brigade.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nMinistry of Defence (July 2013).

The fire may have originated from a local Soviet decision to avoid poisonous gas discharge, by burning off the gas, and while geologists had hoped the fire would consume the fuel in a few days, the gas is still burning fifty years later.  \nLocals have named the crater the \"Door to Hell\".\n\n\nSee also\nDarvaza gas crater, the main tourist attraction in the area.\nEnergy policy of the Soviet Union\nEternal Flame Falls\nList of cities, towns and villages in Turkmenistan\nMine fire\nSidoarjo mud flow\nErbent, a nearby town that is also in the Karakum Desert.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nPhotos from the Darvaza Gas Crater or \"Gates of Hell\"\nTourist information for Darvaza\nFlaming Crater, Darvaza Turkmenistan 1/6 - Phillips Connor on YouTube\nPictures and YouTube link\nAu bord du cratère de Darvaza",

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1983 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996.\n\n\nEarly life\nChynoweth was born in Richmond, an inner suburb of Melbourne to a family of Cornish descent.\n\n\nPolitics\nChynoweth first entered federal parliament at the federal election of March 1983, as part of a landslide Labor win under the leadership of Bob Hawke. He was the Labor candidate for the seat of Flinders, based on the outer south eastern fringe of Melbourne. He defeated incumbent Liberal member Peter Reith. Only months earlier Labor had failed to win Flinders, with a different candidate, Rogan Ward, at a by-election held in December 1982. Ward did not become the candidate again due to dissatisfaction with his candidacy at the by-election.\nFollowing a redistribution of electoral boundaries in 1984, Chynoweth opted to contest the seat of Dunkley. He was defeated for Labor preselection by Albert Knowles of the left faction, but the preselection result was overturned by the National Executive's decision to mandate the endorsement of all sitting MPs.\nDunkley was one of a number of new seats created as a consequence of the enlargement of parliament. The seat took in much of the urban area previously covered by Flinders, and was considered a safer bet for a Labor candidate than the redistributed Flinders. (Dunkley was created with a notional two-party margin of Labor 53.2% to Liberal 46.8%. Flinders had a notional post-redistribution two-party margin of Labor 50.7% to Liberal 49.3%.) Chynoweth won the seat of Dunkley at the 1984 federal election and was re-elected in 1987.\nChynoweth was defeated at the 1990 federal election as one of a number of Labor losses in Victoria at that election. However, he was to make a comeback to politics by winning back the seat of Dunkley at the 1993 federal election. He defeated Liberal MP Frank Ford, who had defeated him three years earlier.\nA redistribution that took place ahead of the 1996 federal election transformed Dunkley from a marginal Labor seat into a seat with a notional Liberal majority. Chynoweth re-contested the redistributed Dunkley but lost to Liberal candidate Bruce Billson.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBiography for CHYNOWETH, Robert (Bob) Leslie",

The slogan empowers the contestants to work with an environmental advocacy that is personally significant to them. The phrase is also the name of an award also given by the pageant. The first Beauty for a Cause prize was awarded in 2003.\n\n\nAdvocacy\nThe connotation that all pageant contestants advocates world peace is a stereotype that is no longer true and having a platform is a part of the competition. Since many women around the world admire and aspire to be a beauty queen, Carousel Productions believed beauty queens would be an effective advocate of worthy causes. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that there were about 100,000 beauty contests held each year with more than 2.5 million women competing for a chance to win a beauty title.\nThe Miss Earth pageant raises public awareness about environmental protection and social action to reduce climate change where the delegates of the pageant promotes \"5Rs\", Re-think, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Respect.\nMiss Earth places greater weight on the intellectual abilities of a delegate more than any pageant by electing the winner based largely on her capability to be an effective ambassador of the earth and only secondarily on her beauty. Consequently, the Miss Earth candidates of each participating countries or territories are required to undertake extensive preparation and training in comprehending and addressing environmental issues and problems. The pageant requires the delegates to be knowledgeable about environmental protection, and winners are expected to advocate for and become involved with environmental awareness campaigns worldwide through activities like tree plantings, eco-fashion shows, and coastal clean-ups. The delegates serve as a role model in upholding the advocacy of preserving and restoring the environment.\n\n\nSpecial award\nThe Beauty for a Cause award was first given in the Miss Earth 2003  competition to the candidate who made the most significant social contribution. Miss Afghanistan 2003, Vida Samadzai, received the award for helping found a US-based women's charity that seeks to raise awareness of women's rights and education in Afghanistan by “symbolizing the newfound confidence, courage and spirit of today’s women and representing the victory of women’s rights and various social, personal and religious struggles”. The award was then discontinued for three years.\nThe award was reinstated in the finals of Miss Earth 2007 to honor the delegate with the most significant contribution in the preservation and protection of the environment. Miss South Africa Bokang Montjane was the second recipient of the Beauty for a Cause award, given at the conclusion of the 7th edition of Miss Earth pageant that took place on November 11, 2007 at the University of the Philippines Theater in Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines.\n\nIn 2020, Miss Australia Brittany Dickson, a veterinarian and brain cancer survivor received the Eco Angel Special Award, the equivalent of Beauty for a Cause award in the Miss Earth 2020 pageant.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\"Feminism, Beauty Pageants And The Environment\"Fernando, Emmanuel Q.
