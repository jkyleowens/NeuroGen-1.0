Tamatepō had twin sons:\n\nRauakiuta\nRongomai - Ancestor of Rongo-Ū\nRauakitai\nMohoao - Ancestor of the hapū Ngāti Te Aute\nAccording to Te Ahukaramū Royal, it was after the death of Marutūahu that Tamatepō's mana was diminished and his line faded into obscurity. Tamatepō's twin sons had a whakataukī in their name: \"Te kanohi o to tokorua, e kore e kitea\" - \"The both of the one likeness, who were never seen\".\nTamatepō married a Ngāti Huarere woman, whose name was Rangiuru or Rongomai, and is said to have been a slave. Hence Tamatepō's subsequent banishment back to Kāwhia, and the loss of mana and the mantle of Marutūahu's mauri. It wasn't until the time of Rongomai, that notice and mana came back to the line of Tamatepō. The name Rongo-Ū is a commemoration of this: \"Ngāti Rongo-Ū\" - \"The descendants of Rongomai now established\".\nHowever, according to some of Tamatepō's descendants, Rangiuru was a highly-born woman of Ngāti Huarere.\nAnother notable descendant of Tamatepō was Kairangatira, son of Mohoao, who was chosen to lead the siege of Oruarangi Pā, after the wife of Tāurukapakapa (the youngest son of Marutūahu) was murdered by her own people. Kairangatira himself was later murdered by Ngāti Huarere near Kupata Stream. Tāurukapakapa was also murdered.\n\n\nWhakapapa\nThe rangatira of Ngāti Rongo-Ū, Te Aotūtahanga and Manukaihongi were grandsons of Rongomai.\n\nTamatepō\nRauakiuta\nRongomai\nTe Akatāwhia, married Māhanga\nTe Aotūtahanga\nManukaihongi\nRauakitai\nMohoao\nKairangatira, married Paretao, daughter of Rautao\nPakira\nPoutangi, married Te Aute, a descendant of Takakōpiri of Waitaha, and the second marriage of Hotunui\n\n\nSee also\nList of Māori iwi\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Pasha",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=22041583",
    "text": "Pasha (Ottoman Turkish: پاشا; Turkish: paşa; Arabic: باشا, romanized: basha) was a high rank in the Ottoman political and military system, typically granted to governors, generals, dignitaries, and others. Pasha was also one of the highest titles in the 20th-century Kingdom of Egypt and it was also used in Morocco in the 20th century, where it denoted a regional official or governor of a district.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe English word pasha comes from Turkish pasha (pāşā; also basha (bāşā)). The Oxford English Dictionary attributes the origin of the English borrowing to the mid-17th century. The etymology of the Turkish word itself has been a matter of debate. Contrary to titles like emir (amīr) and bey (sir), which were established in usage much earlier, the title pasha came into Ottoman usage right after the reign of Osman I (d. 1324), though it had been used before the Ottomans by some Anatolian Turkish rulers of the same era. Old Turkish had no fixed distinction between /b/ and /p/, and the word was spelled başa still in the 15th century.\nAccording to Online Etymology Dictionary, the Turkish pasha or basha was itself from Turkish baş / bash (باش 'head, chief'), itself from Old Persian pati- ('master', from Proto-Indo-European *poti) and the root of the Persian word shah, شاه. According to Oxford Dictionaries, the Turkish word from which it was borrowed was formed as a result of the combination of the Pahlavi words pati- 'lord', and shah (𐭬𐭫𐭪𐭠). According to Josef W. Meri and Jere L. Bacharach, the word is \"more than likely derived from the Persian Padishah\" (پادشاه). The same view is held by Nicholas Ostler, who mentions that the word was formed as a shortening of the Persian word padishah. Jean Deny also attributed its origin to padishah, while repeating a suggestion by Gerhard Doerfer that it was influenced by Turkic baskak (bāsqāq), meaning 'agent, tax collector'.\nSome theories have posited a Turkish or Turkic origin of the word, claiming it derived from başağa (bāş āghā), which denoted a 'principal elder brother' or 'prince's elder son' in the pre-Ottoman period. According to etymologist Sevan Nişanyan, the word is derived from Turkish beşe (بچّه 'boy, prince'), which is cognate with Persian bačče (بچّه). Some earlier Turkish lexicographers, such as Ahmed Vefik Paşa and Mehmed Salahi, argued it was most likely derived from Turkish başa or Turkish beşe, the latter meaning 'elder brother' and being a title given to some Ottoman provincial officials and janissaries.\nAs first used in western Europe, the title appeared in writing with an initial b. The English forms bashaw, bassaw, bucha, etc., general in the 16th and 17th century, derive through the medieval Latin and Italian word bassa. Due to the Ottoman presence in the Arab world, the title became used frequently in Arabic, though pronounced basha due to the absence of the /p/ sound in Arabic.\n\n\nRole in Ottoman and Egyptian political system\n\nWithin the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan had the right to bestow the title of Pasha. Lucy Mary Jane Garnett wrote in the 1904 work Turkish Life in Town and Country that it was the sole \"Turkish title which carries with it any definite rank and precedence\".\nIt was through this custom that the title (Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [ˈbæːʃæ]) came to be used in Egypt, which was conquered by the Ottomans in 1517. The rise to power in Egypt in 1805 by Muhammad Ali, an Albanian military commander, effectively established Egypt as a de facto independent state; however, it still owed technical fealty to the Ottoman Sultan. Moreover, Muhammad Ali harboured ambitions of supplanting the Osman Dynasty in Constantinople (now Istanbul), and sought to style his Egyptian realm as a successor sultanate to the Ottoman Empire. As such, he bore the title of Pasha, in addition to the official title of Wāli, and the self-declared title of Khedive. His successors to the Egyptian and Sudanese throne, Ibrahim, Abbas, Sa'id, and Isma'il also inherited these titles, with Pasha, and Wāli ceasing to be used in 1867, when the Ottoman Sultan, Abdülaziz officially recognised Isma'il as Khedive.\nThe title Pasha appears originally to have applied exclusively to military commanders and only high ranking family of the sultans, but subsequently it could distinguish any high official, and also unofficial persons whom the court desired to honour.\nIt was also part of the official style of the Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral of the Ottoman fleet).\nPashas ranked above Beys and Aghas, but below Khedives and Viziers.\nThree grades of Pasha existed, distinguished by the number of horse tails (three, two, and one respectively; a symbol of Turco-Mongol tradition) or peacock tails that the bearers were entitled to display on their standard as a symbol of military authority when on campaign. Only the sultan himself was entitled to four tails, as sovereign commander in chief.\nThe following military ranks entitled the holder to the style Pasha (lower ranks were styled Bey or merely Effendi):\n\nThe Vizier-i-Azam (Grand Vizier, the prime minister, but also often taking the field as Generalissimo instead of the Sultan)\nMushir (Field marshal)\nFerik (army lieutenant-general or navy vice-admiral)\nLiva (major general or rear-admiral)\nThe Kizlar Agha (chief black eunuch, the highest officer in the Topkapı Palace; three tails, as commander of the baltadji corps of the halberdiers in the imperial army\nConstantinople's Shaikh ul-Islam, the highest Muslim clergyman, of cabinet rank.\nIf a Pasha governed a provincial territory, it could be called a pashaluk after his military title, besides the administrative term for the type of jurisdiction, e.g. eyalet, vilayet/walayah. Both beylerbeys (governors-general) and valis/wālis (the most common type of Governor) were entitled to the style of Pasha (typically with two tails). The word pashalik designated any province or other jurisdiction of a Pasha, such as the Pasha or Bashaw of Tripoli.\nOttoman and Egyptian authorities conferred the title upon both Muslims and Christians without distinction. They also frequently gave it to foreigners in the service of the Ottoman Empire, or of the Egyptian Khedivate (later Sultanate, and Kingdom in turn), e.g. Hobart Pasha. In an Egyptian context, the Abaza Family is known as \"the family of the pashas\" for having produced the largest number of nobles holding this title under the Muhammad Ali dynasty and was noted in Egyptian media in 2014 as one of the main \"families that rule Egypt\" to this day, and as \"deeply rooted in Egyptian society and… in the history of the country.\"\n\n\nHonorific\nAs an honorific, the title pasha was an aristocratic title and could be hereditary or non-hereditary, stipulated in the firman (patent of nobility) issued by the Sultan carrying the tughra (imperial seal). The title did not bestow rank or title to the wife nor was any religious leader elevated to the title. In contrast to western nobility titles, where the title normally is added before the given name, Ottoman titles followed the given name. In contacts with foreign emissaries and representatives, holders of the title Pasha were often referred to as \"Your Excellency\".\nThe sons of a Pasha were styled Pashazada or Pashazade.\nIn modern Egyptian and (to a lesser extent) Levantine Arabic, it is used as an honorific closer to \"Sir\" than \"Lord\", especially by older people. Among Egyptians born since the Revolution of 1952 and the abolition of aristocratic titles, it is considered a highly formal way of addressing one's male peers.\nThe Grand National Assembly of Turkey abolished the title Paşa, along with all other titles and nicknames, through Law No. 2590, known as the Law on the Abolition of Titles and Nicknames, enacted on November 26, 1934 Although Paşa title is no longer an official title, generals of the Turkish Armed Forces are often unofficially referred to as Paşa along with General by the Turkish public and media.\nIn the French Navy, \"pasha\" (pacha in French) is the nickname of the Commanding Officer, similar to the term \"skipper\" in the Anglophone navies.\n\n\nList of notable pashas\n\nThe inclusion criterion is that the person held the rank of \"pasha\" in his society\n\nAbaza Family, Egyptian Pashas and Beys\nAbbas I of Egypt\nAbbas II of Egypt\nAli Pasha, multiple people\nAli Pasha Mubarak\nAndranik Pasha\nBaker Pasha (Valentine Baker)\nBarbarossa Khair ad-Din Pasha\nBucknam Pasha (Ransford Dodsworth Bucknam)\nAhmed Pasha (Claude Alexandre de Bonneval)\nCigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha\nDjemal Pasha\nPargalı Ibrahim Pasha (\"Ibrahim Pasha of Parga\"), also known as Frenk Ibrahim Pasha (\"the Westerner\"), Makbul Ibrahim Pasha (\"the Favorite\") and Maktul Ibrahim Pasha (\"the Executed\")\nDragut, Ottoman Naval Commander & Pasha of Tripoli\nEl-Emam family\nEmin Pasha\nEnver Pasha\nEssad Pasha Toptani\nFakhri Pasha\nFekry Pasha Abaza\nFuad Pasha\nGessi Pasha (Romolo Gessi)\nGlubb Pasha (Sir John Bagot Glubb)\nGordon Pasha (Charles George Gordon)\nGuyon Pasha, (General Richard Guyon), also known as Kurshid Pasha.\nHabib Abdoe'r Rahman Alzahier\nHagop Kazazian Pasha\nHajji Mustafa Pasha\nHobart Pasha (Augustus Charles Hobart-Hampden)\nHüseyin Tevfik Pasha, arms and algebra expert.\nHussein Refki Pasha\nIbrahim Edhem Pasha\nİsmet Pasha (İsmet İnönü)\nJa'far Pasha al-Askari, founder of the modern Iraqi army.\nJamal Pasha\nJudar Pasha, Moroccan general.\nKara Mustafa Pasha\nHicks Pasha (William Hicks), British Colonel, Hero of the Mahdist Wars.\nKazazian Pasha\nKilic Ali Pasha\nMultiple members of the Köprülü family\nLala Kara Mustafa Pasha\nLiman von Sanders Pasha (Otto Liman von Sanders)\nGoltz Pasha (Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz)\nMahmud Dramali Pasha, Ottoman general\nMarcus Simaika Pasha, Egyptian Coptic leader, politician\nMehmet Esat Bülkat\nMehmed Pasha Sokolović\nMeissner Pasha (Heinrich August Meissner)\nMelling Pasha (Antoine Ignace Melling)\nMidhat Pasha\nMüezzinzade Ali Pasha, Ottoman admiral.\nMuhammad Ali Pasha, viceroy of Egypt\nMustafa Kemal Pasha, subsequently known as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the post-Ottoman Turkish republic.\nMustafa Reshid Pasha\nNaguib Pasha Mahfouz, is known as the father of obstetrics and gynaecology in Egypt and was a pioneer in obstetric fistula.\nNubar Pasha\nNuri Pasha al-Said, Iraqi political premier of the Kingdom of Iraq.\nOsman Pasha\nOmar Pasha Latas\nPiyale Pasha\nQassim Pasha Al Zuhair, Pasha of basra and Kuwait.\nRadu Bey, Pasha of Wallachia, Brother of Vlad III Tepes\nRefet Bele\nRegep Aga\nRiyad Pasha, Egyptian statesman.\nRussell Pasha, British officer in the Egyptian police.\nRüstem Pasha the longest serving Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire.\nSaid Pasha\nŞerif Pasha, Kurdish nationalist.\nSentot Prawirodirdjo, known as \"Alibasah Sentot\" or \"Sentot Ali Pasha\".

In 1658 he entered Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner, and was elected a scholar in 1659.\nAbout 1670, Lake became chaplain and tutor to the princesses Mary and Anne, the daughters of James, Duke of York. He was made prebendary of Exeter Cathedral on 13 December 1675, and archdeacon of Exeter on 24 Oct. 1676. In 1676 he was created D.D. at Cambridge by royal mandate. On 5 January 1681,, he was elected a brother of St. Katharine's Hospital, of which he was also a commissary, resigning in 1698. On 30 November 1682 he was instituted to the rectory of St. Mary-at-Hill, to which was annexed in 1700 that of St. Andrew Hubbard.\nLake was an admired preacher. He died on 1 February 1704, and was buried in St. Katharine, Tower Hill, where there was an inscribed monument.\n\n\nWorks\nLake wrote, for the use of his royal pupils, Officium Eucharisticum. A preparatory service to a devout and worthy reception of the Lord's Supper, London, 1673, which reached a thirtieth edition in 1753. In 1843 it was republished at Oxford with a preface by Albany James Christie. In the later editions the text underwent alterations; the Meditation for every Day in the Week appended to the third (1677) and subsequent editions seems to have been written by another divine. The Prayers before, at, and after the Holy Communion were reprinted in Theophilus Dorrington's Reform'd Devotions, 1700, 1704, 1727.\nLake's Diary in 1677–8 was edited in 1846 by George Percy Elliott, for vol. i. of the Camden Society's Miscellany.

    "text": "A narrative typically ends in one set way, but certain kinds of narrative allow for multiple endings.\n\n\nComics\nThe Death-Ray by Daniel Clowes\nCliff Hanger by Jack Edward Oliver\n\n\nLiterature\n\nThe Choose Your Own Adventure series\nFighting Fantasy\nLife's Lottery\nThe French Lieutenant's Woman\n\n\nTheater\nAyn Rand's 1934 play Night of January 16th allowed the audience to affect the ending by acting as the \"jury\" and voting the defendant \"innocent\" or \"guilty\".\nThe 1985 musical The Mystery of Edwin Drood\nDario Fo's 1970 play, Accidental Death of an Anarchist\nThe long-running play Shear Madness has multiple, audience-selected endings.\n\n\nFilms\nDVDs and Blu-ray discs may include an alternate ending as a special feature. These are usually not considered canon.\nFilms which include multiple endings within the main cut of the film:\n\nClue\nWayne's World and its sequel, Wayne's World 2\nScarface\nSliding Doors\nRun Lola Run\nHarikrishnans\nThe Messiah, which includes one account of Jesus' crucifixion according to Christian teaching and one according to Muslim teaching.\n28 Days Later\nUnfriended: Dark Web\nBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\n1408\n\n\nTelevision\nCrown Court\nDo the Right Thing (BBC TV series, 1994-1995)\n\n\nAnimation\nDragon's Lair and Space Ace\nThe fifth season finale of the Rooster Teeth web-series, Red vs. Blue\n\n\nVideo games\nVideo games, as an interactive medium, allow for a wide variety of outcomes. Especially nonlinear video games such as visual novels, role-playing games and interactive dramas often feature multiple endings. Multiple endings may increase a game's replay value, encourage customization or deviate from the story in the form of easter eggs. As such, these video games often, but not always, feature one or multiple \"true\" or \"good endings\" which are canonized either by the developer or player base as well as \"false\" or \"bad endings\".\n\n\nRole-playing video games\n\nMultiple endings can be an integral part of many visual novels and role-playing games as these genres often emphasize customization and individuality. \nExamples of role-playing games that feature multiple endings:\n\nChrono Trigger, which was cited as revolutionary for including multiple endings when it released in 1995.\nBaldur's Gate 3, which features four distinct major endings. Larian Studios announced that there were 17,000 possible endings ahead of the game's release.\nCyberpunk 2077, which features four canon endings with one additional one being introduced with the downloadable content Phantom Liberty. There is one more \"false ending\" in which the protagonist commits suicide ahead of the finale, and another secret ending which only becomes available after waiting five minutes before choosing a dialogue option.\nMass Effect 3's endings were cause for controversy. Players felt their character choices felt inconsequential and criticized the game's endings for its lack of closure and inconsistencies.\nThe Dragon Age series includes a variety of impactful choices the player can make throughout the games with typically one major one at the end. In Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Inquisition, players are able to import their save files from previous games to alter the games' world building, flavor text for multiple characters and events, and appearances from recurring characters, allowing for a player-specific canon. For the fourth installment in the series, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, developer BioWare changed this system so that players could now reflect the previous games' different endings directly in the game's character creator.\nPapers Please includes 20 endings in the game. The players choices throughout the game such as if he lets EZIC agents get through or if he accepts bribes influences which ending he will get, without giving the player too much of an idea about what decisions cause which endings which results in the players getting immersed in the game.\n\n\nChoice-driven video games\nMultiple endings are a common feature in \"choice-driven\" games in which decisions made by the player serve as the main gameplay loop. These games are usually adventure or storytelling games whose ending or sometimes even entire story changes depending on the player's active, in the form of dialogue options, or passive choices, such as games with moral systems. \nExamples of choice-driven games that feature multiple endings:\n\nLife Is Strange, which includes two canon endings. Players can choose either to save the protagonist's home town from a tornado while sacrificing her implied love interest or vice versa.\nLife Is Strange 2, which, unlike its predecessor, also takes previous choices the player has made into consideration in the form of a \"moral system\" for its seven endings.\nDetroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls and many more games created by Quantic Dream feature multiple endings depending on the player's choices.\nUntil Dawn, The Quarry and The Casting of Frank Stone all feature multiple endings for each of their large cast of protagonists, a common trope in  Supermassive Games.\nTelltale Games are known for featuring a variety of different endings in their story-based games such as their The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones video game adaptations.\n\n\nMultiple endings as a gameplay mechanic\nSome video games revolve their entire story around the concept of multiple endings and utilize them as a gameplay mechanic. This is done either chronologically, whereby the player experiences a game's ending multiple times but through different point-of-views, or through \"knowledge-gating\" in which all endings are achievable from the start but have to be deduced through trial and error or through experiencing the game's other endings.\nExamples of video games that feature endings as a gameplay mechanic:\n\nThe Stanley Parable, which features eighteen different endings.\nThe Talos Principle and its sequel.\nNier and Nier Automata, which require the player to finish the game multiple times before reaching their \"true endings\". Each subsequent playthrough unlocks new content in the form of cutscenes or playable characters.\n\n\nSee also\nAlternate ending\nInteractive fiction\nVisual novel\n\n\nReferences",

He served as the director of various companies in the food sector, was involved in the promotion of Opus Dei's schools, and managed some agricultural schools (EFA).\n\n\nBackground and education\n\n\nAcademic background\nHe pursued his initial studies at the school in Vallfogona de Balaguer (Lleida) and continued them at the Brothers of La Salle school in Reus. In Terrassa, he pursued studies in Industrial Technical Engineering, complementing his academic background with a master's degree from Esade and the Senior Management Program (PADE) at IESE (Barcelona).\n\n\nProfessional trajectory\nHis professional career began at the companies Agut S.A. (Terrassa) and Samí (Balaguer). In 1969, he joined Granja Castelló (Mollerusa), and later was appointed director of the factory at Lecherías del Noroeste S.A (LENOSA) in León, where he worked for nine years. In 1977, he returned to Mollerussa as the Managing Director of Leche el Castillo, a position he held until 1991. On January 1, 1992, he joined Nestlé AEPA and took on the role of Managing Director of Productos del Café S.A. (Reus).\nParallel to his professional work, in 1979 he became part of the founding group of the Arabell school, which at that time belonged to Opus Dei's Fomento de Centros de Enseñanza. He was actively involved in launching the educational institution, which began its journey (September 15, 1979) provisionally in Raimat, an elegant modernist building that had been used for years as the school for girls in the town. The school moved to its permanent location on October 2, 1980, on the road from Lleida to Huesca.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1965, he married Roser Simó Cima, with whom he had eleven children: María de los Ángeles, María del Carmen, Roser, Jaime, Toni, Josep, Jordi, Kiko, Rafa, Mariona, and Joan.\nIn May 1980, he applied for admission to Opus Dei as a Supernumerary member. Upon his passing, his friends and colleagues compiled about a hundred tributes in a book titled \"Pepe Serret: Recuerdos de sus amigos\" (Pepe Serret: Memories from his friends). Years later, the first biography of Pepe Serret would be published: \"Himno a la vida, 1ª ed., 2000. Biografía del empresario Josep Serret Borda (1941-1993)\" (Hymn to Life, 1st ed., 2000.

    "text": "Major Sir John Hubert Ward  (20 March 1870 – 2 December 1938) was a British army officer and courtier.\n\n\nEarly life\nWard was the second son of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley by his wife Georgina Elizabeth née Moncreiffe. His paternal grandfather was William Humble Ward, 10th Baron Ward and his maternal grandfather was Sir Thomas Moncreiffe, 7th Baronet.\nFollowing his father's death in 1885, his brother, William Humble Ward, succeeded as the 2nd Earl of Dudley. His other siblings included Robert Ward, a member of parliament for Crewe. All six sons of the 1st Earl received half a million dollars upon their father's death.\nWard was educated at Eton College.\n\n\nCareer\nHe was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Worcestershire Yeomanry (The Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars) on 11 January 1900, and served in the Second Boer War 1900–1901, as an aide to Major Gen. John Palmer Brabazon. He was promoted to lieutenant, and later fought in the First World War and gained the rank of major.\nIn 1901, Ward was the Assistant Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the War Office, Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. Ward served as an Equerry to four successive British monarchs. He was appointed Equerry to King Edward VII 28 February 1902, and served until the King's death in 1910. He was then an Extra Equerry to King George V 1910–1936, to King Edward VIII in 1936, and to King George VI from 1937 until the following year, when he died.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nWard's engagement to Jean Templeton Reid (1884–1962) was announced in April 1908. She was the daughter of Whitelaw Reid, American ambassador to the United Kingdom, sister of Ogden Mills Reid, a New York publisher, the granddaughter of Darius Ogden Mills, an American financier, and the niece of Ogden Mills, a prominent New York Society man. Ward and Reid met through George Holford, also equerry-in-waiting to the King.\nOn 23 June 1908, the 38-year-old Ward married Reid at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in a ceremony attended by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. The wedding was celebrated at Dorchester House, and was one of the greatest society events of the year. Together, the couple had two sons:\n\nEdward John Sutton Ward,  (1909–1990), who married Margaret Susan Corbett (d. 1981) in 1934. After her death, he married Marion Elizabeth Jessie Clover (d. 1997), the former wife of William Romilly, 4th Baron Romilly, in 1986. His godfather was King Edward VII.\nAlexander Reginald Ward (1914–1987), a Justice of the Peace for Berkshire between 1941 and 1947, who married Ilona Hollos in 1946. They divorced in 1959 and he married Zena Moyra Marshall in 1967. They divorced 1969 and he married Constance Cluett Sage. He was one of the founders of Chilton Aircraft.\nThe Wards had a country estate, known as Chilton, in Hungerford, Berkshire. Ward died at his home, Dudley House in London, on 2 December 1938. Lady Ward died in 1962.\n\n\nAwards and honours\nHe was decorated with the award of the Officer of French Legion of Honour, Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic of Spain, Commander of the Order of Zähringer Löwen of Baden, and Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark.\nWard was also invested as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order and as an Officer of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPhotograph of Sir John Hubert Ward; Hon.

    "text": "Warren County is a county located in the south central portion of the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 134,554, making it the fifth-most populous county in Kentucky. The county seat is Bowling Green. Warren County is now classified as a wet county after voters approved the measure in 2018. The measure became law in January 2019 that allows alcohol to be sold county wide.\nWarren County is included in the Bowling Green, KY Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located in the Pennyroyal Plateau and Western Coal Fields regions.\n\n\nHistory\nWarren County was the location of several Native American villages and ancient burial mounds constructed by earlier cultures. The first white men to enter the area were the long hunters in the 1770s. General Elijah Covington was among the first landowners. McFadden's Station, one of the earliest settlements, was established in 1785 by Andrew McFadden/McFadin on the northern bank of the Barren River at the Cumberland Trace.\nWarren County became the 23rd county of Kentucky in 1796, from a section of Logan County. It was named after General Joseph Warren of the Revolutionary War. He dispatched William Dawes and Paul Revere on their famous midnight ride to warn residents of the approaching British troops. He was also a hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill.\nThrough riverboat trade, Warren County thrived in the agricultural market. In 1859, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (currently CSX Transportation) was laid through the county.\nDuring the Civil War, most residents are said to have favored the Union. Because of its strategic value, Warren County was occupied by Confederate forces in September 1861. It was occupied in turn by the Union Army on February 14, 1862, following the Confederate retreat to Tennessee. During the Confederate withdrawal, they destroyed railroad bridges in Barren County, the Bowling Green train depot and other railroad buildings to hinder Union pursuit.\nThe completion of Interstate 65 and Green River Parkway, later renamed the William H. Natcher Parkway, (and in 2019 was renamed as the I-165) in the 1960s and 1970s, brought an industrial boom that transformed the farm-oriented county into a more urban one.\nIn 1997, Bowling Green became a Tree City USA, sponsored by the National Arbor Day Foundation.\n\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 548 square miles (1,420 km2), of which 542 square miles (1,400 km2) is land and 6.0 square miles (16 km2) (1.1%) is water.\n\n\nGeographic features\nThe Green River forms the northern boundary of the county, and was a means of transportation for settlers. Tributaries of the Green River that flow through Warren County are the Barren and Gasper rivers, Drake's and Jennings creeks and Bay's Fork. In the north the land is possibly the most rugged, since it lies between the Green and Barren rivers, with very tall ridges near Riverside and Richardsville. The major drainage in Warren county is Barren River, which flows through Bowling Green and is surrounded by steep ridges in some areas. Several sizable hills rise in Bowling Green proper. They were favored for forts and other development: a reservoir, hospital, and Civil War fort were built on one; much of Western Kentucky University's campus on another; Hobson Grove, a historic Italian Renaissance style civil war era plantation estate on another; and a second civil war fort on another. In the east the land is rolling (much like central Kentucky's landscape) near Drakes Creek. The land in the south and southwest of the county is predominantly flat. In the western side of the county, the land is hilly with steep ridges and rocky and cliff-ridden near Gasper River. Shanty Hollow Lake is in the northwest corner of the county.\nThe flat elevated areas in the west and the flatland in the south and southwest have soil that is fertile and supports tobacco, hay, corn and soybean crop production. The rest of the land is predominantly clay soil; it is rocky and not very suitable for agriculture. Many residents rear livestock and horses, or hunt in these areas.\n\n\nTransit\nGO bg Transit\nTopper Transit\n\n\nMajor highways\n\n\nAdjacent counties\nButler County - northwest\nEdmonson County - northeast\nBarren County - east\nAllen County - southeast\nSimpson County - south\nLogan County - southwest\n\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 92,522 people, 35,365 households and 23,411 families residing in the county.

The regiment served in Hawaii during World War I, 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 9th Divisions between the world wars, and with 3rd Infantry Division during World War II and Korea. Since 1957, the regiment has been a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System and the U.S. Army Regimental System, with regimental elements serving with the 3rd, 4th, 10th, 25th, 79th, 83rd, and 96th Infantry Divisions and various field artillery brigades and groups. The regiment's single active component, the 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment, is assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division and stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.\n\n\nCurrent status of regimental elements\n1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - active, assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division\n2nd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - inactive since 25 February 1991\n3rd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - inactive since 15 June 1996\n4th Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - inactive since 15 August 1990\n5th Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - inactive since 15 February 1963\n6th Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - inactive since 1 October 1983\n7th Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment - inactive since 1 September 1995\n\n\nHistory\nThe 9th Field Artillery Regiment was formed from elements of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment in Hawaii in 1916. By 1919, the regiment was stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The regiment was inactivated there on 1 September 1921. Although the regimental headquarters was inactive from 1921 through 1927, the regiment's 1st Battalion was active from 1922 to 1927, with elements at Fort Des Moines, Iowa and Fort Riley, Kansas. Although inactive, the regiment was reassigned from the 7th Division to the 9th Division in 1927. The regiment was reorganized as a 75mm gun regiment in 1927 in the Seventh Corps Area, and Organized Reserve personnel assigned to the unit trained at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin in 1927 and at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1928–9. In 1930, the regiment was allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, reassigned from the 9th Division to the 4th Division, and changed into a motorized 155mm howitzer unit, but never organized in the Fourth Corps Area. The regiment's 1st Battalion was activated in 1930 at Fort Lewis, Washington. In 1933, the regiment was withdrawn from the Fourth Corps Area and allotted to the 9th Corps Area, and reassigned from the 4th Division to the 3rd Division. The regiment's 2nd Battalion was activated in 1939, joining the 1st Battalion at Fort Lewis. The 3rd Battalion was disbanded in 1939 (apparently without ever being organized). On 1 October 1940, the regiment was reorganized as the 9th Field Artillery Battalion as part of the Army's conversion to triangular divisions which eliminated field artillery regiments from the force structure in favor of independent battalions.\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe 9th Field Artillery Battalion departed Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation, Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 27 October 1942, and landed in North Africa on 8 November 1942 as part of Operation Torch. As the division artillery's 155mm general support unit, one battery of the battalion landed with each regimental landing group.\nIn January 1944, the 9th FA was in Quiliano in Italy and later rest near Naples.\nSection Under Development\n\n\nKorea\nSection Under Development\n\n\nFurther service by regimental elements\n\nThe 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment served with the 3rd Infantry Division from 1957 to 1971.

    "text": "The Treaty of Tientsin, also known as the Treaty of Tianjin, is a collective name for several unequal treaties signed at Tianjin (then romanized as Tientsin) in June 1858.  The Qing dynasty, Russian Empire, Second French Empire, United Kingdom, and the United States were the parties involved. These treaties, counted by the Chinese among the unequal treaties, opened more Chinese ports to foreign trade, permitted foreign legations in the Chinese capital Beijing, allowed Christian missionary activity, and effectively legalized the import of opium. They ended the first phase of the Second Opium War, which had begun in 1856 and were ratified by the Emperor of China in the Convention of Peking in 1860, after the end of the war.\n\n\nDates\nThe Xianfeng Emperor authorized negotiations for the treaty on May 29, 1858. His chief representatives were the Manchu Guiliang and the Mongol Huashana. The Russian treaty was negotiated by Yevfimiy Putyatin and finalized on June 13; the American treaty was negotiated by William Bradford Reed and finalized on June 18; the British treaty was negotiated by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, and finalized on June 26; and the French treaty was negotiated by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gros and finalized on June 27.\n\n\nAmerican involvement\nFollowing the pattern set by the great powers of Europe, the United States took on a protectionist stance, built up its navy, and tried to create a mercantile empire. The United States was one of the leading \"treaty powers\" in China, forcing open a total of 23 foreign concessions from the Chinese government. While it is often noted that the United States did not control any settlements in China, it shared British land grants and was actually invited to take land in Shanghai but refused because the land was thought to be disadvantageous.\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nMajor points\nRussia, which had previously been limited to trading at designated border posts, received the right to trade with the treaty ports by sea. Most-favored nation clauses in each treaty further ensured that all concessions were shared by the four powers.\nGuangzhou and the four treaty ports opened to foreign trade and residence by the Treaty of Nanjing were joined by Tainan, Haikou, Shantou, Haicheng, Penglai, Tamsui, and (notionally) Nanjing. The ports at Haicheng and Penglai being found inadequate for European vessels, their status was later extended to nearby Yantai and Yingkou, effectively opening another two ports.\nChina was forbidden from considering Russian Orthodox, Protestant, and Roman Catholic Christianity, whether practiced by foreigners or Chinese converts, to be a harmful superstition. All laws, regulations, and practices limiting its observance became null and void everywhere in the country.\nThe extraterritoriality of American citizens and Russian, British, and French subjects was reaffirmed. They further received the right to travel throughout the Qing Empire for pleasure or business so long as they possessed a valid passport, but the Qing Empire was able to prevent them from lawfully residing in the interior with extraterritoriality.\nThe Qing Empire permitted foreign vessels to navigate on the Yangtze River but established that no legal trade would be permitted with areas held by the Taiping Rebellion until their reconquest. Foreign trade was to be limited to Zhenjiang, pledged to be opened within the year, and a further three ports to be opened after the suppression of the Taipings. This clause was later used to establish treaty ports at Wuhan and Jiujiang.\nThe four nations gained the right to station permanent diplomatic legations in Beijing, which had previously been a closed city. The Russians' ecclesiastical mission in Beijing was also exempted from its previous restrictions.\nChina was forbidden from using the character 夷 (understood to mean \"barbarian\") in official documents to refer to officials, subjects, or citizens of the four nations.\nChina was forbidden from establishing or permitting any further monopolies or cartels over its domestic trade.\nAddenda to the treaties settled China's duties and tariffs on terms advantageous to the victors and pledged the Qing Empire would pay an indemnity of 6,000,000 taels of silver: 2 million to France, 2 million to Britain for military expenses, and 2 million as compensation to British merchants.\n\n\nDefinitions\nThe Treaties of Tientsin use several words that have somewhat ambiguous meanings. For example, the words \"settlement\" and \"concession\" can often be confused. The term \"settlement\" refers to a parcel of land, leased to a foreign power, which is composed of both foreign and national peoples, and governed by locally elected foreigners.  The term \"concession\" refers to a long-term lease of land to a foreign power, under which the foreign nation has complete control of the land, which is governed by consular representatives.\n\n\nSee also\n\nUnequal treaty\nImperialism in Asia\n19th-century Protestant missions in China\nWilliam Bradford Reed\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nPrimary sources\nBruce, James; et al.

    "text": "David John Teece  (born September 2, 1948) is a New Zealand-born US-based organizational economist, Professor emeritus in Global Business and director of the Tusher Center for the Management of Intellectual Capital at the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and  as of 2024, Distinguished Scholar of Strategy and Innovation at the University of South Florida Muma College of Business.\nTeece is the executive chairman emeritus and cofounder of Berkeley Research Group, an expert services and consulting firm headquartered in Emeryville, California. His areas of interest include corporate strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation, competition policy, and intellectual property. He is also founding general partner of a venture capital firm, Pilatus Capital.\n\n\nBiography\nTeece grew up in Blenheim and Nelson, New Zealand and attended Waimea College before enrolling in 1967 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch (now the site of the Christchurch Arts Centre), where he earned a bachelor's degree and a Master of Commerce degree.\nHe moved to the United States to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received a Ph.D. in economics, specializing in industrial economics, international trade, and technological innovation. Two members of the Economics faculty had a particular influence on his research that he later acknowledged in articles he wrote in tribute to each of them: Edwin Mansfield, a pioneer in the study of industrial R&D and the economics of technological change; and Oliver Williamson, Nobel Laureate and creator of Transaction Cost Economics.\nTeece taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1975 until 1982, when he was hired by the Haas School of Business at U.C. Berkeley, where he is a chaired professor. He has published more than 200 academic articles and more than a dozen books, and Google Scholar notes that he has been cited at least 170,000 times. He co-founded and serves on the editorial board of two academic journals: Industrial & Corporate Change  (Oxford University Press) and the Russian Management Journal. He is also the Executive Director of Berkeley Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization.\nAfter the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the couple offered a substantial donation to the city for earthquake recovery. The money was used by his former university to install the classics and music school in the Old Chemistry building at the Christchurch Arts Centre. In 2017, 40 years after its move from the Christchurch Central City to the Ilam campus, the University of Canterbury returned to its original home, and opened The Teece Museum of Classical Antiques in May 2017. The Townsend Teece restored telescope has been restored for placement in the university's observatory in Christchurch.\nTeece resides in Florida.\n\n\nResearch areas\n\n\nCapturing value from innovation\n\"Teece has made lasting contributions to the study of innovation.\" Teece's 1986 paper \"Profiting from Technological Innovation\" was selected by the editors as one of the best papers published in Research Policy from 1971 to 1991  and is the most cited paper ever published in the publication. In October 2006, Research Policy published a special issue commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the original article. The paper was updated in 2018 to give attention to emerging issues in the digital economy.\nIn this series of papers, Teece explained why innovative firms often fail to capture economic returns from their invention. He described how it is sometimes more important for a business to be able to win at marketing, distribution, manufacturing, and other complementary areas than to come up with a big idea in the first place. He identified the factors which determine whether the firm that wins from innovation is the firm that is first to market, a follower firm, or a firm that has related capabilities that the innovation requires to provide value to a customer. The key elements in what has been called the Teece Model are the imitability of the innovation (how easily competitors can copy it) and the ownership of complementary assets.  Sidney Winter has argued that Teece's paper contributes \"en passant but fundamentally, to the clarification of basic questions.\"\n\n\nDynamic capabilities\nTeece is identified as being partially responsible for the dynamic capabilities perspective in strategic management. Dynamic capabilities have been defined as \"the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments\". Further, \"The concept of dynamic capabilities, especially in terms of organizational knowledge processes, has become the predominant paradigm for the explanation of competitive advantages. However, major unsolved—or at least insufficiently solved—problems are first their measurement and second their management…\"\nAccording to ScienceWatch, his paper (with Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen) \"Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management\" was the most cited paper in economics and business globally for the period from 1995 to 2005.\nTeece's concept of dynamic capabilities is a theory about the foundations of competitive advantage: \"the capacity (1) to sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) to seize opportunities, and (3) to maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise's intangible and tangible assets.\"\nHis concept stands parallel to the dynamic capability perspective of Eisenhardt & Martin (2000). It also builds on the idea of combinatorial capabilities (Kogut & Zander 1992).\n\n\nTheory of the multiproduct firm\nRoberts and Saloner (2013) credit Teece with \"the first attempt to build a systematic theory of the firm scope based on profit-maximizing behavior\" (827) in his 1982 article \"Towards an Economic Theory of the Multiproduct Firm,\" in which Teece describes the existence of excess resources in firms, stating that firms could better use those resources by diversifying into new lines of business. He also presents transaction cost arguments regarding whether resources can be shared contractually, and explains that protecting those resources is a potential basis for diversification. Teece additionally builds on Williamson (1975) in arguing that \"internal capital allocation may be better than what the market can achieve\" (828).\n\n\nDynamic Competition\nFor over three decades Teece has criticized antitrust and competition economics for its failure to consider the power of innovation driven broad spectrum dynamic competition. Teece tweaks the sources of economic rents down more finely, and believes Schumpeterian and Ricardian rents are generally benign from an antitrust perspective. This is seen to be \"a very valuable insight\" that is counter to traditional antitrust enforcement. He is recognized for persistently alerting regulatory bodies to the different nature of competition in the innovation economy compared to the industrial economy.\n\n\nPanmure House Declaration\nTeece invited and organized the \"New Enlightenment Conference\" in Panmure House, the original home of Adam Smith in Edinburgh, Scotland, July 2019. The conference participants signed the Panmure House Declaration, \"the first major pronouncement from Adam Smith's home since 1790.\" It called for a stronger commitment to Adam Smith's values of economic freedom and a rule-of-law democracy, and the pursuit of the common good. Teece became the inaugural Adam Smith scholar in residence in Panmure House.\n\n\nHonors\nTeece holds eight honorary doctorates: Saint Petersburg State University (Russia, 2000), where he was honored for his role in co-founding the business school; Copenhagen Business School (Denmark, 2004); Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland, 2004); University of Canterbury (New Zealand, 2007);University of Calgary (Canada, 2015); Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania, 2016); European Business School (Germany, 2016); and Edinburgh Business School (United Kingdom, 2017). He is also an honorary professor at China's Zhongnan University of Economics and Law and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia and an Honorary Member of the Law and Economics Association of New Zealand.\nIn 2002, Accenture listed Teece among its Top 50 Business Intellectuals. The ranking system was based on a combination of Google name hits, LexisNexis media database searches, and citations found in the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index.\nIn 2003, Lappeenranta University presented Teece with the first Viipuri International Prize in Strategic (Technology) Management and Business Economics.\nA 2008 analysis by Thomson Scientific found him to be one of the top-10 most-cited scholars in economics and business from 1997 to 2007.\nIn 2011 he received the Herbert Simon award from Laszlo College for Advanced Studies, Corvinus University of Budapest.\nA 2011 article, \"Innovation in Multi-Invention Contexts,\" coauthored with Deepak Somaya and Simon Wakeman, was selected as the winner of the 2012 California Management Review Best Article Award. This article presents a framework designed to help guide managers of innovating firms in designing appropriate strategy when seeking to bring an innovation to market in a multi-invention context.\nIn the 2013 New Year Honours, Teece was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to New Zealand–United States relations. He also received the Academy of International Business Eminent Scholar Award in Istanbul in July 2013. Teece is described as a \" 'leading authority' on matters related to antitrust and competition policy and intellectual property stating and is 'highly sought after.'\"\nWho Who's Legal 2018 noted that David Teece is \"'extremely highly regarded' for his longstanding output in the field of competition economics.\" In the same year, the Strategic Management Society awarded him the CK Prahalad Distinguished Scholar-Practitioner Award and classified him as \"a renowned academic, a prolific author, an active consultant, serial entrepreneur, angel investor and CEO mentor.\"\nIn 2020 he was ranked as the world's most-cited scholar in the combined field of business and management in an analysis of science-wide author citations published in PLOS Biology, a peer-reviewed journal. He was also indicted into the Thinkers50 Hall of Fame.\nIn 2022, Teece was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.\n\n\nPolitical views\nTeece has not publicly stated his political views, though he chaired Californians for a Balanced Budget and Better Economy, a PAC that supported Tom Campbell's 2012 run for U.S. Senate.\nHis largest political donation was $500,000 to Californians for a Balanced Budget and Better Economy.  In recent election cycles he has donated to several Republican senators' campaigns, including Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Tom Cotton, Lisa Murkowski, and Dan Sullivan.\n\n\nSelected publications\nTeece has published more than 200 scholarly papers and more than a dozen books and is coeditor of the Palgrave Encyclopedia of Strategic Management.

The society provides financial support to members and their families in times of need; and also actively advises on maritime navigational safety such as the placement of lighthouses and buoys, and selection of Boston Harbor pilots.\n\n\nBrief history\nThe society first formed as a fellowship in 1742, and officially incorporated in 1754. Founders included William Starkey, Edward Cahill, Isaac Freeman, Richard Humphreys, Edward Freyer, Moses Bennet, Jonathan Clarke, John Cullum, Joseph Prince, and Abraham Remmick. In its first century the society conducted meetings at the Concert Hall, Bunch-of-Grapes tavern, and the Sun Tavern. In 1851 it kept an office on Commercial Street and later in the Merchants Exchange. Since the 1980s it has operated from offices in the Boston Navy Yard.\nAccording to maritime historian Samuel Eliot Morison, the society's meetings \"were common ground where all Bostonians interested in seaborne commerce met. The secretary describes it in 1811 as 'composed of upwards of 100 former shipmasters who have retired from sea with adequate fortunes, many of whom are largely interested in the insurance offices and as underwriters, and about 50 of the most respectable merchants and shipowners and gentlemen of the highest stations in the commonwealth. The rest of the Society is composed of the more active and younger mariners who still follow the seas as a professional business.' These last were the men who made the name of Boston famous from Archangel to Smyrna, and east by west to the River Plate and Calcutta.\"\n\n\nNavigation safety\n\nThe society has borne responsibility for safe pilotage in the Boston Harbor since the 18th century. \"Beginning in 1791 and continuing through the present, the society through its trustees is vested with the authority to appoint Pilot Commissioners, who in turn appoint Boston Harbor pilots.\" It has also published guides such as the 1832 Rules and Regulations for the Pilotage of the Harbor of Boston.\nAlong with others, the society caused the creation of the Cape Cod Light in 1797. In 1805 the society built the current granite base of the beacon on Nixes Mate in Boston Harbor. The society also produced studies including one that led to the building of Long Island Head Light in 1819.\nAmong the society's many accomplishments in the area of navigation safety are the publication in 1768 of Directions for Sailing in and out of Plymouth Harbour (issued in connection with the building of Plymouth Light in that year); the production in 1790 of charts of the coast of North America; and the 1797 publication of Directions for Sailing by Cape-Cod Light-House.\n\n\nOther activities\nIn addition to maritime safety, the society has devoted itself to collection and distribution of funds to aid members and their families in times of financial need.\n\nThe society has also hosted a number of lectures. In the 19th century speakers included John Pickering (on \"telegraphic language\") and Robert Bennet Forbes.\nIn 1893 the society began supervising \"the operation of school ships Enterprise (1892-1909) and her successor Nantucket (1909-1917, 1921-1940),\" affiliated with the Massachusetts Nautical Training School.\nAs a focal point for seafaring in general the society has stewarded donations of model ships, telescopes, paintings, scrimshaw, and travel souvenirs. Visitors to the society's present-day quarters in Charlestown may view some of these objects on display.\n\n\nMembers and officers\nMembers in the 18th century included William Furness, Daniel Malcom, John Foster Williams, James Magee; 18th-century presidents included Thomas Dennie and Mungo Mackay. Among the members in the 19th century: J.D. Farrell, F.W. Macondray, and Daniel McLaughlin. In the heyday of the clipper ship \"many were captained or owned by such society members as Bacon, Eldridge, Emmons, Forbes, Glidden, Howes, Lodge, Ropes, Upton, Wales, Watkins and Weld.\" Some of the 19th-century presidents were Jonathan Chapman, Eben Davis, Charles Emery, Luther Fisk, Robert Bennett Forbes, William Humphrey, James P. Martin, William F. Sturgis, and Israel Whitney. Members and officers in recent years include William A. Baker, Barry Clifford, William M.

He joined Darlington on one-month loan in January, which brought him his first league experience, and played five games in the Third Division.\n\n\nDarlington\nHe joined the club on a free transfer in the following month. He was a regular for Darlington for the following season-and-a-half, making over 60 league and cup appearances, but fell out of favour in the first half of the 1998–99 season and joined Northampton Town on loan in December 1998, which was quickly converted to a permanent signing a week later.\n\n\nNorthampton Town\nHope made over 150 appearances in four and a half seasons at Northampton, helping the club to automatic promotion to the Second Division in 2000. Following the club's relegation to the Third Division at the end of the 2002–03 season, Hope was released by Northampton in August 2003.\n\n\nYork City\nHope joined York City on a one-month contract in August 2003. He then signed a three-month contract in the following month. He stayed at York for the rest of the season but after the club was relegated to the Conference National at the end of the 2003–04 season he left the club.\n\n\nChester City\nHe then signed for Conference champions Chester City on a two-year contract. Hope made 28 appearances in League Two for Chester in the 2004–05 season, helping the club to avoid relegation. He also scored in Chester's memorable Football League Trophy win over Sheffield Wednesday.\n\n\nShrewsbury Town\nShrewsbury Town signed Hope on free transfer in August 2005 after being allowed to leave Chester as he did not feature in manager Keith Curle's plans for the 2005–06 season. He became a regular for Shrewsbury and was made club captain. He made over 75 appearances in two seasons, helping the club to the League Two play-off final in May 2007. Following defeat in the play-off final, Hope was released by Shrewsbury.\n\n\nWrexham\nHis next port of call was to sign for Wrexham in June 2007. He made 35 league and cup appearances for Wrexham in the 2007–08 season but was transfer listed in May 2008 following the club's relegation to the Conference.\n\n\nGrimsby Town\nHe returned to League Two with a move to Grimsby Town after being handed a two-year contract by Alan Buckley in June. However, after struggling to hold down a first team place, his contract at Grimsby was cancelled by mutual consent on 7 February 2009, departing Blundell Park after only featuring seven times during the 2008–09 season.\n\n\nPersonal life\nAfter Hope retired from football, he retrained to work on oil rigs in the North Sea.

    "text": "Penril DataComm Networks, Inc. was a computer telecommunications hardware company that made some acquisitions and was eventually split into two parts: one was acquired by Bay Networks and the other was a newly formed company named Access Beyond. The focus of both company's products was end-to-end data transfer. By the mid-1990s, with the popularization of the internet, this was no longer of wide interest.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPenril, whose earnings reports and other financials were followed by The New York Times in the 1990s, made several acquisitions but also grew internally. Following its Datability acquisition it renamed itself Penril Datability Networks.\nBy the time the 1968-founded Penril was acquired by Bay their name was Penril DataComm Networks. The company, which as of 1985 \"had made 14 acquisitions in 12 years,\" also had done extensive work regarding quality control, and leveraged their product line by what The Washington Post called clever packaging: \"software, cables, instructions and telephone support\" sold to those less technically skilled as \"Network in a Box.\"\n\n\nDatability\nDatability Software Systems Inc. was the initial name of what by 1991 became 'Datability, Inc.', \"a manufacturer of hardware that links computer networks.\" The 1977-founded firm began as a software consulting company, especially in the area of databases. To speed up project development they built a program generator, which they marketed as Control 10/20 (targeted at users of Digital Equipment Corporation's DECsystem-10 and DECSYSTEM-20). After trying their hand at time-sharing they built hardware to enhance bridging these computers to DEC's VAX product line. In particular they focused on Digital's LAT protocol, selling \"boxes\" that reimplemented the protocol, at a lower price than DEC's. They later expanded into other areas of telecommunications hardware The firm relocated to a larger manufacturing plant in 1991 and was acquired by Penril in 1993.\n\n\nAccess Beyond\nAccess Beyond was initially housed by Penril, from which it was spun off. A securities analyst noted\nthat Access began operations with no debt. They subsequently merged with Hayes Corporation. Some of the funds brought to the merger came from a sale by Penril of two of its divisions, each bringing about $4 million.\n\n\nRon Howard\nRon Howard, founder of Datability, became part of Penril when the latter acquired the former, and was CEO of Access Beyond when it was spun off by Penril. Access merged with Hayes Microcomputer Products and was renamed Hayes Corp, at which time Howard became executive VP of business development and corporate vice chairman of Hayes.\n\n\nPeople\nIn the matter of hiring immigrants, in an industry where recent arrivals came from a culture of six day work weeks, and subcontracting was then common, these assembly line workers at Penril comprised about 25%, compared to double in other firms. Placement was overseen by government agencies.\n\n\nControversy\nPenril had a joint development agreement, beginning in 1990, with a Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) subsidiary. A dispute arose, and the matter was brought to court. \nPenril was awarded $3.5 million in 1996.\n\n\nReferences",

Produced by Niuma Mohamed under NiuXo Films, the film stars Yoosuf Shafeeu, Aminath Rishfa, Zeenath Abbas, Ahmed Saeed, Nashidha Mohamed, and Ahmed Azmeel. The film was released on 3 January 2019.\n\n\nPremise\nMana (Niuma Mohamed) and Riffath (Yoosuf Shafeeu) are a modern dual-career couple, much to the disappointment of their parents, who look forward to a grandchild. Mana returns for a study break from abroad and Riffath observes a distinctive change in her behavior. The relationship between the couple is affected by Mana's mood swings.\n\n\nCast\nNiuma Mohamed as Mana Rasheed\nYoosuf Shafeeu as Riffath Abdul Rahman\nAhmed Asim as Moosa \"Hardy\" Haidhar\nAminath Rishfa as Dr. Shehenaz\nAhmed Azmeel as Hassan\nMariyam Shakeela as Arifa, Mana's mother\nAminath Rasheedha as Waheedha, Riffath's mother\nIsmail Zahir as Abdul Rahman, Riffath's father\nZeenath Abbas as Nafeesa\nNashidha Mohamed as Ainth\nAhmed Saeed as Anwar\nAhmed Ziya as Doctor\nMariyam Haleem as Hardy's mother\nAjnaz Ali\nAhmed Asif\nMariyam Zoya Hassan as Nuha (Special appearance)\nMariyam Shifa (Special appearance)\nAminath Eshal Rasheed\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe film was announced on 20 October 2017 at a grand event held to celebrate Niuma Mohamed's twenty-year career. Releasing the first look of the film, Mohamed declared her \"onscreen retirement\" and indicated the film to be her last, though she would \"still continue to serve in the industry behind the camera\". A thirty-second teaser was released on 22 November 2017, featuring a demoralized Mohamed shattering a drinking glass by continuously hitting it on his forehead. Mohamed had earlier worked with director Moomin Fuad in the segment \"Baiveriyaa\" from the unreleased anthology film Hatharu Halha, which was the first Maldivian anthology film project.\nIt was earlier projected that filming would begin on 25 January 2018, but it was delayed, citing the need for Mohamed to \"gain weight to showcase the perfect physique of the character\". Filming commenced on 17 June 2018 on R. Inguraidhoo, for a ten-day schedule. All indoor shots were completed during this schedule and filming for outdoor shots began on 11 July 2018 in Male'. An ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Aminath Rishfa, Zeenath Abbas, Ahmed Saeed, Nashidha Mohamed, Ahmed Azmeel, Mariyam Shakeela, Aminath Rasheedha, and Mariyam Haleem were announced in a promotional event held on 10 April 2018.\n\n\nSoundtrack\nThe first song from the film, \"Reydhanve Mendhanve Dhandhen\", sung by Mira Mohamed Majid and Falih Adam, was released on 21 September 2018. Two promotional songs were released prior to the film's release: Zoya's \"Maa Rangalhu Vaaney\" and Mira Mohamed Majid's \"Sihuru Fadhavi Kamana\". The latter, directed and edited by Aishath Rishmy and Ravee Farooq, was shot over eight days and was an instant hit upon release.\n\n\nRelease\nThe film was initially planned to be released on Mohamed's birthday, 20 October 2018. However, the team later accelerated the release date to 19 October 2018 based on fan requests, before pushing it back for an early-2019 release. On 27 September 2018, Mohamed confirmed that dubbing for the film was halted since she was suffering from laryngitis. Hence, the release date of the film was postponed to January 2019.\n\n\nResponse\nNivairoalhi received mostly positive reviews from critics. Aishath Maaha of Dho? favored the performance of the lead actors, particularly praising Ahmed Asim's work. She also mentioned the \"neat arrangement\" of its screenplay, though she pointed out its \"weak ending\", saying it was unsatisfactory. Similar sentiments were echoed from Aminath Luba of Sun, who called Asim \"outstanding\", while other cast members were thought to be \"excellent\". Luba also found the scene arrangement to be \"gripping\", while also calling the film's ending \"weak\".\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences",

It has been called an \"iTunes for news\" and a \"micropayments-for-news pioneer\" in various media.\nThe project was founded by Marten Blankesteijn and Alexander Klöpping.

The transaction of the former occurs automatically when the user opens an article. The price is then deducted from the user’s account balance, to which they added funds prior to the transaction. The service immediately reverses the transaction when the user closes the purchased article quickly after opening it or requests a refund which is only available for 24 hours after purchase. Purchased articles can be accessed at no additional charge.\nThe prices are determined by the publishers and range between €0.09 (snippets) and €1.99 (feature stories) and are often around €0.25, 30% of which is paid to Blendle. Users can top up their accounts manually or set up an automatic top-up.\n\n\nCuration\nAside from offering access to articles and entire issues through which users can browse, the service also assembles articles according to section, provides general staff picks and has a list of trending articles.

Users can also search for articles directly and set up keyword-related alerts.\n\n\nPublishers\nAt launch, Blendle had agreements with 56 publishers.

Most of the publishers are Dutch and German newspapers and magazines, but the service also lists several Belgian Dutch-language newspapers and magazines as well as a few newspapers and magazines from English-speaking countries. In September 2015, Blendle has expanded the service to Germany and has so far concluded agreements with 37 German publishers. In the US platform, Blendle has expanded to over 25 US-based publications.\nIn March 2022, the Publisher DPG Media announced, following a court decision in his favor, that his titles would no longer be available on the digital newsstand Blendle. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Collaborative intelligence is distinguished from collective intelligence in three key ways: First, in collective intelligence there is a central controller who poses the question, collects responses from a crowd of anonymous responders, and uses an algorithm to process those responses to achieve a (typically) \"better than average\" consensus result, whereas collaborative intelligence focuses on gathering, and valuing, diverse input. Second, in collective intelligence the responders are anonymous, whereas in collaborative intelligence, as in social networks, participants are not anonymous. Third, in collective intelligence, as in the standard model of problem-solving, there is a beginning, when the central controller broadcasts the question, and an end, when the central controller announces the \"consensus\" result. In collaborative intelligence there is no central controller because the process is modeled on evolution. Distributed, autonomous agents contribute and share control, as in evolution and as manifested in the generation of Wikipedia articles. \nCollaborative intelligence characterizes multi-agent, distributed systems where each agent, human or machine, is autonomously contributing to a problem solving network. Collaborative autonomy of organisms in their ecosystems makes evolution possible. Natural ecosystems, where each organism's unique signature is derived from its genetics, circumstances, behavior and position in its ecosystem, offer principles for design of next generation social networks to support collaborative intelligence, crowdsourcing individual expertise, preferences, and unique contributions in a problem solving process.\nFour related terms are complementary:\n\nCollective intelligence processes input from a large number of anonymous responders to quantitative questions to produce better-than-average predictions.\nCrowdsourcing distributes microtasks to a large number of anonymous task performers.\nHuman Computation engages the pattern-recognizing capacities of anonymous human microtask workers to improve on machine capabilities and enable machine learning.\nCollaborative intelligence complements the three methods defined above, but here task performers are not anonymous. Task performers have different skills, motivations and may perform different tasks. These non-anonymous devices and human contributors, from tagged sensors to geo-located devices to identified unique human contributors, drive collaborative problem-solving in next generation social networks.\n\n\nOverview\nCollaborative intelligence is a term used in several disciplines. In business it describes heterogeneous networks of people interacting to produce intelligent outcomes. It can also denote non-autonomous multi-agent problem-solving systems. The term was used in 1999 to describe the behavior of an intelligent business \"ecosystem\" where Collaborative Intelligence, or CQ, is \"the ability to build, contribute to and manage power found in networks of people.\" When the computer science community adopted the term collective intelligence and gave that term a specific technical denotation, a complementary term was needed to distinguish between anonymous homogeneity in collective prediction systems and non-anonymous heterogeneity in collaborative problem-solving systems. Anonymous collective intelligence was then complemented by collaborative intelligence, which acknowledged identity, viewing social networks as the foundation for next generation problem-solving ecosystems, modeled on evolutionary adaptation in nature's ecosystems.\n\n\nAI and Collaborative Intelligence\nAlthough many sources warn that AI may cause the extinction of the human species, humans may cause our own extinction via climate change, ecosystem disruption, decline of our ocean lifeline, increasing mass murders and police brutality, and an arms race that could trigger World War III, driving humanity extinct before AI gets a chance. The surge of open source applications in generative AI demonstrates the power of collaborative intelligence (AI-human C-IQ) among distributed, autonomous agents, sharing achievements in collaborative partnerships and networks. The successes of small open source experiments in generative AI provide a model for a paradigm shift from centralized, hierarchical control to decentralized bottom-up, evolutionary development. \nThe key role of AI in collaborative intelligence was predicted in 2012 when Zann Gill wrote that collaborative intelligence (C-IQ) requires \"multi-agent, distributed systems where each agent, human or machine, is autonomously contributing to a problem-solving network.\" Gill's ACM paper has been cited in applications ranging from an NIH (U. S. National Institute of Health) Center for Biotechnology study of human robot collaboration, to an assessment of cloud computing tradeoffs. A key application domain for collaborative intelligence is risk management, where preemption is an anticipatory action taken to secure first-options in maximising future gain and/or minimising loss. Prediction of gain/ loss scenarios can increasingly harness AI analytics and predictive systems designed to maximize collaborative intelligence. Other collaborative intelligence applications include the study of social media and policing, harnessing computational approaches to enhance collaborative action between residents and law enforcement. In their Harvard Business Review essay, Collaborative Intelligence: Humans and AI Are Joining Forces –\nHumans and machines can enhance each other's strengths, authors H. James Wilson and Paul R. Daugherty report on research involving 1,500 firms in a range of industries, showing that the biggest performance improvements occur when humans and smart machines work together, enhancing each other's strengths.\n\n\nHistory\nCollaborative intelligence traces its roots to the Pandemonium Architecture proposed by artificial intelligence pioneer Oliver Selfridge as a paradigm for learning. His concept was a precursor for the blackboard system where an opportunistic solution space, or blackboard, draws from a range of partitioned knowledge sources, as multiple players assemble a jigsaw puzzle, each contributing a piece. Rodney Brooks notes that the blackboard model specifies how knowledge is posted to a blackboard for general sharing, but not how knowledge is retrieved, typically hiding from the consumer of knowledge who originally produced which knowledge, so it would not qualify as a collaborative intelligence system.\nIn the late 1980s, Eshel Ben-Jacob began to study bacterial self-organization, believing that bacteria hold the key to understanding larger biological systems. He developed new pattern-forming bacteria species, Paenibacillus vortex and Paenibacillus dendritiformis, and became a pioneer in the study of social behaviors of bacteria. P. dendritiformis manifests a collective faculty, which could be viewed as a precursor of collaborative intelligence, the ability to switch between different morphotypes to adapt with the environment. Ants were first characterized by entomologist W. M. Wheeler as cells of a single \"superorganism\" where seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism. Later research characterized some insect colonies as instances of collective intelligence. The concept of ant colony optimization algorithms, introduced by Marco Dorigo, became a dominant theory of evolutionary computation. The mechanisms of evolution through which species adapt toward increased functional effectiveness in their ecosystems are the foundation for principles of collaborative intelligence.\nArtificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a real-time technology that enables networked human groups to efficiently combine their knowledge, wisdom, insights, and intuitions into an emergent intelligence. Sometimes referred to as a \"hive mind,\" the first real-time human swarms were deployed by Unanimous A.I. using a cloud-based server called \"UNU\" in 2014. It enables online groups to answer questions, reach decisions, and make predictions by thinking together as a unified intelligence. This process has been shown to produce significantly improved decisions, predictions, estimations, and forecasts, as demonstrated when predicting major events such as the Kentucky Derby, the Oscars, the Stanley Cup, Presidential Elections, and the World Series.\nA type of collaborative AI was the focus of a DARPA Artificial Intelligence Exploration (AIE) Program from 2021 to 2023. Named Shared Experience Lifelong Learning, the program aimed to develop a population of agents capable of sharing a growing number of machine-learned tasks without forgetting. The vision behind this initiative was later elaborated in a Perspective in Nature Machine Intelligence, which proposed a synergy between lifelong learning and the sharing of machine-learned knowledge in populations of agents. The envisioned network of AI agents promises to bring about emergent properties such as faster and more efficient learning, a higher degree of open-ended learning, and a potentially more democratic society of AI agents, in contrast to monolithic, large-scale AI systems. These research developments were deemed to implement concepts inspired by sci-fi concepts such as the Borg from Star Trek, however, featuring more appealing characteristics such as individuality and autonomy. \nCrowdsourcing evolved from anonymous collective intelligence and is evolving toward credited, open source, collaborative intelligence applications that harness social networks. Evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr noted that competition among individuals would not contribute to species evolution if individuals were typologically identical. Individual differences are a prerequisite for evolution. This evolutionary principle corresponds to the principle of collaborative autonomy in collaborative intelligence, which is a prerequisite for next generation platforms for crowd-sourcing. Following are examples of crowdsourced experiments with attributes of collaborative intelligence:\n\nSwarmSketch is a crowd-sourced art experiment.\nGalaxy Zoo is a citizen science project led by Chris Lintott at Oxford University to tap human pattern recognition capacities to catalog galaxies.\nDARPA Network Challenge explores how the Internet and social networking can support timely communication, wide-area team-building, and urgent mobilization to solve broad-scope, time-critical problems.\nClimate CoLab, spun out of MIT and its Center for Collective Intelligence.\nreCAPTCHA is a project to digitize books, one word at a time\nAs crowdsourcing evolves from basic pattern recognition tasks to toward collaborative intelligence, tapping the unique expertise of individual contributors in social networks, constraints guide evolution toward increased functional effectiveness, co-evolving with systems to tag, credit, time-stamp, and sort content. Collaborative intelligence requires capacity for effective search, discovery, integration, visualization, and frameworks to support collaborative problem-solving.\nThe collaborative intelligence technology category was established in 2022 by MURAL, a software provider of interactive whiteboard collaboration spaces for group ideation and problem-solving. MURAL formalized the collaborative intelligence category through the acquisition of LUMA Institute, an organization that trains people to be collaborative problem solvers through teaching human-centered design. The collaborative intelligence technology category is described by MURAL as combining \"collaboration design with collaboration spaces and emerging Collaboration Insights™️ ... to enable and amplify the potential of the team.\"\n\n\nContrast with collective intelligence\nThe term collective intelligence originally encompassed both collective and collaborative intelligence, and many systems manifest attributes of both. Pierre Lévy coined the term \"collective intelligence\" in his book of that title, first published in French in 1994. Lévy defined \"collective intelligence\" to encompass both collective and collaborative intelligence: \"a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and in the effective mobilization of skills\". Following publication of Lévy's book, computer scientists adopted the term collective intelligence to denote an application within the more general area to which this term now applies in computer science. Specifically, an application that processes input from a large number of discrete responders to specific, generally quantitative, questions (e.g. what will the price of DRAM be next year?) Algorithms homogenize input, maintaining the traditional anonymity of survey responders to generate better-than-average predictions.\nRecent dependency network studies suggest links between collective and collaborative intelligence. Partial correlation-based Dependency Networks, a new class of correlation-based networks, have been shown to uncover hidden relationships between the nodes of the network. Research by Dror Y. Kenett and his Ph.D. supervisor Eshel Ben-Jacob uncovered hidden information about the underlying structure of the U.S. stock market that was not present in the standard correlation networks, and published their findings in 2011.\n\n\nApplication\nCollaborative intelligence addresses problems where individual expertise, potentially conflicting priorities of stakeholders, and different interpretations of diverse experts are critical for problem-solving. Potential future applications include:\n\ncompetitions, where submissions must be integrated to produce a synergistic outcome;\nsmart search, where social networks of searchers on related topics co-define search results;\nprofessional groups, interest collectives, citizen science and other communities, where knowledge-sharing is a prerequisite for effective outcomes;\nplanning, development, and sustainable project management;\nsmart systems to transform independent cities into collaborative, ecological urban networks\nWikipedia, one of the most popular websites on the Internet, is an exemplar of an innovation network manifesting distributed collaborative intelligence that illustrates principles for experimental business laboratories and start-up accelerators.\nA new generation of tools to support collaborative intelligence is poised to evolve from crowdsourcing platforms, recommender systems, and evolutionary computation. Existing tools to facilitate group problem-solving include collaborative groupware, synchronous conferencing technologies such as instant messaging, online chat, and shared white boards, which are complemented by asynchronous messaging like electronic mail, threaded, moderated discussion forums, web logs, and group Wikis. Managing the Intelligent Enterprise relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base. As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving. Metaknowledge characterizes how knowledge content interacts with its knowledge context in cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional, or global distributed collaboration.\n\n\nSee also\nCloud collaboration\nCollaborative innovation network\nCollaborative learning\nCollective problem solving\nDistributed cognition\nGlobal brain\nMass collaboration\nMass communication\nSocial epistemology\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Kenmare (Irish: Neidín, meaning 'the little nest') is a small town in the south of County Kerry, Ireland. The name Kenmare is the anglicised form of Ceann Mara, meaning \"head of the sea\", referring to the head of Kenmare Bay. It is also a townland and civil parish.\n\n\nLocation\nKenmare is located at the head of Kenmare Bay (where it reaches the farthest inland), sometimes called the Kenmare River, where the Roughty River (An Ruachtach) flows into the sea, and at the junction of the Iveragh Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula. It is also located near the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, Mangerton Mountain and Caha Mountains and is a popular hillwalking destination. Nearby towns and villages are Tuosist, Ardgroom, Glengarriff, Kilgarvan, Killarney, Templenoe and Sneem.\nKenmare is in the Kerry constituency of Dáil Éireann.\n\n\nHistory\nEvidence of ancient settlement in the Kenmare area includes one of the largest stone circles in the south-west of Ireland. Close to the town, this stone circle shows occupation in the area going back to at least the Bronze Age (2,200–500 B.C), when it was constructed. The circle has 15 stones around the circumference with a boulder dolmen in the centre.\n\nVikings are said to have raided the area around the town which at that time was called Ceann Mhara, which means \"head of the sea\" in Irish.\nThe entire area was granted to the English economist and scientist Sir William Petty by Oliver Cromwell as part payment for completing the mapping of Ireland, the Down Survey in 1656. He laid out the modern town circa 1670. Before him, a previous surveyor of Ireland, Sir Valentine Browne (1510–1589), ancestor of the Earl of Kenmare, was granted some lands in County Kerry during the resulting plantation, the Munster Plantation.\nThe three main streets that form a triangle in the centre of the town are called Main Street (originally William Street, after William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne), Henry Street (originally Sound Road), after the son of the 1st Marquis and Shelbourne Street (Henry Petty became the first Earl of Shelburne). This name was also later applied to Shelbourne Road in Dublin.\n\nThe convent in the town, the Poor Clare Sisters, was founded in 1861 when five nuns including Sister Mary Frances Cusack (The Nun of Kenmare), who was also an author and publisher of many books, moved to Kenmare from their convent in Newry, County Down. Under the guidance of Mother Abbess O'Hagan in 1864 a lace-working industry was established and Kenmare lace became noted worldwide. The convent no longer exists and Pobalscoil Inbhear Scéine secondary school occupies this site since 2001.\nA suspension bridge, which is claimed to be the first in Ireland, over the Kenmare River was opened in 1841 and served the community till 1932 when it was replaced by a new concrete bridge.\nDuring and after the Civil War (1922–1923), there were a number of incidents in Kenmare, including the killing of O'Connor brothers in September 1922 by the Anti-Treaty IRA, and the brutal assault against the allegedly Unionist daughters of a local doctor by three Dublin Guard officers led by Paddy Daly in 1923 (which is sometimes referred to as the 'Kenmare incident'). Kenmare was briefly held by the Anti-Treaty IRA, during the Irish Civil War, before being successfully retaken by the Irish Army in December 1922.\nThe town library is one of the Carnegie Libraries funded by Andrew Carnegie. It opened in 1918, and the architect was R.M. Butler. The library building is now home to the Carnegie Arts Centre and theatre, hosting a local drama group and a number of travelling productions each year, as well as music and comedy nights.\nHoly Cross Catholic Church in Kenmare was consecrated in 1864. It was built under the guidance of Archdeacon Fr. John O'Sullivan – who is interred within the church. The church has stained glass windows by O'Connor London (1863), by Caseys Dublin (1864) and by Earley Dublin (1864). The organ is by Telford & Telford(1865). Buried in the church grounds is Monsignor Francis Cremin (died 2001), who was a periitus or theological expert at Vatican II. He was a native of Kenmare and had been Professor of Canon Law and Moral Theology at St Patrick's College, Maynooth from 1949 until 1980. He was a brother of Con Cremin, an Irish diplomat, who represented Ireland in France and Germany during World War II and subsequently in Portugal, the Holy See, the United Kingdom and at the United Nations.\n\nThe Church of Ireland church of St Patrick celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008. The town has been a winner in the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 2013, 2000 and was a runner-up in 2003 and 2008.\n\n\nTourism\n\nKenmare lies on two noted Irish tourist routes, the Ring of Kerry and the Ring of Beara, approximately 32 kilometres (20 mi) from Killarney. As a result, it is a popular tourist destination and many of the businesses in the area cater to tourists. The town is noted for its food and pubs.\nSince the late 1990s the tourism industry has driven local construction work, with land being sold at high prices to developers wishing to build estates of holiday homes. This has led to an increase in the town's population, particularly during the peak tourist season, and prompted fears among some residents that the town is becoming overdeveloped and losing much of its identity.\n\n\nNotable people\n\nInter-county Gaelic footballers Mickey 'Ned' O'Sullivan, Stephen O'Brien and Paul O'Connor are from the Kenmare area, while Pat Spillane is from nearby Templenoe. Kenmare is also the home of Irish Olympic slalom skier Thos Foley.\nKenmare was home to composer Ernest John Moeran for a number of years up to his death and a local bar was named after him – but has since been renamed. Diplomat Con Cremin was also from Kenmare, as is senator Mark Daly. Writer Anna McPartlin grew up in Kenmare, and her 2007 novel Apart from the Crowd was set in the town.\nFrancis Brennan is the owner of the five-star Park Hotel in Kenmare. He and his brother John, owner of the nearby Dromquinna Manor Hotel in Templenoe, are known for their TV series \"At Your Service\".\n\n\nFair days\nDue to its location at the centre of a large agricultural area, Kenmare served as the local market town. Until the establishment of an auction mart in the early 1990s, the approximately monthly fair days were a time when farmers would stand their animals in the streets for sale to visiting stock dealers. The only fair which continues to be held is that of 15 August, which coincides with the Catholic holy day of obligation marking the Assumption of Mary. The day attracts crowds of locals and visitors and is the busiest day of the year in Kenmare.\n\n\nTransport\nThere are daily bus-services in summer to Killarney and in the off-season, the bus runs Monday-Friday. There is also a daily service to/from Cork in the summer months on the N71 via Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bandon. In mid-2023, a new service from Killarney to Skibbereen via Kenmare was announced, replacing the previous Killarney to Kenmare and Kenmare to Skibbereen services with additional journeys and extended hours.\nThe N71 also connects Kenmare to Killarney on a mountainous and scenic part of the Ring of Kerry route via Moll's Gap and Ladies View.  Alternatively one can reach Killarney via the slightly longer but more comfortable route through Kilgarvan. Kenmare also lies on the N71 national secondary road south-Cork route to Glengarriff. In November 2014, the Eastern Relief Road was opened, allowing drivers from the R569 Kilgarvan Road to bypass the town centre when accessing the supermarkets and schools.\nKenmare railway station opened, in October 1893, as the terminus of a branch from the Great Southern and Western Railway's Mallow–Tralee line at Headford Junction. The station closed, along with the branch, in early 1960 and the last passenger train ran on 1 February 1960. The track was lifted shortly afterwards.\n\n\nServices\nThe town has a primary and secondary school, a public library, community hospital, as well as Catholic, Church of Ireland and Methodist churches.\n\n\nSports\nThe GAA club, Kenmare Shamrocks, competes in Kerry GAA competitions. George Mayberry from Kenmare participated in the 1908 Summer Olympics.\nKenmare Kestrels Basketball Club was founded in 2006 and competes in the Kerry Area Basketball League.\nThe local soccer team Inter Kenmare F.C. competes in the Kerry District League at U17, Youth & Senior Men's/Women's level and in the Kerry Schoolboys/girls League for all underage teams.\nOverlooking Kenmare Bay and adjacent to the Park Hotel is the 18 hole, Kenmare Golf Club.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the fictional Harry Potter universe, Kenmare is home to the Kenmare Kestrels, one of only thirteen Quidditch teams that play in the Quidditch League of Britain and Ireland. The team players wear emerald-green robes emblazoned with two yellow K's across the chest.\nThe eponymous song \"As I leave behind Neidín\" was written by Jimmy McCarthy and recorded by Mary Black amongst others.\nThe town was also referenced in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \"Breaking the Ice\". The crew aboard the spaceship answer questions received from school children who are said to be from Kenmare.\n\n\nSee also\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nMarket Houses in Ireland\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nKenmare Lace",

He was tour captain for the inaugural Wallaby overseas tour, that to New Zealand in 1905.\n\n\nEarly life and club rugby\nBorn in Parramatta, New South Wales Wickham was schooled at Parramatta Marist Brothers followed by Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1889 where he learned his rugby. After school he played for the Parramatta Two Blues in 1893 & 1894 then the Wallaroo club side in Sydney in 1895 and 1896. He lived in Lucknow near Orange, New South Wales from 1896 to 1899 and played rugby there, making representative Country sides for clashes against City in each of those years. In 1900 he returned to Sydney and commenced with the Western Suburbs DRUFC in its inaugural year of competition. He would play 87 first-grade games for the club.\n\n\nRepresentative career\nWickham was first selected in a New South Wales representative side in 1895 aged 19 and would go on to make 37 Waratah appearances in a state representative career than lasted till 1906. He made 24 state appearances in matches against Queensland. Howell cites his finest Waratahs game as an 1897 tour match against the visiting All Blacks when he scored two tries and booted a conversion for a rare 22-8 New South Wales win over New Zealand.  \nHe first represented at the national level against New Zealand, in Sydney, on 15 August 1903. He made two Test appearances against Great Britain who toured Australia 1904 and then in 1905 he was selected for the Wallabies tour of New Zealand, the first overseas campaign by an Australian rugby side. He was one of fourteen New South Welshman, who with nine Queenslanders made up a twenty-five strong squad. It was a disappointing tour for the Wallabies who played seven games and won only the last three against Manawatu-Hawkes Bay, Wanganui-Taranaki and Auckland. Wickham played every match on tour and was top-scorer with eighteen points from two penalty goals and three goals from marks. In total he claimed five international rugby caps for Australia, four of them as captain.\n\n\nCoach\nWickham had been two years retired by the date of the 1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain. New South Wales state selector James McMahon was tour manager and in those days the idea that anyone other than the captain would coach the side was frowned upon. McMahon was initially the only accompanying official but Howell writes that a public campaign resulted in Wickham also being included on the tour as Assistant Manager acting unofficially as coach.\n\n\nBibliography\nCollection (1995) Gordon Bray presents The Spirit of Rugby, Harper Collins Publishers Sydney\nHowell, Max (2005) Born to Lead - Wallaby Test Captains, Celebrity Books, Auckland NZ\nZavos, Spiro (2000) The Golden Wallabies, Penguin, Victoria\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=262490",
    "text": "Rockapella is an American a cappella musical group formed in 1986 in New York City. The group's name is a portmanteau of \"rock\" and \"a cappella\". Rockapella sings original vocal music and a cappella versions of other songs. Over time, their sound has evolved from high-energy pop and world music style toward a sound more influenced by R&B. Rockapella found their enduring success in Japan early in their career. They are most successful for their role as a house band and comedy troupe on the PBS children's geography game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.\nIn addition to three compilation albums in Japan, Rockapella has released 19 albums in the US and Japan. Since the band's vocal percussionist was hired, the line \"All sounds provided by the voices and appendages of Rockapella\" has been printed on each of their CDs.\n\n\nBand history\n\n\nEarly years (1986–1990)\nThe founding members of Rockapella consisted of Brown University alumni Sean Altman, Elliott Kerman, Steve Keyes, and David Stix. They had each been in an a cappella group at Brown called High Jinks, but not all at the same time. Having been in High Jinks the longest, Altman was the only connection between the other three members; when they found each other in New York City following their graduation, they decided to form Rockapella. The band began performing on New York City street corners in 1986 with a hat at their feet and a song repertoire that consisted of a mix of barbershop arrangements and a cappella renditions of classic doo wop pieces that evolved to focus less on oldies and barbershop and more on contemporary rock music. Passers-by began to drop business cards into the hat, and these street corner performances led to private party and club performances around NYC.\nStix left the group in 1987 to pursue his artistic career and was replaced by Charlie Evett. That same year, a dinner party performance for television personality Kathie Lee Gifford led to Rockapella's 1988 appearance on the WABC-TV show The Morning Show, Regis Philbin and Gifford's NYC morning talk show before it went national. Their performance of Altman's signature arrangement of the calypso novelty standard \"Zombie Jamboree\" caught the eye of producer Gerard Brown. He invited Rockapella to perform on the PBS \"Great Performances\" TV special Spike Lee & Company – Do It A Cappella, which would put them into the national spotlight. However, Evett left the group to continue a career in software design in 1988 before the special's taping, and Barry Carl was hired to take his place.\n\n\nWhere in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1991–1996)\n\nWith a PBS special and numerous morning talk show appearances under their collective belt, Rockapella was noticed by the producers of an up-and-coming children's geography game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. Shortly before the show's premiere, Keyes had decided to leave Rockapella to launch his legal career, but was still part of the band when they auditioned and were hired to write and perform the show's theme song as well as appearing as the comic relief house band. Keyes was replaced by Scott Leonard, who had just returned from a career as the lead singer in a Tokyo Disneyland electronic rock band. Between Leonard joining the band and the start of their television break, Rockapella began to pick up fame, starring in a Whoopi Goldberg HBO comedy special Chez Whoopi, a Taco Bell commercial, and opened for acts such as Chuck Berry, Styx, Billy Joel, and their a cappella idols The Persuasions, who the group had met on the Do It A Cappella special. They also performed on Jay Leno's first New Year's Eve episode of The Tonight Show in 1992.\nRockapella first appeared on the half-hour game show in 1991 and later continued to appear daily for five seasons, catapulting the band's four members into mid-level television celebrity status and making the Rockapella-performed theme song (which was penned by Altman and his childhood friend, David Yazbek) as one of the best known television themes in history. Jeff Thacher joined Rockapella as the band's permanent vocal percussionist in 1993, although he only appeared on Carmen Sandiego during its fifth and final season two years later. While Rockapella was seen daily in homes across America, Leonard used his connections to the Japanese music market to acquire a recording contract with ForLife Records. The group released seven albums of original and cover material under this label in Japan during their run on Carmen Sandiego and for two years after that, being the first to bring contemporary a cappella music to Japan. On the final episode of Carmen Sandiego, Sean Altman memorably had his blonde braids cut by show host Greg Lee. As the other members of Rockapella became aware that his braids were actually being cut, they stopped miming the title song and covered their mouths in shock.\n\n\nPost-Carmen Sandiego years (1997–present)\n\nFollowing the end of Carmen Sandiego in 1996, Altman left Rockapella to pursue his solo career the following year, and was replaced by Kevin Wright. They did two Folger's coffee commercials between 1998 and 2001 and a PBS special of their December 9, 2000, concert. In 2002, Carl was replaced by George Baldi III. In 2003, the group started their now annual \"A Rockapella Holiday\" tour, and in 2004, they released a live album, as well as re-released all of their previous North American albums on the independent label Shakariki Records. That same year, Kerman, the group's baritone and the last remaining founding member of the group, left and was replaced by John K. Brown, a second tenor. Rockapella began joining the Boston Pops on stage in the eastern US in 2006, creating a concert experience that shows both the orchestra's and Rockapella's talents separately and together in a manner never done before: a cappella with instrumentation. In August 2009, Wright announced he would be leaving the group at the end of the year to spend more time with his family; his last performance with the band was on December 22 of that same year, and was replaced by Steven Dorian.\nThe project to make \"Bang\", the title track off their newest album, the first track in Rock Band to feature full, four-instrument gameplay based on no live or synthesized instruments began in the summer of 2010, and was released for purchase on January 30, 2011 through the RBN. At the beginning of 2011, the band's cover of \"It's A Small World\" from their album Comfort & Joy, was featured in a TV commercial for the animated film Gnomeo and Juliet. On November 16, 2011, Rockapella released a new holiday album, A Rockapella Holiday.\nIn 2022, Jose Rosario left the group and was replaced by Manny Houston. Bryant Vance left the group at that time as well, allowing George Baldi III to return. By mid-2023, Baldi left the group once again and was replaced by Armand Hutton.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nUS & International albums\n\nAll albums from Don't Tell Me You Do through Comfort & Joy were re-released in the US by Shakariki Records in 2004.\n\n\nCompilation albums\n\n\nMiscellaneous albums\n\n\nSingles and EPs\n\n\nOther appearances\n\n\nSolo albums and appearances\n\n\nSongs used in commercials\n\nGnomeo and Juliet - feature film trailer\nFolgers coffee\nNBC The Today Show promos for the earliest version of the program's \"Where in the World is Matt Lauer?\" segment.

The principal canopy trees in this forest community are Sydney blue gum and blackbutt which are usually seen between 20 and 40 metres tall. 180 species of indigenous plants have been identified at Dalrymple-Hay Nature Reserve.\n\n\nDistribution\nThe Blue Gum High Forest is restricted to the northern parts of Sydney, on soils based on shale with an annual rainfall over 1100 mm (43 in). Much of it grew on the ridge tops, roughly following the present day Pacific Highway from around Crows Nest up to Hornsby. Also it was recorded on soils based on the Mittagong Formation, volcanic diatremes and exposed shale lenses within the Hawkesbury Sandstone. Blue Gum High Forest grades into Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in drier areas of lower rainfall.\nRemnants are found as far west as West Pennant Hills and Eastwood, though most of the few remaining areas are in suburbs such as Pymble, Turramurra and Wahroonga. Turiban Reserve in Wahroonga has particularly tall trees. Two of the larger forest remnants are Dalrymple-Hay Nature Reserve and Sheldon Forest. Around one percent of the original forest remains, and the current remnants amount to an area of 136 hectares (336 acres).\n\n\nEcological status\nDue to fragmentation and the surrounding urban area, the forest remnants are constantly under threat from invasive plant species. Bush regeneration programs have been put in place for many years. Significant species include Wandering Jew, Madeira vine, passionfruit vine, Chinese privet, ochna and camphor laurel.\n\n\nFauna\n\nRing-tail possums, sugar gliders, brushtail possums and grey-headed flying foxes are common.

    "text": "Judith Ann James (born August 8, 1967) is an American rheumatologist. She first came to Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) as a Sir Alexander Fleming Scholar in the summer of 1988, and then joined the foundation’s scientific staff in 1994.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJames was born on August 8, 1967, in Pond Creek, Oklahoma to a serial entrepreneur mother and wheat farmer father. While attending Pond Creek-Hunter High School, James convinced her  science teacher to create a physiology and anatomy class. Upon graduating as valedictorian, James attended Oklahoma Baptist University (OBU) on a full scholarship. During her undergraduate studies, James applied three times for the Sir Alexander Fleming Scholar Program before finally being accepted in 1988. She had been rejected twice due to her lack of research experience so she collaborated with an Oklahoma State University researcher to help with an investigation into possible health benefits of tarantulatoxin. James subsequently graduated from OBU with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry with minors in math and music and enrolled at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine (OU) for her medical degree and a doctorate in microbiology and immunology. She was a member of the inaugural class of OU‘s MD and Ph.D. program. During her medical internship, she became interested in lupus and chose a different career from paediatrics.\n\n\nCareer\nUpon completing her residency and fellowship, James joined the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) as a member of the foundation's Arthritis and Immunology Research Program, where she continued her investigative studies in systemic lupus erythematosus. In 1997, she received the Merrick Junior Scientist Award from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation for her work. While serving in this role, James discovered a strong association between Epstein-Barr virus and lupus in children. She later found that lupus patients obtained autoantibodies which are typically present in the blood years before the onset of the disease, allowing scientists and doctors to predict early infection. James was subsequently appointed the Lou Kerr Chair for Biomedical Research in 2004 and focused on understanding systemic rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. \nIn 2007, James was presented with the Edmund L. Dubois Memorial Achievement Award for her work on Lupus. She was later awarded the Edward L. and Thelma Gaylord Prize for Scientific Achievement from The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation for her groundbreaking work in researching diseases of the immune system.

    "text": "The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is used to assess adrenal gland function by measuring how cortisol levels change in response to oral doses or an injection of dexamethasone. It is typically used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome.\nThe DST was historically used for diagnosing depression, but by 1988 it was considered to be \"at best, severely limited in its clinical ability\" for this purpose.\n\n\nPhysiology\nDexamethasone is an exogenous steroid that provides negative feedback to the pituitary gland to suppress the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Specifically, dexamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the anterior pituitary gland, which lie outside the blood–brain barrier, resulting in regulatory modulation.\n\n\nTest procedures\nThere are several types of DST procedures:\n\nOvernight DST or ONDST - An oral dose of dexamethasone is given between 11pm and midnight, and the cortisol level is measured at 8 - 9am the next morning\nTwo-day DST - This involves giving an oral dose of dexamethasone at six-hourly intervals for 2 days, with the cortisol level measured 6 hours after the final dose was given\nIntravenous DST\nDexamethasone-CRT test\n\n\nInterpretation\nLow-dose and high-dose variations of the test exist.  The test is given at low (usually 1–2 mg) and high (8 mg) doses of dexamethasone, and the levels of cortisol are measured to obtain the results.\nA low dose of dexamethasone suppresses cortisol in individuals with no pathology in endogenous cortisol production. A high dose of dexamethasone exerts negative feedback on pituitary neoplastic ACTH-producing cells (Cushing's disease), but not on ectopic ACTH-producing cells or adrenal adenoma (Cushing's syndrome).\n\n\nDose\nA normal result is a decrease in cortisol levels upon administration of low-dose dexamethasone. Results indicative of Cushing's disease involve no change in cortisol on low-dose dexamethasone, but inhibition of cortisol on high-dose dexamethasone. If the cortisol levels are unchanged by low- and high-dose dexamethasone, then other causes of Cushing's syndrome must be considered with further work-up necessary.\nAfter the high-dose dexamethasone, it may be possible to make further interpretations.\n\n†ACTH as measured prior to dosing of dexamethasone\nEquivocal results should be followed by a corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, with inferior petrosal sinus sampling.\n\n\nReferences\n\nTheodore C.

After making his senior debut with Passo Fundo in 1992, he moved abroad to join R.E. Mouscron in the following year before returning to Sampaio Corrêa.\nAmorim's first title came up in 1999, as he won the Campeonato Potiguar with ABC. After representing União São João, Portuguesa, Fortaleza and Sport Recife, he was the top goalscorer of the 2002 Campeonato Pernambucano with Santa Cruz, scoring 12 goals.\nAmorim then left for city rivals Náutico, but returned to Sport in 2003. After playing for hometown sides Paysandu and Remo, he joined CRB in 2006. He later returned to the latter club in 2007, after a brief stint at America-RJ, and was the club's top goalscorer in the league during his two-year spell; his second year, however, ended in relegation.\nIn March 2009, Amorim returned to Alagoas after signing for CSA from Madureira; highlights included a goal in a 1–0 victory over Neymar's Santos which knocked the team out of the 2009 Copa do Brasil. He returned to CRB for the 2010 season, but was released in September of that year due to the club's poor financial situation.\nIn 2011, Amorim represented Coruripe, and played for Independente-PA the following year. In January 2014, after two years without a club, he joined Murici. He later moved to Santa Rita, and retired in the end of the year at the age of 42.\n\n\nManagerial career\nAmorim started his managerial career with Pinheirense in 2016, winning the second division of the Campeonato Paraense. On 5 December of the following year, he was named manager of his former club Independente for the ensuing campaign.\nOn 6 July 2018, Amorim took over Tuna Luso. In the following February, he was in charge of São Francisco-PA before being appointed João Brigatti's assistant at another of his former clubs, Sampaio Corrêa, in June.\nOn 20 February 2020, after Brigatti's departure to Ponte Preta, Amorim was appointed manager of Sampaio in an interim manner.

He served as minister of Construction (1958–1962), minister of Education (1962), member of the French National Assembly (1967–1981) and mayor of Blois (1971–1989). \nHis childhood correspondence with Antoine de Saint-Exupéry helped inspire the title character of the 1943 novel The Little Prince. During the German occupation of France in World War II, Sudreau was a resistance fighter in the Brutus Network. He was imprisoned in the Buchenwald concentration camp. \nAfter the war, he made a rapid career in civil service and was responsible for the planning of major construction and infrastructure projects during General de Gaulle's government. A convinced pro-European, he presided European Movement France from 1962 to 1968. He was also a lobbyist for the French railway industry and chaired its association FIF from 1963 to 1996.\n\n\nBiography\nSudreau was born in Paris, the son of businessman Jean Sudreau and Marie-Marguerite (née Boyer) Sudreau. Sudreau studied law and history at the University of Paris (Sorbonne). He was preparing for the agrégation (state examination for high school teachers) in history but was prevented from taking it by the outbreak of the Second World War. While training as a fighter pilot at the École de l'air in Bordeaux-Mérignac, France fell to the German Wehrmacht and was forced to surrender in June 1940. Unlike some of his fellow students, he did not flee to England for family reasons (he had just married and had become the father of a child). Instead, he stayed in the so-called free zone in the south of France and served as an officer in the air force of the Vichy regime.\nReturning to France in May 1945, Sudreau was promoted by de Gaulle and made a career in civil service. He was appointed subprefect, then subdirector at the ministry of the Interior. From 1951 to 1955, he served as prefect of the Central French department of Loir-et-Cher whose seat is in Blois. At the time, he was the youngest prefect of any French department. He then took the post of Commissioner for Construction and Urban Planning in the Paris region where he oversaw projects like the construction of large \"functional\" complexes, the commencement of the RER suburban rail, the Boulevard Périphérique ring road, and the launch of the La Défense business district in western Paris.\nWhen de Gaulle returned to power as Prime minister in June 1958, he appointed Sudreau to the newly created office as minister of Construction, a position he also retained after the founding of the Fifth Republic under de Gaulle as President of the Republic. In Georges Pompidou's first premiership, Sudreau became minister of Education in April 1962. He resigned from this post in October 1962 in protest against a proposal by Charles de Gaulle to amend the constitution, introducing direct presidential elections.\nIn 1985, Sudreau sat on the \"Jury of Honor\" that assessed whatever the film Des terroristes à la retraite should be aired in France or not. Sudreau referred to the recent Palestinian bombings of American and Israeli targets and stated: \"at the very moment when we are again talking about direct action, this broadcast legitimizes terrorist methods.” The \"Jury of Honor\" in its report stated “though it is highly desirable that a film inform French of all generations about the saga of the FTP-MOI, such a film nevertheless still remains to be made”.\n\n\nPersonal life\nHe was married to France Brun; they had three children: Jean Sudreau (predeceased), Anne Sudreau O'Connor (predeceased), and Bernard Sudreau. His son Jean died of lung cancer and was married to Danièle Louis-Dreyfus, daughter of French Resistance fighter and businessman Pierre Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n\nPublications\n1967 L'enchaînement (Plon)\n1980 La stratégie de l'absurde (Plon)\n1985 De l'inertie politique (éditions Stock)\n1991 Au-delà de toutes les frontières\n\n\nBibliography\nChristiane Rimbaud, Pierre Sudreau, Le Cherche Midi, 2004\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBooks\nBowles, Brett (2011). \"Historiography, Memory, and the Politics of Form in Mosco Boucault's Terrorists in Retirement\".

The negligent rider was both a colleague and a friend. The accident occurred on the way to work.  As the rider's insurance policy excluded pillion passengers, Coward's widow was obliged to claim damages from the MIB. The MIB would have liability only where insurance for the pillion was compulsory; and at the time insurance was compulsory only if pillions were carried \"for hire or reward\". Coward had paid the friend a small weekly contribution for the daily trip, and the widow argued that this amounted to a contract for hire or reward. The MIB countered that carriage for hire or reward required to create legal relations, and that on these facts (an agreement between friends), there was no such intention.\n\n\nDecision\nThe Court of Appeal held there was no contract of hire or reward as it was a social and domestic agreement without intention to create legal relations, and that the widow was not entitled to compensation.\n\n\nSubsequent decisions\nIn Connell v Motor Insurers Bureau  Lord Denning, MR, sitting in the Court of Appeal declared that he was \"not happy with the decision in Coward\", adding that \"when a man gives another a lift in return for money there is a contract, albeit informal\". Denning refused to follow Coward and declared that a car driver who gave friends a lift in return for cash or other valuable consideration was indeed acting \"for hire or reward\".\nStrictly speaking, Denning was in breach of the rule that the Court of Appeal is bound by its own earlier decisions; but in Albert v Motor Insurers Bureau  the House of Lords in 1971 approved the Connell judgment in preference to that in Coward.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Farnams Village Historic District is a historic district in Cheshire, Massachusetts, United States.  It encompasses the historic limestone mining community known as Farnams Village and the associated surviving industrial and mining infrastructure associated with a mining operation active from the late 19th century into the mid-20th century.  The main village area is centered on Lanesborough Road in southern Cheshire, near Farnams and Quarry Roads, with quarry sites on the hillside to the west.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n\n\nDescription and history\nFarnams Village is located in southern Cheshire, a rural town on the eastern slope of Mount Greylock in western Massachusetts.  The geology of southwestern Cheshire includes ridges of outcrops with deposits of limestone and marble, which were mined on a small scale, primarily for local use by farmers, beginning in the early 19th century.  The arrival of railroad infrastructure in the area in the mid-19th century prompted a more organized expansion of mining efforts.  The Dean family were one of the first to establish a small mining operation (c. 1840), located roughly at the western end of Quarry Road.  Brothers Alfred and Albert Farnam in 1874 opened a lime processing facility, and greatly expanded mining in an area adjacent to the small Dean mine.  The Farnams were economically successful, producing a high quality white plaster lime, and eventually expanded their holdings to more than 1,500 acres (610 ha).  They overextended their finances in the process, and sold the business in 1905.  The business was acquired by US Gypsum in 1927, and operated until 1969, when it was closed down.\nThe historic district covers a total of 1,400 acres (570 ha).  The center of the district is the historic village center, at the junction of Lanesborough, Farnams, and Quarry Roads, where there stand a cluster of buildings, including worker housing and buildings related to the operation of the quarries.  The district also includes the quarries and abandoned quarry equipment, former mining structures, worker housing, and public facilities of the village.  There are significant areas of primarily industrial archeological interest, due to the large number of abandoned and destroyed buildings.\n\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Berkshire County, Massachusetts\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Garrett Lynch (born 1977) is an Irish new media artist working with networked technologies in a variety of forms including online art, installation, performance and writing.\n\n\nCareer\nSince 2000 Lynch has a developed an artistic practice centred on the use of networks.  He has published papers including \"Google and Art: A commercial/cultural new media art economy?\" in the ISEA, Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts newsletter and \"Net Art : au-delà du navigateur… un monde d’objets\" (Net.art: beyond the browser to a world of things) in Terminal no. 101, \"Net Art, Technologie ou Création?\" (Net Art, Technology or Creation), spoken at conferences and events, curated exhibitions and live events, exhibited and performed in a number of international exhibitions and events including \"Notes on a New Nature\" at 319 Scholes, \"The Vending Machine\" at the 54th Venice Biennale, \"REFF – Remix the World, Reinvent Reality\" at Furtherfield Gallery, Jouable; Art, Jeu et Interactivité, and \"Liminality: The Space Between Worlds\" at Antena.\n\n\nWork\nLynch's work has developed based on a conceptual consideration of the use of networks within artistic practice. Moving initially from a net.art practice and its emphasis on the web and the web browser as artistic form to a networked practice that explores networks in their widest interpretation, his work uses networks as \"a means, site and context for artistic initiation, creation and discourse\".\nInformed by Cybernetics and Communication theory, his discourse frequently deals with issues concerning nodes and their arrangement, the spaces between or the internodal and the behaviour that can occur between nodes in a network. As such he views his work dealing with these concepts and issues as largely opportunist, potentially parasitic in nature and his practice as essentially one of arrangements aligning it with key concerns within conceptual art.\nHe states that his networked practice aims \"to get people to think about the ideas I'm making connections or links between. I personally like work that makes me think so I try to make work to make others think…What obsesses me is not the internet per se but the idea of networks, all sorts of networks, technological (digital, electronic and electrical), social, biological etc. My work is starting to be a networked art rather than net.art, an internet art\".\n\nSince 2001 curating has been a part of Garrett's practice.  Initially curating online net.art works through the \"Banner Art Collective\", in 2006 he co-founded the sonic arts events \"Open Ear\" which ran ten live events at various locations in England and Wales until 2009.\nLynch created the site-specific work for the online virtual world of Second Life \"Between Saying and Doing\" in 2008 as a critical comment on performance and virtual worlds.  This initiated a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces that remains ongoing.  In these works Lynch explores the \"real\" and the \"virtual\" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity.  This process involves the use of his real name for his \"representation\" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a sandwich board prop stating this that is worn continuously.\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=4000429",
    "text": "Johan and Peewit (French: Johan et Pirlouit, pronounced [ʒoan e piʁlwi]) is a Belgian comics series created by Peyo and named after the two main characters. Since its initial appearance in 1947, it has been published in 13 albums that appeared before the death of Peyo in 1992. Thereafter, a team of comic book creators from Studio Peyo continued to publish the stories.\nThe series is set in Medieval Europe, and mainly concerns the adventures of Johan, a young squire and his jester sidekick Peewit, and includes elements of sword-and-sorcery. It is also notable for branching out into The Smurfs franchise, following their first introduction in the 1958 story The Smurfs and the Magic Flute.\n\n\nPublication history\nInitially titled simply Johan, the series first appeared in the newspaper La Dernière Heure in 1947 and then in Le Soir from 1950 until 1952. It began publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou on 11 September 1952 and the initially blond-haired hero became dark-haired.\nIn 1954, Johan was joined by Pirlouit, and the series took its final name. It was in Johan et Pirlouit, on 23 October 1958, that the first smurf appeared.\nPeyo stated that Pirlouit was his favourite character, and Johan et Pirlouit was the only series on which he always did the drawings without the aid of the studio. Their adventures appeared regularly in Spirou in the 1950s and early 1960s, but the success of the Smurfs meant that they were much neglected afterwards, aside from a very short one-off adventure in 1977. However, following Peyo's death, other artists and writers have revived the series with 4 more albums between 1994 and 2001.\n\n\nSynopsis\nSet in the Middle Ages in an unnamed European kingdom, the series follows the adventures of Johan, a brave young page to the King, and Peewit, his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. Johan rides off in search of adventure with his trusty horse Bayard, while Peewit gallops sporadically, and grudgingly, behind on his goat, Biquette. The pair are driven by duty to their King and the courage to defend the underpowered. Struggles for power between deposed lords and usurping villains form the basis of many of the plots which also contain elements of detective fiction as the pair hunt down traitors and outlaws, as well as fantasy, with witches and sorcerers, giants, ghosts and, above all, the Smurfs.\nThe first few adventures did not feature Peewit. From his first appearance in 1947, Johan had a number of solo adventures and met Peewit in 1954, thus, in line with many other comic series of the time, giving Johan's earnest hero a comic relief sidekick similar to Tintin's Captain Haddock, Lucky Luke's Rantanplan, Asterix's Obelix, or Spirou's Fantasio.\n\n\nCharacters\nJohan: A squire to the King who later ascends to the rank of knight. Johan is a capable leader and a talented combatant, as he is shown to be skilled swordfighter, archer, and  hand-to-hand fighter. He is the quintessential bold fighter, always ready to be in the thick of it, and a natural leader. Johan is quick to intervene whenever he sees an injustice being committed and will go all the way to rectify wrongs, ignoring Peewit's grumblings about the problems that they are going to face in the process. His name is pronounced \"Yohahn\".\nPeewit: (\"Pirlouit\" in the original French) A blond, gluttonous dwarf and Johan's best friend, he lived in the forest neighboring the King's castle playing practical jokes on the people and stealing meats and apples before being hired as the court jester. He agreed, provided that he was not obliged to wear the jester's outfit, which he felt made him look like a \"fool\" (which is another term for jester). His name is pronounced \"Peewee\".Contrary to what he believes himself, Peewit is a terrible musician, though, unlike Cacofonix from the Asterix series, the other inhabitants of the castle cannot bring themselves to tell him how bad he is — though the King did once make a show of removing earplugs in Peewit's presence. His \"music\" has also been known to cause rain.Peewit is easily upset, especially when Johan volunteers him to go on another adventure but, being cunning and agile, he is quite capable of escaping from a tight corner and putting up a fight. When outwitting his enemies, he screams out his cry of triumph: \"Peeeewiiiiit\". In the Smurfs cartoon series, rather than being a random dwarf, he is the King's nephew, as he states in the episode The Sorcery Of Maltrochu, and is portrayed as a kid, younger than Johan.\nBayard: Johan's horse and primary mount who typically accompanies him and Peewit on their various adventures. He is shown to be very loyal & protective of Johan and Peewit, having traveled to many lands and formed a strong bond with both of them. Bayard is also shown to be close with Biquette, Peewit's mount, with the two being capable of limited non-verbal communication. Bayard is typically portrayed as being a white stallion with black spots, although he has on occasion been depicted as being a chestnut shade. Bayard's exact breed of horse is never made clear in the series. He shares his name with the legendary horse Bayard from medieval European (including Belgium) folklore, although it is unknown if their shared name is coincidental or intentional.\nBiquette: Peewit's goat and primary mount who often accompanies him and Johan on their various adventures. She is very loyal to Peewit and Johan, and often assists them in battle against various enemies with her powerful horn attack. Biquette is also shown to be close to Bayard, Johan's mount, to the extent that the two can communicate with the other in a limited capacity. Biquette is depicted as a black nanny goat with a white splash near her mouth. Biquette's exact breed of goat is never made exactly clear in the series. Her name means \"young female goat\" in French, and she is named after a goat that belonged to Nine Culliford, the wife of series creator Peyo, as a child. Biquette is a common nickname in French for goats (see Biquette).\nThe King: The unnamed monarch of the Kingdom. He is somewhat carefree and enjoys wine but is also firm and is loved by his subjects and vassals. He has a beautiful niece, but no direct descendants. He can be very keen to go on expeditions and battles — which can be difficult given his old age.\nHomnibus: An enchanter whom the heroes often consult on matters of magic. He is also an alchemist and herbalist. It is he who first tells Johan and Peewit about the beings called the Smurfs.\nOlivier: Homnibus' young servant.\nRachel: An old sorceress, who has a terrible reputation, but is actually very kind and helpful. She knows how to make many different potions, including a mixture called Wine of Giddiness.\nCount Tremaine: (\"Comte Tréville\" in the original French) A skilled knight and brave warrior, he is a friend and role model to Johan.\nLady Barbera: Usually called \"Dame Barbara\" in the cartoon series; an old aristocratic woman who resides in the King's castle, always wearing a green dress. She has a reputation for being a gossip, as well as being somewhat prideful and stuck-up.\nThe Smurfs: The Smurfs appear in several stories as Johan and Peewit's allies. While the Smurfs have their own series, adventures with their two human friends remain part of the \"Johan and Peewit\" series. Papa Smurf's knowledge of magic is especially helpful.\nPapa Smurf: The leader of the Smurfs.\nSmurfette: A female Smurf created by Gargamel. She was originally the only female Smurf prior to the introduction of Sassette and Nanny in the 1981 TV series, Vexy in The Smurfs 2, and the Smurf Girls in Smurfs: The Lost Village and the 2021 Smurfs cartoon series. (she only features in the Smurfs cartoon series and the upcoming Johan and Peewit cartoon series).\nBrainy Smurf: (he only features in The Smurfs and the Magic Flute and Smurfs cartoon series).\nHefty Smurf: (he only features in The Smurfs and the Magic Flute and Smurfs cartoon series).\nClumsy Smurf: (he only features in The Smurfs and the Magic Flute and Smurfs cartoon series).\nDopey Smurf/Dimwitty Smurf:\nPrincess Sabina: Niece to the King. She is pretty but hates ladylike things and is an excellent marksman (she only features in the Smurfs cartoon series, but is based on Princess Anne, who appears in the third book).\n\n\nMerchandising\nWhile never as popular as the Smurfs, Johan and certainly Peewit enjoyed their share of fame and popularity as well, and consequently some merchandising was made. In 1959, a first Peewit figurine was made by Dupuis, followed a few years later by a Johan. In the 1970s, Bully and Schleich made Johan and Peewit figurines in their series of PVC Smurf figurines. Plush puppets were made as well.\n\n\nIn other media and comics\nOriginally a Johan and Peewit adventure, The Smurfs and the Magic Flute was adapted into an animated film in 1976 in Europe, with considerable success. It was re-released in 1983 in the wake of the success of the Smurfs cartoons from Hanna-Barbera, and enjoyed some success in the USA as well.\nJohan and Peewit were also featured in some of the animated Smurf cartoons, being the main stars in many episodes. In France and other European countries, their TV cartoon adventures were treated as a separate series from that of the Smurfs, even though the latter feature heavily.\nIn the early 1980s, some records about their adventures were made in France and Italy, contributors including Cristina D'Avena.\nOn July 11, 2024, a new animated series focused on Johan and Peewit was announced by Peyo Productions titled Tales of Johan & Peewit. The series modernizes the characters with a blend of 2D and 3D animation styled. The Smurfs are supporting characters in the series. \nAnother Peyo series was Benoît Brisefer (best known in English as \"Benny Breakiron\") about a little boy with extraordinary strength. Benoît's adventures are set in modern times. In one episode a man strongly resembling Johan can be seen signing into a luxury hotel near a film studio — he even wears a brown jacket and red trousers similar to Johan's; in another, a newspaper indicates the announcement of a film called Johan: The Return II with a photo of Johan next to it, and Biquette makes a cameo appearance in the same volume.\nWhen the Smurfs got their own series, Johan and Peewit did not feature. However, they did appear in a 2008 Smurf adventure called \"The Flute Smurfers\" (French: Les schtroumpfeurs de flûte). This story, published to mark the 50th anniversary of the first appearance of the Smurfs, is a prequel to La flûte à six schtroumpfs (published in English as \"The Smurfs and the Magic Flute\") and tells how the Smurfs first deliver the flute which was to be the basis of the 1958 story. Johan and Peewit help out a human friend of the Smurfs, but do not actually get to meet the little blue elves themselves.\n\n\nStories and English translations\nFew of Johan and Peewit's adventures have been published in English: La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs as The Smurfs and the Magic Flute (Hodder and Stoughton UK, 1979, Random House USA, 1983 and Papercutz USA, 2010), La guerre des sept fontaines as The War of the Seven Springs (Papercutz USA, 2013), and La Flèche noire under the title The Black Arrow (Fantasy Flight Publishing USA, 1995).\nBelow is a list of the French titles, their year of publication, an English translation of the titles and a brief description.\nThe first 13 albums were published by Dupuis; those that came afterwards were published by Le Lombard.\nAs well as Spirou magazine, some of the shorter stories, like Sortilèges au château, were published in Risque-Tout (French for \"Daredevil\") which came from the same publishers.\nJohan's adventures published in newspapers prior to his appearing in Spirou are not included.\n\n\nOther languages\nJohan and Peewit appeared in different other languages, of which the ones below with their corresponding names.\n\nCatalan: Jan i Trencapins\nDanish: Henrik og Hagbart\nDutch: Johan en Pirrewiet\nFinnish: Johannes ja Pirkale\nGerman: Johann und Pfiffikus\nHungarian: Janó és Bibice\nIcelandic: Hinrik og Hagbarður\nIndonesian: Johan dan Pirlouit\nItalian: John e Solfamì\nPortuguese: Johan e Pirlouit\nSpanish: Johan y Pirluit\nSwedish: Johan och Pellevin\n\n\nSee also\nMarcinelle school\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\nJohan and Peewit Dupuis Publishing (in French)",

His grandsons, the third generation of the Koç family, today run Turkey's largest group of companies, Koç Holding, the only Turkish company on the Fortune Global 500 list. In 2016, the family's wealth was estimated at US$8 billion, ranking them as the wealthiest family in Turkey. According to the Vehbi Koç Foundation, their lineage can be traced to Hacı Bayram-ı Veli.\n\n\nFamily history\n\n\nFirst generation\nVehbi Koç was born on July 20, 1901, in Ankara and died on February 25, 1996, in Istanbul. In 1926, he married Sadberk, his maternal cousin. The first firm he established was called Koçzade Ahmet Vehbi and was registered in 1926 at the Ankara Chamber of Commerce. While working in commerce, he became the local partner of Ford Motor Company and Standard Oil n 1928. When Ankara became the capital of the young Turkish Republic, construction work increased rapidly and Koç began trading in construction materials, building supplies and hardware. Following the establishment of branch offices in Istanbul and Eskişehir in 1938, he merged all these enterprises into a company called Koç Ticaret A.Ş.\nKoç's first initiative in the automotive sector eventually turned into a full-scale industry. Following an agreement with the Ford Motor Company in 1959, he set up Ford Otosan. In 1963 Vehbi Koç consolidated all the companies bearing his name under the same roof and founded Koç Holding. This was the start of the holdings era in Turkey and many businessmen followed Koç in the same direction.\nVehbi Koç founded an Eye Bank at the Faculty of Medicine of Ankara University, a Cardiology Institute at the Faculty of Medicine of Istanbul University, and the Vehbi Koç Dormitory at Middle East Technical University. Under the leadership of Vehbi Koç, 205 businesspeople, academics, and intellectuals came together to establish the Turkish Education Foundation (Turkish: Türk Eğitim Vakfı, commonly abbreviated as TEV) in 1967.\nKoç School opened in 1988 and Koç University in 1993.

Neither the Register of Shipping (RS), nor Lloyd's Register (LR) provided one. The most complete account of Whitby vessels gave her launch year as 1789, with owner F. Easterby.\nAurora first appeared in the RS in 1800 with J.Bevan, master, Mellish & Co. owner, and trade London–South Seas. It gave her origin simply as \"British\", and stated that she had undergone a thorough repair. By the 1802 volume the RS showed Aurora's master as Massey, her origin as Whitby, and her having undergone the thorough repair in 1799.\nAurora first appeared in LR in 1801 with S. Macey, master, Millen & Co., owner, and trade London–Southern Fishery.\nPeter Mellish owned Aurora for all four of her whaling voyages.\n1st whaling voyage (1799–1801): Captain Stephen Macey (or Macy, or Massey) sailed from London on 3 May 1799, bound for Walvis Bay. Aurora returned to London on 15 April 1801.\n2nd whaling voyage (1801–1802): Captain James Birnie acquired a letter of marque on 2 June 1801. Aurora left England on 23 June, and returned on 4 July 1804.\n3rd whaling voyage (1803–1804): Captain Thomas Gray (or Gay, or Thomas Goyes), sailed from England on 21 February 1803. He sailed during the Peace of Amiens and so did not acquire a letter of marque. Aurora returned on 6 April 1804.\n4th whaling voyage (1804–1806): Captain Peter Long acquired a letter of marque on 4 July 1804. On 4 September 1804, Captain Peleg Long sailed from England. Cyrus reported that Aurora had been at Saint Helena on 26 March 1806, having arrived from Brazil with 200 barrels of sperm oil and 300 barrels of whale oil. At St Helena Aurora also took on part of the cargo of oil from Commerce, which intended to continue to seek out whales.

The central apse stands in the very same position once occupied by the old watchtower. The central altar is embellished by a triptych representing the crucifixion of Saint Andrew. In one of the lateral passes, there is an altar dedicated to the Madonna of Pompei and a spiral staircase leading up to the organ.\"\nAndreae together with the businessman Moritz von Bernus, also founded the German Evangelical Church on the island in the year 1899, Capri being a popular holiday destination for Germans and also having a sizeable German population.",

    "text": "An arms embargo is a restriction or a set of sanctions that applies either solely to weaponry or also to \"dual-use technology.\" An arms embargo may serve one or more purposes:\n\nto signal disapproval of the behavior of a certain actor\nto maintain neutrality in an ongoing conflict\nas a peace mechanism that is part of a peace process to resolve an armed conflict\nto limit the ability of an actor to inflict violence on others\nto weaken a country's military capabilities before a foreign intervention\n\n\nHistorical examples\n\n\nArgentina\nUS President Jimmy Carter imposed an arms embargo on the military government of Argentina in 1977 in response to human rights abuses.\nAn arms embargo was put in place, along with other economic sanctions by the European Economic Community (EEC), within a week of the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentina, two British dependent territories in the South Atlantic. The European nations ended the embargo after the end of the ensuing Falklands War, and Argentina looked to Western European countries and Israel for arms supplies during the US embargo until it was lifted in 1989.\n\n\nIndonesia\nThe US government imposed an arms embargo against Indonesia in 1999 because of human rights violations in East Timor. The embargo was lifted in 2005.\n\n\nIran\nThe United States imposed economic sanctions against Iran following the Iranian Revolution in 1979. However, to secure the release of American hostages, several senior Reagan administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran in the 1980s in a scandal called the Iran–Contra affair. In 1995, the US expanded sanctions to include firms dealing with the Iranian government.\nIn March 2007, UN Security Council Resolution 1747 tightened the sanctions imposed on Iran in connection with the Iranian nuclear program. The sanctions were lifted on 16 January 2016.\nIn September 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the imposition of an arms embargo on the Iranian Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics and other entities involved in Iran's nuclear program, including the government of the disputed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro for providing weapons to Iran.\nOn 18 October 2020, Iran announced that the United Nations conventional arms embargo imposed on the country in 2007 had expired. The embargo had barred Iran from purchasing arms, including tanks and fighter jets, from foreign nations. The embargo was lifted as per the conditions under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world leaders, despite US objections.\n\n\nIsrael\n\nDuring 2024, due to the genocide in Gaza, several countries such as Italy, Japan, Spain, Canada, Colombia, the Netherlands and Belgium have ceased the sale of weapons to Israel. Key US allies such as Britain and France are debating it.\nHowever the United States and Germany as the major suppliers of Israel's arms imports keep supplying lethal weapons in spite of growing criticism of the mounting civilian casualties.\nOn May 20, 2025, Spain’s parliament has voted to enshrine in law an arms embargo on Israel that the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, introduced to end “the genocide in Gaza”. During the vote to approve the decision, 178 members of parliament voted in favor, and 169 members of parliament from the right and far-Right voted against the proposal. The Spanish arms embargo would completely prevent the sale of weapons to Israel and the purchase of Israeli weapons by Spain.\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China\nThe United States and the European Union stopped exporting arms to China after 1989 after the suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square. In 2004 and 2005, there was some debate in the EU over whether to lift the embargo.\n\n\nSomalia\n\nOn 1 December 2023 after 31 years the United Nations Security Council lifted the longest arms embargo on the Somali Armed Forces and the Somali federal government, while continuing sanctions against the Al-Shabaab militant group.\n\n\nSouth Africa\nUN Security Council Resolution 418 applied an arms embargo of South Africa in 1977 on dual-use items. The embargo was lifted by Resolution 919 in 1994.\n\n\nUnited States\nTo protest the Vietnam War, Sweden imposed an arms embargo on the United States in 1966. That notably deprived Navy SEALs of the Carl Gustav m/45 submachine gun, which resulted in the creation of the Smith & Wesson M76.\n\n\nList of current arms embargoes\nThe countries included in the list are under arms embargo of the UN or another international organization such as the EU and the OSCE and others) or a country. In some cases the arms embargo is supplemented by a general trade embargo, other sanctions (financial), or travel ban for specific persons. In some cases, the arms embargo applies to any entity residing or established in the country, but in others. it is partial with the recognized government's forces and international peacekeepers being exempted from the embargo.\n\n\nArms embargo by UN\n Democratic Republic of the Congo (non-governmental forces by UN, EU), 2003/1993–\n Haiti (by UN), 2022–\n Iraq (non-governmental forces by UN, EU), 2004–\n Libya (by UN, EU) 2011–\n North Korea (by UN, EU), arms and luxury goods, 2006–\n Lebanon (non-governmental forces by UN, EU), 2006–\n South Sudan (by UN) 2018–\n Sudan (by UN, EU), 2004/1994– (UN/EU)\n Yemen (by UN, EU), 2015–\n\n\nFormer embargos\n Eritrea (by UN, EU), 2010–2018\n Guinea (by EU), 2009–2014\n Iran (by UN, EU), 2006–2020\n Ivory Coast (by UN, EU), 2004–2016\n Rwanda (by UN in Resolution 918 and EU) (UN: 1994–2008, EU)\n Sierra Leone (by UN and EU), 1997–2010\n Somalia (by UN, EU), 1992/2002–2023 (UN/EU)\n Yugoslavia (by UN in Resolution 713 and EU) (UN/EU: September 1991)\n Central African Republic (by UN, EU), 2013–2024\n\n\nArms embargo by others\n Argentina (by the United Kingdom) 1982–\n Armenia (by OSCE), 1992–\n Azerbaijan (by OSCE), 1992–\n Belarus (by EU), 2011–\n Cuba (by US), 1958–\n Egypt (by EU), 2013–\n Myanmar (by EU), 1990–\n People's Republic of China (by EU/US), 1989–\n Venezuela (by EU), 2017–\n Syria (by the Arab League), 2011–\n Zimbabwe (by EU), 2002–\n Israel (by Spain), 2025-\n\n\nFormer embargos\n Syria (by EU), 2011–2013\n Turkey (by US) 1975–1978\n Uzbekistan (by EU), 2005–2009\n Vietnam (by US) 1984–1995\n\n\nSee also\nArms control\nArms Export Control Act (United States)\nArms industry\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHellström, Jerker (2010) \"The EU Arms Embargo on China: a Swedish Perspective\", Swedish Defence Research Agency\nUS Bureau of Industry and Security\nUK Current Arms Embargoes and Other Restrictions\nEuropean Commission CFSP Sanctions\nSIPRI database of multilateral arms embargoes since 1950",

It was first described by the Swedish entomologist Carl Alexander Clerck in 1759 from a specimen found in Sweden.\n\n\nDistribution\nThe moth can be found in Europe (including the Mediterranean region), Anatolia and through Asia to China. It is also found in North America.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe sallow kitten is grey/white and has a wingspan of 27 to 35 mm. The first part of the wing has a large grey middle band. It differs from the poplar kitten (Furcula bifida) in its generally smaller size, but more especially in the shape of the black line forming the outer margin of the central band; this is always more or less angled or dentate towards the front margin of the wings, whereas, in the poplar kitten, this portion of the line forms a clean curve.\n\n\nTechnical description (Seitz)\nThe blackish grey median band is sharply edged with black, its distal sinus usually extends only to the apex of the cell; beyond the middle 3 parallel dentate lines. In borealis Borkh., from Lapland and Northern Russia, thorax and wings are blackish smoke-colour; specimens from Amurland also are somewhat darker than those from Central and Southern Europe. — sangaica Moore, which inhabits North and Central China, is distinguished by its narrower median band. — Egg black.The larva at first blackish, later stages yellowish green clotted with red, a large patch on the thorax and continuous with it dorsal spots on abdominal segments 1 —8 dark red-brown; the spot on segment 4 largest, extending sideways to the stigmata. Head of the same colour as the spots. Anal filaments with red-brown . Pupa in a brown cocoon, yellowish brown with greenish wing-cases; frequently hibernates twice.\n\n\nBiology\nThe flight period ranges from April to the end of August. Depending on location the moth has one or two generations per year and is attracted to light.\n\nOva\nThe dark purple, hemispherical eggs are laid in batches of two or three on the upper surface of leaves in May or June and again in August. They hatch after nine days.\n\nLarvae\nThe caterpillar can grow up to 35 mm and is bright green with a purple brown marking on the saddle and can be found from May through to September. The main host plants are willow (Salix species) and occasionally aspen (Populus tremula) and other poplar (Populus species). Larvae can be found on small isolated moorland bushes.\n\nPupae\nBefore pupation the larva hollows out a recess. The pupa is dark purple-brown and pupation takes place in a tough cocoon constructed from a mixture of chewed wood-pulp and silk.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nSouth R.

    "text": "William Richard Higgins (January 15, 1945 – July 31, 1989) was a United States Marine Corps colonel who was captured in Lebanon in 1988 while serving on a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission. He was held hostage, tortured, and, 17 months later, he was murdered by his captors.\n\n\nBiography\n\nWilliam Higgins was born in Danville, Kentucky, on January 15, 1945.  He graduated from Southern High School in Louisville and earned his bachelor's degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. A scholarship student in the Navy ROTC, he received the Marine Corps Association Award and was commissioned in the Marine Corps in 1967. He later obtained master's degrees from Pepperdine University and Auburn University. He graduated from the Army Infantry Officers Advanced Course, the Air Force Command and Staff College, and the National War College.\nAs a lieutenant, he participated in combat operations in 1968 in South Vietnam as a rifle company platoon commander and executive officer with C Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. He was aide-de-camp to the Assistant Commander of the 3rd Marine Division.\nReturning to the States, Lt. Higgins served at Headquarters Marine Corps in 1969. In 1970, he served as the Officer-in-Charge of the Officer Selection Team in Louisville, Kentucky.\nHe returned to Vietnam in 1972, serving as an infantry battalion advisor to the South Vietnamese Marine Division. In 1973, he served as a rifle company commander with B Company, 1st Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, in Vietnam.\nFrom 1973 to 1977, Captain Higgins served at the Staff Noncommissioned Officers Academy and Officer Candidate School at Quantico, Virginia.\nReturning to the Fleet Marine Force in 1977, Capt. Higgins was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where he again served as a rifle company commander with A Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment. Upon promotion to major, he was reassigned as the Logistics Officer for Regimental Landing Team 2, 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade.\nAfter completion of the Air Force Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1980, designated a distinguished graduate, Higgins returned to Washington, D.C., where he served at Headquarters as a Plans Officer until his selection to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\nIn 1981 and 1982, he served as Military Assistant to the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, then as Assistant for Interagency Matters to the Executive Secretary for the Department of Defense.\nAfter graduation from the National War College in 1985, he returned to the Pentagon as the Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, where he served until he was transferred to his United Nations assignment in July 1987. He was promoted to colonel on March 1, 1989, while in captivity.\n\n\nCapture and murder\n\nIn 1982, the situation in Lebanon started to become more chaotic and violent. In 1985, three years before Higgins's kidnapping, William Francis Buckley, another retired American lieutenant colonel working for the CIA had been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered. On February 17, 1988, this situation repeated itself when Higgins, who was serving as the Chief, Observer Group Lebanon and Senior Military Observer, United Nations Military Observer Group, United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, was abducted.\nHiggins was driving alone on the coastal highway between Tyre and Naqoura in southern Lebanon, returning from a meeting with a local leader of the Amal movement, when a car blocked the road in front of him and forcing him to stop, after which he was pulled from his vehicle by armed men suspected of being affiliated with Hezbollah.\nAs a reaction to his abduction, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 618, demanding his release.\nDuring his captivity, he was interrogated and tortured. On April 21, 1988, a public statement in Arabic, along with black-and-white pictures of a disheveled and scruffy Higgins, was sent by the kidnappers to the news agency Reuters in which they proclaimed that Higgins was a war criminal and would be tried by a \"tribunal of the oppressed\". The kidnappers who claimed responsibility for Higgins' capture claimed to form part of a Shia Muslim terrorist organization called \"The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth\", which was in reality a pro-Iranian wing of Hezbollah.\nHiggins was eventually charged with \"spying for the criminal United States on our Lebanese and Palestinian peoples\" and \"active participation in American conspiracies against our Muslim people\".  Higgins, the statement went on to elaborate, worked in Lebanon supervising a \"Pentagon team to combat Lebanese and Palestinian Islamic organizations in Palestine and Lebanon\". American governmental officials rejected the accusations as \"nonsense\", who noted that Higgins had not been working on behalf of the United States government, but for the United Nations and on a peacekeeping mission.\nAfter his kidnapping, rumors and unconfirmed reports about Higgins' death began to circulate. For instance, on April 18, 1988, a Lebanese radio news outlet named Voice of Lebanon and controlled by Maronite Christians, and thus, unlikely to be influenced by Muslim extremists, claimed that Higgins had died in southern Lebanon in the crossfire of an armed clash between pro-Syrian and pro-Iranian militias as both Syria and Iran fought a proxy war on Lebanon for control of said country. Sources from the United Nations in the region claimed that Higgins had died under torture after he had tried to escape.\nOn July 31, 1989, the group announced that it had executed Higgins by hanging, and publicly released a videotape of the murder along with a statement calling the graphic footage \"an opening gift\" for Israel and the United States. This was in retaliation for the abduction of Hezbollah leader Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by Israeli commandos in South Lebanon, July 27, 1989, during which two other people accompanying Obeid also were taken and a neighbour killed. The operation had been planned by Israel's then minister of defence, Yitzhak Rabin.\nThe footage showed images of Higgins' body hanging by the neck as he slowly suffocated to death, and were televised around the world. FBI experts analyzed the footage. They concluded the body hanged was indeed Colonel Higgins. The video was also examined by Israeli security services, who raised doubts about its authenticity. Among other things, Higgins is seen in the video wearing a coat and winter clothes, which do not match the summer weather in July in Lebanon. Afterwards, with the return of his body to the Americans, knife cuts were discovered in his throat – which was likely the cause of death. According to the researchers who examined all the evidence, Higgins was murdered in December 1988.\nHiggins was declared dead on July 6, 1990. His remains were recovered on December 23, 1991, by Major Jens Nielsen of the Royal Danish Army, who was attached to the United Nations Observation Group in Beirut. The remains were found in an advanced state of decomposition beside a mosque near a south Beirut hospital. His body had been buried for several months prior.  After Higgins was murdered, his kidnappers buried the body. They then dug it out almost a year later, with their public statements.\nOnce recovered, Colonel Higgins' body was flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where it was conclusively identified and then he was interred at Quantico National Cemetery, Triangle, Virginia, on December 30, 1991.\nA memorial and religious service for Higgins had previously been held in November 1989 at Louisville's Southern High School, from which Higgins had graduated in 1963.\n\n\nAftermath\nOn February 16, 1992, Israeli troops assassinated Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi. Hezbollah responded one month later by attacking the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people.\nIn 1999, Higgins' widow filed a civil suit against Iran as the main sponsor of Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard in the United States Federal district court. The court ruled in her favor and issued a default judgment ordering the defendants, including the Islamic Republic Iran, to pay $57 million in compensatory damages to Higgin's widow and daughter for the 529 days he was held and tortured. The court ordered an additional $300 million in punitive damages be paid by the Revolutionary Guard. Iran showed no intention of paying the damage award.\n\n\nMilitary awards\nHiggins' military decorations and awards include the following:\n\nIn April 2003, he was posthumously granted a Prisoner of War Medal. In 1998, Department of Defense General Counsel, Judith A. Miller, initially blocked the award, based on the claim that \"circumstances do not appear to meet the criteria established by Congress for award of the Prisoner of War Medal.\"  The Navy later overruled her after it was determined that the 1989 expansion of the eligibility criteria allowed the award.\n\n\nOther awards and honors\nOn March 18, 1992, President George Bush awarded Colonel Higgins the Presidential Citizens Medal (posthumous).  The medal was accepted by his wife, Robin, and daughter, Chrissy.

    "text": "\"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" is a song recorded by Andy Gibb, initially released in April 1977 by RSO Records as the first single from his debut album Flowing Rivers (1977). The song was written by Gibb's older brother Barry, and produced by Gibb-Galuten-Richardson. It reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks, starting on the week ending 30 July 1977, and again for the week ending 17 September 1977.  It was Gibb's first single released in the United Kingdom and United States.  His previous single, \"Words and Music\" was only released in Australia.  It is ranked number 26 on Billboard's 55th anniversary All Time Top 100.\n\n\nWriting and recording\n\"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" was written by Barry Gibb in Bermuda, as well as \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water\" with Andy Gibb credited as co-writer on the latter. It was recorded in October 1976; the sessions were produced mainly by Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson and with Barry on this track and \"(Love Is) Thicker than Water\"; Galuten also played keyboards and piano. Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh contributed guitar on this song. The track is a fairly dramatic love song, with the singer declaring his unending passion and stating that without her, he would die.\nAndy reveals, \"'I Just Want to Be Your Everything' was one of the most meaningful of all form, you know.\" He later recalls Barry Gibb's writing style:\n\n\"So, once we discussed it all and got the deal together, me and Barry locked ourselves in a bedroom and Barry just started writing. When Barry writes, it is very hard to collaborate with him, because he is so quick. And before I knew it he was starting to do the chorus of ['I Just Want to Be Your Everything'], and I thought, 'Wow what a hook!'. He's an expert at his craft. Within about 20 minutes, he'd written a number one record; and then we went right into another one, ['(Love Is) Thicker than Water'.]\nTwo mixes were prepared for the song; the more popular mix was released on the album and as the single version, while the earlier mix was used for promotional purposes. The promo version had an additional keyboard that at times competed with the lead vocal. The drummer's high-hat count during both breakdowns was completely mixed out and Gibb's harmony vocal is more prevalent during ad-libs.\n\n\nRelease and chart success\nIn Billboard, the song spent a cumulative four weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The song first reached the top of the chart on July 30 for the first of three consecutive weeks. Then, The Emotions went to No. 1 with \"Best of My Love\" on August 20 for the first of four straight weeks, during which time Gibb's song remained in the top three. When the Emotions fell out of the #1 spot, \"I Just Want to be your Everything\" shot back to #1 for an additional week, on September 17. It was replaced once again by \"Best of My Love\", but would spend a record 16 weeks in the top 10. That record would be surpassed in early 1978, by his brothers, Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb, performing as The Bee Gees, when their song \"How Deep is Your Love\" spent 17 weeks in the top 10. On Billboard's Hot 100, \"I Just Want to be your Everything\" ultimately enjoyed a 31-week chart run spanning from the end of April through the end of November.\nIn Billboard's competitor magazine Cashbox, Gibb's hit stayed at #1 for three consecutive weeks, spent 12 weeks in the top 10, and 29 weeks on the Top 100.\nCash Box said that \"a high-pitched, boyish voice is the vehicle for this happy love song.\" Record World said that \"a sure pop touch should take this tune penned by brother Barry right up the charts.\"\nOn the Top Singles Chart of Record World (another Billboard competitor), \"I Just Want to be your Everything\" racked up a five-week stay at #1, which, like its four-week run on Billboard, was interrupted by The Emotions' \"Best of My Love\". On the Record World chart, Gibb hit #1 on August 6, stayed there on August 13, then yielded to The Emotions for two weeks, before returning to #1 for two additional weeks beginning on September 3. It had a record 15 weeks in Record World's top 10, from mid-July to late October, and spent of a total of 32 weeks in the top 100.\n\"I Just Want to be Your Everything\" was Andy Gibb's longest-running chart single on Billboard, Record World, and Cashbox. In terms of year-end charts, they all ranked \"I Just Want to be your Everything\" as the #2 song of 1977, bested by Debby Boone's \"You Light Up My Life\" (in Cashbox and Record World) and by \"Tonight's the Night\" by Rod Stewart (in Billboard). Gibb's song also appeared on the Soul Singles chart, peaking at number 19 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male at the 20th Grammy Awards.  The song became a gold record.\n\n\nPersonnel\nAndy Gibb — vocals\nBarry Gibb — background and harmony vocals\nJoe Walsh — electric guitar\nPaul Harris — keyboards\nAlbhy Galuten — synthesizer\nHarold Cowart — bass\nRon Ziegler — drums\nNelson \"Flaco\" Padrón — percussion\n\n\nChart performance\n\n\nConnie Smith's version\n\nThe best-known cover version of \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" was recorded by American country music artist Connie Smith. Released in the autumn of 1977, Smith's version, according to AMG reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, was \"relatively faithful\" to Gibb's version and — given its disco-influenced sound — also a departure from her honky-tonk songs of the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" peaked at #14 on Billboard Magazine's Hot Country Songs chart in 1978, becoming her last significant hit, as her further hits for Monument Records, such as \"Lovin' You Baby\" and \"They'll Never Be Another for Me,\" peaked in progressively lower positions on the country chart between 1978 and 1979.\n\n\nChart performance\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJust Want to Be Your Everything Andy Gibb - I Just Want to Be Your Everything on YouTube",

The goal is to shade in a tetromino within each pre-printed polyomino in such a way that no two matching tetrominoes are orthogonally adjacent (with rotations and reflections counting as matching), and that the shaded cells form a valid nurikabe: they are all orthogonally contiguous (form a single polyomino) and contain no 2×2 square tetrominoes as subsets.\n\n\nHistory\nThe puzzle was first printed in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #106; the original title is a combination of 'nuru' (Japanese: \"to paint\") and 'omino' (polyomino). In issue #112, the title was changed to the present one, which represents the four (of five) tetrominoes used in the puzzle: the L-shape, the straight, the T-shape, and the skew (square tetrominoes may never appear in the puzzle as they are a direct violation of the rule).\n\n\nComplexity\nTesting whether a given LITS puzzle has a solution is NP-complete.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Nikoli puzzle types\n\n\nReferences",

It has smooth greyish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, red to pink, sometimes yellowish flowers and conical to slightly bell-shaped fruit.\n\n\nDescription\nEucalyptus proxima is a mallee that typically grows to a height of 3 m (9.8 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey bark that is shed to reveal pale orange or coppery new bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are 40–75 mm (1.6–3.0 in) long and 15–30 mm (0.59–1.18 in) wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, 47–85 mm (1.9–3.3 in) long and 15–23 mm (0.59–0.91 in) wide tapering to a petiole 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a slightly flattened, down-turned, unbranched peduncle 12–22 mm (0.47–0.87 in) long, the individual buds sessile or on thick pedicels 1–4 mm (0.039–0.157 in) long. Mature buds are oval 8–15 mm (0.31–0.59 in) long and 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from September to November and the flowers are red to pink, sometimes yellowish. The fruit is a woody, conical to slightly bell-shaped capsule, 9–13 mm (0.35–0.51 in) long and 8–14 mm (0.31–0.55 in) wide with the valves near rim level.\n\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus proxima was first formally described in 2005 by Dean Nicolle and Ian Brooker from a specimen they collected near Jerdacuttup in 2002. The specific epithet (proxima) is from the Latin word proximus, meaning \"nearest\" or \"most similar\", referring to similarity of this species to E. cernua.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nNodding mallee grows in mallee shrubland between Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.\n\n\nConservation status\nThis eucalypt is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Eucalyptus species\n\n\nReferences",

He attended his father's alma mater, Newington College (1906–1908) and went up to the University of Sydney in 1909 and graduated MB in 1915.\n\n\nWar service\n\n\nWorld War I\nCarruthers served  with the Royal Army Medical Corps in England, France, Salonika and India from 1914 until 1919 and held the rank of major. After active service he undertook a post-graduate course in medicine in London, becoming a Member and later a Fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute.\n\n\nWorld War II\nIn 1940, he rejoined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He served until 1945 and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and was assistant director of hygiene in the First Australian Army. Carruthers was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the military division for distinguished service in the Middle East.\n\n\nMedical career\n\n\nNew South Wales\nFollowing World War I, Carruthers became a resident medical officer at the Coast Hospital. Until 1927 he worked mainly in mental diseases and undertook post-graduate studies in psychiatry at the University of Sydney. He worked at Callan Park and was in charge of five Red Cross nerve hospitals in Sydney tending ex-servicemen. He was also associated with Randwick Repatriation Hospital and worked in private practice.\n\n\nTasmania\nFrom 1927 until 1935 Carruthers was the senior house surgeon at the Royal Hobart Hospital and then for a year he was administrator of the Lachlan Park Hospital. He was appointed the Tasmanian Director of Public Health in 1936 and served in that capacity until rejoining the army in World War II. At war's end Carruthers was appointed Director of Hospitals and Medical Services in Tasmania. In 1951, upon the retirement of the Director of Public Health both that office and his own were combined in the position of Director General of Health and he held that position at the time of his death.\n\n\nDeath\nCarruthers died at the Royal Hobart Hospital after a long illness and following a funeral service at the Memorial Congregational Church was cremated. The chief mourners were his three sisters, as his parents and brother had predeceased him.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The sicklefin redhorse (Moxostoma ugidatli) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish in the genus Moxostoma. It is endemic to the southeastern United States, where it is known from a small section of the Appalachian Mountains in southwestern North Carolina and northern Georgia. Long known to the Cherokee people, it was only scientifically recognized as a distinct species in 1992, and only officially given a scientific name in 2025.\nThe fish was once an important food source to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians before it nearly disappeared in the 1970s and 1980s. A number of groups and agencies are attempting to preserve the fish, including the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, Duke Energy, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\nTaxonomy\n\n\nEtymology\nAccording to various sources it is called ugidatli (\"wearing a feather\", used as the specific epithet) or junghitla (\"wearing a red feather\") in the Cherokee language, referring to the fish's uniquely large dorsal fin. It has been colloquially referred to as the \"salmon of the South\" due to its migratory tendencies. Robert E. Jenkins, who first noted the distinctiveness of the species, originally proposed that the species be named Moxostoma falcatus (Latin for \"sickle-shaped\") as a reference to the shape of the dorsal fin and referred to it as such in correspondences, but the species was officially described as M. ugidatli to honor its significance to the Cherokee. \"Moxostoma falcatus\" is now a nomen nudum.\n\n\nDiscovery and description\nThe sicklefin redhorse was discovered to Western science in 1992, when Roanoke College biologist Robert E. Jenkins noted several distinctive redhorses recovered from the Little Tennessee basin. These redhorses had several unusual features, most notably their high, sickle-shaped dorsal fins, and their dentition suggested that they may represent hybrids between the river redhorse (M. carinatum) and smallmouth redhorse (M. breviceps). However, Jenkins later observed a spawning wild population comprising individuals that only associated with each other, confirming that they represented a distinct species. After more than 30 years, over which its distribution was analyzed and it became the subject of targeted conservation efforts, it was officially described as M. ugidatli in 2025. Jenkins, who had died a few years prior to description, was given a posthumous authorship on the study.\nGrowing to more than 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) in length, the sicklefin redhorse may represent the largest vertebrate species from continental North America to be discovered as a new species (as opposed to being split from a preexisting species) in the past century.\n\n\nEvolution\nThe closest relatives of the sicklefin redhorse are the shorthead redhorse (M. macrolepidotum) and pealip redhorse (M. pisolabrum), from which it diverged during the Late Miocene. The ancestral sicklefin redhorse may have been restricted to basins carved within metamorphic rock, and thus become isolated in the Blue Ridge range by the gradual erosion of metamorphic rock and associated exposure of the sedimentary rocks of the Ridge-and-Valley province, isolating it upstream. A similar evolutionary history has been assumed for the greenfin darter.\n\n\nDistribution\nIt is endemic to a small portion of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina and Georgia. It is primarily found in the Hiwassee and Little Tennessee rivers, where it exclusively lives, but also migrates up smaller streams including the Valley River, Brasstown Creek, Tuckasegee River, and the Oconaluftee River. Its distribution includes the Great Smoky Mountains, and some specimens have been recovered from Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Its range has been significantly reduced due to impoundment of rivers by dams, and it has been extirpated from sites such as the Nottely River and the lower Oconaluftee, which may qualify for reintroduction.\n\n\nEcology\nThe sicklefin redhorse is a potamodromous species that inhabits the downstreams of large rivers in the summer and fall, and migrates to lotic habitats just upstream of reservoirs in the winter. Some populations overwinter within reservoirs such as Fontana Dam. They migrate to smaller tributaries in the spring to spawn. Their dependency on now-dammed lotic habitats has contributed to their endangerment. They appear to be highly sensitive to cold temperatures.\n\n\nMorphology\n\nThe sicklefin redhorse can reach up to 25 in (640 mm) long, and weigh up to 7 lb (3.2 kg). It features a large and sickle-shaped dorsal fin on its back, which is generally olive-colored but sometimes partly red. The body is olive-colored with a brassy sheen. The lower fins are primarily dusky to dark, often with a yellow or orange tint, and the tail fin of the fish is mostly red.\n\n\nParasites\nThe sicklefin redhorse is known to be infected by a single species of potentially host-specific myxozoan, Myxobolus naylori, which uses the redhorse as an intermediate host. This is the only Myxobolus species known to infect a Moxostoma.\n\n\nRelationship with humans\n\nThe Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians once depended on the sicklefin redhorse, as well as other large redhorse (Moxostoma) fishes, for a food supply. The hunting of the fish was historically a big event and a family affair; large stone V-shaped weirs were set up in the river next to involved settlements with traps for the fish placed at their apexes.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nFavrot, Scott D.; Kwak, Thomas J.

    "text": "James of Aragon (29 September 1296 – July 1334) was the eldest child of King James II. His mother was Blanche of Naples, the second of his father's four wives. As the king's eldest son, James was not only an infante but also heir apparent to the Crown of Aragon, a realm stretching from north-eastern Spain to Sardinia and Corsica. He is best known for his unexpected decision to renounce his marriage and right to the throne and become a monk.\n\n\nYouth\nWhen Queen Blanche's pregnancy became apparent in the spring of 1296, King James II sent for a respected physician from Paris, who helped the queen deliver Infante James on 29 September. King James personally oversaw the health of the heir apparent to the Crown of Aragon, even after the infante reached adulthood; he appointed his son's physicians and expected them to regularly report to him. Even the infante's chamberlain was a former royal surgeon. James was appointed procurator general already in his youth, with the task of handling judicial affairs in the name of his father. In 1313, he survived a severe fever.\n\n\nMarriage controversy\nJames's engagement to Eleanor of Castile was agreed upon in December 1308 at Monreal de Ariza. The union was of great importance, as the one-year-old infanta was the only child of King Ferdinand IV. Eleanor moved to Aragon in 1312, to be raised as its future queen. James, however, was notoriously unpredictable. In the spring of 1318, aged 22, he announced to his father that he wished to break off the engagement and renounce his right to the crown so that he could take holy orders, despite never before having shown interest in monastic life. The infuriated king tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him. In August, the infante came down with an abscess, from which he suffered throughout the autumn and into the winter. He used it as an excuse not to visit his father, which further worsened their relationship. The marriage went ahead despite the bridegroom's vehement opposition. It was celebrated on 5 October 1319 in Gandesa, but James refused to consummate it. At the time of the wedding, the bride was only 12 years old, while James was 23.\n\n\nCloistered life\nThe king eventually gave in to his son's demands. The renunciation was ratified in the presence of an assembly of noblemen at the Monastery of Saint Francis in Tarragona on 22 December. The marriage, unconsummated, was easily annulled. James entered the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, only to leave it later to join the local Order of Montesa. Father and son's relationship became increasingly strained following the renunciation, with the younger James's instability and licentiousness continuously troubling the king.\nOn the death of their father in 1327, the crown passed to James's brother, the freshly widowed Alfonso IV. Alfonso proceeded to marry Eleanor, James's former wife, in 1329. James died in July 1334.\n\n\nReferences",

The oldest extant manuscripts date from 1566 and 1581.\nThis story is widely spread in Minnan-speaking areas, mainly the south part of Fujian, Chaoshan (Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shantou), Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Tân Saⁿ and Gō͘-niû (traditional Chinese: 陳三五娘; simplified Chinese: 陈三五娘; pinyin: Chén Sān Wǔniáng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tân-saⁿ-Gō͘-niû; Teochew: Dang5 San1 Ngou6 Niê5) is a popular Taiwanese opera adaptation based on the play.\n\n\nStory\nTân Saⁿ (Tan) is a scholar who is native to Quanzhou in southern Fujian province. When he sent his brother- and sister-in-law to Guangnan, he stopped in Chaozhou. During the Lantern Festival, Tan met N̂g Gō͘-niû (Ng) by chance and they fell in love with one another. Lim, a local rich man's son, also saw Ng in the lantern show, and he was shocked by Ng's beauty. So Lim asked for a blind date and sent a lot of bride-price to Ng's house, because he wanted to marry Ng. Ng's father was greedy so he agreed to Lim's proposal. Ng did not want to obey her father's decision but she was obligated to, so she fell into deep sorrow.\nIn June, Ng went to the embroidery room (繡樓) accompanied by her maidservant, Ang. At that time, Tan returned to Chaozhou seeking Ng. They recognized one another in the long distance and were filled with all kinds of emotions. Ng threw her handkerchief with lychee to Tan to show her own feeling. Tan was very excited and then he came up with an idea to go to Ng's house to see her again.\nSeveral days later, Tan, disguised as a person, broke the treasure mirror on purpose. So he could sell himself to Ng's family as a servant to compensate the mirror. Ng guessed Tan's motive so she was very happy but worried. She could not deny the marriage with Lim and stay with Tan forever.\nA year later, Tan still could not know what Ng's mind exactly. He was so disappointed that he decided to return to Quanzhou. Ang asked the reasons then she sent a letter written by Tan to Ng. After reading his letter, Ng was very moved and met Tan alone. They loved each other deeply and decided to stay with each other no matter how hard the difficulties were. Lim could not wait to marry Ng, so he asked Ng to marry him within three days. Tan and Ng had no choice but to escape from Chaozhou to Quanzhou.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nXin chen san wu niang (1967) at IMDb\nDigital scan, 重刊五色潮泉插科增入詩詞北曲勾欄荔鏡記戲曲全集 (1566), vol. 1.

    "text": "Shichirigahama (七里ヶ浜) is a beach near Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, which goes from Koyurugimisaki Cape, near Fujisawa, to Inamuragasaki Cape, west of Kamakura. Since from it one could enjoy a clear view of both Mount Fuji and Enoshima at the same time, during the Edo period it was popular as a subject for ukiyo-e. For example, famous ukiyo-e artists Hiroshige and Hokusai both include it in their 36 Views of Mount Fuji. Its dark sands are rich in iron ore which allowed Kamakura to become a florid center for the production of swords and knives. Its name is usually translated into English as \"Seven Ri Beach\", the ri being a unit of measurement.\nUnlike its easterly neighbor Yuigahama, its floor drops too quickly, so it is not very popular as a sea resort, but surfers are present in every season. Since 1939 it is administratively part of the City of Kamakura. The area is served by the Enoshima Electric Railway, or Enoden, which connects Kamakura Station in Kamakura with Fujisawa Station.\n\n\nEtymology of the name\nThe beach's name means \"Seven Ri Beach\", where a ri is an old Japanese unit of measurement equivalent to 3.9 km (2.4 mi), and therefore Shichirigahama should be about 27 km (17 mi) long. In fact, it is just over one tenth of that length. The origin of the name is unknown, and many hypothetical etymologies exist. According to a passage of the Shinpen Kamakurashi, it comes from the Shichiri Bikyaku (七里飛脚) (a term usually shortened into just Shichiri), which was an Edo period messenger service on the Kantōdō highway with a horseman change every seven \"ri\". However, since the expression shichiri also meant \"a long ride\", the name could also just mean that the beach is very long. Shichirigahama has also been called Shichirinada (七里灘), Shichibama (七里浜) and Shichiriura (七里浦).\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough not part of Kamakura proper since it lies outside the city's Seven Entrances, the entire area from Katase to Inamuragasaki represents a historically important area just outside the former military capital. According to the Azuma Kagami and the Shinpen Kamakurashi, Shichirigahama was the Kamakura shogunate's execution ground. It was also the scene of many battles, and records show that in the Edo period bones and rusty weapons were still being recovered from its sand.\n\n\nMinamoto no Yoshitsune's letter from Koshigoe\n\nMinamoto no Yoritomo's famous younger half-brother Yoshitsune, celebrated in Japan in Noh and Kabuki plays for both his bravery and his death, served the shōgun faithfully for years, leading the Minamoto clan in defeating the Taira clan, but for several reasons couldn't avoid a confrontation with him. After some victories, he tried to enter Kamakura, but was stopped at Koshigoe by a letter from Hōjō Tokimasa. He waited fruitlessly about 20 days at Koshigoe's Manpuku-ji, near Shichirigahama, then dictated to his attendant Benkei a letter for Yoritomo destined to become famous, the \"Letter from Koshigoe\", in which he complained that he had never betrayed his brother, but to the contrary had always faithfully served him. He had won for him important victories, but had received nothing but reproach and diffidence in return. Yoritomo didn't relent, so Yoshitsune gave up and left Koshigoe for Kyoto. The letter originally appears in the Azuma Kagami and is not believed to have been penned by Yoshitsune. It probably does however reflect his true feelings.\nThe feud between brothers continued until a fugitive Yoshitsune was forced to kill himself. His six-week-old head preserved in liquor was then brought to the shōgun, who accepted it in Koshigoe in 1182. Yoshitsune is enshrined in Shirahata Jinja in Fujisawa.\n\n\nInamuragasaki\n\nEmperor loyalist Nitta Yoshisada in 1333 invaded Kamakura, deposing its Regent Hōjō Takatoki and ending the 145-year old Kamakura shogunate. According to the legend, being unable to defeat Kamakura defenses on land, he went down to Shichirigahama and, at the impassable cape of Inamuragasaki, prayed to the god Ryūjin to withdraw the waves and let him through.\nThe stele at Sode no Ura (袖の浦), the tiny bay west of Inamuragaki, reads:\n\n666 years ago on May 21, 1333 Nitta Yoshisada, judging Kamakura's invasion on land to be difficult, decided to try to bypass this cape. This is the place where, according to tradition, he threw his golden sword into the waves, praying to the sea-god to withdraw them and let him pass. (Stele erected in 1917)\n\n\nNichiren in Shichirigahama\n Nichiren Buddhism was born in Kamakura, and the city is rich in places tied to both Nichiren and his life. Several of them are in Shichirigahama. This is because one of the shogunate's execution grounds was in Katase near Fujisawa in the spot where now Ryūkō-ji is, so, when Nichiren was condemned to death, he had to be brought there. Nichiren had been condemned for having written his Risshō Ankoku Ron, judged to be subversive by authorities. A miracle however saved him, because when he was about to be beheaded (an event known to Nichiren's followers as the Tatsunokuchi Persecution (龍ノ口法難)), lightning struck his executioner. Nichiren was ultimately pardoned and an order was sent to Katase to stop the execution.\n\n\nReikō-ji\nReikō-ji (霊光寺) and its Tanabegaike Pond (田辺が池) were the scene of one of Nichiren's miracles. In a period of extreme drought, after the famous priest Ninshō had already failed he successfully prayed the gods for rain. For this reason, the pond is also known as Amagoinoike (雨乞の池, or \"Rain-prayer Pond\").\n\n\nNichiren's pine tree\nThe so-called Nichiren Kesagake no Matsu (日蓮袈裟掛けの松) was a pine tree on the road to Katase from which Nichiren hanged his kesa (a Buddhist stole) while on his way to Ryūkō-ji so that it wouldn't be soiled by his blood. The original pine tree died long ago, and has been replaced many times by the faithful. Today, however, there is no pine tree and only a stele is left.\n\n\nYukiaibashi Bridge\nThe Yukiaibashi Bridge (行合川, \"Meeting-each-other Bridge\") is a small bridge near Enoden's Shichirigahama's station built on the spot where a messenger carrying Nichiren's pardon met the messenger bound in the opposite direction to announce his miraculous salvation.\n\n\nKoyurugimisaki\nAt the western end of the beach another cape, similar in size and shape to Inamuragasaki, juts into the sea. It's called Koyurugimisaki (小動岬) (\"Small Movement Cape\"), and on it stands a small Shinto shrine called Koyurugi Jinja. Once again, the origin of its unusual name is unknown.\nOne legend says that, during the Edo period, on it stood a pine tree which shook even when there was no wind, producing an extremely pleasant sound as if a celestial creature was playing an instrument. According to another, the founder of the shrine, who was a Kamakura period samurai called Sasaki Moritsuna, saw the pine tree move very slightly and emit sounds like those of a koto, so he gave the cape its name.\nNitta Yoshisada stopped at Koyurugi Jinja in 1333 to pray for victory. Having won, he came back to offer a sword and some money to the shrine, with which the shinden was later restored. The shrine used to be called Hachiōji-gū (八王子宮) from the name of Koshigoe's tutelary spirit (chinju (鎮守/鎮主)), but its name was changed during the shinbutsu bunri (the forced separation of Buddhism and Shinto in temples and shrines) in the Meiji era. Later, in 1909, it was fused with another shrine, and for that reason it now enshrines kami Takeminakata no Mikoto.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nKamakura Shōkō Kaigijo (2008).

    "text": "Niels Trolle til Trollesholm og Gavnø (20 December 1599 – 20 September 1667) was a Danish nobleman who served as vice admiral under Christian IV and later as Steward of Norway from 1656 to 1661. He played a central administrative role during the Nordic War.\n\n\nPersonal life\nTrolle was born in Ringkøbing and was a brother-in-law of Gregers Krabbe and Niels Krabbe. He was the son of vassal Børge Trolle (d. 1610). He studied at Herlufsholm School for 2 years, and later went on a field trip to Leipzig. Trolle returned home in 1615 only to leave again to study abroad in Giessen. After a brief visit to his home in Denmark, he studied at the University of Padua, and also in France and England.\nOn 23 July 1626, he married Mette Corfitzdatter Rud, who died on 25 February 1632. In 1634, Trolle was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Copenhagen Castle, and on 16 October 1636, he married Helle Rosenkrantz (1618-1685), daughter of Holger Rosenkrantz, at Glimminge.\nThe estate at Gavnø (Gavnø Gods)  in Næstved was acquired by Niels Trolle in 1663. In the late 1660s, the church became a private chapel. It was embellished by his wife Lady Helle Rosenkrantz into one of Denmark's most colorful churches and is the only visible remnant of the priory. \n\n\nCareer\nAfter serving in several positions as an agent of the nobility, Trolle was elected as a land commissioner in Zealand in 1638. He became a member of the Admiralty Court in Bremerholm in 1639. In 1643, when the Torstensson War started, he served as a general provisioning commissioner until the spring of 1645, when Christian IV offered him the position of vice admiral.\nTrolle did not play a major role in the war as a naval officer. Although he was ordered to aid in the defense of the island of Bornholm in June 1645, the island fell before his forces could participate, and his fleet and company were confined in the Copenhagen harbor.\nIn August, the Second Treaty of Bromsebro (Brømsebrofreden) was signed and in September he participated in the exchange of ratifications in Markaryd for which the fleet was unprepared. Christian IV was very angry at him for his attitude against his father-in-law, Holger Rosenkrantz, during the procession of nobles in 1646.\nIn 1647, he was a member of a commission to investigate the financial condition. Then in August 1648, he followed Frederick III to Akershus Fortress and received the Order of the Elephant (Ridder af Elefantordenen, R.E.), the highest order of Denmark-Norway. In February 1650, he joined the commission to report on the navy but resigned as vice-admiral due to infirmity in January 1651. He heard cases for Hannibal Sehested and Corfitz Ulfeldt, and in July was given a seat on the review commission to examine deliveries to Holmen. In 1655, he became a member of the newly established Admiralty.\nTrolle had been strongly considered for Statholder of Norway in 1651 after Hannibal Sehested, and in 1656 he succeeded his brother-in-law Gregers Krabbe to the position. He was appointed to Akershus len (county) instead of Roskilde. Lieutenant General Jørgen Bjelke, commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army, was highly critical of Trolle's governorship due to his lack of support and inactivity during the second war with Sweden (1658–1660). \nIn 1660, Trolle was among those who was the most critical over Frederick III's revolution to install himself as an absolute monarch. Rumors spread among the opposition that he had been beaten by a citizen of Copenhagen, because of his views. Later Trolle accepted absolute monarch, and became a member of  the privy council, 13 October 1660. At the same time, he endured personal difficulties caused by Colonel  Jørgen Løvenklaus. They had a violent disagreements in October, which led to interrogations by the Royal Commission. In March 1661, the Supreme Court acquitted Trolle of all Løvenklau's accusations and condemned his opponent to suffer as a liar. However, he complained that he was tried by a court, because of his nobel background.\n\n\nDecline and death\nTrolle was succeeded as Governor of Norway by Iver Krabbe (1602–1666) in September 1661. He settled in Copenhagen, but was not taken in any of the new management colleges, felt strongly infringed by the new ranking rules of 1662, and was regarded for several years as an opponent of the government. He died on 20 September 1667, and was buried in the chapel of Roskilde Cathedral.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is a rare, autosomal recessive form of muscular dystrophy (weakness and breakdown of muscular tissue) mainly described in Japan but also identified in Turkish and Ashkenazi Jewish patients; fifteen cases were first described on 1960 by Dr. Yukio Fukuyama.\nFCMD mainly affects the brain, eyes, and muscles, in particular, the disorder affects development of the skeletal muscles leading to weakness and deformed appearances, and brain development is blunted affecting cognitive functioning as well as social skills. In 1995, the disorder was linked to mutations in a gene coding for the protein fukutin (the FCMD gene). Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is the second most prevalent form of muscular dystrophy in Japan.  One out of every 90 people in Japan is a heterozygous carrier.\n\n\nSymptoms and signs\nIn terms of the signs/symptoms of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy it is characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle tone as well as an impairment in brain and eye development. Initial symptoms of FCMD present in early infancy as decreased ability to feed.  Marked differences in facial appearance occur due to decreased muscle tone. Further characteristics include:\n\nSeizures\nDelay in development\nCardiac issues\nSwallowing difficulty\nNeurological problems\nFukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy also affects the nervous system and various associated parts.  FCMD affects normal development of the brain producing a broadly smooth, bumpy shaped cortex named cobblestone lissencephaly as well as various other malformations, notably micropolygyria. Children also experience delayed myelination in the brain.\n\n\nCause\n\nThe cause of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is rooted in the FKTN gene, located at human chromosome 9q31, encoding  the protein fukutin.  Mutations in this gene, and therefore the fukutin protein, are the cause of FCMD. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\nThis means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 9 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.\nTwo mutations have been identified. The first and most common is an SVA retrotransposal insertion in the 3'-untranslated region. The second is a deep-intronic point mutation c.647+2084G>T. This second mutation has only been found to date in the presence of the first mutation.\n\n\nPathophysiology\n\nThe mechanism of this sub-type of muscular dystrophy consists of a mutation in the FKTN gene which results in a malformed fukutin protein. It is thought that fukutin modifies the alpha-dystroglycan protein, which is important in anchoring cells to certain molecules, specifically including some proteins.  Alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscles helps to prevent the breakdown of muscle fibers through stabilization and protection.  Alpha-dystroglycan also helps brain development by assisting in the migration of neurons. Most frequently, FKTN is mutated in such a way that creates a shortage of fukutin in the cell, which in turn creates problems during formation of alpha-dystroglycan leading to less stabilization of muscle cells.  Use of the destabilized muscle fibers over time causes them to break down and a gradual decline in muscle tone and atrophy of muscle fibers occurs. The decline in cerebral fukutin causes neuronal cells to continue moving beyond their intended destination. Additionally, oxidative stress has some effect on astrocytes (as well as, neurons) when fukutin is subdued.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nSerum creatine kinase concentration and muscle biopsies can be obtained to help determine if the individual has FMCD.  FKTN molecular genetic testing is used to determine a mutation in the FKTN gene after a serum creatine kinase concentration, muscle biopsies, and/or MRI imaging have presented abnormalities indicative of FCMD, the presence of the symptoms indicates Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.  The available genetic test include:\n\nLinkage analysis\nDeletion analysis\nSequence analysis - exons\nSequence analysis - entire coding region\n\n\nTreatment\nCurrently this sub-type of muscular dystrophy has no cure and no definitive treatment exists.  Treatment offers preventative tactics to delay muscle breakdown and increase life expectancy.  Stretching and physical therapy can increase mobility.  Treatment also includes correcting skeletal abnormalities through orthopedic surgery and other orthopedic techniques. Antiepileptic medication is administered to help prevent seizures.  ACE inhibitors and beta blockers help treat heart conditions, and respiratory assistance is more than likely needed at some point for the affected individual.\n\n\nPrognosis\nFukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy has a poor prognosis.  Most children with FCMD reach a maximum mobility at sitting upright and sliding. Due to the compounded effects of continually worsening heart problems, impaired mental development, problems swallowing and additional complications, children with FCMD rarely live through adolescence, the disorder proves fatal by age 20.\n\n\nSee also\nCongenital muscular dystrophy\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAida, N.; Tamagawa, K.; Takada, K.; Yagishita, A.; Kobayashi, N.; Chikumaru, K.; Iwamoto, H.

    "text": "David Alexander Robertson BEM (born 17 October 1968) is a Scottish former football player and coach, who was most recently the manager of Scottish League One club Peterhead. \nRobertson played as a left back for Aberdeen, Rangers, Leeds United, Montrose and represented Scotland. Since retiring as a player, he has managed Elgin City, Montrose, Phoenix FC and most recently I-League club Real Kashmir, before being appointed manager of Peterhead in November 2022.\n\n\nPlaying career\nRobertson began playing football with Deeside Boys Club (now Banks O' Dee FC) before he started his football career by signing an \"s\" form with local club Aberdeen, where he won the Scottish Youth Cup alongside Joe Miller, Paul Wright and Stevie Gray. After becoming a first team regular aged 17, he won a Scottish League Cup winner's medal against Rangers in 1989 and a Scottish Cup winner's medal in 1990 against Celtic in a match which ended with a thrilling penalty shoot out (9–8, Robertson scoring his kick).\nRobertson moved to Rangers for £970,000 in 1991. With the Ibrox club, he helped the club to the last six of their joint-record nine championship titles in a row, as well as adding three more Scottish Cups and three more League Cups to his collection. He only received one red card during his spell, for a brutal bodycheck on his friend Joe Miller in the opening minutes of the Old Firm 1992 Scottish Cup semi-final, which broke the Celtic winger's ribs (Miller played on, Rangers still won the match with ten men and Robertson appeared in the final after suspension). During his time at the Gers, he won three full international caps for Scotland.\nAfter exactly 250 games for Rangers, Robertson signed for Leeds United in 1997 for £500,000, but recurring injury problems curtailed his spell in England and he played only 26 league matches in four years at Elland Road (all in the first season).\nRobertson retired from football in 2001 but was back playing in 2002 when he was appointed player/assistant manager of Scottish Football League club Montrose. He scored his first and only goal for Montrose in a 3–2 defeat at Cowdenbeath in the Scottish League Cup. His playing career with Montrose was cut short, however, due to one of his Achilles tendons snapping during a match against Greenock Morton in the same year.\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn September 2006, Robertson was appointed manager of Montrose but he resigned just four months later. He moved to Phoenix, Arizona and worked as a director of boy's coaching at the Sereno Soccer Club. Robertson was head coach of USL Pro club Phoenix FC in 2013.\n\n\nReal Kashmir\nIn January 2017 Robertson was appointed as the head coach of Indian I-League 2nd Division side Real Kashmir. Under his tenure Real Kashmir won the promotion to Indian top flight football, thus becoming the first team from Kashmir to be promoted to the I-League. Robertson also signed his son Mason to play for the club. \nRobertson's management of Real Kashmir was featured in two documentaries made for BBC Scotland, Real Kashmir FC and Return to Real Kashmir FC, which won best documentary at Scottish BAFTAs, the UK Broadcast awards, and the European Sports Awards in Rotterdam. He was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to the community in Kashmir and UK-India relations. He left the club in September, and was succeeded by Mehrajuddin Wadoo.\n\n\nPeterhead\nOn 29 November 2022, Robertson was named as the new manager of Scottish League One club Peterhead, marking his first managerial role in Scotland in 15 years. He left the position in March 2023, following a run of results that the Peterhead chairman described as \"embarrassing\".\n\n\nPersonal life\nHis son Mason is also a footballer.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\n\n\nInternational appearances\n\n\nManagerial record\nAs of match played 18 March 2023\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nPlayer\nAberdeen\n\nScottish Cup: 1989–90\nScottish League Cup: 1989–90\nRangers\n\nScottish Premier Division: 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1995–96, 1996–97\nScottish Cup: 1991–92, 1992–93, 1995–96\nScottish League Cup: 1992–93, 1993–94, 1996–97\n\n\nManager\nElgin City\n\nNorth of Scotland Cup: 2003–04\nReal Kashmir\n\nI-League 2nd Division: 2017–18\nIFA Shield: 2020, 2021\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDavid Robertson at Soccerbase \nProfile and stats at AFC Heritage Trust\nDavid Robertson at Premier League (archived)\nDavid Robertson at Post War English & Scottish Football League A–Z Player's Transfer Database\nProfile at Sporting-Heroes.net\nProfile at Leeds United FC History",

    "text": "Alsophila pometaria, the fall cankerworm, is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is found in North America from Nova Scotia west to Alberta, south to Colorado and California.\n\n\nDescription\nThe caterpillars grow to about 25 mm long. In color, they vary from light green to a dark brownish green. Light green caterpillars have white lines running down the body from the head to the tip of the abdomen while the darker caterpillars have a black stripe the length of their back. Larvae have three pairs of legs on their thorax and three pairs of prolegs on their abdomen. The first pair of prolegs (on segment 8, unexpected in Geometridae as opposed to Noctuidae) is much smaller than the last two pairs (the one on segment 9 typical for geometer moths and the pygopodium at the end of the animal). The pupa is wrapped in a silk cocoon and is buried just beneath the surface of the ground.\nAdult males have a 25–35 mm wingspan. The  forewings are glossy brown and crossed with irregular white bands. The females are brownish gray, wingless, and 10–12 mm long. Eggs are grayish brown with a dot and ring on the top and are less than 1 mm in diameter.\n\n\nBiology\nThe larvae feed on a large variety of deciduous trees and shrubs, including Ulmus, Fraxinus and Acer. Other recorded hosts include hackberry, oak, various members of the rose family, walnut and willow. The larvae hatch and are active in the spring. These insects are called fall cankerworms because the females emerge from the soil in November, mate and lay their eggs in clusters on hardwood trees.\nThere are some natural enemies of this species. Many birds eat the caterpillars. The ground beetle, Calosoma frigidum also feeds on the caterpillars. The wasp, Telenomus alsophilae, parasitizes the eggs. The Aleiodes species Aleiodes gastritor is a parasitoid of this species' caterpillars. \n\n\nEconomic importance\nThe larvae, called loopers or inchworms, are considered a serious pest of many tree species because they can cause major defoliation in the new spring growth. If defoliation occurs two years in a row, the tree can die, especially if it has been stressed by drought.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"910672.00 – 6258 – Alsophila pometaria – Fall Cankerworm Moth – (Harris, 1841)\".

    "title": "Ransom of John II of France",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=5171887",
    "text": "The ransom of John II of France was an event during the Hundred Years War, between France and England. King John was captured by the English during the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, and held for ransom by the English crown. Finally settled in the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360, the ransom of John II had serious consequences for the ongoing degradation of the stability of France and helped increase English influence during the war.\n\n\nBackground\n\nFrom his ascent to the throne in 1350 to the time of his capture in 1356, King John II's reign had been marked by tensions both within and outside of his kingdom. John's Valois claim on French territories was disputed by both Charles II of Navarre and Edward III of England. Vital provinces such as Normandy maintained a high level of autonomy from the crown and frequently threatened to disintegrate into private wars. Worse, many nobles had closer links to the English crown than to Paris. The Hundred Years' War that had begun nineteen years before was not a modern war of nations; as one scholar has put it, it was 'an intermittent struggle... a coalition war, with the English often supported by Burgundians and Gascons, and even a civil war, whose combatants looked back to a heritage that was partly shared.'\nThe French defeat at Crécy under John's father, Philip VI of France, and the loss of Calais had increased the pressures on the Valois family to achieve military success. John himself was an unlikely candidate for a warrior prince; his health was fragile and he engaged little in physical activity, seldom jousting or hunting. His interests ran more towards literature, and to the patronage of painters and musicians. Perhaps in response to his lack of martial prowess, John had created the Order of the Star. As with Edward III's creation of the Order of the Garter, John hoped to play on the concepts of knightly chivalry to bolster his prestige and authority. Having grown up amongst intrigue and treason, John governed in a secretive manner. His reliance upon a close circle of trusted advisers frequently alienated his nobles, who objected to what they perceived as arbitrary justice and the elevation of unworthy associates, such as Charles de la Cerda. The issues of friction within the French nobility, weaknesses in personal administration and chivalric ideals would play out in the ransom of King John.\n\n\nCapture\n\nAfter straining financial trouble for both kingdoms and incidence of the Black Death, the war resumed in 1355 after an eight-year break. Despite John's efforts to offer peace by offering continental French land, Edward III knew that peace was impossible to keep. In September, 1355, Edward, The Black Prince, led an English-Gascon army in a violent raid, termed a chevauchée, across southwestern France. After checking an English incursion into Normandy, John led an army of about 16,000 south, crossing the Loire in September, 1356, attempting to outflank the English soldiers at Poitiers numbering less than 7,000. The Prince's situation was poor; his forces were now trapped, outnumbered and weak from illness. John was confident of victory and, rejecting both the Prince's efforts to negotiate a solution, insisting on the Prince's surrender as a hostage, and advice from one captain to surround and starve the Prince, the King ordered a direct attack. In an era in which chivalry placed high importance on winning renown through personal feats of arms, or 'prowess', and in which victory was a sign of God's favour, the prospect of a decisive battle must have been politically appealing to the troubled King.\nThe Battle of Poitiers was a disaster for the French as a result of superior defensive position and strategy allowing the use of English longbows effectively. As at the Battle of Agincourt sixty years later, many French forces did not fully participate. Prominently, Dauphin Charles and his younger brother Louis left the battle early, possibly as a result of an order from John. At least their departure meant that they avoided capture by the English; King John was less fortunate. John had taken precautions against his own capture; he was guarded in the battle by the ninety members of the Order of the Star, and had nineteen knights from his personal guard dressed identically to confuse the enemy. Surrounded and with most of the Order dead, the King fought on with considerable personal valour until Denis de Morbecque, a French exile who fought for England, approached him.\n\"Sire,\" Morbecque is said to have announced, \"I am a knight of Artois.  Yield yourself to me and I will lead you to the Prince of Wales.\"\nKing John is said to have surrendered by handing him his glove. That night King John dined in the red silk tent of his enemy, where the Black Prince attended to him personally.  He was then taken to Bordeaux, and ultimately from there to England, where he was at first held in the Savoy Palace, then at a variety of locations, including Windsor, Hertford, Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire, Berkhamsted Castle in Hertfordshire and briefly at King John's Lodge in East Sussex. Eventually, John was taken to the Tower of London.  As a prisoner of the English for several years, John was granted royal privileges, permitting him to travel about and to enjoy a regal lifestyle. His account books during his captivity show that he was purchasing horses, pets, and clothes while maintaining an astrologer and a court band. Philip, John's fourth son, had also been captured at Poitiers and followed him into captivity.\n\n\nRansom\n\nNow in English captivity, King John began the challenging task of negotiating a peace treaty, which would likely require the payment of a large ransom and territorial concessions. Meanwhile, in Paris, the Dauphin, Prince Charles, was facing his own difficulties in his new position as regent. Charles had returned to Paris with his honour intact, but popular feelings over a second French military disaster were running high. Charles summoned the Estates General in October to seek money for the defense of the country. But many of those assembled, furious at what they saw as poor and secretive management under King John, formed an opposition group body led by Etienne Marcel, the Provost of Merchants. Marcel demanded widespread political concessions. Charles refused the demands, dismissed the Estates-General, and left Paris.\n\nPolitical strife ensued. In an attempt to raise money, Charles tried to devalue the currency; Marcel ordered strikes, and the Dauphin was forced to cancel his plans and recall the Estates in February 1357.  The Third Estate (the commoners), with support from many nobles, presented the Dauphin with a Grand Ordinance, a list of 61 articles that would have severely restricted royal powers. Under pressure from the mob, Charles eventually signed the ordinance as Regent. But when news of the document reached King John, still at this point imprisoned in Bordeaux, he immediately repudiated the ordinance. During the summer, Charles began to enlist support from the provinces against Marcel and the Parisian mob, and successfully re-entering Paris. The final act of violence was the murder by the mob of key royal officials. Charles again fled the capital, but the attack broke the temporary alliance between the Parisian commons and the nobility. By August 1358, Marcel was dead and Charles was, once more, able to return to Paris.\nAt the influence of the Pope, a truce was called in March 1357 and negotiations were opened for King John's release. Once in London, King John signed the Treaty of London (1358), which set his ransom at 4 million écus. After the French could not raise the first installment of ransom, this treaty was replaced with the Treaty of London (1359), which additionally ceded most of western France to England. The Estates General rejected this second treaty, and King Edward reinvaded France later that year, landing in Calais in October 1359. Edward reached Reims in December and Paris in March, but his advances were unsuccessful in drawing out the French army to a decisive battle. King Edward reduced his terms to a third of western France (mostly in Aquitaine and Gascony), and a ransom of 3 million crowns, which was agreed to in the Treaty of Brétigny (1360).\n\n\nJohn's return\n\nThe Treaty of Brétigny, signed on 25 May 1360, offered the release of John in exchange for eighty-three hostages, along with other payments. After four years in captivity, King John was released after the signing of the treaty. John's son, Prince Louis, who had avoided capture at Poitiers, was among the persons who were to be given as hostages. In October 1360, Louis sailed to England from Calais. The full ransom was to be paid within six months, but France was economically weakened and incapable of paying the ransom on schedule. After several years in captivity, Louis tried to privately negotiate with Edward III of England for his freedom. When this failed, Louis decided to escape; he arrived back in France in July 1363.\nKing John had returned to a difficult situation in 1360. France was still divided, had lost considerable territories, and was heavily indebted to England. The Dauphin's infant daughters, Joan and Bonne, died within two weeks of each other. Charles himself had been severely ill, with his hair and nails falling out; based upon the symptoms, some suggest that he had arsenic poisoning. Most of his inner circle had died at the Battle of Poitiers.\nThe royal administration continued to perform poorly. When John was informed that Louis had escaped, he voluntarily returned to captivity in England. John's council tried to dissuade him from doing so, but he persisted, citing \"good faith and honor.\"  He sailed to England that winter, where he was met by Sir Alan Buxhull, Sir Richard Pembridge and Lord Burghersh at Dover, to be conducted to Eltham and the Savoy Palace and was warmly welcomed in London in January 1364. However, John became ill and died in April 1364. His body was returned to France, where he was interred in the royal chambers at Saint Denis Basilica.\nIt is not certain why John returned to captivity, even though chivalry was perhaps at its height at that time. Acts of mercy and clemency were looked upon positively in medieval times, but behaviour that violated the chivalric code was usually forgotten if it was clearly in the interests of the state. Escaping from captivity was unchivalrous, and carried consequences, but was still common nonetheless. John's critics alleged that he returned to London for \"causa joci\" (reasons of pleasure), citing his unmartial lifestyle. Historians have speculated that John simply could not face the difficulties of ruling France. John may have seen his failures and Charles' misfortunes as a sign from God, and consequently sought religious redemption. John may also have hoped to negotiate with Edward III directly.\nOver time, the ransom of King John had a considerable impact. The money paid to England contributed to the royal treasury until the reign of King Henry V. Although the short reign of King Charles V was successful, the political unrest that ensued after the capture of King John fed into the instability of King Charles VI's reign, weakening France throughout much of the Hundred Years War.\n\n\nReferences",

In that case her family intervened before the scam was completed, but it inspired Margolin to write the screenplay.\n\n\nPlot\n93-year-old Thelma Post lives alone in Los Angeles. Her loving grandson, Daniel \"Danny\" Markowitz, often visits and looks after her needs despite not taking responsibility for his own life. Although Thelma is close with Danny, she finds his constant assistance patronizing.\nA phone scammer posing as Danny calls Thelma, claiming he has been arrested. Thelma sends $10,000 to a local address as instructed. After a panic involving her daughter Gail and son-in-law Alan, Thelma finds out Danny is safe and she was scammed. Unable to get help from the police and unwilling to let the scammer get away with her money, Thelma evades her family and sets out to the address to retrieve it.\nThelma attempts to contact old friends for a favor but discovers most of them have died or moved away. She reluctantly enlists the help of Ben, a friend and widower living in assisted living, whom she had been ignoring since her husband's death. They ride Ben's expensive 2-person scooter to the home of Mona, their elderly acquaintance. Thelma steals Mona's gun while Ben distracts her. Meanwhile, Danny, Gail, and Alan realize Thelma is missing and search for her to no avail. During an argument with his parents, Danny vents about his recent breakup with his girlfriend and his lack of skills aside from looking after Thelma, fearing he will go nowhere.\nThelma and Ben get lost in a shady neighborhood, near the scammer's address. Ben insists on turning back, but Thelma refuses. They argue, and Ben chastises Thelma for her avoidance of him and her unwillingness to allow people to help her, which reminds him of how his impaired hearing prevented him from registering his late wife's fall years earlier until it was too late. Thelma admits she didn't need him, just his scooter. Ben’s scooter is then destroyed by a reckless driver, prompting him to abandon Thelma. Thelma continues alone on foot, eventually suffering a fall. She realizes she can not get up on her own and gives up hope until Ben returns to assist her and the two reconcile.\nThelma and Ben reach the address, where a young man collects Thelma's money from a PO box. They follow him to a rundown antique store. Ben listens through their connected phones while Thelma sneaks in and discovers the owner, Harvey, and his grandson Michael running a scam operation in the backroom. Thelma demands her money back, but they refuse, and Harvey grabs her arm. Harvey, who relies on an oxygen regulator and his grandson, laments that his store is failing and has resorted to scamming people to stay financially stable. Thelma pretends not to know who they are and apologizes for being a nuisance. Once seated, she pulls Mona's gun on Harvey. Michael tries to escape but is knocked out by Ben outside. Thelma uses Harvey’s computer while Ben holds Harvey at gunpoint, but struggles with the banking system. She calls Danny for help, and he guides her through transferring the money while driving to pick them up. Michael re-enters the store, but Thelma tells him that Harvey talks down about him, leading Michael to abandon his grandfather. Thelma leaves Harvey $500 of the $10,000 transfer and scolds him for tricking people and not appreciating his grandson, then shoots his computer so that Harvey cannot continue his scamming operation. Thelma and Ben exit the store triumphantly before Danny picks them up.\nThelma is reunited with her family, and they watch Ben perform in a play at the nursing home. She has a newfound respect for Ben, and they plan to get together shortly. While visiting her husband's gravesite with Danny, Thelma assures her grandson that he will be fine when she is eventually gone. As Danny drives Thelma home, they talk in the car about how incredible the trees are still alive, no matter how gnarled their roots look. A mid-credits scene shows writer/director Josh Margolin having an identical conversation with his grandmother.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nRelease\nThelma premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2024. It was released theatrically in the United States by Magnolia Pictures on June 21, 2024. It was released in the United Kingdom on July 19, 2024, by Universal Pictures.\nThis is Roundtree's final feature film, released after he died in 2023.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nBox office\nThelma grossed $9 million in the United States and Canada, and $4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $13 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Thelma was released alongside The Bikeriders and The Exorcism.

He earned a degree in political science and economics at the Corvinus University of Budapest in 2009. Currently, he attends Doctoral School of Demography and Sociology, University of Pécs.\n\n\nPolitical career\nBana was a member of the youth organization of the far-right Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP) between 2004 and 2006. He presided the organization from 2005 until his quit from the party in the autumn of 2006. He joined Jobbik in early 2007 and participated in the establishment of its local branch in Vas County. He was elected president of the Vas County branch of Jobbik in 2008. He was a domestic assistant of MEP Zoltán Balczó from 2009 to 2010. He was re-elected in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. He was elected one of the vice-presidents of the party in May 2018. He held the position until January 2020. He was elected president of the Vas County branch again in February 2020.\nBana ran as candidate for MP for Körmend (Vas County 5th constituency) in the 2010 parliamentary election. Ha came to the second place (15.6 percent) after Fidesz candidate and winner Zsolt V. Németh. Nevertheless, Bana was elected MP via the national list of the Jobbik. As he was one of the youngest MPs for years, he acted as a senior recorder during the inaugural plenary sessions either in 2010, 2014 and 2018. Bana was again the candidate of his party in Körmend (Vas County 3rd constituency) in the 2014 parliamentary election, but Zsolt V. Németh defended his mandate and Bana came to the second place with 22.02 percent. Bana obtained a mandate from the national list of the Jobbik.

He said, \"he wanted the party to operate as a center-right, civic and European force, instead nihilism, populism and internal showdown came under the leadership of Péter Jakab and Márton Gyöngyösi, which is completely unacceptable\". Bana retained his parliamentary seat, sitting as an independent MP, until the end of the parliamentary term in 2022. He founded the civil organization Association for Vas County in June 2020. He participated in the 2021 opposition primary as a candidate of the Everybody's Hungary Movement (MMM) in Körmend constituency.

In case of victory, Bana decided to will join the caucus of the LMP – Hungary's Green Party. In the 2022 parliamentary election, Bana was defeated by Fidesz candidate Zsolt V. Németh, and because he was not on national list of opposition alliance this time, he left parliament after 12 years.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Felician (Hungarian: Felicián; died after 1139) was a Hungarian prelate in the first half of the 12th century, who served as Archbishop of Esztergom from around 1125 until his presumably death in 1139 or later.\n\n\nCareer\nThere is no information about his origin and family relationships. Some historians argue that Felician perhaps served as either Bishop of Transylvania (e.g. János Viczián) or Eger (e.g. Gyula Pauler) before his election as Archbishop of Esztergom. He was already active clergyman during the reign of Coloman, King of Hungary. His name appears in the two donation charters of the Zobor Abbey in 1111 and 1113, where he was styled as provost of Fehérvár. Felician was first mentioned as Archbishop of Esztergom by a royal document of grant to a certain Füle (or Fila). Majority of the historians, including Attila Zsoldos and Margit Beke argue Stephen II issued the charter around 1125–28, while Imre Szentpétery dated the narration to the years between 1127 and 1131. Librarian László Fejérpataky marked the year 1131 as the date of the document's issuance.\nFelician presided over the coronation of Béla II in Székesfehérvár on 28 April 1131. After Hungarian troops plundered and looted the estates of the Archbishopric of Salzburg in the summer of 1131, Felician mediated between Béla II and Archbishop Conrad to facilitate the conclusion of peace, which was made in Esztergom and it was followed by a long period of stability in the border region. In 1134, he judged over a conflict in a case of the Dubrava forest. His verdict also contains the summarized history of the Diocese of Zagreb, which is the first ever mention of the bishopric, founded by Saint Ladislaus I in the early 1090s. After Split accepted Béla II's suzerainty, Felician consecrated its bishop Gaudius in 1136, which act was objected by Pope Innocent II, as he claimed of papal suzerainty over the territory of Dalmatia. Felician was present at an assembly of the prelates and barons in 1137 in Esztergom, when the child prince Ladislaus was proclaimed Duke of Bosnia by his father Béla. In the same year Felician dedicated the rebuilt Mount of Saint Martin monastery at Pannonhalma (The first buildings of the community had burned down). After the reburial of Béla's father Duke Álmos, Felician listed the complete property of the Dömös Chapter in 1138. Béla and Felician welcomed the missionaries of Otto of Bamberg on 20 April 1139. Felician last appears in contemporary sources on 27 July 1139.\nHis name is recorded by a 15th-century annotation in a 13th-century famous manuscript Psalterium Davidicum cum calendario, part of the collection of the Batthyaneum Library in Alba Iulia.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources",

    "text": "This is a list of the tallest buildings in Sweden. The history of skyscrapers in Sweden began with the completion of Kungstornen on Kungsgatan in Stockholm. The twin towers are each 60 m (197 ft) high and were completed in 1924 and 1925 respectively. In 1927 Thor Thörnblad proposed an American inspired skyscraper on Blasieholmen in Stockholm, the proposal was 40 floors and 150 metres high. This would have made it the tallest skyscraper in Europe by a large margin at the time. In the Post-World War II era construction of several high-rise buildings began, such as Wenner-Gren Center, Skatteskrapan, Hötorgsskraporna, Folksamhuset, and Kronprinsen. In the early part for the 21st century a new wave of high-rise buildings has reached Sweden. Karlatornet in Gothenburg stands as the tallest building in Sweden and Scandinavia.\nMany Swedish skyscraper projects have been cancelled after protests, or because the plans were proved economically unsustainable. A 200 m (656 ft) high skyscraper, called Tell Us Tower, was planned for construction in 2010 at Telefonplan in Stockholm's southern suburbs, but the plans were cancelled in 2007. There were plans to construct a 325 m (1,066 ft) high skyscraper, Scandinavian Tower, in Malmö, but they were canceled in 2004. If built, the Scandinavian Tower would have been the tallest skyscraper in Europe.\n\n\nList\nDefinition \n\nHeight to architectural top: This is the main criterion under which the CTBUH ranks the height of buildings. Heights are measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the top of the building, inclusive of spires but excluding items such as flagpoles and antennae.\nHighest occupied floor: Height to the floor level of the highest floor that is occupied by residents, workers or other building users on a consistent basis.\nHeight to tip: Height to the highest point of the building, including antennae, flagpoles, and technical equipment.\nBuilding heights are measured in \"plushöjd\" with the RH2000 vertical reference system in Sweden, which shares its zero point with the NAP. The zero point is approximately at sea level. A common mistake is therefore to cite the \"plushöjd\" as the building's height, which in fact is the height above sea level.\nIf a source states no specific type of height it is displayed in the \"Height to architectural top\" category, which is also the official height.

(1910–1990) was widely recognized by the engineering community and known for his innovative structural engineering solutions, as a senior assistant engineer and lieutenant with the Department of National Defense, a professor at the University of Toronto, as co-founder of the North American firm Morrison Hershfield, and as a prolific author. He was a lifelong advocate of education and the engineering profession.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHershfield' parents Aaron and Molly Hershfield left Teofipol, Ukraine in the mid-1890s for Manitoba, Canada in search of greater opportunities and in the hopes of starting a family. On December 24, 1910 their son Charles Hershfield was born. As a child and later in his teens, Hershfield's interests resided in music, baseball, carpentry, and mechanical engineering. He attended St. John's High School in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and even from a young age, highly valued his education.\nHershfield later studied engineering at the University of Manitoba. Working with two of his classmates, H.F. Peters and W. Gruber, Hershfield submitted the thesis \"Some Tests of Welded Joints\". Hershfield graduated in 1930 with the degree of Bachelor of Science in civil engineering.\nDuring the summer periods as an undergraduate Hershfield worked for the Dominion Bridge Company in Winnipeg. Upon graduation and until 1932, in conjunction with the Winnipeg City Engineer, he was involved with structural design of bridges, viaducts and subways.\nSeveral years later Hershfield continued his education and received the degree of Master of Applied Science from the University of Toronto in 1950. His master's thesis was titled \"Series Expansion of Joint Rotations for the Analysis of Rigidly Framed Structures \".\n\n\nWorking life\nIn 1935 Hershfield moved to Toronto, Ontario and until 1941 was employed with Standard Iron and Steel Works where his skills and services were focused in structural design, estimating, contracting, detailing and supervision of the fabrication and erection of steel structures.\nFrom 1941 to 1943 he was a staff member of the Canadian Department of National Defense, Naval Service, Works and Building Branch as Senior Assistant Engineer, with the rank of Lieutenant. His work during this time included structural design on naval shore establishments including shops, storage facilities, training buildings, and drill halls, of wide variety as to size and materials of construction.\nAfter leaving the naval service in 1943, Hershfield joined the staff of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. Hershfield taught a variety of courses related to structural engineering and supervised many graduate students. He was also principal instructor in structural engineering in the School of Architecture at University of Toronto.\nIn 1946 Hershfield, along with Carson Morrison, Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins, responded to the post-war building boom by founding the engineering consulting firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins. The firm today exists under the name Morrison Hershfield, with offices across North America specializing in multidisciplinary engineering and related expertise.\nHershfield retired from teaching at the University of Toronto in 1976 after 31 years of service but continued to work closely with Morrison Hershfield almost up to the time of his death.\n\n\nNotable projects\nAssisted with complex structural design of the roof for the Stratford Shakespeare Festival Theatre, Stratford, Ontario (1957)\nDesigned the complex structural roofing system for the Ontario Pavilion Building at Expo 67, Montreal, Quebec (1967)\nAssisted with the expansion of the Toronto Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario\nUniversity of Toronto Medical Science Building, Toronto, Ontario\n\n\nAwards and achievements\nElected to the grade of Partner with the Engineering Institute of Canada, 1955.\nMember of the Publications Committee, for the Engineering Journal, 1970–74.\nElected to Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada, 1974.\nConsulting Engineer Designation, Association of Professional Engineers, 1974.\nMember of the Committee of Examiners, Ontario Association of Architects, 1974–82\nMember of the Canadian Standards Association Standards Policy Board, 1977–78.\nRequalifed as a Designated Consulting Engineer, Association of Professional Engineers, 1979.\nAwarded the Engineering Medal by the Association of Professional Engineers Ontario, 1982.\nServed as a Structural Engineer on the OAA Committee of Examiners, 1982.\nUpon his death, the University of Toronto set up the Charles Hershfield Memorial Scholarship fund to acknowledge Hershfield's significant accomplishments as a structural engineer and professor.

    "text": "Deborah Willis (born February 5, 1948) is a contemporary African-American artist, photographer, curator of photography, photographic historian, author, and educator. Among her awards and honors, she is a 2000 MacArthur Fellow. She is currently Professor and Chair of the Department of Photography and Imaging at Tisch School of the Arts of New York University. In 2024, she was elected to the American Philosophical Society.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nDeborah Willis was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Ruth and Thomas Willis on February 5, 1948. Willis is the mother of conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas. Her father was a photographer as well, and her close familial ties are apparent in works such as Daddy's Ties: The Tie Quilt II (1992), and Progeny: Deborah Willis and Hank Willis Thomas (2009).\nWillis's degrees include a B.F.A. in photography from Philadelphia College of Art in 1975; an M.F.A. in photography from Pratt Institute in 1979; an M.A. in art history from City College of New York in 1986; and a Ph.D. from the Cultural Studies Program of George Mason University in 2001.\n\n\nCareer\nDuring her early career, Deborah Willis sought to find and recognize photography created by African Americans. She also aims to document and portray the beauty of the female body through her works. With the help of Richard Newman from Garland Publishing, she was able to create her first book Black Photographers, 1840-1940: an Illustrated Bio-bibliography (1985), which included more than three hundred photographers in the book. As she described in an interview, many of the photographers were ready to throw out their work due to lack of recognition before the book. Continuing with her goal of recognizing black photographers, Deborah Willis came out with a second installment called “An Illustrated Bio-Bibliography of Black Photographers, 1940-1988” (1989) which also included contemporary photographers, as she previously intended to in the first installment.\nWillis was the curator of photographs and the prints/exhibition coordinator at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library between 1980 and 1992, after which she became exhibitions curator at the Center for African American History and Culture of the Smithsonian Institution for eight years. Between 2000 and 2001,she was Lehman Brady Visiting Joint Chair Professor in Documentary Studies and American Studies at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She then joined the faculty of New York University as a professor of photography and imaging in the Tisch School of Arts, eventually become the chair of that department. Interested in \"historic and cultural documentation and preservation\", she has published \"some twenty books on African-American photographers and on the representation of blacks in photographic imagery.\" Among them are Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers 1840 to the Present (2002), Posing Beauty: African American Images from the 1890s to the Present (2009), and Black: A Celebration of a Culture (2014). Also known as \"Deb Willis,\" she survived a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2001. She was the curator of photographs and the prints/exhibition coordinator at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library between 1980 and 1992.\nWillis co-produced the 2014 documentary film Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People, which is based on her book Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers 1840 to the Present. In 2008, she organized the exhibition Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits for the National Museum of African American History and Culture of the Smithsonian Institution.\nWillis's work was included in the 2015 exhibition We Speak: Black Artists in Philadelphia, 1920s-1970s at the Woodmere Art Museum.\n\n\nOther activities\nWillis served on the jury that chose the winners of the Rome Prize for the 2023–24 cycle, co-chaired by Naomi Beckwith and Fred Wilson.\n\n\nRecognition\nWillis has received numerous awards and honors, including:\n\n1995: Infinity Award for Writing, International Center of Photography.\n2000: MacArthur Fellow\n2003: Honorary doctorate, Maryland Institute College of Art\n2005: Fletcher Fellow, Fletcher Foundation\n2005: Guggenheim Fellow, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation\n2013–2014: Richard D. Cohen Fellow in African and African American Art, Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, Harvard University\n2020: Award for Outstanding Service to Photography and Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society.\n2023: Don Tyson Prize for the Advancement of American Art \n2023: Honorary Doctor of Humanities from Yale University\n\n\nArtistic and photographic works\nAs an artist and photographer, Willis was represented by Bernice Steinbaum Gallery in Miami and Charles Guice Contemporary in Berkeley, California. Her exhibitions have included:\n\nProgeny, Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, Miami, 2008.  The exhibition traveled as \"Progeny: Deborah Willis and Hank Willis Thomas\" in 2009 to New York and to Sacramento, California.\nRegarding Beauty, University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2003, containing \"photographs and autobiographical quilts\".\nDeborah Willis: Tied to Memory, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, 2000.\nDeborah Willis, Hughley Gallery & Objects, Atlanta, 1992, involving \"small narrative quilts built around historical photographs, documents and family snapshots\".\nWillis is also a quilter, also incorporating photographic images into her pieces. Daddy's Ties: The Tie Quilt II from 1992 (27 x 34\"), for example, is a fabric collage with added button, tie clips, and pins forming \"a supple, irregularly shaped memorial.\" The work references multiple generations and genders, as it elicits memories of fathers teaching their sons, boys maturing into adult clothes and rituals, and women adjusting their husbands' knots. At the same time, however, the artist's cutting and reconfiguration of the ties raises the possibility that such nostalgic references might be outmoded or rejected. This multivalent collage \"also memorializes black soldiers who fought in World War II\", since Willis includes photos of soldiers on linen fabric collaged onto the tie fabric. Willis's focus on the African-American experience is evident in Tribute to the Hottentot Venus: Bustle (1995), a fabric and photo linen collage (23 x 28\") in a triptych format. Small images of Saartjie Baartman, the so-called \"Hottentot Venus\", appear in the left and right sections together with pieced fabric silhouettes of her body. The central image in the triptych is of a late 19th-century dress with prominent bustle, its shape emphasizing the buttocks. Willis explains that her use of quilting as a technique \"reminds us who we are and who and what our ancestors have been to us in the larger society\".\nHer quilts have been included in the following exhibits and catalogs:\n\nStory Quilts: Photography and Beyond, Black Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, 1999, Curated by photographer and installation artist Pat Ward Williams, the exhibition showcased the works of three African-American artists—Willis, Kyra E. Hicks and Dorothy Taylor.\nTribute to the Hottentot Venus quilt, 1992.\n\n\nCurated exhibitions\nExhibitions that Willis has curated include:\n\nPosing Beauty in African American Culture, which opened Fall 2009 at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, and went on to tour worldwide.\nReflections in Black, Arts and Industries Building, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, 2000, on African-American photography. The exhibition in whole or in part traveled widely in the U.S. between 2000 and 2003.\nReflections in Black: A Reframing, on display September–October 2025 at New York University's Cooper Square Gallery, ahead of a new edition of Reflections in Black being released in November.\nConstructed Images: New Photography, which traveled between 1989 and 1992.\n\n\nPublications\nWillis, Deborah, Leigh Raiford, and Sarah Lewis, editors (2025).

The established spellings of a few names which were already common before this time sometimes deviates from these rules; for example, the Ludwig is traditionally Людвиг (including in placenames), with ю instead of у. It was also historically common to render personal names into their Russian forms or cognates, rather than strictly transliterating them, as with Peter being rendered as Пётр. German phonemes which do not exist in Russian are rendered by their closest approximations: the umlauts ö and ü are rendered as ё (yo) and ю (yu), and ä and e are mostly rendered as е (not э). H (when not part of a cluster) is now rendered with х or omitted (when silent); it was historically often rendered with г (g), as in the name of Heinrich Heine (Russian: Генрих Гейне).

    "text": "The 2017 Kuomintang chairmanship election (Chinese: 2017年中國國民黨主席選舉) was held on 20 May 2017. This was the eighth direct election of the party leader in Kuomintang history. All registered, due-paying KMT party members were eligible to vote.\n\n\nHistory\nThe 2017 Kuomintang chairmanship election was originally scheduled for 20 July. Alex Tsai cited the KMT party charter while announcing the party's decision to move the election date to 20 May. According to Tsai, the charter states that new party leaders should be elected three months before the last national party congress convened by the incumbent leader. In 2005, Lien Chan left office on 19 August, and, said Tsai, a full-term inauguration should therefore occur on 20 August. For that to happen in accordance with Article 17 of the charter, the 2017 election date was rescheduled to 20 May. The proposal was voted on in a Central Standing Committee meeting held 21 December 2016. Though early reports claimed a lower attendance, fourteen committee members attended the meeting, and 26 people boycotted the vote. Party headquarters stated that the election date change vote was held with a quorum as defined by central governmental standards, and passed; party regulations define a quorum as half the eligible participants, and in the case of the forty-member Central Standing Committee, twenty people must have voted. Liao Kuo-tung took a strong position against the change in election date, calling for Hung Hsiu-chu's resignation as party leader. Central Standing Committee member Yao Chiang-lin filed a civil lawsuit against Hung. In the next Central Standing Committee meeting, the original attempt to reschedule the chairmanship election was placed under reconsideration, and passed, confirming the election date as 20 May 2017. After the meeting, Liao continued claiming that disagreement over the election date was only \"partially resolved\". He also stated that \"only five committee members attended the meeting\" called to deliberate the first date change.\n\n\nCandidates\nIncumbent chairperson Hung Hsiu-chu was the first to declare her candidacy for the position. On 7 January 2017, Hau Lung-pin entered the race. Two days later, Wu Den-yih announced his bid for the chairmanship. On 12 January, Han Kuo-yu resigned his executive positions at Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corporation and entered the leadership election. Steve Chan launched his chairmanship campaign on 23 January. Tina Pan became the sixth candidate to enter the election on 23 February.\nFigures released by the Kuomintang in January showed that, for the election, the eligible electorate included 226,783 party members, while total party membership numbered 887,861 people. By April, the electorate had risen to 451,510 people. Candidates must have collected the signatures of three percent of the Kuomintang membership by 15 April, an approximate minimum of 13,000 in 2017, to qualify for the election. On 21 April, all candidates were officially confirmed.\n\n\nResults\nShortly after polls closed on 20 May, Wu Den-yih was declared the winner of the election, having won approximately 52 percent of the vote. Wu earned 144,408 votes. Incumbent Hung Hsiu-chu received 53,063 votes, while Hau Lung-pin finished third with 44,301 votes. Han Kuo-yu and Steve Chan finished with the closest margin between candidates at 16,141 and 12,332 votes respectively. Tina Pan placed sixth with 2,437 votes. Turnout was 58.05 percent of 476,147 eligible voters.\n\nHung Hsiu-chu announced on 14 June that she planned to resign her position by 30 June, and had named Lin Junq-tzer acting chairman of the Kuomintang.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Technical foul",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=850095",
    "text": "In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a \"T\" or a \"tech\") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA).\nTechnical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States.  First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running or when the ball is dead. Second, in FIBA play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.\nIn most American competitions, ejection of the offender, that of the player, coach, or otherwise, is the penalty for being assessed two technical fouls in a game, if charged directly to him/her (some technicals committed by a player are charged to the team only).  In addition, any single flagrant technical foul, or a disqualifying foul in FIBA and NCAA women's play, incurs ejection. FIBA rules call for ejection for two non-flagrant technicals (known as unsportsmanlike fouls under that body's rules; the term is also used in NCAA women's rules) against a player. FIBA rules call for ejection when a coach draws two technicals, or a third is called on the bench.  In the NBA, there are certain technical fouls that cannot involve an ejection.\n\n\nInfractions\n\nMany infractions can result in the calling of a technical foul.  One of the most common is the use of profane language toward an official or another player.  This can be called on either players who are currently active in the play of the game, or seated on a team's bench.  It can also be assessed to a coach or another person associated with the team in an official capacity such as a trainer or an equipment manager.  Additionally, coaches or players can be assessed a technical foul for disputing an official's call too vehemently, with or without the use of profanity. This verbal unsporting technical foul may be assessed regardless of whether the ball is dead or alive.\nOther offenses can result in technical fouls, such as:\n\nAllowing players to lock arms in order to restrict the movement of an opponent (usually a team technical)\nBaiting or taunting an opponent\nDisrespectfully addressing or contacting an official or gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment\nFaking being fouled (flopping). In NCAA women's basketball, effective in 2023–24, the first offense is a warning, with subsequent offenses being technical fouls assessed as team personal fouls, but not as individual personal fouls.\nFighting or threatening to fight\nGoaltending a free throw\nGrasping either basket during pre-game or halftime warm-ups during the time of the officials' jurisdiction, including attempting to dunk or stuff a dead ball (whether successful or not) prior to or during the game or during any intermission of the game. Beginning in 2015–16, dunking is permitted during warmup periods in NCAA play, although hanging on the rim remains illegal.\nIllegal substitution or entering the game at an impermissible time\nIntentionally hanging on the basket at any time (except to prevent an injury)\nKicking or striking the basketball at any time using the foot in an unsportsmanlike manner (unintentional kicking is a violation only)\nKnowingly attempting a free throw or accepting a foul to which the player was not entitled\nLifting or jumping onto a teammate to gain a height advantage\nRemaining out of bounds to gain an advantage\nRemoving the jersey or pants within the visual confines of the playing area\nShattering the backboard or rim of a goal.\nUse of television monitoring or replay equipment, computers, or electronics such as megaphones for coaching purposes during the game\nUsing tobacco or smokeless tobacco\nViolations of the rules for delaying the game (in the NBA, NCAA, and NFHS) usually incur a team warning for a first offense, followed by a team technical, or sometimes a player technical, if the same team delays a second time. From 2023–24, NCAA women's rules explicitly call for delay of game to be a team warning on the first offense and a team technical thereafter. This includes:\n\nGoing out of bounds during an opponent's throw-in without contact (warning, then a technical foul), or touching an opposing thrower-in (intentional foul on the violator in NFHS, and is the warning for being out-of-bounds) or the ball (a technical on the offender in NFHS, and is the warning for being out-of-bounds) as it is held entirely in out-of-bounds\nIn the (W)NBA, or since 2022, FIBA, during the last two minutes of any playing period (quarter or overtime), contact by a defensive player against a player throwing the basketball in before the ball is released is not considered delay of game. It is instead a special class of personal foul known as a \"throw-in foul\" (FIBA) or \"away from the play foul\" (W(NBA)), and is penalized by one free throw and possession.\nHuddling at the foul line for an excessive time (warning, then a technical in NFHS)\nNot being ready to start play after a time-out, or to begin a quarter or half, or to shoot a free throw(s) at such times (a special protocol, known as the \"resumption-of-play procedure\", is used in NFHS, where violations instead of technicals are initially called in some such situations)\nRefusing to immediately pass the ball to the nearest official when a whistle blows\nFailing as the free thrower to be in the free-throw semicircle when the official is ready to administer the free throw (unless the resumption-of-play procedure is in effect in NFHS, supra)\nThrowing the ball into the stands or otherwise preventing a ball from being made live promptly after a made goal to allow one's team to set up on defense (if a blatantly unsportsmanlike act, a technical foul against the player; otherwise, a warning to that team and team technicals thereafter). This includes throwing the ball to an official when such act is not required—such would likely incur a warning. In addition, throwing the ball at an opponent's head may also be considered a technical foul.\nand more technical issues, such as:\n\nBeginning the game with a starting player not so designated\nFailure to supply the scorer with names and numbers of team players prior to the start of the scheduled contest, or at least 10 minutes prior to the contest in some jurisdictions\nHaving too many players on the court, or too few (NBA; NCAA and NFHS if intentional)\nIf the coach leaves his box, especially to argue. There are times when a coach may go to the scorer's table to correct a game error.\nFailing, as the coach, to replace a disqualified player within the allotted time (charged to the coach)\n(NBA only) playing a \"scratched\" player (a rule adopted in 2005 where up to two \"scratches\" are permissible on a 14-man roster)\nRefusing to occupy the proper bench\nRemaining in or returning to the game after being disqualified\nIn the NBA, there must be five players on the court at all times.  A Player Foul Penalty situation exists if a player is assessed a sixth or subsequent personal foul and must remain in the game because there are no eligible players on the bench, or if after an injury or ejection, the last player to be disqualified for his sixth personal foul must return to the game.  The penalty is a technical foul (with one free throw) for each extra personal foul or returning to the game after disqualification.\nRequesting an excess time-out\nUniform violations, including illegal insignia or numbers; having 2 or more players with the same number; or having the wrong number for a player in the official scorebook\nThe NBA has an Illegal Defense rule.  Until 2001, it was designed to stop defenders from dropping back into a zone and thus preventing drives to the basket.  The penalty, after a warning, was a technical foul charged to the offending team and one shot for the offense, except that if the first violation occurred within 24 seconds of the end of a period, the technical was assessed without warning.\nBeginning with the 2001–02 season, the rule, now known as \"Defensive Three Seconds,\" prohibits a defender from being in the shooting lane for three seconds, unless guarding an opponent within arm's reach (or the player with the ball, regardless of distance).  The penalty is the same as it was for an illegal defense, except that no warning is issued. The WNBA implemented this rule in 2013.  Any technical fouls for Illegal Defense do not count towards ejection.\nAdditionally, home teams can be assessed technical fouls resulting from their partisans' misconduct for excessive use of artificial noise, the playing of music by their band, or for dangerous offenses such as throwing items (particularly ice or coins) onto the court.\nUsually a fight or lesser altercation between players results in a \"double technical\", in which a technical foul is issued to both players involved.  If any player leaves the team bench during a fight, he can be charged with a technical foul and ejected, as can any coach that does so without the beckoning of an official.  Rules against fighting vary from high school to college to the (W)NBA, but all levels penalize severely for such conduct, to include suspensions and (in the [W]NBA) heavy fines. NFHS and NCAA require the automatic ejection of bench personnel leaving the team area during a fight, whether or not these players actually participate in the fight.\nBeginning with the 2010–11 season, the NBA began to crack down on general complaining. Technical fouls can now be issued for the following:\n\nMaking aggressive gestures anywhere on the court\nDisagreement in which a player demonstrates how he was fouled\nRunning toward an official to complain about a call\nExcessive inquiries about a call\n\n\nPenalty\n\nIn college basketball, NFHS, and lower divisions, the penalty for technical fouls has increased over the years.  Initially, the opposing team was awarded one free throw.  This later increased to one free throw and possession of the ball.  For a while, \"bench technicals\" assessed on a non-active player, assistant coach, or anyone else on the team bench were considered more serious and resulted in the award of two shots. (Coaches have their own technical fouls, although they may be ejected and/or suspended if they have a mix of technicals totaling two or three fouls, depending on seriousness.)\nToday, high school basketball (NFHS in the United States) provides for two free throws and possession of the ball at the division line opposite the scorer's table, regardless of circumstances, for a technical foul.  International basketball provides a similar penalty. Before the 2015–16 season, college basketball awarded two shots for all technical fouls, with the ball then put in play at the point of interruption (POI), the spot and circumstances where play was stopped for the technical. Since 2015–16, the NCAA awards only one free throw for so-called \"Class B\" technicals, such as hanging on the rim or delay of game; \"Class A\" technical fouls still result in two free throws.  In the (W)NBA, the penalty remains one free throw for the opposing team, with play resuming from the point of interruption. The shot clock is reset to 14 seconds if it read less than such at the time of the foul. The team awarded the foul shots for a technical may select the player(s) to shoot them (this rule differs slightly from level to level and internationally), as opposed to personal fouls, where the player fouled, unless injured, must shoot his own foul shots.\nIn the (W)NBA, technical fouls are split into two classes, unsportsmanlike and non-unsportsmanlike. A player assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul is fined, and accumulating sixteen unsportsmanlike technical fouls during the regular season will result in a one-game suspension. For every two technical fouls received thereafter during that regular season, the player or coach's suspension increases by one game. Penalties for unsportsmanlike technical fouls are even higher for playoff games. Players and coaches will be fined for every unsportsmanlike technical foul they receive. Those who accumulate seven unsportsmanlike technical fouls will be suspended for one game. For every two unsportsmanlike technical fouls received thereafter, the player or coach's next suspension increases by one game.\nNon-unsportsmanlike conduct technical fouls are defined per NBA Rule 12, Section V, Paragraph c, and none count towards a fine, ejection or suspension.  These fouls are assessed for excessive time-outs, defensive three seconds, scratched player dressing and playing, a player foul penalty situation, shattering backboards, or delay of game.  An offensive player who intentionally hangs on the backboard, unless it is legal for safety reasons, is fined $500 but is only assessed a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul.  Technical fouls assessed for a player foul penalty situation caused by an offensive foul still result in one free throw.\nThe league can reclassify an unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul as a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul after a game following review.  For example, the NBA changed the technical foul by DeMarcus Cousins for clearing Jeremy Lamb's loose shoe off the playing court in a Golden State Warriors v. Charlotte Hornets game on February 25, 2019, from unsportsmanlike to non-unsportsmanlike, rescinding the fine and the foul count, primarily over safety issues.\n\n\nNotable instances\nOne of the most famous technical fouls ever assessed was called on Chris Webber of the University of Michigan late in the 1993 NCAA championship game. Down by two points to North Carolina with only seconds remaining, Webber called a time-out when Michigan had none left. After the referees approved his request, the resulting excessive time-out technical foul, for which North Carolina guard Donald Williams made both foul shots, ended any hopes Michigan had of claiming the championship. \nA string of famous technical fouls occurred on February 23, 1985, at a regular season game between the rival Purdue Boilermakers and Indiana Hoosiers. Just five minutes into the game, a scramble for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana. IU's legendary head coach Bob Knight was furious and insisted the call should have been a jump ball. Seconds after Purdue inbounded, another foul was called on Indiana. Knight received a technical for his irate reaction, and then famously threw a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench across the court, resulting in a second technical. As his tirade continued, he received a third technical and was ejected from the game to a standing ovation from the home crowd at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. The picture of Knight throwing the chair has since become a potent symbol of the Indiana–Purdue rivalry.\nIn what has been called the greatest game ever played, Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics, the Suns found themselves one point down with one second left in double overtime, no time-outs remaining and possession of the ball under their defensive basket after a John Havlicek bucket. Faced with the near-impossibility of sinking an 80-foot desperation shot, Suns guard Paul Westphal hit upon an unusual solution. He intentionally called a time-out the Suns did not have. While this gave the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White successfully converted to increase the lead to two, it gave the Suns possession at halfcourt, and enabled Gar Heard to sink an 18-footer as time expired to force a third overtime. NBA rules were changed the following year to prevent a repeat occurrence.\nAn instance where many technical fouls could have been called, but were not (instead, the game was abandoned, a remedy available to the officials when too many players would have or have been disqualified or ejected for the game to continue, or when a team continually commits technical fouls in order to make a travesty of proceedings), was the Pacers–Pistons brawl involving players and spectators on November 19, 2004, in an NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. Ron Artest of the Pacers and Ben Wallace of the Pistons began scuffling after Artest fouled Wallace hard. This escalated into a brawl where players from both teams became involved, and grew worse after Artest retreated to the scorer's table and was hit by a cup thrown by a spectator.  Artest and several teammates and opponents then ran into the stands and fought with fans.  Had technical fouls been formally assessed, the result would likely have been the ejection of both teams' entire squads (except for Pistons player Tayshaun Prince, who was the only player from either team to remain on the bench for the entire incident).  In the end, nine players were suspended for a total of 146 games, including Artest for the remainder of the season.\nIn a 2007 game against the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs' power forward Tim Duncan was charged a technical foul by referee Joe Crawford for laughing at him while sitting on the bench (\"gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment,\" as indicated above).  As he had already picked up a technical foul on the previous play, also while sitting on the bench, this led to his ejection.  Upon further review it was determined that this technical foul was inconsistent with the league's game management, and NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Crawford for the rest of the season. Duncan was fined $25,000 for the incident.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns set the record for most combined technical fouls in a quarter with 7 technicals in the 3rd quarter.\nRasheed Wallace holds the record for the most technical fouls received during one season in the NBA. In the 2000–01 season, he received 41 technical fouls in 80 regular season and postseason games played. Karl Malone holds the all-time mark for most technical fouls by a player in a career with 332, a record previously held by Dennis Rodman.\nThere have been a few instances in the NBA when a team's entire bench has either been injured or fouled out, and one of the five remaining eligible players fouls out, resulting in the technical foul that effectively acts as a bonus free throw situation. The Atlanta Hawks' Cliff Levingston (fouled out, but one of the five remaining players was ejected) and the Los Angeles Lakers' Robert Sacre (fouled out) have both taken advantage of the disqualified player rule. Under NBA Rule 3-I-a (player fouls out) and 3-I-b (player injured or ejected), the player was assessed with a technical foul for remaining in the game or returning to the game after fouling out.\n\n\nList of NBA career technical fouls leaders\nThe following list shows the NBA players with the most career technical fouls:\n\n\nSee also\nFlagrant foul\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a \"T\" or a \"tech\") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA).\nTechnical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States.  First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running or when the ball is dead. Second, in FIBA play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.\nIn most American competitions, ejection of the offender, that of the player, coach, or otherwise, is the penalty for being assessed two technical fouls in a game, if charged directly to him/her (some technicals committed by a player are charged to the team only).  In addition, any single flagrant technical foul, or a disqualifying foul in FIBA and NCAA women's play, incurs ejection. FIBA rules call for ejection for two non-flagrant technicals (known as unsportsmanlike fouls under that body's rules; the term is also used in NCAA women's rules) against a player. FIBA rules call for ejection when a coach draws two technicals, or a third is called on the bench.  In the NBA, there are certain technical fouls that cannot involve an ejection.",

    "text": "Zuṭṭ is an Arabicised form of Jat. Originally inhabitants of lower Indus Valley, Jats were present in Mesopotamia from the 5th century AD since the times of the Sasanian Empire, although their main migration occurred after the establishment of Umayyad Caliphate. They were one of the prominent ethnic groups in lower Iraq during the Islamic Golden Age, supplying mercenary soldiers to the Muslim states. Their mention fades from Arab chronicles after the 11th century.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nOriginal homeland\nAt the time of Umayyad conquest of Sindh in the early 8th century, Zutt (Jats) populated Makran and Turan (including Qiqan, modern Kalat) as far as the east bank of Indus river, where cities of Mansura and Multan were located. According to Ibn Khordadbeh, Jats safeguarded the entire trade route in the region which was known as bilād al-Zāt (land of the Jats). Makran had a significant number of Zutt at the time (or before) the Muslim conquest who had moved eastward into Sind as well in the following centuries. Goeje says Zutt were a people originating from Sind and claims that they were distributed throughout the Sassanid Empire. Al-Khwarizmi also elucidates their origins, attributing their roots to Sind and noting the Arabicization of their original name, Jit, to Zuṭṭ and further highlights that the Zutt were employed to protect badhraqa (roads). In Arabic literature, however, Sind referred to a larger region than the present province of Sindh and Makran, and the \"land of Sind\" designated the Indus valley or the area traversed by Indus river.\n\n\nIn early Islamic Arabia\nThe commercial activities of Zutt lead to their settlements in Arabia. They were evidently present in Arabia before the advent of Islam, mainly around the Persian Gulf and are known to have interacted with Muhammad. Muhammad reportedly compared Musa (Moses) with them in physique, and stated him to be of brown complexion, straight hair and tall stature, resembling Zutt. On another occasion, when Aisha fell ill, her nephew sent for a Zutt physician to treat her. According to al-Tabari, some Zutt participated in the Ridda Wars against Muslims.\n\n\nIn Sassanid Empire\nSassanid emperor Bahram V (431 – 38) is said to have adopted a policy of tribal resettlement in the coastal regions. Due to it, a number of Zutt migrated, often with great herds of water buffalo, to the marshland of southern Iraq where they introduced large-scale rice farming. They may have come in the search of pastures there, and their presence is indicated by a canal called Nahr al-Zuṭṭ in Iraq, as well as a district called Zutt in Khuzistan or Bahrain. They also inhabited the city of Haumat al-Zutt in Khuzistan.\nLast Sassanid emperor, Yazdegerd III, called Zutt from Sind to help in his war against Arabs. They fought as mercenary cavalry men for the Sassanian Empire, later defecting to the side of Muslims. When Muslims besieged the city of Ahwaz in Iran in 640, Zutt put up a strong resistance in the defence of the city along with Persian Aswaran. Later, as did Aswaran, who were known as Asawira during the caliphate period, they settled in Basra as allies of Banu Tamim.\n\n\nIn Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates\nZutt formed a large population of the garrison town of Basra, where they became allies of the Arab tribe of Banu Hanzala in the inter-tribal warfare. The treasury of Basra was guarded by 40 or 400 Zutt soldiers during the reign of Ali under their chief Abu Salama al-Zutti, who were, according to the version narrated by Abu Mikhnaf, killed while protecting bayt al-mal when rebels under Talha and Zubayr occupied the city. Zutt regiments had fought along with Ali at the battle of Camel in 656 under their chief, Ali bin Danūr.\nIn 670, a large number of Zutt, along with Aswaran, were moved into coastal cities of Syria, such as Antioch, Beirut and Tripoli, replacing earlier Greek population, and a quarter in Antioch came to be known after them. This was an attempt by Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I to ward off any possible naval invasion by Byzantine Empire. During this period, the role of Zutt and the associated groups was to guard the governors of different provinces, as well as to suppress revolts. They also acted as special troops to guard provincial treasuries. Zutt had been in Mesopotamia for long enough that they were considered distinct from Sindhis or Indians. In Iraq and elsewhere, they had their separate units under their own leaders, giving them a status of distinct sub-tribe in the Muslim society.\n\n\nSecond migration\nAfter the conquest of Sindh in 712, a second influx of Zutt occurred from Makran into Iraq. As a nomadic pastoral community, they did not originally profess Hinduism and instead followed their tribal religion. Zutt were barely integrated into the Hindu society of Sindh, and as they were always prone to rebellion, Brahman dynasty had imposed discriminatory measures upon them, which were maintained by Arabs, and in some cases, even intensified after a long series of rebellions. Four thousand Zutt became captive of Muslims during the early Muslim incursions into Makran, and later they participated as auxiliaries in the conquest of Sindh. The two chief tribal groupings in Sindh at the time of Arab conquest were Zutt and Meds. Unlike Jats, however, Meds were seafaring people. Some of them carried piracy in the Indian Ocean as Bawarij. The incident in which they captured two treasure ships coming from Ceylon to Basra became casus belli for the Umayyad invasion of Sindh.\nIn addition to Zutt, several other groups from Indus Valley had permanently settled into Mesopotamia, including Sāyabija and Andāghar, who were at times considered as part of Jats, and sometimes described separately. Muslim accounts describe these soldiers as originally inhabitants of Sind. An important sub-group of Zutt were Qayqāniyya, who inhabited the region of Qayqan (also known as Qiqān, modern Kalat). Many of them had been taken as captives between 659 and 664 by Abd Allah bin Sawwar al-Abdi to Iraq, who was appointed as governor of regions surrounding Sindh. He was himself killed in one of the wars against Qiqani Zutt in 667 and Qiqan was re-conquered by them. Always armed with arrows, whether cavalry or infantry, these Zutt Qayqaniyya units were master archers of the caliphate, and acted as auxiliary group for shurta. Qiqaniyya as well as Bukhariyya, an Iranian unit of soldiers, were sent to suppress revolt of Zayd ibn Ali in 740 by Umayyad Caliphate. Another group associated with Zutt was that of Qufs, or \"mountain dwellers\", who were dark-skinned soldiers from Kerman. They had been recruited by Sassanids as auxiliaries and later, actively supported Arabs against Sassanids. However, they had married among Persians and had assimilated to the Persian culture.\nJats (with their very name being synonymous with dromedary-men or cameleers) in Makran reportedly reared fine-quality camels which were in demand as far as Khurasan, and tall Qīqāni horses, which were presented to Mu'awiya I. In Basra, they manufactured a distinct variety of cloth called zuttī or zuttiyah. In the first half of 8th century, many of them were settled with herds of buffalo in the regions of Massisa and Amanus (present-day Turkey) to combat the large number of lions found there.\n\n\nIn Abbasid Caliphate\nThe position of Zutt as mercenary soldiers remained stable for some time after the Abbasid revolution and establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate. They still formed part of the armed forces of Basra during the governorship of Abbasid Sulayman bin Ali. During the Abbasid civil war (809  – 813), al-Sāri ibn al-Hakam al-Zutti gained control of the lower Egypt, including the capital city of Fustat in 813 and ruled it till his death in 820. He was a Zutt soldier of abna’ al-dawla, the elite Khurasani troops of Abbasid caliphate. His two sons, Abu Nāsr (r. 820–822) and Ubāydallah (r. 822–826) succeeded him as the emirs of Egypt. During this period, Egypt was independent from the Abbasids. Ubaydallah's reign came to an end in 826, when al-Ma'mun sought to achieve control over the country by dispatching to it the Tahirid general Abdallah ibn Tahir. Ubaydullah chose to fight against him, but his forces were defeated and he was forced into exile in Samarra, where he died in 865. According to the Arabist Thierry Bianquis, the succession of al-Sari by his sons signals the first attempt at creating an autonomous dynasty ruling Egypt, heralding the more successful Tulunids and Ikhshidids. According to Juan Signes Codoñer, Zutt may have been also involved in Thomas the Slav's revolt against the Byzantine Empire in 821–23.\n\nJats produced a number of well-known people during the Islamic Golden Age. Famous theologian, Abu Hanifa, who was the founder of Hanafi school of thought, is considered by some to be one of them. His grandfather, named Zuttā, was brought as captive by Muslim armies in the late 7th century to lower Iraq. Other Zutt scholars include Ibn Ulayya, who was from Qayqan, and al-Awza'i. As they were earliest of the people from Indus Valley to have interacted with Muslims, \"Zutt\" became a general term for the people from Sind and Multan who were living in Syria, which included scholars and governors like Ibn al-A'rabi, Ibn Shahak and Abu al-Khasib. During this period, Zutt increasingly intermingled with other non-Arab foreign people in Basra, a cosmopolitan port at the time. They, along with Sayabija and Zanj, were designated as one of the Black peoples (Arabic: as-swadan) by Arabs. Grandfather of al-Jahiz, the famous 9th century author, was reportedly a black cameleer. The term Black, however, was apparently applied to Berbers and Indians as well.\n\n\nZutt rebellion\n\nAs the central power of caliphate broke down after the mid-9th century, Zutt came to be viewed as outlaws and brigands instead of allies. Zutt, Asawira and other troops were effectively demilitarized at the start of century. Some of Zutt later turned into Banu Sasan, who were members of what C. E. Bosworth calls \"Islamic Underworld\". The Qiqaniyya, who had reputation as sea-faring people, turned to piracy along the coast of Baluchistan and Makran. The continued political suppression, as well as relative weakness of Abbasid control after the devastating civil war, encouraged the Zutt living in lower Iraq to rise in rebellion in 820 under the leadership of Muhammad ibn Uthman. Early Abbasid efforts to defeat Zutt proved unsuccessful, and they continued to levy taxes over caravans and to raid neighbouring regions of Basra. After the defeat of Ahmad bin Sa'd al-Bahili, Abbasids sent a large force of more than 10,000 under their general Ujayf ibn Anbasa in 834 to Wasit, which was a stronghold of Zutt. Abbasid forces blocked the waterways to the Iraqi marshes and thus cut down the communication lines of Zutt. The war continued for nine months, and included amphibious operations, until Zutt leaders agreed to surrender. They were ultimately deported to a village at the Byzantine frontier of Cilicia in 835. In 855, Byzantine army made an unexpected raid on the city of Anazarbus (`Ain Zarbah) and took many of them to Constantinople.\nThe Zutt rebellion lasted for 14 years before finally being put down. Al-Tabari, a 9th-century historian, quoted a long poem by a Zutt poet when they were being deported to Cilicia. in it, poet taunted people of Baghdad, where caliph was based, for their cowardice as they could not defeat Zutt and had to employ Turkic slave-soldiers against them. The poet held these Turks in military posts in low regard and instead glorified austerity of the Zutt.\n\n\nLater period\nZutt also participated in the later Zanj and Qarmatian rebellions against the caliphate, with Abu Hatim al-Zutti being one of the major Qarmatian Da'is. Becoming active in 907, Abu Hatim prohibited his followers to slaughter animals and so they came to be known as Baqliyya, or \"Green Grocers\". They were a major sub-sect of Qarmatians in lower Iraq and staged multiple uprisings against the Abbasids. A certain Abū al-Faraj Muḥammad al-Zutti was a Buyid minister in Baghdad in 990. Zutt, along with Turks and Daylamis, formed part of army of Buyid prince Abu Nasr Shah-Firuz, ruler of Fasa, when he waged war against Baha' al-Dawla for the control of province of Fars in 1000 AD. They were described as most numerous and bravest of the warriors of Fars by Abbasid vizier al-Rudhrawari. Little is known about them any further, although they seem to have gained certain degree of notoriety along with Kurdish and Bedouin tribes.\nAbbasid caliphate itself disintegrated after the anarchy at Samarra, and the regions of Makran, Sind and Multan became independent under Ma'danids, Hābbarids and Munābbihids, respectively. Owing to these developments, the movement of Jats into Iraq ceased. During the same period, Jats left Makran and moved upward to the fertile but thinly populated Punjab plains, which, since 16th century, have been dominated by them.\n\n\nDescendants\nAfterwards, Jats lost their distinct identity in the Mesopotamia that they had previously. The 19th century Dutch orientalist De Goeje attempted to link Zutt with Romani of Europe. However, there is no evidence of any direct relation between the two groups, as Romani language does not contain any significant Arabic loan words, and his thesis remains unproven. Similarly, the identification of Zutt or Jats, who were northwestern Indo-Aryans, with the present day Dom people (also called Nawar) is also spurious, as Dom are speakers of central Indo-Aryan Domari language, and migrated from central India instead. However, the term Zott has persisted in Arab countries, albeit in a pejorative way, to describe them because of their Indian origins. It is believed that the Zutt later became what are now known as Marsh Arabs of Iraq. However, genetic studies show that the Marsh Arabs harbor mtDNAs and Y chromosomes that are predominantly of Middle Eastern origin and despite the cultural influence from the Indian subcontinent, the genetic input is marginal.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nZakeri, Mohsen (1995).

Some of its former students have been among the most-influential personalities in the country, including Jacques Chirac, the former French President, and Pascal Lamy, the former president of the World Trade Organization (2005–2013). The Orthodox theologian Fr. Alexander Schmemann attended the school. Daft Punk musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met there in 1987. The poet Louis Aragon also attended Carnot.\nThe Lycée has served as a filming location for many films, and often hosts fashion shows during Paris fashion week. The heart of the building is a large hall measuring 80 by 30 meters covered with a glass roof mounted on a metal frame on a project by Gustave Eiffel. The Lycée Carnot has a middle school section and a high school section. There are also preparatory classes for grandes écoles, in economic and commercial sections as well as in sciences.",

The song was produced by Groove and Monte Booker, and serves as the lead single from Smino's third studio album, Luv 4 Rent.\n\n\nBackground\n\"90 Proof\" was originally planned to be on J. Cole's album The Fall Off, but Smino later asked for the song back. He explained, \"I thought about it and the whole time I knew it would be great for me, being on J. Cole’s album. When I was wrapping up the tracklist, though, I just felt like something was missing, and I put \"90 Proof\" right after my intro and it just sounded like they were meant for each other. So I just called Cole and asked him if I could get the song back and he let me.\"\n\n\nComposition\nThe song features a \"melodic, guitar-laced beat\", in which Smino raps in his trademark \"fast, expressive helium-cackle\". In his verse, he apologizes for his vices that get in the way of his relationships. Meanwhile, J. Cole's verse remains \"calm and grounded\" with melodies that creep into his delivery.\n\n\nMusic video\nThe song's music video premiered on November 3, 2022. It was directed by Phillip Youmans, and is described as a \"neo-soul hip-hop southern gothic thrill ride\". The video sees Smino, J. Cole, and their friends at a seemingly normal party, where shots are heard as the video takes a dark turn.\n\n\nReferences",

After leaving school, John (junior) worked with his father surveying routes for projected railway lines in England.\n\n\nTo Ireland\nHis father, John Grantham (1774-1833), was appointed as John Rennie's assistant to survey the River Shannon. He introduced steam navigation to the inland Shannon in 1827 and his steam boats plied the Shannon and the Grand Canal and were taken up by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company. He is buried in the cathedral at Killaloe where there is a commemorative wall tablet. His son assisted him in the work.\n\n\nReturn to England\n\n\nMather, Dixon and Company\nReturning to England, he joined Mather, Dixon and Company in Liverpool and later became a manager and partner in the firm.\n\n\nNaval work\nMather, Dixon and Company closed in 1843 and Grantham began a practice as a Naval Architect and Consulting Engineer. He was involved in the design of several large iron sailing and steam ships, including Sarah Sands, Pacific, Antelope and Empress Eugenie. \nHe became Engineer to the Whitehaven Steamship Company, and other companies, and was involved in the  construction of vessels for Australia and Egypt. In 1859 he left Liverpool for London, where he continued to do work for the mercantile marine.\n\n\nRailways and tramways\nIn 1860, became Engineer to the Buenos Aires Northern Railway, Argentina. In 1863, he created the first tramway in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nIn 1872 he designed a steam tramcar.  This was a four-wheel double-deck car with two vertical boilers in the centre. The boilers were of the Field type and each was 18 inches diameter and 4 ft 4 in high. The engine, placed under the floor, had two cylinders, each 4\" diameter and 10\" stroke. These drove a single pair of driving wheels, 30\" diameter. The car could be driven from either end. The car was built in 1873 by the Oldbury Carriage and Wagon Company and the steam machinery was supplied by Merryweather & Sons.\nThe car was tried out in London, at West Brompton and in Vauxhall Bridge Road, but it was not a great success. Edward Woods modified it, by fitting a single Shand Mason boiler in place of the twin Merryweather boilers, and it was then used on the Wantage Tramway from about 1876 to 1881. The car re-appeared on the Portsdown and Horndean Tramway about 1903 and was derelict when that line closed in 1934.\n\n\nInnovations\nIn 1830, Grantham won a prize from the London and North Western Railway for a design for pulling up passenger carriages from Lime Street to Edge Hill Station, Liverpool, by stationary engines.\nHe took out several patents for screw propellers and invented a system of sheathing iron-built ships with wood and copper, to prevent fouling in tropical climates.\n\n\nReferences",

He was a descendant from old New England settlers who trace their history to Ralph and Alice Farnham of England who settled in Ipswich, Massachusetts. in 1635. The first of the name to settle in Rhode Island was John Farnum, a grandson of Ralph the immigrant, who moved from Uxbridge, Massachusetts to Georgiaville, Rhode Island. in 1755. As a boy he gave evidence of the great talent that he later developed as an artist.\n\n\nEducation\n\nHe was a pupil of the Rhode Island School of Design. Farnum studied at the Academie Julian in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurens and (Benjamin) Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant where he won several awards for drawings. He also studied at Académie Colarossi in the evening, studying figure drawing under Jean-Léon Gérôme and Castaigne. He also had the advantage of criticism from Adolphe William Bouguereau. His most remarkable canvas of that period was his \"Tarantella\".\n\n\nCareer\nOn July 21, 1896, a large landscape entitled \"Piccolo Piazza, Ana Capri\" was accepted by the Royal Academy of Arts, London, a distinction accorded few American artists.\nHe returned abroad in April, 1904, when he was absent for 2 years which he spent in London, Paris and then in Madrid and Algiers and later spent considerable time in Italy, with special stay at Capri.\nHe belonged in the group of late 19th- and early 20th-century artists in Rhode Island, and for years his studio in Butler Exchange was an important art centre in the city of Providence. He painted many portraits of local politicians while occupying this studio.\nAfter pursuing his art studies in Paris he spent many years in travel and study abroad, following in the footsteps of Marcus Waterman, also a noted RI artist, in Northern Africa, winning a wide reputation for his African subjects.\nHe also painted a number of official portraits for city and state, some of which still hang in the RI state house and the city hall.

His first wife was Alice Leigh of Fall River, Massachusetts, to whom he was married in 1898 in Chelsea. To them was born one child, a daughter, Elodie, who gave great promise of becoming a violinist of distinction and was looked upon as one of the most remarkable girls in the city. Her death in 1914 was a tragedy in the artist's life. His wife, inseparable companion of his daughter, failed gradually in health after her child's death and died in December, 1920. The memory of young Elodie Farnum, as well as her portrait by the artist, survives in the library at the Rochambeau branch of the Providence public library.\nHe was a prominent figure in RI cycling history, was a veteran member of the RI wheelmen and rated high as a road and track rider. He was captain of the club for many years.\nIn his later years he maintained his studio at his home on Fruit Hill section of North  Providence.

    "text": "Admiral Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton, 2nd Baronet, KCB (11 October 1759 – 9 February 1832) was a British naval officer. He was born in Southampton, the son of Vice-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and first served aboard HMS Medway in June 1774, in the Mediterranean. His first command came in March 1779 when he was given HM Sloop Swallow as a reward for his part in an engagement with a much larger opponent. Bickerton later joined Rodney's squadron in the West Indies where he took part in the capture of Sint Eustatius in 1781. Making post captain on 8 February 1781, he took temporary command of HMS Invincible and fought in her at the Battle of Fort Royal on 29 April 1781.\nWhen Britain entered the French Revolutionary War in 1793, Bickerton joined the Channel Fleet before, in October 1794, being ordered to transport General Sir John Vaughan to the West Indies, to take command of British land forces there. After another spell in home waters, Bickerton was sent to the Mediterranean where he spent much of the war on blockade duty and, after their surrender, oversaw the evacuation of French forces from Alexandria. He remained in the Mediterranean during the short-lived peace and when hostilities renewed was second in command to Lord Nelson there.\nForced ashore by illness in 1805, Bickerton first served as a Lord of the Admiralty and First Naval Lord before finishing his naval career as Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, having attained the rank of full admiral in 1812.\n\n\nPersonal life\nRichard Bickerton was born in Southampton on 11 October 1759, the only surviving son of Vice-admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and Mary Anne Hussey.\nOn 25 September 1788, he married Anne, daughter of Dr James Athill of Antigua. Bickerton succeeded as 2nd Baronet in 1792 when his father died. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1810. On 2 January 1815, Bickerton was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath then later, in May 1823, he inherited the estate of Wood Walton and on doing so began using his mother's maiden name before his own surname.\n\n\nNaval career\nBickerton joined the Royal Navy, aged 12, on 14 December 1771, although this was in name only: He was entered in the muster of his father's ships, Marlborough and later Princess Augusta, but did not actually serve until June 1774, when he joined HMS Medway as a captain's servant. Subsequently, promoted to midshipman, he served under Captain William Affleck in the Mediterranean, returning home in 1777 on board Invincible, commanded by Hyde Parker.\n\n\nMaster and Commander\nBickerton was promoted to lieutenant on 16 December 1777 and served under Charles Middleton first on board the 90-gun HMS Prince George, then the seventy-four, Royal Oak in March 1778. In May, Bickerton joined HMS Jupiter in the Bay of Biscay, and when Charles Middleton was appointed comptroller of the navy, he recommended that Bickerton be appointed first lieutenant under the command of Francis Reynolds.\nOn 20 October Jupiter attacked the much larger French ship-of-the-line Triton, forcing her to retire; as a reward for his conduct, Bickerton, on Middleton's recommendation, was in March 1779, promoted master and given command of the sloop, HMS Swallow. Swallow spent just under two years in The Channel, cruising and undertaking escort duties. While on convoy duty during the Summer of 1779, Bickerton gave the order to disperse, having heard of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet in The Channel. His prompt action allowed the convoy to escape. After assisting in the capture of a Dutch convoy, on 2 January 1780, Bickerton and his vessel were sent to the West Indies to join Rodney's squadron and subsequently take part in the capture of Sint Eustatius in 1781.\n\n\nPost Captain\nRodney promoted Bickerton to the rank of post captain on 8 February 1781 and gave him temporary command of HMS Invincible. It was in her that Bickerton took part in the Battle of Fort Royal, an action fought on 29 April 1781, off the coast of Martinique. Bickerton acquired his own ship, HMS Russell, in May, before briefly transferring to Terrible but, finding her unfit, moved to the frigate, HMS Amazon, in July. After service in the Leeward Islands and North American waters, Bickerton returned to England in Amazon, arriving in Portsmouth in February 1782. In September, Bickerton was given the newly repaired HMS Brune; she was decommissioned in May the following year and Bickerton was without a ship until January 1787, when he commissioned HMS Sibyl and in her sailed for the Leeward Islands once more.\n\n\nFrench Revolutionary War\nWhen France declared war in 1793, Bickerton was given command of HMS Ruby and served in her in The Channel until September 1794 when he moved to HMS Ramillies and joined Lord Howe in the Bay of Biscay. In October 1794 he transported General Sir John Vaughan to the West Indies, to succeed Lieutenant-general Sir Charles Grey as the Commander-in-chief of British land forces there. Bickerton remained on this station until July 1795, when he was sent to Newfoundland. Bickerton returned home in November 1795 where he joined Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet on blockade duty in the North Sea. Bickerton served under Duncan for the whole of the following year, then in 1797, he and his ship transferred to the Channel Fleet under Admiral Alexander Hood. In 1798, Bickerton took command of the new HMS Terrible, built in 1785 to replace the old Terrible, scuttled after the Battle of Chesapeake. Later in 1798, Bickerton was given the title of Colonel of Marines, then on 14 February 1799, Bickerton attained the rank of rear-admiral and, towards the end of the year, took up the position of Assistant Port Admiral at Portsmouth.\n\n\nService in the Mediterranean\n\nBickerton hoisted his flag in Seahorse on 13 May 1800 and was ordered to transport generals Abercromby, Moore and Hutchinson to the Mediterranean; after which he spent the rest of the war under Lord Keith, on blockade duty. On 10 June, Bickerton transferred his flag to the 74-gun Swiftsure and began a five-month command of a squadron off Cádiz. During 1801, he worked on HMS Kent, maintaining a blockade on the port of Alexandria until its capitulation on 27 August. He provided support during this time for Lieutenant-General Hutchinson.\nLeft to oversee the French withdrawal, Bickerton conducted this duty with such efficiency that he earned the respect of the French general, Jacques-François Menou, who also acknowledged that, \" ...the vigilance of Sir Richard's squadron had accelerated the reduction of that place, as it cut them off from all supply\". For his part in the British victory, the grateful Turks awarded Bickerton with the Order of the Crescent on 8 October 1801. Following the Treaty of Amiens, Bickerton was left behind in command of the Mediterranean Fleet.\n\n\nNapoleonic Wars\nBy 1804, still in the Mediterranean and having transferred to Royal Sovereign, Bickerton was serving as Second-in-Command to Admiral Lord Nelson, maintaining a close blockade on the French port of Toulon and when Nelson received the thanks of the Corporation of London, he insisted that Bickerton received equal recognition. Bickerton was elevated to Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean when Nelson left to pursue the French Fleet across the Atlantic.\n\n\nLater career\nIn spring 1805, a liver complaint forced Bickerton to return to England. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 9 November 1805 and then appointed to the Board of Admiralty in April 1807. He became First Naval Lord in the second Portland ministry in May 1808. On 31 July 1810 Bickerton attained the rank of full admiral and in March 1812 he left the Admiralty Board and, one month later, was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth with Puissant as his flagship. Bickerton still held this post in 1814 when the Treaty of Paris was celebrated with a Grand Naval Review at Spithead, which was his last active service. The event took place on 24 and 25 June, before the Prince Regent and his allies. Bickerton was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 2 January 1815. On 5 January 1818 Bickerton was promoted to Lieutenant-general of the Marines, then General of the Marines in June 1830.\n\n\nPolitical career\nBickerton was elected a Conservative Member of Parliament for Poole in February 1808, but he did not run for re-election in 1812. He did not often speak in Parliamentary debates, except on naval issues.\n\n\nDeath\n\nBickerton died at his home, No. 15 The Circus, Bath, at the age of 72 on 9 February 1832. His wife outlived him, dying on 2 March 1850. As the couple had no children, the estate passed to Anne's nephew, Vice-admiral Sir Richard Hussey Moubray. The lack of male issue also meant the baronetcy became extinct with his death.\nA memorial to Bickerton, by Francis Leggatt Chantrey, was erected in Bath Abbey in 1834. Bickerton Island off the east coast of Australia's Northern Territory was named for him by the British navigator and cartographer, Matthew Flinders, who was the first to circumnavigate the continent.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nRodger, N.A.M.

Its leaves are heart-shaped to lance-shaped and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) long, narrower leaves sometimes to 6 mm (0.24 in) long. The flowers are arranged in cylindrical, many-flowered spikes on the ends of branches with small, leaf-like bracts and bracteoles less than half as long as the sepals. The sepals are less than 2 mm (0.079 in) long and the petals white and about 3 mm (0.12 in) long, forming a tube with lobes longer than the petal tube.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nLeucopogon glabellus was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen . The specific epithet (glabellus) means \"glabrous\".\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThis leucopogon grows in winter-wet places, on granite outcrops and on hills and is widespread in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\n\n\nReferences",

The website lists academic staff which Turning Point believes \"discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.\" It was launched in 2016 and had listed about 200 professors by December of that year. \nResponses to the site include the American Association of University Professors and The New York Times raising fears that it threatens academic freedoms by harassing and intimidating staff, conservative magazine National Review describing it as an \"irritable gesture\" of victimhood by conservatives, and concerns about the safety and welfare of staff following a trend of threatening behavior and communication, including rape and death threats, being sent to listed faculty.\nIn December 2016, 1,500 professors and faculty from across the globe petitioned to have their name added to the list in solidarity with academics who had been targeted and intimidated following their listing, with the message that the listed are \"the sort of company we wish to keep.\" \nTurning Point UK also maintains a similar site, Education Watch, which has been described as \"McCarthyism in the UK\", gaining support from Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The Council for the Defence of the British Universities has also called Education Watch \"populist rightwing propaganda\".\n\n\nSourcing\nConcerns have been raised about the process in which academic staff are listed. Professors have reported being listed for any discussion of race or politics, including in academic publications. Julio Cesar Pino, a professor of Latin American history, was added to the list on the basis of rumors that the FBI may have investigated him for having connections to ISIS. Lamb, a director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at Turning Point, has described the site as \"simply aggregating\" professors who have been the subject of news reports.\nCampus Reform, a part of the Leadership Institute, and Discover the Networks, a website run by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, was the source for most of the professors initially listed on the Professor Watchlist.\n\n\nConcerns\nSlate columnist Rebecca Schuman described the website as \"abjectly terrifying\" and said that she feared for the safety of the listed professors. Some have criticized the website as a threat to academic freedom; Hans-Joerg Tiede, the associate secretary for the American Association of University Professors' department of academic freedom, tenure and governance, told The New York Times: \"There is a continuing cycle of these sorts of things. They serve the same purpose: to intimidate individuals from speaking plainly in their classrooms or in their publications.\" One professor included in the site, George Yancy, wrote that it is \"essentially a new species of McCarthyism, especially in terms of its overtones of 'disloyalty' to the American republic\".\nAccording to Inside Higher Ed, some critics consider the website \"more annoying than dangerous\".\nCritics including Peter Dreier of Occidental College—who is listed on the site for having criticized the National Rifle Association and using Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States as a required text—have pointed out errors of fact that may make Professor Watchlist less than reliable as a source of information. Dreier's entry formerly listed him as a former employee of the Industrial Areas Foundation and as the man who inspired college student Barack Obama to become a community organizer. Dreier identifies these claims about him as \"complete fantasy\". He also noted elements of his biography that the website completely omitted, such as his work with labor unions, his activism in favor of a minimum wage, and the books he wrote.\nKent State professor Julio Pino said to The New York Times the site is \"a kind of normalizing of prosecuting professors, shaming professors, defaming professors.\"\nThe website's organizers say that it simply provides conservative students with a guide to their professors, akin to RateMyProfessors.com, enabling them to avoid left-wing classes.\nOver one hundred University of Notre Dame faculty members signed an open letter asking to be included in the site, saying in part:\n\nWe surmise that the purpose of your list is to shame and silence faculty who espouse ideas you reject. But your list has had a different effect upon us. We are coming forward to stand with the professors you have called \"dangerous,\" reaffirming our values and recommitting ourselves to the work of teaching students to think clearly, independently and fearlessly.\nIn response to the Notre Dame letter, University of Chicago psychology professor Leslie Kay started the website \"Free Academics\". This website lists the names of professors across the United States who have signed it to ask for their names to be added to the list. As of December 2016, it had over 1,500 signatories.\nThe list has been accused of disproportionately targeting professors of color and other minority professors.\nThe website has been criticized for using surveillance-type propaganda to manipulate ideas of truth, equality, and freedom. Critics have compared Professor Watchlist to the actions of U.S. senator Joseph McCarthy, who tried to publicly identify American citizens as Communists and Communist sympathizers in the 1950s. The New York Times wrote that it was \"a threat to academic freedom.\"\nHans-Joerg Tiede, a staff member of the American Association of University Professors, said of a professor who was named for writing a book chapter on teaching mathematics to minority ethnic children: \"She was inundated with death threats. She was Jewish and received anti-Semitic threats and threats of sexual assault. Instances like that are happening with some regularity\".\nThe website erroneously claimed that Hunter Biden would \"assist in lecturing a course\" at Tulane University in the fall semester of 2021.\n\n\nSee also\nCanary Mission\nCharlie Kirk firings\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website - Professor Watchlist\nOfficial website - Education Watch",

One of Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seats and all eight seats in the United States House of Representatives were up for election, as well as half of the Wisconsin Senate seats and all 99 Wisconsin State Assembly seats.  Voters also chose ten electors to represent them in the Electoral College, which then participated in selecting the 45th president of the United States.  The 2016 Fall Partisan Primary was held on August 9, 2016.\nThe Wisconsin Republican Party made large gains in the 2016 election. Businessman and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won Wisconsin in an upset, becoming the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Additionally, the state GOP had a strong showing in the State Legislature, building their largest majorities since 1957, and Republican senator Ron Johnson defeated Russ Feingold a second time for a second term. This put Walker and the Wisconsin GOP in a strong position.\nThe 2016 Wisconsin Spring Election was held April 5, 2016.  This election featured a contested race for Wisconsin Supreme Court, with Republicans' preferred candidate, recently-appointed justice Rebecca Bradley, winning a ten-year term.  The Spring election also saw various other judicial and local elections, including contested county executive and mayoral races in Wisconsin's largest city and county, Milwaukee.  The 2016 Wisconsin Spring Primary was held February 17, 2016.\n\n\nFederal\n\n\nPresident\n\n\nSenate\n\nIn a rematch of the 2010 election, first term incumbent Republican Ron Johnson ran against former Democratic U.S. Senator Russ Feingold. Johnson defeated Feingold in the general election with 50.2% of the vote.\n\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nAll of Wisconsin's eight United States House of Representatives seats were up for election in 2016. Party composition remained unchanged after the general election.\n\n\nState\n\n\nLegislature\n\n\nState Senate\n\nThe 16 even-numbered districts out of 33 seats in the Wisconsin Senate were up for election in 2016. Nine of these seats were held by Republicans and seven were held by Democrats. Prior to the election, Republicans controlled the chamber with a 19 to 14 majority, but they gained a seat in the election.\n\n\nState Assembly\n\nAll 99 seats of the Wisconsin State Assembly were up for election in November. Nine Assemblymen (6 Republicans, 3 Democrats) did not seek re-election.\n\n\nJudiciary\n\n\nState Supreme Court\n\nIncumbent Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley defeated Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in the April general election.  Justice Bradley had been appointed to the court in 2015 by Governor Scott Walker, to replace Justice N. Patrick Crooks, who had died in office.  Justice Crooks' term was already set to expire in 2016, thus the election did not need to  be scheduled any earlier than it was already set to be held before Crooks's death.\nThough Wisconsin's judicial elections are officially nonpartisan, Bradley's victory was seen as a win for the Republican Party, as she supported a judicial philosophy in line with that of federal conservative judges like Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. During the election her primary backers were Republican-aligned interest groups such as the NRA Political Victory Fund and Wisconsin Right to Life. Justice Crooks, her predecessor, was seen as a swing vote on the court, so his replacement by the conservative Bradley was seen as a net gain for the conservative bloc on the court.\n\n\nState Court of Appeals\nAll four districts of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals had a seat up for election in 2016.  None of the races were contested.\n\nIn District I, Judge Joan F. Kessler was elected to her third term without opposition.\nIn District II, Judge Paul F. Reilly was elected to his second term without opposition.\nIn District III, Judge Thomas Hruz was elected to his first full term, after being appointed to the court by Governor Scott Walker in 2014.\nIn District IV, Judge Brian Blanchard was elected to his second term without opposition.\n\n\nState Circuit Courts\nForty of the state's 249 circuit court seats were up for election in 2016.  Ten of those seats were contested.  Three incumbent judges were defeated—Milwaukee County judges Paul Rifelj and Michelle Ackerman Havas, and Eau Claire County judge Brian H. Wright.  All three defeated judges had been appointed by Governor Scott Walker.\n\n\nLocal\n\n\nKenosha\nJohn Antaramian was elected to a four-year term as Mayor of Kenosha.  He was returning to office after having previously served four four-year terms as mayor from 1992 through 2008.\n\n\nMilwaukee\nIncumbent Tom Barrett was reelected to his fourth term as Mayor of Milwaukee, defeating alderman Bob Donovan.\nIncumbent County Executive Chris Abele was re-elected, defeating state senator Chris Larson.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Toftes Gave was a Norwegian orphanage for enforced placement of maladjusted children, or children in deficit of parental care. It was established in 1844 in Munkedamsveien in the city of Christiania. The institution was relocated to Ullensaker Municipality in 1858, and again to the island of Helgøya in Nes Municipality in 1876. The institution closed in 1947.\n\n\nHistory\nThe institution was established by wholesaler and former mayor of Christiania Andreas Tofte in 1844, as a \"rescuing institution for morally corrupt children of both sexes\". It was originally located at Munkedamsveien 31 in Christiania, at Holmen in Pipervika. In 1847 the institution, including seven buildings, was donated to the municipality of Christiania. The donation was accepted on 9 June 1847, and the institution was henceforth called Toftes Gave (Tofte's gift), named after the donor. In 1858 it was moved to Risebro farm in Ullensaker. In 1876, it was decided to relocate the institution again to Nedre Sund farm on the island of Helgøya in Lake Mjøsa, in Hedmark county. The moving process took place during the autumn of 1877. According to new regulations adopted in 1878, from then on the institution only accepted boys.\nWhile the clientele consisted of 58 boys in 1888, this increased to 151 boys in 1899. The number was reduced to 86 boys in 1912. In 1912 the farm's livestock counted 78 cattle, 14 horses and 65 pigs. After decades of cultivation the farmland consisted of about 900 decares (0.90 km2; 0.35 sq mi) of arable land and 400 decares (0.40 km2; 0.15 sq mi) of productive forests. From this period the institution is known among others through the memoirs of Johannes S. Andersen. He spent four years at Toftes Gave, beginning when he was ten years old, and describes a regime of strict discipline. The children were used as farm workers, under the surveillance of local farmers from Helgøya, and he had the impression they were regarded as inferior to the most primitive of animals. The children adapted to the regime in order to survive. Their instincts of self-preservation also made them learn how to pick locks to gain access to the storage rooms that housed supplies of potatoes or turnips, in order to appease their hunger.

    "text": "Shirin Abedinirad (born 1986) is an Iranian contemporary artist and assistant professor at Utah Valley University. She is known for her large-scale mirror installations, conceptual art, and land art projects that explore themes of nature, spirituality, and optical illusions. Since 2024, she has served as Assistant Professor in the Department of Art & Design at Utah Valley University. In 2023, she appeared as an actress in Ali Ahmadzadeh's film Critical Zone, which won the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAbedinirad was born in 1986 in Tabriz, Iran. She began her artistic practice with painting in 2002. She earned an Associate Degree in Graphic Design from Ardabil Vocational College for Girls (2003-2005) and a Bachelor of Arts in Fashion and Textile Design from Shariaty Technical College in Tehran (2009-2014), where her thesis examined the relationship between conceptual art and fashion design.\nIn 2013, she participated in a visual arts workshop led by renowned Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami. From 2021 to 2024, she pursued a Master of Fine Arts in Studio Art at Michigan State University, graduating with her thesis project \"Reflective Journey.\"\n\n\nArtistic practice\nAbedinirad's work primarily consists of site-specific installations using mirrors and reflective materials to create optical illusions and connect natural environments with human perception. Her installations often incorporate geometric forms inspired by Islamic architecture, particularly ziggurats and pyramids, which she covers with mirrors to reflect and fragment the surrounding landscape.\nHer artistic philosophy centers on creating \"a transcendental experience\" through the manipulation of light, reflection, and space. She has stated that her work aims to \"connect the earth to the sky\" and create moments of contemplation about humanity's relationship with nature.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nAcademic career\nIn 2024, Abedinirad joined Utah Valley University as Assistant Professor in the Department of Art & Design, where she teaches courses in Fiber Art, Sculpture III, and 3D Design. Prior to this appointment, she served as Instructor of Record for Three-Dimensional Form at Michigan State University (2022-2023).\n\n\nMajor installations\nAbedinirad's first major outdoor installation, Narcissus (2013), was created in Iran's Central Desert, featuring a spiral staircase covered in mirrors. This was followed by Evocation (2013), also in the Central Desert, which established her signature approach of using mirrors to create illusions in natural landscapes.\nIn 2014, while on scholarship at Fabrica Research Centre in Italy, she created Heaven on Earth, an installation that brought her mirror work into an interior space. Her international breakthrough came with Mirrored Ziggurat (2015) at the Underbelly Arts Festival on Cockatoo Island, Sydney, which gained widespread media attention.\nBabel Tower (2015), created in collaboration with Italian designer Gugo Torelli, became one of her most recognized works. The installation featured a pyramidal structure covered in mirrors that rotated to create kinetic reflections. The image was later selected as the cover for Stanford University Press's book \"Archaeology of Babel: The Colonial Foundation of the Humanities\" by Siraj Ahmed.\nHer work Revision (2018) was featured at the Lorne Sculpture Biennale in Australia, while Reflective Journey (2023-2024) has been shown at multiple international venues including the Oku-Noto Triennale in Japan and as a VR installation at Art Dubai Digital.\n\n\nFilm career\nIn 2023, Abedinirad made her acting debut in Ali Ahmadzadeh's film Critical Zone (Persian: منطقه بحرانی). The film won the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=40620214",
    "text": "Clement Renzi (born as Clement Edward Joseph Peter Renzi; 1925–2009) was an American sculptor whose figurative bronze and terra cotta works depict people, human relationships, animals, and birds. His work has been popular with collectors in California's Central Valley and is placed in more than 60 public venues, primarily in that region.\n\n\nChildhood and family\nClement Renzi was the third of seven children, born to parents Clemente Renzi and Luisa Guastaferro. The couple had been drawn to Central California's Tulare County because of its resemblance to the landscape of Clemente's native village of Dugenta, Italy. After the family lost their prune orchard in the stock market crash of 1929, they moved to Farmersville, California, where Clemente worked managing a ranch.\n\n\nBeginnings as a sculptor\nClement Renzi's first drawing, at about age seven, depicted a cow on his family's farm. He resolved to become a sculptor during a family trip to San Francisco's Palace of the Legion of Honor. During that visit, he encountered the sculptures of Auguste Rodin and had difficulty keeping his hands off them, despite admonitions of a security guard.\nAt the end of World War II, while serving as a naval officer in Hawaii, Renzi worked in a lumberyard, where he began to experiment with woodcarving.\nLater, while at U.C. Berkeley studying business administration through the G.I. Bill, he took art classes with Jacques Schnier and Richard O'Hanlon. After he had graduated in 1947 and was working as an accountant for Standard Oil, a fellow student urged him to attend a lecture by art educator Henry Schaefer-Simmern. The lecture was an epiphany for Renzi, who said, \"It was just like I had walked into daylight from darkness.\"\n\"It was that kind of an experience and it had a profound effect on me. Here was Henry saying that art cannot be imposed upon you.  You have to make your own judgments. I had thought that the teacher alone played that part and made all the judgments, but Henry said, 'No, you are perfectly free to do it your own way. The most important thing is that you do what you can do, in the way that you feel it, and the way you can express it. It has perfect validity as a work of art when you do it your own way.' That enormous sense of freedom gave me an exciting license to advance along my own path.\"\nAt age 27, Renzi enrolled as a charter member of Schaefer-Simmern's Institute of Art Education and continued his studies there for five years. He later said that Schaefer-Simmern provided a “course to guide my whole life work.”\nAlthough Renzi experimented with drawing, painted needlework, mosaic, and block printing, Schaefer-Simmern observed that his work all seemed to resemble sculpture and encouraged him to focus on that medium.\nIn 1950, Renzi married Dorothy Ohannesian, a classically trained singer from Fresno, California. When Renzi complained to Dorothy that his accounting job at Standard Oil felt increasingly unsatisfying, she persuaded him to seek part-time jobs that would allow him to focus on his art.\nIn 1954–1955, Dorothy studied singing in Vienna through an Alfred Hertz Master's Fellowship from UC Berkeley. During this time, Clement studied at Vienna's Academy of Applied art, P. 16. with a special focus on block printing. The couple also studied in Paris.\n\n\nNew York\nFollowing their return to the United States, Clement completed his first major commission, The \"Fourteen Stations of the Cross\", for a Christian Brothers retreat center in St. Helena.\nIn 1957, he and Dorothy moved to New York City to accommodate Dorothy's recording contract with MGM records. Renzi studied anatomy at the Art Students League, and before long, he had secured a workspace at New York's Sculpture Center. Clement offered a large tapestry, Eat, Drink and Be Merry, for sale at the gallery at an audaciously high price, not fully wanting to part with it. When, to his surprise, the work was sold, Dorothy encouraged Clem to devote himself full-time to his sculpture. P. 16. With the Sculpture Center, he participated in several New York exhibits, was featured in shows traveling nationwide, and held a one-man exhibit in 1960.\nIn a brochure for the 1960 exhibit, Sculpture Center's founder, Dorothea Henrietta Denslow commented, “These little people with their long noses, big eyes, and chubby figures live in a far-away land. They are friendly, warm and at peace with themselves, enjoying their unimportant happy moments. We do not know them or their country, but Renzi does, as you can readily see by this show. Through his sculpture, we watch them as they work and play in close harmony, concerned only with the miracles of their simple world.”\n\n\nFresno, California\nIn 1963 the couple moved to Dorothy's hometown of Fresno, to raise their daughter in a quieter environment. Although he had intended to continue shipping his work to the Sculpture Center in New York, his work quickly proved appealing to Fresno collectors. Within a year, Renzi had secured a commission for a large bronze, The Visit, for the City's new outdoor mall.\nRenzi taught in the art department at Fresno State College for three years, but left when it seemed to be taking too much attention from his work. Renzi had built a studio in his backyard in Fresno's Fig Garden neighborhood, and travelled periodically to cast his larger bronze works through the lost wax process in ItalyItaly and Spain. As costs rose in Europe, he turned to foundries in Mexico City and California. His terra cotta works, made from locally derived clay, were often cast in a kiln on the premises of his home. Most of the completed works were unique or cast in editions of two or three.\nRenzi continued to receive almost uninterrupted commissions for large bronzes for area hospitals, banks, churches, schools, colleges, the Fresno library, entertainment centers, civic buildings, parks, malls and businesses. In addition, he produced hundreds of smaller works, which he sold from his home and through local galleries. He also continued to offer works through the Lillian Kornbluth gallery in Fairlawn, New Jersey; the William Beattie Gallery in Chicago, and Sculpture Center in New York City.\n\n\nControversy about Brotherhood of Man\nIn 1969, one of Renzi's sculptures, Brotherhood of Man, drew attention to his work when a group unsuccessfully contested its placement at the Fresno County Courthouse, asserting that its subject matter violated the separation of church and state.\n\n\nStyle\nRenzi's style sometimes resembles the work of Ernst Barlach, reflecting the influence of German expressionism in his training, and has also been compared to folk art. However, Renzi did not identify with any particular style or movement and considered the character of his work to have evolved through an introspective, self-directed process of trial and error. \"I try to find something completely my own within me and try to enlarge on the concepts that come out of inner search,\" he said in a 1974 interview. \"I search within and get ideas from within.\"\nRenzi's early work often featured tall, slender forms. In the early 60's his sculptures could be characterized as “fat and flat”. Later works assumed a more rounded, friendly aspect (P 13) with cherubic children making a frequent appearance, although he also experimented with other kinds of forms, such as a series of bird-like boats with abstract human passengers, and with weightier themes, such as heroic figures from the Old Testament.\n\n\nLegacy\nAlthough Renzi's art was well received by critics and collectors during his New York years, and he continued to market smaller pieces through galleries in the Chicago and the New York area, the demand for his work was so strong in Fresno and its surrounding communities that as time went on, he gave little attention to promoting his work in major urban centers. He remains best known in California's Central Valley.\n\n\nExhibitions\n\n\nOne-man exhibitions\nThe Sculpture Center, New York New York. 1960 and 1973\nSt. Mary's College, Moraga, California\nUniversity of Virginia Gallery, Charlottesville, Virginia\nFresno Art Center (Clement Renzi: The Fresno Years, 1989.

    "text": "Noko Jeans (Korean: 노코진스) was a Swedish fashion company. The company was best known for importing jeans from North Korea. Although the company was not the first to import jeans from North Korea, it was the first company to insist to keep the label 'Made in North Korea' on the jeans. The company was founded in 2007 and ceased operations in 2011, however the company continued to post on social media until 2013.\n\n\nHistory\nNoko Jeans was founded by Swedish entrepreneurs Jakob Ohlsson, Jacob Aström and Tor Rauden Källstigen. The idea for the company came after they got drunk.\nOn July 20, 2007, they were scrolling through a North Korean website and noticed a new page titled \"Business\". After clicking on a button, they found a list of goods that North Korea claimed to be able to export. They sent a email to the contact address and claimed that they were import-export managers of a fictitious company. A few hours later, they received a response thanking them for their interest.\nIn November 2007, North Korean Embassy in Stockholm made a call to them. A North Korean attempted to convince them to buy a zinc factory and make jackets instead. In December 2007, they provided two pairs of jeans, one of them being a used pair, to North Korean delegation for inspection at a textile factory.\nOn July 27, 2008, the trio arrived in Pyongyang on a train from Beijing. The next 10 days were spent visiting textile factories. They were rejected by North Korea’s biggest textile producing company, but struck a deal with North Korea’s largest mining company, Trade4, which was also involved in textile on their last day in North Korea. They signed a contract to produce 1,100 pairs of black jeans.\nOn November 11, 2009, after two years, the jeans arrived at last in Stockholm. The jeans were intended to be sold at The Noko Jeans shop on December 4, which the label describes as its \"museum\", as well as at Aplace, a retail space within the PUB department store. The department store refused to cooperate, claiming that it did not wish to become involved in politics. In 2010, the North Korean manufacturer also annulled their agreements with company.\nThe company remained in business until 2011. In 2013, the company claimed to have only 100 pairs of jeans left. From December 18, 2009 to February 6, 2010, Noko Jeans had a museum in Södermalm, Stockholm.\n\n\nDesign\nThe two unisex models were designed in collaboration with fashion designer Julia Hederus. Both models are designed based on the Noko Jeans story. Both of the models were made in black denim.\nKara Slim Fit is a tighter model with a regular waist.\nOke Loose Fit is more baggy, with a drop-crotch. Oke Loose Fit has a regular waist.\nThe karaoke bar where the founders spent their first evening in Pyongyang served as the inspiration for the names, Kara and Oke.\n\n\nProduction\nThe founders claimed that they had packed spools of sewing thread and large amounts of cash their bags when they went to North Korea. They brought the cash for the production with them because it was too complicated to do it through ordinary bank channels. They also said they had to supply everything all the materials needed as North Korea doesn't produce anything.\nAt one point they were asked to import a zinc smelting oven and another asked for a pirated copy of Adobe Acrobat as the person couldn't read the files they were sending him.\nIn 2009, when the founders returned to North Korea to see the progress, the jeans were not yet ready as the buttons were stuck somewhere between Pakistan and Pyongyang.\nA total of 1,100 pairs of jeans were made by a mining company in Pyongyang during 2009. Each pair of jeans cost 1,500 kronor (£131) or ($220) which is more than two year’s wages for the average North Korean.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nNew York Times — “North Korea-Made Designer Jeans Launched in Sweden”\nThe Huffington Post — \"Denim Diplomacy\"\nOfficial Website (Now defunct) - archived version here\nOfficial Photo Gallery (Flickr)\nThis is Our Factory\nHELLO IT'S Noko Jeans!",

    "text": "The Coney Island Mermaid Parade is an art parade held annually in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City. The event, the largest art parade in the United States, is held each year in June and celebrates the arrival of the summer season. Created and produced by the non-profit arts organization Coney Island USA, the 40th annual parade was held on June 18, 2022.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe Mermaid Parade traditionally takes place on the Saturday closest to the summer solstice, June 21, regardless of weather. Its intent is to celebrate self-expression, boost pride in Coney Island, and give New York artists a place to display their artwork.  There are no ethnic, religious, or commercial aims.\nThe parade pays homage to the Coney Island Mardi Gras parades of the early 20th century. During this era, Coney Island was the primary amusement park destination for those in the New York metropolitan area. Like the annual Village Halloween Parade, the Mermaid Parade evokes the artistic spirit of Mardi Gras.\nThe event typically attracts about 3,000 participants and hundreds of thousands of spectators from all five boroughs of New York City. After the last participant passes the reviewing stand, parade founder Dick Zigun leads the procession to the beach for a ceremony representing the opening of the ocean for the summer swimming season.\n\n\nHistory\nThe tradition began in 1983, when the first event of this kind was conceptualized and organized by Dick Zigun, the founder of the non-profit arts organization Coney Island USA, who is sometimes dubbed the \"Mayor of Coney Island.\"\nThe parade of June 22, 2013, was almost canceled due to a lack of money and resources following the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. It was rescued through a successful Kickstarter campaign along with a benefit concert that together raised $117,000, more than the $100,000 goal.\nThe 2020 parade was replaced by a virtual event (The Tail-a-Thon) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The parade was delayed in 2021 to September 12 (marking the last weekend that lifeguards would be on duty at Coney Island) in order to improve the chances that it could be held, but on August 18 it was announced that the parade would be cancelled out of an abundance of caution due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in the region.\n\n\nThemes\nThe Mermaid Parade is known for marine costumes and occasional nudity.  There are sections in the parade for vehicles of all kinds, for floats, for groups, and for individuals.  There are also family friendly and artsy categories.  The organizers of the parade claim to encourage bribery, to give participants a more equal chance to win the various costume contests which are also part of the day's entertainment.\nEach year the Mermaid Parade features a King Neptune and Queen Mermaid.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nJulián Is a Mermaid\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Coney Island Mermaid Parade at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\n\"Mermaid Parade images\".

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=551020",
    "text": "Leæther Strip is a Danish musical project founded on 13 January 1988 by Claus Larsen. Its influence has been most felt in the electronic body music and electro-industrial genres. Leæther Strip was one of the earliest and most prominent acts on Germany's now defunct Zoth Ommog record label. For distribution outside of Europe, the music has been licensed to the U.S. labels Cleopatra Records and Metropolis Records. After the demise of Zoth Ommog in 1999, Larsen signed to Bloodline Records, which only released a single before also going out of business. In 2005, Leæther Strip signed with the Belgian-based label Alfa Matrix.  On 3 June 2011 Larsen announced his split from Alfa Matrix in order to self-release future material.\n\n\nHistory\nLarsen was born on 13 November 1967 in Aalborg, Denmark. He first released music under the name of Leæther Strip in 1989, but he had been in as many as three bands previously, the last of which was a solo \"instrumental melodic techno\" project named Forbidden Art. His 1995 release G.A.W.M.U.S. (Getting Away With Murder U. S.) included two early demos from 1982 and 1984, with the latter forming the unknown beginning of the band according to an interview conducted with Claus Larsen. In 1991, Larsen created a side-project called Klute in which he also remained the sole member.\nThe band name was intended to convey the literal meaning — a small band of leather — though Larsen has been guarded as to the reason. During some early shows, the racy implications of the name \"strip\" led some to believe that his act was explicitly pornographic to the point where one show was scouted by a pornographic magazine.\nHis first album, The Pleasure of Penetration, was produced by Talla 2XLC (Andreas Tomalla of Bigod 20) and Ra/Hen (Ralf Henrich of Robotiko Rejekto) and released on the German label Zoth Ommog Records. His early records were labeled \"industrial\" music, although Larsen himself had no specific opinion of what genre the music fit into. In 1994, Larsen changed the sound of Leæther Strip, with the release of a synthesized semi classical album, Serenade for the Dead, which was conceived as a soundtrack to a fictional film. This change in sound was compounded by the tragedy of the near death of his father and culminated in the darker and more somber 1995 album Legacy of Hate and Lust. The releases since then have reincorporated electronic dance elements, and have redefined Leæther Strip into what Larsen calls \"symphonic electro\".\nLeæther Strip remained silent for several years after the release of the single Carry Me in 2000 and the official band website, which once contained a wealth of information regarding the project, was taken offline. In foreshadowing the return of his band, Larsen's remix of the band KiEw's song Graograman on the Diskette EP (2003) states at the beginning of the song, in a sing-song computer-generated voice, \"Leæther Strip will return for more electronic mayhem\". In an interview conducted late 2005, Larsen revealed that label issues, as well as personal concerns, caused the dormancy of the band during the 2000–2005 period.\n28 October 2005 marked the official return of Leæther Strip with the EP release Suicide Bombers on the Alfa Matrix label. Claus Larsen opened a blog to inform fans of his current activities and progress on the project. A string of releases followed including the 2-CD album After the Devastation, and the 2006 EP releases Walking on Volcanos and Fætish. Also in 2006, Claus Larsen released a free song via his MySpace page, a remix of Frank Tovey taught me things. The song was subsequently downloaded over 10,000 times.\nOn 13 April 2007, Leæther Strip released the album The Giant Minutes to the Dawn. It was made available in several editions, including a special limited edition box-set which includes the band's first DVD release. According to various reviewers, the album constituted the \"true\" return of the band to classic Leæther Strip form.\nIn a post to his MySpace blog made in late November 2008, Larsen announced his intention to develop a live show for a small run of exclusive engagements in 2009. Two shows took place in Denmark in April 2009, and Leaether Strip has been confirmed to perform at the Power Strip Festival in the USA and the Amphi Festival in Germany during Summer 2009.\nVia a video teaser on YouTube Claus Larsen announced that the first Leaether Strip album, The Pleasure of Penetration, would be re-released as a remastered double CD set on 13 November 2007, Claus Larsen's birthday, under the title Retention n°1. The release is part of an ongoing box series through which Claus Larsen will re-release his complete back-catalogue via the Belgian label Alfa Matrix. Each re-release will have both the fully remastered version of the original album on disc 1 and on the second disc, a totally re-written and reinterpretation of some selected songs from the original album by Leaether Strip himself re-recorded with current technologies. The original track-list on disc 1 has been extended to 15 tracks with the addition of early 12\" tracks and other rarities of the period.\n\nLarsen's lyrics for Leaether Strip are often frank and direct, sometimes to the point of being hostile.  Political songs include the anti-Nazi song \"AEighty AEight\" which contains the chorus \"You are not human / You are not soldiers\" as well as the song \"Suicide Bombers\" (On the Suicide Bombers EP) with its chorus question, \"Who told you to die that way?\" More frequently, Larsen explores his own personal issues in the same open fashion, resulting in many tracks that are simultaneously aggressive and introspective.\nLarsen's husband and band companion, Kurt Grünewaldt Hansen, died on 28 September 2020, after a battle with cancer, aged 75.\n\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\n1990 – The

    "text": "Clara railway station serves the town of Clara in County Offaly.\nThe station lies on the Dublin to Galway and Dublin to Westport or Ballina line.\n\n\nHistory\nThe station opened on 3 October 1859.\nBranch Line Origins:\nThe Portarlington to Athlone railway was only a branch line up until the mid-1970s and there were several further spur lines emanating from Clara.\nClara to Streamstown Railway:\nClara was once a railway junction, it had a spur to Streamstown on the now disused Athlone–Mullingar link.\nIn 1895, according to the Bradshaw's Guide (page 600 of the 1895 guide), there were 4 trains per weekday from Clara to Streamstown and 5 in the opposite direction, with the journey taking between 20 and 29 minutes.\nClara to Banagher Railway Off-Shoot:\nAnother such spur to the branch-line, was the Clara to Banagher railway. This served Ferbane, and the Cloghan and Belmont railway station before terminating in Banagher, near where the Banagher Marina is today. In 1920, according to the 1920 Bradshaw's Guide (page 705) there were two passenger trains per day in each direction via steam train with the journey taking 43 minutes. There were no weekend services.\nToday all these areas are served by the 840 Local Link bus with 6x daily return services while also serving the additional communities of Ballycumber and Pullough with a drop-off location in the middle of Banagher town as opposed to a 9-minute walk from the location of the railway station to the centre of the town.\nLimited Service Patterns:\nIn 1920 there was also a twice daily (no service during weekends) offering between Dublin Heuston (then Kingsbridge Station) with journey times varying between 1 hour 59 minutes and 2 hours and 14 minutes. Heading west, the service would terminate after crossing the Shannon in Athlone's Roscommon-based station.\nWhile the Portarlington to Athlone railway continued to remain a branch line and there were still only two daily return trains between Clara and Dublin Heuston, journey times had improved to 1 hour 45 minutes by 1971 as per the CIE timetable.\nNational Historical Context:\nIn 1971 there were 10.3m passenger journeys per year in Ireland compared to 50.7m in 2024. While 4 trains per day is very low compared to 2025's 25, it is worth noting that there were only 94 daily train services on the entire Ireland rail network in 1972. Trains serving Clara thus represented over 4% of all trains nationally. In 2025 there are close to 900 daily trains during weekdays.\nMainline Promotion:\nBy 1975 the Portarlington to Athlone line had been promoted to the current mainline and Clara then received 5 daily return services with journey times being reduced to as little as 89 minutes. You could also now go directly to Galway for the first time via regularly scheduled passenger services.\nIn 2025, the fastest services take 59 minutes between Heuston and Clara.\n\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn 9 March 2019, a woman was seriously injured after being hit by a train to Westport near the station. Services were suspended for a few hours as a result.\n\n\nSee also\nList of railway stations in Ireland\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nIrish Rail Clara Station Website",

    "text": "The Pioneer Mother is a sculpture formerly located on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon. Burt Barker donated the six-foot-tall bronze sculpture, created by artist Alexander Phimister Proctor, to the university. Barker's daughter, Barbara Barker, introduced the sculpture to a public gathering of hundreds on May 7, 1932, during Junior Week and Mother's Day festivities.\n\n\nCreation and design\nPioneer Mother began with Barker, then a vice-president of the University of Oregon, who had the initial idea to represent the pioneer mothers on campus and financial resources to present this work as a gift to the state board of education.  He commissioned Proctor to do the work in 1927, since Proctor had already created The Pioneer. For this sculpture, the model was Barker's own mother, Elvira Brown Barker, who migrated to Oregon across the Great Plains in 1847.\nIn design, The Pioneer Mother conveys the subject in later life, after the trials of the journey westward had long been completed. When Barker made the news of his gift public, he described what set this sculpture apart: \"[o]thers have perpetuated the struggles of the pioneer mother; I want to perpetuate the peace which followed her struggles.\"  The sculpture, placed atop a six-foot-tall base of pink granite, portrays a woman sitting at rest on a straight-backed chair, with a Bible upon her lap. The clear lines and massing of the base further enhance the suggestion of repose. Her journey, as represented in the bronze bas-relief panels on the west and east sides of the base, is over, and she is firmly rooted in her new home. Her style, as seen in her hair arrangement and cut of her dress, is simple, she is a depiction of all pioneer mothers in the twilight of their years.\n\n\nLocation\nThe sculpture was intentionally placed in a busy location on the University of Oregon campus. Barker stated in his address at her unveiling that \"[i]t has been placed on the campus of the University of Oregon ... with the hope that so placed in the midst of the students and their activities, it may tell its story as a work of art and become a strong factor in implanting the love of the beautiful in the lives of the students as they go in and out before it.\"\nAs to her exact location, an Old Oregon article describes her placement thus: \n\n\"[h]er site was not chosen until a cardboard facsimile of the statue was placed at various positions on the campus. After the entire women's quadrangle was changed, the Mother was placed in the center, close enough to several paths so she can catch bits of University chatter.\"\n\nShe faces north, toward The Pioneer, a sculpture of a male pioneer, with Johnson Hall, the university's main administration building, between them. The sculptures are about one hundred yards apart.  The primary sources consulted, however, give no indication that this was done with the intention they face each other as the popular notion today insists.\n\n\nHistory\nThe statue was toppled by activists in June 2020, along with The Pioneer. The president of the university condemned the actions as vandalism.\n\n\nSee also\n1932 in art\nOregon Trail\nList of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPioneer Mother (sculpture) at the Smithsonian Institution",

First, he sent off Inter's Romelu Lukaku after celebrating his late equalizer. Lukaku was subject of racist chants during the match. He celebrated his goal with a \"silencing the crowd\" gesture where Massa evidently saw it as inciting the crowd. After the match ends, he sent off Inter goalkeeper's Samir Handanović and Juventus's Juan Cuadrado after they degenerate into a brawl. Afterwards, former Serie A referee Luca Marelli criticized Massa's decisions to send off Lukaku while Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport suggest that Massa failed to keep a lid on things.\nWeeks later, on 23 April 2023, Massa refereed the Greek Super League derby Olympiacos CFP- AEK Athens 1-3 which caused huge complaints from the Olympiacos CFP team with his refereeing, causing the invasion at the end of the match by Olympiacos CFP team officials, the president of Evangelos Marinakis and the fans of Olympiacos who clashed with the Police. After the end of the match, Massa wrote on the match sheet that when he left the field, he felt a hit on his genitals by people he did not recognize.\nOn 5 June 2025, Massa was assigned to referee the Serbia v Albania match in Tirana.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDavide Massa referee profile at WorldFootball.net\nDavide Massa referee profile at EU-Football.info",

    "text": "WUBC (channel 48) was an independent television station in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States, which broadcast from 1967 to 1970. Originally owned by Piedmont Triad TV and later by WEAL, Inc., owner of radio station WEAL (1510 AM), it operated from studios at 1013 Warehouse Street and a transmitter at Summerfield, North Carolina. WUBC was ultimately a financial failure that forced WEAL into bankruptcy and led to an auction of that station five years later.\n\n\nHistory\nPiedmont Triad TV—a company controlled by Ralph C. Price, a former president of the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company—applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1966 for a new television station on Greensboro's ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 48. The construction permit for the station was granted on March 8, 1967.\nAfter several delays, some caused by rains affecting construction of the tower, WUBC began broadcasting on November 6, 1967. Programs at launch included a late night local talk show, Triad Tonight, as well as movies and syndicated shows. WEAL and WPET personality Tommy Parker also hosted a show.\nThe television station was transferred from Piedmont Triad TV to WEAL, Inc., in 1969; Price and Carroll G. Ogle were the only principals in both companies. In November of that year, WUBC filed an application with the FCC challenging the license of WGHP in High Point, in an effort to move to the more desirable very high frequency (VHF) channel.\nIn June 1970, plans were presented to refocus WUBC as a \"local news and sports station\" alongside the appointment of a new sales manager. On July 23, WEAL, Inc., presented a petition for bankruptcy with $71,000 in assets against $342,000 in liabilities. The station left the air after July 25 for what was described initially as a temporary pause due to financial and technical issues. At least one provider of syndicated programming sued for non-payment. In early 1971, Piedmont Triad TV joined WEAL in bankruptcy; it had no assets and more than $700,000 in debt.\nWEAL briefly analyzed returning the station to operation by September 1970, but no resumption of broadcasting took place. In December, trustee William Zuckerman declared that the panorama for WUBC potentially returning to the air was \"very dark\"; not only were there engineering problems, but even in 1970, six years after the All-Channel Receiver Act came into effect, there were still too many VHF-only television sets in the region for channel 48 to be financially viable. Meanwhile, a WUBC objection to a transmitter site change and facility improvement for WBTV in Charlotte was successful; an FCC hearing examiner found that letting WBTV move to a new site in Denver, North Carolina, would have an adverse effect on WUBC and \"impair, if not totally frustrate\" the development of UHF television in the Triad.\nThe debt incurred in the WUBC venture carried WEAL, an otherwise profitable radio station, to the auction block. In 1974, WEAL was auctioned, as were two lots consisting of the tower site and tower for WUBC. The winning bidder for the radio station never paid, and a second auction was held in 1975 to dispose of the radio station. Channel 48 in Greensboro would later be used by a new and unrelated station, WGGT, in May 1981.\n\n\nReferences",

During his early life, he was a member of the Christian Democrats and Christian Democratic Center.\nHe was elected for the first time to the Chamber of Deputies in the 2001 elections, in the single-member constituency of Agrate Brianza, representing the House of Freedoms.\nIn the XIV Legislature, he was secretary of the Public and Private Employment Commission; he was also a member of the Culture, Science and Education Commission; the Parliamentary Commission for the control of the activities of the bodies managing compulsory forms of social security and assistance; of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Assembly of the Council of Europe; of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Assembly of the Western European Union.\nIn the 2006 elections, he was re-elected deputy on the lists of the Unione di Centro (UDC), this time in the Emilia-Romagna constituency.\nIn the XV Legislature, he was Vice-President of the Culture, Science and Education Commission. Already critical of the UDC line, he supported the minority motion led by Carlo Giovanardi at the III Congress in 2007.\nOn 4 February 2008, together with Giovanardi himself, he left the UDC and founded the Popular Liberal movement, which then joined Silvio Berlusconi's new political project, the People of Freedom. In the 2008 elections he was therefore re-elected as a deputy, on the lists of the People of Freedom in the Emilia-Romagna constituency. He became a member of the Board of Directors of the PdL in the Chamber of Deputies. He did not run for re-election in 2013.\nBarbieri died on 15 June 2025, at the age of 78.\n\n\nReferences",

Vasudev Rao a cousin of Raja Gangadhar Rao, he was adopted by the maharaja after his own son died. The adoption of Anand Rao, who was renamed Damodar Rao, occurred on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the Maharaja in November 21, 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this, Rani Laxmibai cried out \"I shall not surrender my Jhansi\" (\"mai apni Jhansi kabhi nahi doongi\"). In March 1854, Rani Laxmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.\nHowever, actions by mutineers at Jhansi and the failure of negotiations between the Rani and the Company resulted in Jhansi State reasserting its independence. Eventually, Company forces laid siege to the city of Jhansi and after determined resistance, they breached its defenses. Rani Laxmibai evaded capture, according to tradition, with Damodar Rao on her back jumping on her horse, Sarangi from the fort. They survived but the horse died. More probably she escaped in the night with her son, surrounded by guards.\n\nAfter the death of Rani Lakshmibai at Kotah ki Sarai in Gwalior on 17 June 1858, he survived that battle and, lived with his mentors in the jungle, in dire poverty. According to a memoir purported to be by Damodar Rao, he was among his mother's troops and household at the battle of Gwalior, together with others who had survived the battle (some 60 retainers with 60 camels and 22 horses), he fled from the camp of Rao Sahib of Bithur and as the village people of Bundelkhand dared not aid them for fear of reprisals from the British they were forced to live in the forest and suffer many privations. He had taken asylum in Jhalrapatan when due to the help of some old confidants, he met Raja Pratapsinh of Jhalarpatan. An old confidant, Nanekhan impressed upon the local British political officer, Flink to forgive young Damodar. He was sent to Indore after he surrendered to the British. Here, Sir Richard Shakespeare, the local political agent, placed him under the guardianship of a Kashmiri teacher, called Munshi Dharmanarayan, to teach Damodar – Urdu, English and Marathi. He was allowed to keep only 7 followers (all others had to leave) and was allotted an annual pension of Rs. 10,000.\nHe settled down at Indore, where British provided him house in Residency and was paid a pension of Rs. 400/- by British. His first wife died shortly afterwards and he was married again into Shivre family. In 1904, he had a son named Lakshman Rao. Later, after end of the Company rule in India, he also petitioned British Raj for recognition but was refused to be recognized as legal heir. Damodar Rao was an avid photographer by passion. He died on 28 May 1906 survived by his son Lakhsman Rao.\n\n\nReferences",

In 2006, Bunnaloo had a population of 126.\n\n\nHistory\nThe area that is now known as Bunnaloo originally was split between two properties: the Cobram Station and Perricoota. In 1899, a crown lease on part of the Perricoota land expired and the New South Wales Government split a paddock into six 700 acre homestead farms to be sold in 1901. Further subdividing of the Cobram Estate land allowed for more residents to move to the area.\nThe first Post Office in Bunnaloo was run from the home of a Mrs Hawkins, replacing the weekly mail run from Mathoura by Syd Larcombe. In 1924 a new railway line was laid, with Bunnaloo homing a new station. This allowed for easy transport of wheat or stock (previously it had to be carted 18 miles to Mathoura).\nIn 1926, Victor Hicks built a store in Bunnaloo. The Post Office was moved here, becoming the first official Bunnaloo Post Office (until its closure in 1974).\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1919 the parents of Bunnaloo purchased and moved a building from Womboota to a property to be used as a school. This was run by subsidised teachers prior to government teachers being supplied. For the school's final years it was again run by subsidised teachers. In 1927, the school was closed and the building sold to parents of the town of Walliston.\nBunnaloo Public School opened in 1928 and is still running (despite closing from 1944 to 1951 due to World War II). Currently, it has approx. 50 students attending. Students in Years K to 6 attend from all around the area. The current principal is Darren Devereux.\n\n\nSport\nUntil its disbandment at the end of the 1989 season, the Bunnaloo Football Club operated for many years. It won back-to-back premierships in 1988 and 1989.\nIn the 1960s, the Bunnaloo Table Tennis Club was established and operated. Teams of four men and two women competed for the McHugh Holschier trophy.\nBunnaloo in conjunction with Mathoura fields a cricket team in the Goulburn Murray Cricket League known as the Northern United Cricket Club. Prior to this, the Bunnaloo Cricket Club operated from the Bunnaloo Recreation Reserve.\n\n\nAmenities\n\nThe first Bunnaloo Hall was built in 1927 at a cost of £702. A supper room was added in 1945, and throughout the late 1950s and 1960s fundraisers were held to refurbish the hall. In the early 1980s, a new Bunnaloo Hall was built as part of the Bunnaloo Recreation Reserve. This includes an oval, cricket nets, and tennis courts.\nThe Bunnaloo Uniting Church (formerly the Bunnaloo Methodist Church) opened in 1966.\nA petrol station still operates, currently known as Riverine Petroleum. It resides on the intersection of Fitzroy Street and Bunnaloo Road.\n\n\nClimate\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Bunnaloo, New South Wales at Wikimedia Commons",

Everest and Harry C. Jennings Sr. were friends, and both were  engineers. Herbert Everest was also physically disabled after surviving a mining accident in 1918. Everest complained to Jennings about the bulk of chairs available in the early 1930s, and in 1933, the pair designed and built a lightweight, collapsible model in Jennings' garage. The design was patented in October 1937.\nThe pair soon went into business to manufacture their improved design. In the 1940s, they supplied disabled veterans of World War II through government contracts that established the company as a recognized name in rehabilitation equipment.\nThe Everest family sold its interest in the company in 1943, but Gerald Jennings, son of Harry Sr., was chief executive from 1952 until he retired in 1985.\nIn 1956, the company was \"the first to manufacture the electric wheelchair on a mass scale\".\n\n\nSuccess and legal troubles\n\nBy the early 1970s, Everest & Jennings International was \"the world's largest supplier of wheelchairs.\" But this status brought increased scrutiny. In 1977, the United States Justice Department formally accused Everest & Jennings of practices that violated antitrust laws. The resulting settlement required Everest & Jennings to make annual compliance reports to the Justice Department; the settlement was called \"little more than a slap on the wrist\" by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Nader was also involved with protests about the quality, safety, and price of Everest & Jennings chairs, by a disability rights group. A class action suit was brought by equipment dealers, but dismissed in court in 1984.\nEverest & Jennings recorded sales of $145 million in 1980, and profits near $8 million.  In the 1980s they launched \"Avenues,\" an adaptive clothing line for wheelchair users. They also diversified into hospital beds, but it suffered major losses. Changes within the company and in the business landscape during the 1980s left Everest & Jennings struggling at decade's end.\n\n\nLater developments\nIn 1992, facing financial difficulties from lost market share, Everest & Jennings moved from Camarillo, California to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1993, the company acquired Medical Composite Technology, a carbon fiber technology company.\nIn 1996, still struggling with debt and falling sales, Everest & Jennings announced the sale of the company to Graham-Field Health Products.  Graham-Field soon closed the Everest & Jennings plant in Earth City, Missouri. Graham-Field continues to market wheelchairs under the Everest & Jennings name.\n\n\nNotable customers\nAmong the prominent early users of Everest & Jennings wheelchairs were Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Sergeant Alvin C. York  and Winston Churchill. Ed Roberts and other members of the Rolling Quads used Everest & Jennings power chairs.  Author Joni Eareckson Tada once wrote, \"If they ever made a statue of me, I would want my 300-pound Everest & Jennings power chair front and center.\"  Actor Christopher Reeve's first wheelchair after becoming quadriplegic in 1995 was made by Everest & Jennings.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, often shortened to the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), is a South African pan-Africanist national liberation movement that is now a political party. It was founded by an Africanist group, led by Robert Sobukwe, that broke away from the African National Congress (ANC) in 1959, as the PAC objected to the ANC's theory that \"the land belongs to all who live in it both white and black\" and also rejected a multiracialist worldview, instead advocating a South Africa based on African nationalism.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe PAC was formally launched on 6 April 1959 at Orlando Communal Hall in Soweto. A number of African National Congress (ANC) members broke away because they objected to the substitution of the 1949 Programme of Action with the Freedom Charter adopted in 1955, which used multiracialist language as opposed to Africanist affirmations. The PAC at the time considered South Africa to be an African state by an \"inalienable right of the indigenous African people\" and refused to support equal rights of the oppressed and oppressor, exploiter and exploited, the land dispossessor and landless Africans - \"the dispossessed.\" They insisted that the historic mission of the PAC of the people of Azania was \"the complete freedom, liberation and independence of Afrika.\" This entailed political, social, economic and military independence. Robert Sobukwe was elected as the first president, and Potlako Leballo as the Secretary General.\nOn 21 March 1960, the PAC organised a campaign against pass laws. People gathered in the townships of Sharpeville and Langa where Sobukwe and other top leaders were arrested and later convicted for incitement. Sobukwe was sentenced to three years and Potlako Leballo to two years in prison. Sobukwe died in Kimberley, Cape Province, 1978 of lung cancer. Immediately after the Sharpeville massacre the National Party Government banned both the ANC and PAC on 8 April 1960. The PAC responded by founding its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army.\n\n\nIdeology\nThe PAC followed the idea that the South African Government should be constituted by the African people owing their allegiance only to Africa, as stated by Sobukwe in the inaugural speech of the PAC:\n\n\"We aim, politically, at government of the Africans by the Africans, for the Africans, with everybody who owes his only loyalty to Africa and who is prepared to accept the democratic rule of an African majority being regarded as an African.\"\n\nIt was Pan-Africanism with three principles of African nationalism, socialism, and continental unity. Its body of ideas drew largely from the teachings of Anton Lembede, George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, Martin Delany, Kwame Nkrumah, and W. E. B. Du Bois.\nThe PAC initially advocated for a form of \"Africanist Socialist Democracy\", based on African and Black Identity, with the aim of creating a South Africa (which they would rename Azania) for Black South Africans, to the exclusion of other nationalities or ethnicities. Unlike the African National Congress's view on socialism, the PAC was stated to have rejected the concept of class oppression, instead focusing exclusively on national liberation. Nevertheless, their initial manifesto lists the \"black working class\" as the \"driving force in the struggle\" against white capitalists and \"reactionary\" middle-class groups. These socialist elements were strongly toned down by the 1990s, instead adopting a more \"conservative\" stance that sought not to restrict market forces and a commitment not to implement socialism \"for the sake of it\". The Pan Africanist Youth Congress of Azania described the new program as the \"work of an element which is on the CIA payroll\". However, by April 1992, the PAC's party leadership in the Annual Congress no longer showed opposition to taking part in the multiracial negotiations to end the apartheid.\nThe PAC historically rejected Marxism, opposed communism (though it itself had borrowed from some Maoist tenets) and the inclusion of ethnic minorities within the liberation struggle, instead advocating black liberation exclusively within a Black nationalist concept.\n\n\nLeadership struggles\nThe PAC has been beset by infighting and has had numerous changes of leadership since its transition to a political party. In 1996, Clarence Makwetu, who led the party in the 1994 elections, was removed on the basis of \"bringing the party into disrepute\".\nIn August 2013, the PAC elected Alton Mphethi as president, after previous leader Letlapa Mphahlele was expelled in May amidst allegations of attempting to cause division in the party, financial impropriety and poor quality leadership.\nA faction of the PAC continued to regard Mphahlele as leader. The matter was resolved in the courts, with Mpheti eventually being confirmed as party leader for the 2014 election.\nMpheti has since been charged with murder for the death of a Swazi national, Mthunzi Mavundla, and sentenced for R3 million school transport fraud.\nLuthando Mbinda was elected president at the 2014 congress in Botshabelo, while Letlapa Mphahlele was elected in July 2015 in Manguang. Mbinda claimed that Mphahlele's election was not valid, as he was not a valid member, while Mphahlele challenged his expulsion in court.\nThe Independent Electoral Commission suspended the party's statutory fund’s allocations until there was clarity about who led the party, and in October 2015 the high court confirmed that Mbinda was the recognised leader.\nConflict then arose between Mbinda and Chief Executive Officer Narius Moloto. Mbinda was subsequently charged by the PAC and later expelled for bringing the organisation into disrepute. Narius Moloto was elected party leader in December 2017.\nIn 2019, Mbinda opened two bank accounts and arranged for the Parliamentary Finance Department to pay monies owing to the PAC to these accounts. He handed himself over to the Hawks in 2021 and was convicted of fraud in 2025.\nInfighting continued after the 2019 elections, with leader Narius Moloto unilaterally dissolving the party's structures, a decision which was later set aside by the courts.\nIn August 2019, in Limpopo, one faction elected Moloto as leader, while a week later in Bloemfontein, another faction elected Mzwanele Nyhontso as leader. In October 2019, the Independent Electoral Commission recognised Nyhontso as the legitimate party leader.\nIn November 2020, speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise received notice that the PAC had expelled Nyhontso, and notified him that he had therefore lost his seat in parliament as the PAC's sole representative. The opposing faction got a court order in December 2020 to reinstate Nyhontso, pending a court order challenging his removal from the party.\nIn August 2021, the court confirmed that Moloto's election was invalid, confirming Nyhontso as president, and in September 2021 Nyhontso was again sworn in as the party's sole MP.\nIn 2024, Nyhontso was again the sole PAC elected MP. He joined the Government of National Unity as Minister of Land Reform and Rural Development after the ANC lost its majority in parliament.\n\n\nElection results\n\n\nNational elections\n\n\nProvincial elections\n\n\nMunicipal elections\n\n\nSee also\n\nAzanian National Youth Unity\nAzanian People's Liberation Army\nFreedom Charter\nHistory of South Africa\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWebsite of the Pan Africanist Congress\nAlternative Website of the Pan Africanist Congress\nPan Africanist Congress Publications Collection 1958-1995\nArchival Information can be found at the Borthwick Institute for Archives, University of York: Congress of South Africa",

    "text": "László Kövér (Hungarian: [ˈlaːsloː ˈkøveːr]; born 29 December 1959) is a Hungarian politician who is the current speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary. Under his capacity as speaker, he was also twice acting president of Hungary in 2012 after the resignation of Pál Schmitt, and again in 2024 after the resignation of Katalin Novák. \nA founding member of Fidesz since 1988, he served as Minister without portfolio for Civilian Intelligence Services during the first Viktor Orbán administration. He was appointed leader of the party in 2000, but resigned from his position the following year.\n\n\nCareer\n\nLászló Kövér was born in the town of Pápa and is a founding member of the Fidesz party. it is reported that even as late as the 1990s, he declared that he was a socialist and argued for the adjective “socialist” to be included in their student organization's (which later became Fidesz) name, which was eventually voted down by the majority, which included Viktor Orbán. He was an active participant in the Opposition Round Table discussions – a notable stage in the Hungarian transition – as well as of the tripartite political negotiations in 1989. A Member of Parliament since 1990, he is now the chairman of the Board of Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Union. He used to lead his political group in the National Assembly, and had chaired the Committee on National Security for two terms. He was minister without portfolio in charge of the Civil National Security Services during the first Orbán Cabinet. Shortly thereafter, he was elected as the President of Fidesz, a position he held until 5 May 2001.\nIn the 1996 to 2009 period, he was a member of the Board of the Hungarian Association for Civic Cooperation. A member of the Board of the Hungarian Association of International Children's Safety Service since 1990, he has been its president since 1994.\nHe was elected Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary on 22 July 2010. Kövér took the position on 5 August, after his predecessor, Pál Schmitt, replaced László Sólyom as President of Hungary.\nKövér has become acting president twice-following the resignation of Schmitt as president on 2 April 2012, Kövér became acting president of the Republic according to the Constitution of Hungary. The National Assembly has 30 days to elect a new president. One of the five deputy speakers of the parliament, Sándor Lezsák was commissioned to exercise the Speaker's rights and responsibilities. On 10 February 2024, Katalin Novák resigned due to scandal, prompting him to take this office once more. \nKövér was re-elected as speaker of the parliament on 6 May 2014, on 8 May 2018, and also on 2 May 2022.\n\n\nPersonal life\nHis paternal grandfather was a carpenter and also a member of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) and later of the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP), who had served in the army of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. The maternal ancestors belonged to the middle class. His maternal grandfather was a taxi driver. His parents were László Kövér, Sr. (1933–1993), a locksmith and Erzsébet Ábrahám (born 1939). His brother, Szilárd, is a jurist. László Kövér married in 1987, his wife is Mária Bekk, a secondary school teacher of history and ethnography. They have three children: Vajk (1988), Botond (1989) and Csenge (1994).\nAfter the 2006 parliamentary election, when Fidesz lost the elections for the second time, Kövér swore that he would not cut his hair until the party was once again able to form a government. After four years, when his party won a two-thirds majority of seats by gaining 52% of the votes, Kövér appeared with short hair in the inaugural session of the sixth parliamentary term on 14 May 2010. In January 2017, Kövér cut his iconic mustache, which became his trademark throughout his political career.\n\n\nControversial views, statements\nAccording to Czech newspaper Hospodářské noviny Kövér said about Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros Dams: \"When the Gabčikova-Nagymaros dam was built, the Slovak side has brutally changed the borders. The Hungarian state sought a legal rather than military solution, which it could have used in this situation.\"\n\nIn September 2013, László Kövér said in a radio interview that in the long run he could image parliament should give more executive and legislative power to the cabinet in order to more effective treatment on \"everyday challenges and enforce decisions through decrees, without the need to enact even the most detailed rules.\" He also told to Echo TV that parliament's current legislative method \"with unnecessary detail\" must be reformed, \"leaving the elaboration of details to the government and simultaneously allowing deputies more time to supervise the executive authority\". Both Hungarian Socialist Party and the E14–PM electoral alliance called on Kövér to resign because of these statements. Jobbik said \"Kövér's statement pointed to a return of the era of the people's republic.\"\nIn December 2015 he caused a furor with his conservative views on gender roles. His words \"we would like it if our daughters believed the highest level of self-actualization is to give us grandchildren\" caused a media storm and spawned memes on the internet.\nIn September 2019, during a summit devoted to Europe's demographic challenges, he suggested that childless people are \"not normal\" and stated that “having children is a public matter, not a private one”.\nIn April 2021, he claimed in an interview that “the Hungarian leftwing liberal opposition is part of a globalist, anti-national network” and that its representatives are “no different from Mátyás Rákosi or Ernő Gerő”. In November it was reported by the Hungarian investigative journalism outlet Direkt36 reported that Kövér had delivered a speech (which had been secretly recorded) when meeting Hungarian civil intelligence services at their private 30th anniversary event in February 2020, in which he claimed that the current opposition parties are \"the greatest national security threat to the country\", adding that “the other part of the political class is acting in the spirit of the political tradition of abandoning the state and of self-disparaging as a nation”, likening them to the Communists led by Béla Kun in 1919 and claiming that they are involved in a 'class war'.\n\n\nNyírő's reburial\nJózsef Nyírő was a popular Hungarian writer in the 1930s and 1940s, and a politician associated with fascism and antisemitism. In 2012, an attempt was made to move Nyírő's remains from Madrid, where his ashes were buried in 1953, to his birthplace Odorheiu Secuiesc in Transylvania. The reburial was originally planned for May 27, but the Romanian government banned the move. Prime Minister of Romania Victor Ponta said that Romania rejects paying tribute on its soil to people known for anti-Semitic, anti-Romanian and pro-fascist conduct. In place of the reburial a small ecumenical service for the writer took place.  The ceremony was attended by the leadership of the Jobbik party, and Hungary's State Secretary for Culture Géza Szőcs and speaker of the Hungarian Parliament László Kövér. Kövér complained that the Romanian government is \"uncivilized,\" \"paranoid,\" \"hysterical,\" \"barbaric,\" and that the people \"who had a son whose ashes were feared\" would be \"victorious.\" He announced that they will bury Nyírő one way or the other and that they had smuggled his ashes into the country. Government authorities searched vehicles to ensure the urn were not buried at the ceremony but its location still remains unknown.\nNobel Prize laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, in a letter to Kövér, said he was furious that Kövér had participated in a ceremony honoring a writer who was a loyal member of Hungary's World War II far-right parliament, an act he suggested reflected the authorities' willingness to gloss over the country's dark past. \"I found it outrageous that the Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly could participate in a ceremony honoring a Hungarian fascist ideologue,\" Wiesel wrote. In further protest, Wiesel rejected the Great Cross, a Hungarian government award that he received in 2004.\nKövér, in his answer letter to Wiesel stated, the American, British and Soviet generals in the Allied Control Commission determined the conclusion in 1945 and 1947, when they refused to extradite the exiled writer two times for the request of the contemporary Hungarian Communist Minister of the Interior, Nyirő was not a war criminal, nor fascist or anti-Semitic.\nHe also mentioned that Nicolae Ceauşescu's government treated Nyírő as a well-recognized writer and ensured pension for his widow in the 1970s. Kövér cited a Hungarian Jewish scientific review (the Libanon) and the newspaper stated that neither Nazi ideals nor anti-Semitism could be found in Nyírő's literary works. Nyírő, the Transylvanian-born Hungarian writer, deserves respect not because of his - although insignificant, but certainly tragically misguided - political activities but his literary works, according to Kövér.\nKnesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin told Kövér that he is not welcome in Israel saying that the government of Israel is \"shocked\" that he chose to participate in the event commemorating Nyírő. \"We are shocked by the reports that you chose to participate in an event commemorating anti-Semitic writer József Nyírő,\" wrote Rivlin, \"By so doing, you have openly proclaimed your identification with a man whose party, as part of the Hungarian leadership, cooperated with the Nazi murderers in the execution of their plan to annihilate the Jewish people.\" Rivlin also said: \"A person who took part in such a ceremony cannot participate in an event honoring a man like Raoul Wallenberg, a Righteous Gentile, a symbol of humanity, who saved Jews while risking his life, and who serves as an example of the fight against the Nazis and their collaborators, with whom you chose to identify.\"\n\n\nHomophobic comments\nIn a speech at the Budapest Metropolitan University pronounced on 15 May 2019, Kövér said that the desire of homosexual people to adopt children could be likened to paedophilia as \"both are interests into children\". Kövér's words were strongly condemned by centre-left opposition and LGBT associations: Tímea Szabó (Dialogue for Hungary) described the statement as \"shameful\", while independent MP Bernadett Szél accused Fidesz to \"court the far-right with no more inibitions\". The Democratic Coalition even described Kövér as \"a political criminal\" and stated that its MPs would no longer stand up to salute the Speaker as he enters the Assembly.\nKövér's words also received condemnation from the political scientist Zoltán Lakner and by the German ambassador in Hungary.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBiography on the Hungarian Parliament Website",

This has been taken as referring to Rabbi Ishmael, a third-generation Tanna and a leading figure of Merkabah mysticism. However, he could not have been a High Priest of Israel, as he was born after the Siege of Jerusalem and associated destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. An alternative attribution would be the earlier Tanna Ishmael ben Elisha, who lived through the Siege of Jerusalem. Although 3 Enoch contains several Greek and Latin words, the book appears to have been originally written in Hebrew.\n\n\nDate of composition\nThough 3 Enoch purports to have been written in the 2nd century, it was probably composed in or near Babylon, and its final redaction was likely completed in the 5th or 6th century. The oldest printed text of 3 Enoch appears to be the Derus Pirqe Hekalot. It covers 3:1–12:5 and 15:1–2, and it is dated by Arthur Ernest Cowley to around 1650. The name \"3 Enoch\" was coined by Hugo Odeberg for his first critical edition of 1928.\n\n\nContent\nThe name Sefer Hekhalot (Hekhalot meaning palaces or temples), along with its proposed author, places this book as a member of Hekhalot literature, a genre which overlaps with the Merkabah or \"Chariot\" literature. Although 3 Enoch does not contain Merkabah hymns, it contains many of the concepts found in other Merkabah texts. It also has a unique layout and adjuration. All these facts make 3 Enoch unique not just among Merkabah writings, but also within the genre of Enochian literature. Several indications suggest that the writers of 3 Enoch were familiar with the content of 1 Enoch (an apocalyptic text dating to the Second Temple period).\nSome points that appear in 1 Enoch and 3 Enoch are:\n\nEnoch ascends to Heaven in a “storm chariot” (3 Enoch 6:1; 7:1)\nEnoch is transformed into an angel (3 Enoch 9:1–5; 15:1–2)\nEnoch is enthroned in Heaven as the exalted angel Metatron (3 Enoch 10:1–3; 16:1)\nEnoch receives a revelation of cosmological secrets of creation (3 Enoch 13:1–2)\nThe story about precious metals and how they will not avail their users and those that make idols from them (3 Enoch 5:7–14)\nHostile angels named 'Uzza, 'Azza, and 'Azael challenge Enoch before God (3 Enoch 4:6) and are mentioned again in passing (5:9)\nThe main themes running through 3 Enoch are the ascension of Enoch into Heaven and his transformation into the angel Metatron. This Enoch, whose flesh was turned to flame, his veins to fire, his eye-lashes to flashes of lightning, his eye-balls to flaming torches, and whom God placed on a throne next to the throne of glory, received after this heavenly transformation the name Metatron.\n\n\nCanonicity\n3 Enoch is not included in the biblical canon of any denomination of Judaism or Christianity.\n\n\nSee also\n1 Enoch\n2 Enoch\nPrimary texts of Kabbalah\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography",

    "text": "Ben's Game is a video game about fighting cancer. The game was conceptualised in 2003 by Ben Duskin—an 8 year old American boy in remission from leukemia—and was published by the Make-A-Wish Foundation in 2004.\n\n\nPlot\nWith a child patient as the hero miniaturized to microscopic level adventuring inside the child's own body, the object is to destroy all cancer cells and to collect the seven shields against common side effects of chemotherapy. Each shield is guarded by a \"monster\"—an incarnation of one of those side effects. The game was designed so that the player character never loses or dies.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay can be described as a three-dimensional version of Asteroids, but instead of a ship, the player character is the child patient on a hoverboard. The left and right arrow keys spin the direction of the ship, the up arrow accelerates and the down brakes. There are 4 weapons available: Sword, Crossbow, Blaster and Missile, each of them having different types of projectiles. The player also has built-in ammo.\nThe game objective is to destroy all of the mutated cells. In addition, there are seven shields. Each shield protects against one of the common side effects of chemotherapy and is guarded by a \"monster\" that represents that side effect. The seven monsters and side effects are as follows: Iceman monster (colds), Robarf monster (vomiting and nausea), Big Chicken monster (chicken pox), Fire monster (fever), Vamp monster (bleeding), Qball monster (hair loss), and the Tornado monster (rash.) The player's ammunition consists of health (which comes from a hospital), ammo (which comes from a pharmacy), and attitude (which comes from home.)\nThe game also features camera control and a two-player mode. There are 12 characters and 6 boards available, however, it has a character/board creation feature, as the textures (and their \"masks\", which are white silhouettes that cut the black area, leaving only the character image to be seen) are normal JPEG files that can be copied and edited, to make new characters and/or boards.\n\n\nDevelopment\nWhen interviewed by Make-A-Wish, Ben's wish was to design a video game in which cancer cells were eaten to help other children visualize fighting their cancer and help them to cope with cancer treatments. He remembered his oncologist telling him to think of chemotherapy as eating cancer cells. When Make-A-Wish first approached gaming companies - their requests to help create a cancer-fighting video game were denied. Make-a-Wish Executive Director Patricia Wilson was told that a video game would take upwards of US$1,000,000 and possibly years to create. Ms. Wilson sought the help of her Board of Directors and within days the request to fulfill Ben's wish was posted on several gaming sites. Inquiries and offers to assist began immediately from game designers in the UK, Israel, Canada and the United States. One particular offer came from a Bay Area game designer who offered to spearhead the entire game design on one condition: that he have a chance to meet and work with Ben directly. Eric Johnston, a software engineer from LucasArts met with Ben weekly for 6 months and together, they created Ben's Game. Ben's own pediatric oncologist served as medical adviser for the game upon condition that UCSF Children's Hospital be the first medical facility to have the game installed for children to play.\nThe game was launched in May 2004 and as of September 2009, the game has been downloaded over 300,000 times by people all over the world.\nBen's Game is freeware, available for Mac and Windows systems, and is multilingual (with support for 9 languages.) The game was made available online for free download for a period of time.\nDuskin and Johnston were awarded the \"Unsung Hero of Compassion\" by the Dalai Lama on 6 November 2005.\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 2007 another wish child, Jericho Rajninger, was inspired by Ben and Ben's Game and decided to use his wish to help other children as well. Jericho's wish, J.R. the Robot, delivers medication to children in the hospital.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBen's Game Archived 2016-09-05 at the Wayback Machine  Make-a-Wish\nBen's Game at MobyGames",

    "text": "A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below (or above) a certain age.\nModern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.\nPlaygrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball.\nPublic playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use.\nA playscape is a type of playground that is designed to provide a safe environment for play in a natural setting.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nNineteenth-century playgrounds\nThrough history, children played in their villages and neighbourhoods, especially in the streets and lanes near their homes. The painting Children's Games (1560) shows children playing in multiple ways in the streets and fields of an imaginary Dutch townscape.\nIn the 19th century, developmental psychologists such as Friedrich Fröbel proposed playgrounds as a developmental aid, to imbue children with a sense of fair play and good manners. In Germany, a few playgrounds were erected in connection to schools. In the 1840s in Britain, the Home and Colonial Infant School had a playground for pupils that included climbing structures, seesaws and parallel bars.  \nThomas Carlyle called for the establishment of public playgrounds within industrial cities such as Manchester, England, in Past and Present (1843), saying that \"every toiling Manchester\" ought to have \"a hundred acres or so of free greenfield, with trees on it, conquered, for its little children to disport in\". The first purpose-built public playgrounds were subsequently created in 1846 in Peel Park in Salford and Queen’s Park and Philips Park in Manchester.\nLater in the 19th century, the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association (1882) became an important advocate for children's playgrounds in London, in part at least to provide a steady supply of healthy and strong working-class children for the army, navy and factories. One of the first playgrounds in the United States was built in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in 1887.\n\n\nTwentieth century playgrounds\n\n\nPlaygrounds in Britain\nThe engineer and philanthropist Charles Wicksteed became an important advocate of children's playgrounds from the 1920s. He manufactured robust equipment, including swings, slides and other playground equipment. The National Playing Fields Association also promoted playgrounds across the middle of the century - one of its founding aims was to 'secure proper playgrounds for children' - which in their mind equated to manufactured equipment. \nIn post war London, pioneering designers, charities and child advocates, including Lady Allen of Hurtwood, popularised the concept of the ’junk playground’ - where children played with rubble, built structures and invented their own entertainment. 'Bombsites and waste ground were transformed into hives of activity by children and progressive educationalists.' Allen campaigned for play facilities for children growing up in the new high-rise developments in Britain's cities and wrote a series of illustrated books on the subject of playgrounds, and at least one book on adventure playgrounds, spaces for free creativity by children, which helped the idea spread worldwide.\n\nIn 2019, there were more than 26,000 children's playgrounds in the UK.\n\n\nPlaygrounds in North America\nOver the course of the 20th century, the street increasingly lost its role as the default public space for children's play and became planned for use by motor cars and momentum built to remove children from the new dangers and confine them to segregated areas to play. Organisations such as the National Highway Protective Society highlighted the numbers killed by automobiles, and urged the creation of playgrounds, aiming to free streets for vehicles rather than children's play. The Outdoor Recreation League provided funds to erect playgrounds on parkland, especially following the 1901 publication of a report on numbers of children being run down by cars in New York City.\n\nIn tandem with the new concern about the danger of roads, educational theories of play, including by Herbert Spencer and John Dewey inspired the emergence of the reformist playground movement, which argued that playgrounds had educational value, improved attention in class, enhanced physical health, and reduced truancy. Interventionist programs such as by the child savers sought to move children into controlled areas to limit 'delinquency'. Meanwhile, at schools and settlement houses for poorer children with limited access to education, health services and daycare, playgrounds were included to support these institutions' goal of keeping children safe and out of trouble.\nIn 1906 the Playground Association of America was founded and a year later Luther Gulick became president. It later became the National Recreation Association and then the National Recreation and Park Association. Urging the need for playgrounds, former President Theodore Roosevelt stated in 1907:\n\nCity streets are unsatisfactory playgrounds for children because of the danger, because most good games are against the law, because they are too hot in summer, and because in crowded sections of the city they are apt to be schools of crime. Neither do small back yards nor ornamental grass plots meet the needs of any but the very small children. Older children who would play vigorous games must have places especially set aside for them; and, since play is a fundamental need, playgrounds should be provided for every child as much as schools. This means that they must be distributed over the cities in such a way as to be within walking distance of every boy and girl, as most children can not afford to pay carfare.\n\n\nPlaygrounds in the Soviet Union\n\nPlaygrounds were an integral part of urban culture in the USSR. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were playgrounds in almost every park in many Soviet cities. Playground apparatus was reasonably standard all over the country; most of them consisted of metallic bars with relatively few wooden parts, and were manufactured in state-owned factories. Some of the most common constructions were the carousel, sphere, seesaw, rocket, bridge, etc.\n\n\nDesign\n\nPlayground design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience. Separate play areas might be offered to accommodate very young children. Single, large, open parks tend not to be used by older schoolgirls or less aggressive children, because there is little opportunity for them to escape more aggressive children. By contrast, a park that offers multiple play areas is used equally by boys and girls.\n\n\nEffects on child development\n\nProfessionals recognize that the social skills that children develop on the playground often become lifelong skill sets that are carried forward into their adulthood. Independent research concludes that playgrounds are among the most important environments for children outside the home. Most forms of play are essential for healthy development, but free, spontaneous play—the kind that occurs on playgrounds—is the most beneficial type of play.\nExciting, engaging and challenging playground equipment is important to keep children happy while still developing their learning abilities. These should be developed in order to suit different groups of children for different stages of learning, such as specialist playground equipment for nursery & preschool children teaching them basic numeracy & vocabulary, to building a child's creativity and imagination with role play panels or puzzles.\n\nThere is a general consensus that physical activity reduces the risk of psychological problems in children and fosters their self-esteem. The American Chief Medical Officer's report (Department of Health, 2004), stated that a review of available research suggests that the health benefits of physical activity in children are predominantly seen in the amelioration of risk factors for disease, avoidance of weight gain, achieving a peak bone mass and mental well-being.\nExercise programmes \"may have short term beneficial effects on self esteem in children and adolescents\" although high-quality trials are lacking.\nCommentators argue that the quality of a child's exercise experience can affect their self-esteem. Ajzen TPB (1991) promotes the notion that children's self-esteem is enhanced through the encouragement of physical mastery and self-development. It can be seen that playgrounds provide an ideal opportunity for children to master physical skills, such as learning to swing, balance and climb. Personal development may be gained through the enhancement of skills, such as playing, communicating and cooperating with other children and adults in the playground.\nControlled risk in play at a playground helps children develop skills to assess physical risk and can reduce injury later in life.\nChildren have devised many playground games and pastimes. But because playgrounds are usually subject to adult supervision and oversight, young children's street culture often struggles to fully thrive there. Research by Robin Moore concluded shown that playgrounds need to be balanced with marginal areas that (to adults) appear to be derelict or wasteground but to children they are areas that they can claim for themselves, ideally a wooded area or field.\nFor many children, it is their favorite time of day when they get to be on the playground for free time or recess. It acts as a release for them from the pressures of learning during the day. They know that time on the playground is their own time.\nA type of playground called a playscape can provide children with the necessary feeling of ownership that Moore describes above. Playscapes can also provide parents with the assurance of their child's safety and wellbeing, which may not be prevalent in an open field or wooded area.\n\n\nFunding\n\nIn the UK, several organisations exist that help provide funding for schools and local authorities to construct playgrounds. These include the Biffa Award, which provides funding under the Small Grants Scheme; Funding Central, which offers support for voluntary organisations and social enterprises; and the Community Construction Fund, a flagship programme by Norfolk County Council.\n\n\nSafety\nSafety, in the context of playgrounds, is generally understood as the prevention of injuries. Risk aversion and fear of lawsuits on the part of the adults who design playgrounds prioritizes injury prevention above other factors, such as cost or developmental benefit to the users. It is important that children gradually develop the skill of risk assessment, and a completely safe environment does not allow that.\nSometimes the safety of playgrounds is disputed in school or among regulators. Over at least the last twenty years, the kinds of equipment to be found in playgrounds has changed, often towards safer equipment built with plastic. For example, an older jungle gym might be constructed entirely from steel bars, while newer ones tend to have a minimal steel framework while providing a web of nylon ropes for children to climb on. Playgrounds with equipment that children may fall off often use rubber mulch on the ground to help cushion the impact.\nPlaygrounds are also made differently for different age groups. Often schools have a playground that is taller and more advanced for older schoolchildren and a lower playground with less risk of falling for younger children.\nSafety discussions do not normally include an evaluation of the unintended consequences of injury prevention, such as older children who do not exercise at the playground because the playground is too boring.\nSafety efforts sometimes paradoxically increase the likelihood and severity of injuries because of how people choose to use playground equipment. For example, older children may choose to climb on the outside of a \"safe\" but boring play structure, rather than using it the way the designers intended. Similarly, rather than letting young children play on playground slides by themselves, some injury-averse parents seat the children on the adult's lap and go down the slide together. This seems safer at first glance, but if the child's shoe catches on the edge of the slide, this arrangement frequently results in the child's leg being broken. If the child had been permitted to use the slide independently, then this injury would not happen, because when the shoe caught, the child would have stopped sliding rather than being propelled down the slide by the adult's weight.\nAlso concerning the safety of playgrounds is the material in which they are built. Wooden playgrounds act as a more natural environment for the children to play but can cause even more minor injuries. Slivers are the main concern when building with wood material. Wet weather is also a threat to children playing on wooden structures. Most woods are treated and do not wear terribly fast, but with enough rain, wooden playgrounds can become slippery and dangerous for children to be on.\n\n\nRegulation\nIn the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American National Standards Institute have created a Standardized Document and Training System for certification of Playground Safety Inspectors. These regulations are nationwide and provide a basis for safe playground installation and maintenance practices. ASTM F1487-07 deals with specific requirements regarding issues such as play ground layout, use zones, and various test criteria for determining play ground safety. ASTM F2373 covers public use play equipment for children 6–24 months old. This information can be applied effectively only by a trained C.P.S.I. A National Listing of Trained Playground Safety Inspectors is available for many states. A Certified Playground Safety Inspector (CPSI) is a career that was developed by the National Playground Safety Institute (NPSI) and is recognized nationally by the National Recreation and Park Association or N.R.P.A. (Some information sources offer interactive examples of playground equipment that violates CPSC guidelines.)\nIn Australia, Standards Australia is responsible for the publication of the playground safety Standards AS/NS4422, AS/NZS4486.1 and AS4685 Parts 1 to 6. The University of Technology Sydney is responsible for the training and accreditation of playground inspectors. The Register of Playground Inspectors Australia lists all the individuals who have been certified to inspector playgrounds within Australia.\nEuropean Standards EN 1177 specifies the requirements for surfaces used in playgrounds. For each material type and height of equipment it specifies a minimum depth of material required. EN 1176 covers playground equipment standards. In the UK, playground inspectors can sit the examinations of the Register of Play Inspectors International at the three required levels - routine, operational and annual. Annual inspectors are able to undertake the post-installation inspections recommended by EN 1176.\n\n\nPrevention strategies\nBecause the majority of playground injuries are due to falls from equipment, injury prevention efforts are primarily directed at reducing the likelihood of a child falling and reducing the likelihood of a severe injury if the child does fall. This is done by:\n\nreducing the maximum fall height of equipment, primarily by reducing the overall height of anything a child might climb on or into;\nreducing the likelihood of falling from equipment, through using barriers, discouraging climbing, and making upper surfaces inconvenient or uncomfortable for climbing or sitting on; and\ninstalling a more flexible surface under and around play equipment, so that a child who falls is less likely to break a bone.\nHow effective these strategies are at preventing injuries is debated by experts, because when playgrounds are made from padded materials, children often take more risks.\n\n\nPlayground injury\n\nEach year in the United States, emergency departments treat more than 200,000 children ages 14 and younger for playground-related injuries. Approximately 156,040 (75.8%) of the 1999 injuries occurred on equipment designed for public use; 46,930 (22.8%) occurred on equipment designed for home use; and 2,880 (1.4%) occurred on homemade playground equipment (primarily rope swings).\n\nPercentage of injuries involving public equipment\nAbout 46% occurred in schools.\nAbout 31% occurred in public parks.\nAbout 10% occurred in commercial childcare centers.\nAbout 3% occurred in home childcare.\nAbout 3% occurred in apartment complexes.\nAbout 2% occurred in fast food restaurants.\nAbout 9% occurred in other locations.\nFrom January 1990 to August 2000, CPSC received reports of 147 deaths to children younger than 15 that involved playground equipment.\n\n70% of those deaths occurred in home\n30% of those deaths occurred in public use\nGirls were involved in a slightly higher percentage of injuries (55%) than were boys (45%).\nInjuries to the head and face accounted for 49% of injuries to children 0–4, while injuries to the arm and hand accounted for 49% of injuries to children ages 5–14. Approximately 15% of the injuries were classified as severe, with 3% requiring hospitalization. The most prevalent diagnoses were fractures (39%), lacerations (22%), contusions/abrasions (20%), strains/sprains (11%).\nFor children ages 0–4, climbers (40%) had the highest incidence rates, followed by slides (33%). For children ages 5–14, climbing equipment (56%) had the highest incidence rates, followed by swings (24%). Most injuries on public playground equipment were associated with climbing equipment (53%), swings (19%), and slides (17%).\nFalls to the surface was a contributing factor in 79% of all injuries. On home equipment, 81% were associated with falls.\nIn 1995, playground-related injuries among children ages 14 and younger cost an estimated $1.2 billion.\nOn public playgrounds, more injuries occur on climbers than on any other equipment. On home playgrounds, swings are responsible for most injuries.\nPlaygrounds in low-income areas have more maintenance-related hazards than playgrounds in high-income areas. For example, playgrounds in low-income areas had significantly more trash, rusty play equipment, and damaged fall surfaces.\n\n\nUnintended consequences\nAs a result of what some experts say is over-protectiveness driven by a fear of lawsuits, playgrounds have been designed to be, or at least to appear, excessively safe. This over protectiveness may protect the playground owner from lawsuits, but it appears to result in a decreased sense of achievement and increased fears in children.\nThe equipment limitations result in the children receiving less value from the play time. The enclosed, padded, constrained, low structures prevent the child from taking risks and developing a sense of mastery over his or her environment. Successfully taking a risk is empowering to children. For example, a child climbing to the top of a tall jungle gym feels happy about successfully managing the challenging climb to the top, and he experiences the thrill of being in a precarious, high position. By contrast, the child on a low piece of equipment, designed to reduce the incidence of injuries from falls, experiences no such thrill, sense of mastery, or accomplishment. Additionally, a lack of experience with heights as a child is associated with increased acrophobia (fear of heights) in adults.\nThe appearance of safety encourages unreasonable risk-taking in children, who might take more reasonable risks if they correctly understood that it is possible to break a bone on the soft surfaces under most modern equipment.\nFinally, the playground that is designed to appear low-risk is boring, especially to older children. As a result, they tend to seek out alternative play areas, which may be very unsafe.\nRisk management is an important life skill, and risk aversion in playgrounds is unhelpful in the long term. Experts studying child development such as Tim Gill have written about the over-protective bias in provision for children, particularly with playgrounds. Instead of a constructed playground, allowing children to play in a natural environment such as open land or a park is sometimes recommended; children gain a better sense of balance playing on uneven ground, and learn to interpret the complexity and signals of nature more effectively.\n\n\nTypes\n\nPlaygrounds can be:\n\nBuilt by collaborative support of corporate and community resources to achieve an immediate and visible improvement to the neighborhood.\nPublic and free of charge, typically found at elementary schools\nConnected to a business and for customers only, such as those at McDonald's, IKEA, and Chuck E. Cheese's\nCommercial enterprises charging an entrance fee, such as Discovery Zone.\nNon-profit organizations for edutainment as children's museums and science centers; some charge admission, some are free.\n\n\nInclusive playgrounds\nUniversally designed playgrounds are created to be accessible to all children. There are three primary components to a higher level of inclusive play:\n\nphysical accessibility;\nage and developmental appropriateness; and\nsensory-stimulating activity.\nSome children with disabilities or developmental differences do not interact with playgrounds in the same way as typical children. A playground designed without considering these children's needs may not be accessible or interesting to them.\nMost efforts at inclusive playgrounds have been aimed at accommodating wheelchair users. For example, rubber paths and ramps replace sand pits and steps, and some features are placed at ground level. Efforts to accommodate children on the autism spectrum, who may find playgrounds overstimulating or who may have difficulty interacting with other children, have been less common.\n\n\nNatural playgrounds\n\n\"Natural playgrounds\" are play environments that blend natural materials, features, and indigenous vegetation with creative land forms to create purposely complex interplays of natural, environmental objects in ways that challenge and fascinate children and teach them about the wonders and intricacies of the natural world while they play within it.\nPlay components may include earth shapes (sculptures), environmental art, indigenous vegetation (trees, shrubs, grasses, flowers, lichens, mosses), boulders or other rock structures, dirt and sand, natural fences (stone, willow, wooden), textured pathways, and natural water features.\n\n\nThemed and educational playgrounds\nSome playgrounds have specific purposes. A traffic park teaches children how to navigate streets safely. An adventure playground encourages open-ended play, sometimes involving potentially dangerous objects such as fire or hand tools. An obstacle course or ropes course is designed to focus participants' attention on accomplishing a predetermined challenging physical task. A trampoline park provides trampolines.\n\n\nPlaygrounds for adults\n\nChina and some countries in Europe have playgrounds designed for adults. These are outdoor spaces that feature fitness equipment designed for use primarily by adults, such as chin-up bars.\nPlaygrounds for older adults are popular in China. Seniors are the primary users of public playgrounds in China. These playgrounds are usually in a smaller, screened area, which may reduce the feeling of being watched or judged by others. They often have adult-sized equipment that helps seniors stretch, strengthen muscles, and improve their sense of balance. Similar playgrounds for adults have been built in other countries. Berlin's Preußenpark for example is designed for people aged 70 or higher.\n\n\nSee also\nBuddy bench\nChin-up bar\nChildren's street culture\nChildren Youth and Environments Journal\nCold War playground equipment\nHome zone/Play street\nPlayground game\nPlayground song\nPlayground Surfacing\nPlayscape\nPlaytime\nPlaywork\nRecess (break)\nRubber Mulch\n\n\nReferences\n\nAjzen, I.

While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below (or above) a certain age.\nModern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development.

Kidby threw second stones for the Kyle George rink in 2005, and they would win the 2005 Canadian Junior Curling Championships and the 2005 World Junior Curling Championships on top of their provincial junior title. Kidby won a second junior title in 2008 throwing second stones for Brennen Jones. That team lost in a tie-breaker at the 2008 Canadian Junior Curling Championships.\nAfter juniors, Kidby moved to Alberta to play lead for the Chris Schille rink out of Edmonton. In 2010, Kidby and Schille joined the Don Walchuk rink with Kidby throwing second stones. That arrangement lasted one season before Kidby moved back to Regina to play second for Braeden Moskowy. In 2012, Schille moved to Saskatchewan to play on the team, as did former Albertan Brock Virtue who would skip, bumping Moskowy to third. Schille would move to second while Kidby moved to the lead position.\nKidby played in his first Alberta men's provincial championship with Walchuk in 2011. The team did not fare well, winning just two matches. After moving back to Saskatchewan, Kidby would play in his first Saskatchewan men's provincial championship in 2012 with Moskowy. That team also did not fare well, winning just one match. However, the new lineup at the 2013 SaskTel Tankard would fare much better. The team lost just two matches en route to their first provincial title. They would go on to represent Saskatchewan at the 2013 Tim Hortons Brier.\nKidby's first season on the World Curling Tour was in 2008-09 with Schille. The team played in one Grand Slam event, the 2009 Players' Championships, where they lost all three matches. The next season, the team again played in just one Grand Slam, this time it was the 2010 BDO Classic Canadian Open, where they again went win less, going 0-5. The next season, with Walchuk, Kidby would play in two slams, the 2010 The National (December), where the team would make it to the quarterfinals, and the 2011 BDO Canadian Open of Curling (January), where the team lost in a tie breaker match. Kidby's next Grand Slam event was at the 2012 Canadian Open of Curling playing lead for Kevin Koe, whose normal lead was absent due to personal matters. At that event, the team lost in the quarterfinals.\nOutside of Slams, Kidby has been on two teams that have won WCT bonspiels.

    "text": "Carlos Francisco Chang Marín or Changmarín (February 26, 1922 – December 5, 2012) was a Panamanian folklorist, painter, musician, journalist, activist and writer of poetry, essays and children's literature.\nHis writing, which has been described as close to the people's voice, portrays the class struggle and the search for social justice of his countrymen and working class people of the world. His work usually mixes descriptions of the Ibero-American countryside and simple life beauty with naive humour and optimism with proletarian revolution conclusions and tone. This makes his work very popular among the intellectual middle classes and the working classes, specifically the campesinos (countryside people), who identify themselves with Changmarín's personality and language. Changmarín was himself born and raised in the countryside of Panama.\nPolitically persecuted in the past, Changmarín's contributions to Panamanian culture and folklore added to his internationally recognized talent and forced otherwise antagonistic institutions such as the government to recognize his achievements. He has won several national awards (see Awards below).\n\n\nBiography\nChangmarín was the artistic name used by Carlos Francisco Chang Marín, which comes from merging both of his surnames (from his paternal surname \"Chang\" and maternal surname \"Marin\"). It expresses his mixed (Chinese and Creole) heritage.\nChangmarín was born in Los Leones, Santiago de Veraguas, Panama, being the second son of an out-of-wedlock union between Carlos Chang, a rich, Chinese-Panamanian merchant, and Faustina Marin, a campesina. He grew up among his mother's family, being unable to be acknowledged in public by his father under the conservative values of Panama's countryside of the early 1920s. However, later his father decided to take him from his mother when he was still a child and sent him to live with a paternal aunt. His aunt was brutally abusive, treating him basically as a slave, constantly humiliating his mixed heritage and his mother's social status. The father, although not participating in the abuse, provided no protection from it and even promoted this behavior in some cases.\nIt is not known when Changmarín left his aunt's house, but he went to Panama City, where he did a series of odd jobs. One of these jobs included working at the Panama Canal under the supervision of U.S. managers, where he witnessed the unfair and abusive conditions between the U.S. personnel and the non-U.S. workers. This added to similar experiences he had had while living with his aunt, who belonged to the richer sector of her hometown. He became determined to establish his proletarian struggle visions and political activism.\nChangmarín returned to formal education at the Juan Demostenes Arosemena Normal School (founded in 1938). He was mentored by intellectuals from South America and Europe, most of whom were victims of European fascism, which helped to consecrate and refine his ideals. He also undertook brief studies in the Panama National Conservatory of Music, which he did not complete.\nBetween 1940 and 1950, Changmarín worked as a teacher in several provinces, where he organized the student movement in strikes to denounce key issues regarding the country's social problems. This resulted in his being fired from his post.\nDuring this period, he was incarcerated several times, but this did not stop him from working in several jobs while in prison. He estimates that he spent some four years of his life behind bars. After being in and out of prison under political charges, Changmarín was finally exiled to Chile in 1968. While living there, he studied painting at the Universidad National de Chile and became very active in the Salvador Allende presidential campaign.\nOnce he was allowed to return to Panama, Changmarín established himself in several leadership and organizational roles within the Communist movement. He continuously worked in his artistic endeavours to deliver social and cultural messages. During this period resulted he was nationally recognized as one of the persons responsible for the Panama Canal struggle against the United States.  This struggle ended with the United States returning the operational control of the Canal Zone, which used to be forbidden for Panamanians.\nUntil his death from stomach cancer, Changmarín lived in his birth town of Santiago de Veraguas with his companion Eneida Romero.  He continued to write, paint and participate in political and ecological commentary and activism. The couple had five children, with four of these still living. In addition, it is well known that Changmarín had a passion for nature in general, with a predilection for orchids.\n\n\nWritings\nAs one of the main Panamanian writers, his work in literature is prolific. During his career, Changmarín has touched on different genres and styles.\n\n\nPoetry\nChangmarín started writing poetry by the time he was in high school(Juan Demóstenes Arosemena Normal School), mentored at that early period of his artistic life by South American and European teachers, the latter mainly being expatriated victims of the fascist Spanish Franquism. While still in college, he received an honored mention for his participation in the 1942 Ricardo Miró National Awards with a submission of a book containing poetry entitled Punto e' llanto.\nAt this stage, his work was considered to be part of the Ibero-American's post-vanguardists Second World War authors according to several scholars. Being under the vanguardist influence, his poetry developed a tone of despair with a very obvious revolutionary intent.\nDimas L. Pitty, in his book Letra Viva, describes Changmarín's work as a creation where \"the art is not the reality, but reality's reflection as an artistic image, marked with the author's subjectivism and ideological views; it is also his fiction\".\nAs a writer, poetry is basically Changmarín's fundamental tool of expression. Once established as a consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (Corporeal Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Miró National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmarín showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmarín leaves out as much as possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver the social and political messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.\n\n\nShort stories\nChangmarín's short story collections are quite numerous and touch upon several themes and scopes. He tries to recreate the countryside storytelling and atmosphere to expose the problems concerning land ownership and exploitation suffered by the countryside people. The latifundia is still very common in Ibero-America. It is endorsed by the government, religious as well as right-wing policy-makers (who generally represent the rich sectors of the society) and transnational corporations.\nAs are most of his works, the short stories are highly political in nature, describing and portraying historical events, as seen in his compendium Noche Buena Mala. Here, stories are related to the events of the 1989 U.S. Military invasion of Panama in (December 20, 1989).\nWhen not being used as a way to deliver and expose political, historical and eco-humanistic paradigms, his short stories have been described to be highly emotional and profoundly radical in form. An example of this is his work Seis Madres, possibly being the most researched and analyzed of his works in this genre. It has been described as written by bursts of raw emotions; an anti-story, and as the first Panamanian short story that could be used to formulate a theory regarding the creative writing process.\n\n\nNovels\nChangmarín has published three novels. He mainly writes in a historical narrative style which has been praised by critics for its attention to detail in the description of the physical frame (flora, fauna, geography) as well as the cultural frame. Changmarín alluded to Victoriano Lorenzo in almost all his larger works for adults and children in an effort to place him as a founding father of Panama. To Chang Marín, Lorenzo was the first true Panamanian whose life story and identity parallel that of Panama as a nation.\nHis latest novel, targeted mainly to young readers, Las Gracias y las Desgracias de Chico Perico (2005), had a more autobiographical approach.\n\n\nChildren's literature\nHaving published several books dedicated to reach the youth, Changmarín tries to deliver his social messages in order to promote human sensibilities and awareness to all ages. Through children's literature, he takes advantage of his pedagology formation by using a profound knowledge of the popular and simple art and language.\nUsing attractive illustrations (hand-drawn by himself) and a short-chapter format to ease the interest of young readers, Changmarín has published in several fields, from poetry to history books. Many scholars consider his children's literature works an expression of his tender side without losing his message and they place many of his works in this area as jewels of Panamanian literature.\nPart of his creation in this field is inspired by his own experiences as a child and by the constant interaction with his own grand and great-grandchildren, to whom most of these books have been dedicated.\nHighly recognized in this area are his poems Las Tonadas y los Cuentos de la Cigarra (1975) and La Muñeca de Tusa (2001) and the novels El Cholito Que Llegó a General (1978) and Las Gracias y las Desgracias de Chico Perico (2005).\n\n\nEssays\nChangmarín's works in the field of essays concentrate on the folkloric, artistic, historical and political areas. Many of his essays have been published in international magazines and newspapers.\nMost of his political essays deal with the relations between the United States of America's policies toward the Panama Canal and Panama in general, as well as its economic models and the impact these have in the region.\nAs a strong proponent of socialism, Changmarín's conclusions portray a critical view to the current international policies of the United States and other pro-globalization countries and organizations such as World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\n\n\nJournalism\nAs a journalist, Changmarín has a long history contributing with commentaries and opinions appearing in several Panamanian and international newspapers, especially the Cuban newspaper Granma. He is highlighted among several others (Milciades Amores C, Mario Riera Pinilla, Alejandro Chock Valdés, Gonzalo Castro, René González and Eustolio Darío Him) as a pioneer of the Prensa Chica (\"small press\") movement in Panama, with his participation in El Cholo newspaper.\nFor several years, he had his own newspaper column, Las Famosas Cartas a Tula (The famous letters to my Aunt Tula), in one of the most widely circulated newspapers, La Critica.  His column was popular due to his humorous approach to contemporary problems.\nParallel to his contributions to the mainstream media, Changmarín founded and directed the weekly bulletin Unidad, an information bulletin publication for the Panamanian Communist Party.\n\n\nMusic\nIn the field of music, Changmarín has produced a long list of compositions, both in writing lyrics and creating the musical arrangements. One of his best-known creations comprise the lyrics for Tio Caiman, made famous by the Chilean group Quilapayún. The piece has also been recorded in Colombia, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Panama by several music groups. The piece is sometimes sung by spectators in soccer matches and performed at music concerts across Ibero-America. Changmarín is hardly known as the creator, but this is a credit that he does not pursue. The Panamanian Birthday Song, recorded by the DEXA orchestra directed by Edgardo Quintero, is also one of his creations and is considered to be a unique contribution to the Panamanian culture and identity.\nAnother of his records is Alma Panameña, which was produced as part of the cultural development programs of the European Union and PROAPEMEP.\n\n\nDécima\nChangmarín is a broadly recognized décima composer in Panama. His interest in this field is related to his folklore research and he has been promoting the recognition of this form of expression of the countryside people for more than half a century. As the main coordinator for the Veraguas delegations in the Mejorana National Festival (since 1950), he has become a one-man cultural institution in this art form.\nChangmarín is the only Panamanian décima composer who published three books dealing with décima composition as well as décimas compilations. The books Socabón, Décimas Populares para Cantar (1959), Los Versos del Pueblo (1973) and  Cantadera, 130 Décimas para Cantar (1995) have been used as references and inspiration to generations of décimas performers.\n\n\nActivism\n\n\nPolitical\nChangmarín's political activism reached an important moment in his life with the foundation of the Panamanian Communist Party (Partido del Pueblo) in 1950. Since communism was outlawed at that time by Panamanian law, this initiative was forced to be conducted secretly. The Panamanian government reacted to the growing dissent and communist organization in the countryside by increasing repression, reaching the extremes of perpetrating political assassinations and disappearances.\nChangmarín used his writings as his main weapon for resistance. For years, he used politically charged décimas as means to educate the people about identity and the struggle at hand. Que se vayan del Canal (I wish they would just leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Maíz (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States.\nHis clear and direct writing form serves as a tool for the constant struggles and protests that were taking place in Ibero-America during the 1970s and 1980s. The décima, having a bard-like effect as an artistic expression and Changmarín having mastered the form, managed to merge it with the social angst-ridden echoes of the dispossessed and the nationalist feelings of the people to \"incense a protest in each fist and a march in each step\".\n\n\nEcological\nChangmarín was a strong proponent of an environmental-friendly way of life and critic of the consumer-oriented free market and industrialization. Having a strong emotional connection with the countryside environment, he actively participates in radio shows commentaries about the topic.\nMoreover, he expressed an integrated relationship between culture and nature, rejecting the industrial Western concept of progress, instead promoting the philosophy of simple life. Although he never openly endorsed Anarcho-Primitivism, there are clear correlations between his views and the movement.\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nPoetry\nRomance de la Niña Perdida\nPunto ‘e llanto (1942)\nPoemas Corporales (1956)\nSocabón.

    "summary": "Carlos Francisco Chang Marín or Changmarín (February 26, 1922 – December 5, 2012) was a Panamanian folklorist, painter, musician, journalist, activist and writer of poetry, essays and children's literature.\nHis writing, which has been described as close to the people's voice, portrays the class struggle and the search for social justice of his countrymen and working class people of the world. His work usually mixes descriptions of the Ibero-American countryside and simple life beauty with naive humour and optimism with proletarian revolution conclusions and tone. This makes his work very popular among the intellectual middle classes and the working classes, specifically the campesinos (countryside people), who identify themselves with Changmarín's personality and language. Changmarín was himself born and raised in the countryside of Panama.\nPolitically persecuted in the past, Changmarín's contributions to Panamanian culture and folklore added to his internationally recognized talent and forced otherwise antagonistic institutions such as the government to recognize his achievements. He has won several national awards (see Awards below).",

The 1929 version survives and unrestored copies are available on unofficial DVDs and streaming services.\n\n\nPlot\nDuring the First World War, a British officer - David Compton - on leave from the trenches in Paris falls in love with and has a liaison of three days with a French performing artist: Deloryse/Lola. He proposes to her and tells her to get ready for the wedding in an hour. He rushes to search for the English church. On the way he meets his superior, who tells him that he has to report immediately, they have to leave Paris. He doesn't even have the time to see his fiancé again.\nAfter returning to fight on the front, he suffers from shell shock and forgets everything that happened in the last four years. After recovering he goes back to his wealthy life of rich industrialist, marries a British Socialite, with whom he runs entirely separate lives. She is the one to invite Deloryse to London to dance on one of her charity events. While dancing and singing on the stage she sees him in a loge. During her second number, where she sings the same song of when he met her in Paris, he finally has a flash back of the song and the singer. After the performance he sends her a notice that he wants to see her. She is excited, but when Doctor Gavron visits her, he measures her pulse and tells her, that she has to give up the stage, as the strain might kill her, even if she dances once more. Then David comes. He meets her and his son Davey. But he is now married to a British Socialite: Vesta Compton, who never wanted children, to the big regret of her husband. \nHe tells his wife, that he wants to adopt a boy. She doesn't want to know anything about it. His wife tells him that she will never give him a divorce. Lola wants then to give his son to David's wife, as she understands that there is no future for her and David, but Vesta refuses. Then David wants to stay with Lola and his son and take all the consequences. They plan to leave for Paris that evening, as Davey has his birthday the next day. But Vesta comes to see Lola \"from woman to woman\" and to tell her that she would ruin David socially, if she lives with him without having him divorced. She gives up little David to bring him to his home. Afterwards she has a breakdown.\nSoon afterwards she has to perform again for another of Vesta's charity events and visits her sleeping son a last time. When she dances and falls dead at the end, they find out she will never dance again, she dies.\n\n\nCast\nBetty Compson as Deloryse / Lola\nGeorge Barraud as David Compton\nJuliette Compton as Vesta Compton\nMargaret Chambers as Florence\nReginald Sharland as Hal\nGeorgie Billings as Davey Compton\nWinter Hall as Doctor Gavron\n\n\nMusic\nThe film featured a theme song entitled \"Sunshine Of My Heart\"\nwith words and music by Jay Whidden and Fred May.

    "text": "Ladislau \"Loți\" Iosif Bölöni (Hungarian: László József Bölöni; born 11 March 1953) is a Romanian professional football manager and former player.\nAfter starting out at ASA Târgu Mureș, Bölöni became an integral part of the Steaua București team that won the European Cup in 1986, making it the only Romanian team—and one of two Eastern European sides—to have achieved the honour. He was twice named Romanian Footballer of the Year and took part in 484 Divizia A games, the fourth-most appearances in the history of the competition. Internationally, Bölöni earned 102 caps with the national team, which ranks him fifth in the nation's all-time list, and scored 23 goals, the sixth highest all-time mark. He is thus considered one of the best Romanian footballers in history.\nFollowing his retirement as a player, he went on to coach clubs in France, Portugal, the Arabian Peninsula, Belgium and Greece. Bölöni was also at the helm of the Romania national team between 2000 and 2001. In terms of trophies won, his most successful stints were at Sporting CP and Standard Liège, with three domestic honours each.\n\n\nClub career\n\nBölöni was born in Târgu Mureș, Romania, into an ethnic Hungarian family from Târnăveni. His first team was Chimica Târnăveni, and in 1970 he moved to ASA Târgu Mureș. He stayed there until 1984, when he joined Steaua București, where he was part of the team which won the 1986 European Cup Final (where he missed his penalty in the shootout) and the European Super Cup the following year.\nBölöni remained at Steaua until 1987. In 1988, aged 35, Bölöni left the country to play in Belgium at Racing Jet Wavre, and then in France at Créteil. He retired from professional football in 1992. On 25 March 2008, he was decorated by Romanian president Traian Băsescu with Ordinul \"Meritul Sportiv\" — (The Order \"The Sportive Merit\") class II, for his part in winning the European Cup in 1986.\n\n\nInternational career\nBölöni won the Universiade gold medal with Romania's students football team in the 1974 edition that was held in France, playing alongside Gheorghe Mulțescu, Dan Păltinișanu, Romulus Chihaia and Paul Cazan.\nPlaying for the Romania national team in 1983, Bölöni scored one of his most notable goals, in the 1–0 win against Italy in a Euro 84 qualification match, which eventually proved invaluable to the country's qualification for the tournament. At the finals themselves in France, he played in all three of Romania's games, and scored the equaliser in the 1–1 draw with Spain at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. In total, Bölöni won 102 caps for Romania and scored 23 goals—or 108 caps and 25 goals if the Olympic games qualification is included.\n\n\nManagerial career\nAs a football coach, Bölöni started with French club Nancy, where he was head coach for several years. He promoted with the team in Division 1. In 2000, he was appointed as national team coach, but in the summer of 2001 decided to leave the job.\nThen he joined Portugal's club Sporting CP, where he won both the Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal in his first year. He was fired at the end of the next season due to mediocre results. His legacy at Sporting was the introduction of youth team players such as Ricardo Quaresma, Hugo Viana and Cristiano Ronaldo into the senior's team starting lineup. In 2002, he aimed to solve the club's financial problems by bringing in Lyon forward Tony Vairelles on loan in exchange for Lyon having first option to sign Ronaldo and Quaresma, but the French club had no interest in the players.\nIn 2003, he returned to France as manager of Rennes. In 2005, he managed the team to their best position in history (4th in Ligue 1), and a subsequent UEFA Cup qualification.\nIn May 2006, Bölöni signed a two-year contract with Monaco, but was fired on 23 October for lack of results. Monaco were 19th out of 20 in the league.\nOn 9 June 2008, Belgian team Standard Liège appointed Bölöni as their new manager, as he succeeded Michel Preud'homme, who led the club to their first Belgian First Division title in 25 years (season 2007–2008). On 24 May 2009, he won the Belgian First Division title in his first season at Standard (season 2008–2009) after playing the championship play-off against Anderlecht.\nOn 10 February 2010, Bölöni resigned from his coaching position at Standard Liege.\nOn 29 May 2010, it was officially announced that Bölöni signed a contract with Emirati club Al Wahda. On 2 September 2010, Al Wahda sacked Bölöni, despite the team's 3–1 win over Ittihad Kalba.\nOn 2 January 2011, he was hired by Lens, on a one-year contract, but he couldn't save the team from relegation. \nBölöni was immediately released in June, and signed a two-year contract with PAOK on 8 June 2011, following a short negotiation period.\n\n\nPAOK\nBölöni's tenure at PAOK started with two wins against Vålerenga for the Third Qualifying Round of 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, that brought them against Karpaty Lviv for the Play-off round. PAOK won the first leg at home and drew the second leg, qualifying for the group stage. In a tough group that consisted of Tottenham Hotspur, Rubin Kazan and Shamrock Rovers, Bölöni's PAOK managed to qualify undefeated at the first place, winning the game at White Hart Lane on the process, a remarkable feat considering that no Greek team had won at English soil since 1999, when PAOK defeated Arsenal at Highbury. For the round of 32, PAOK faced Udinese, and although a 0–0 draw at the first game in Italy spread optimism, a weakened PAOK side was eliminated off the competition when the home leg ended with a 0–3 defeat. All and all, the European presence was positive despite the abrupt end, as PAOK managed six wins out of twelve games, with impressive performances and a milestone win against Tottenham.\nAt the home front, PAOK had a turbulent season, as the team managed to finish third in regular season, with 5th being its final position after Play-off. During the season, PAOK won the away games against AEK Athens and Panathinaikos, marking the end of a winless, ten-year-old tradition against those teams when playing away from home. The team's form was inconsistent though, and the departure – due to the club's financial difficulties – of two of the most significant players of the team, Vieirinha and Pablo Contreras, didn't help matters. Bölöni had to improvise to cover for the roster's lack of depth, with mixed results. Although the season was not deemed successful, fans didn't put the blame on Bölöni, who had won their hearts with his personality, his results against some major opponents and the team's style of play when on good form.\nOn 25 May 2012, PAOK released Bölöni, after a one-year cooperation.\n\n\nCoaching in the Middle East\nBölöni was hired by Qatari club Al Khor on 21 June 2012. On 26 January 2013, in a league match against Qatar SC, he was involved in a controversial incident. He threw a water bottle at a ball boy behind the goal after the boy took the ball, which went out of play, off the pitch. The bottle did not hit the boy, however, it was spotted by the match observer, Ali Al-Naimi, who relayed the information to a referee's assistant who eventually informed the referee, Fahad Jaber, who decided to send him off. Instead of going directly to the stands, he chose to illegally stay within the checkpoint. Security officers attempted to guide him off, but he retorted by using foul language and pushing the police officers. As a result, a police report was filed against him. He was later fined 75,000 Qatari riyals by the QFA and banned for 5 matches.\nIn August 2013, Croatian media speculated that Bölöni might be named the new head coach of Dinamo Zagreb, following the sacking of team's former head coach, Krunoslav Jurčić. Bölöni had previously been linked with Hajduk Split, Dinamo Zagreb's fierce rival, as well.\nOn 21 July 2015, Saudi club Al Ittihad announced Bölöni as their new coach.\n\n\nRoyal Antwerp\nOn 16 June 2017, Bölöni was announced as the new manager of Belgian club Royal Antwerp. In his first season at the club, he finished eighth place in the regular season, and third place in the Europa League play-off group, to keep the team safe from relegation.\nIn his second season, Antwerp was the surprise package of the championship, finishing the regular season on sixth place, and qualifying for the championship play-offs for the first time. Antwerp recorded important victories over Genk (1–0), Anderlecht (2–1), Gent (2–1), Standard Liège (2–1), as well as a blank draw with Club Brugge in the first half of the play-off, and climbed on the 3rd place, but later losses to these teams meant Antwerp finished fourth, thus going for the Europa League play-offs final. In the final, Antwerp beat Charleroi 3–2 after coming back from 0-2 down in the first minutes. Thus, Antwerp secured qualification in the third qualifying round of UEFA Europa League after 26 years of absence from Europe.\nAfter surprisingly knocking out Viktoria Plzeň on away goals in the third round, Antwerp stopped short of the group stages, as they were subsequently knocked out by AZ in the play-offs. Internally, Bölöni led the team to another fourth-place finish in the league, as well as the Belgian cup final in the 2019–20 season, their first since 1992. However, the competition was postponed until 1 August, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Bölöni's contract subsequently expired on 20 May, leading his successor Ivan Leko to manage the team for the final.\n\n\nGent\nOn 20 August 2020, Belgian League runners-up Gent announced Bölöni as their new head coach. In September, he was sacked after only three games in charge.\n\n\nPanathinaikos\nOn 19 October 2020, Bölöni was announced as the new head coach for Greek club Panathinaikos. He drew his first game 1–1 against Volos in the Super League. On 10 May 2021 Boloni was, for the second time this season, sacked, this time by the Greens after failing to guide them to a European qualification spot; he was replaced by Ivan Jovanović on 24 May.\nThroughout January 2022, Bölöni was in talks with Romanian Football Federation president Răzvan Burleanu to return as manager of the Romania national team, more than twenty years after leaving the job. The failed negotiations led to the appointing of Edward Iordănescu instead.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhen Bölöni was 15, his father died of a stroke while watching him play from the stands. His father's death strongly affected him, but Bölöni was persuaded by his mother to continue playing football. She moved from their native city Târnăveni to Budapest sometime later in her life. During his time at Steaua București, Bölöni also worked as a dentist for six years; his daughter followed in his footsteps, and studied implantology in France.\nIn 2021, he was hired by the Nemzeti Sport daily to analyze Hungary's matches at the UEFA Euro 2020, and in the same year revealed his support of the Székely Land football team. Nevertheless, after failed negotiations to take charge of the Romania national team in 2022, Bölöni expressed his regret for not being able to represent his country again.\nBölöni holds Romanian, Hungarian and French nationalities. He acquired French nationality by naturalization on 7 July 1998.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\n\n\nInternational\n\nScores and results list Romania's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Bölöni goal.\n\n\nManagerial statistics\nAs of match played 2 June 2024\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nPlayer\nASA Târgu Mureș\n\nDivizia B: 1970–71\nBalkans Cup runner-up: 1973\nSteaua București\n\nDivizia A: 1984–85, 1985–86, 1986–87\nCupa României: 1984–85, 1986–87\nEuropean Cup: 1985–86\nEuropean Super Cup: 1986\nIntercontinental Cup runner-up: 1986\nRomania\n\nBalkan Cup: 1977–80\nIndividual\n\nRomanian Footballer of the Year: 1977, 1983, (runner-up): 1976, 1986, (third place): 1985, (fourth place): 1982, 1987,\n\n\nCoach\nNancy\n\nDivision 2: 1997–98\nSporting CP\n\nPrimeira Liga: 2001–02\nTaça de Portugal: 2001–02\nSupertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 2002\nAl Jazira\n\nGulf Club Champions Cup: 2007\nStandard Liège\n\nBelgian First Division: 2008–09\nBelgian Super Cup: 2008, 2009\nAl Khor\n\nGulf Club Champions Cup runner-up: 2013\nIndividual\n\nBelgian Manager of the Year: 2009\n\n\nSee also\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\n\n\nReferences",

It is situated in the center of the capital, on Sejongno, a main road that cuts through the capital city of the Joseon Dynasty. The center took 4 years to complete, opening in 1978. It was \"built as a cultural center for Seoulites\". It currently contains one of the biggest pipe organs in Asia.\n\n\nHistory\nAfter the Seoul National Hall was destroyed by fire in 1972, the construction of a venue to continue the cultural heritage of that structure was proposed. Construction began in 1974, and it completed on April 14, 1978. In 1999, the center was placed under control of a foundation.\nThe center's design was based on a fusion of Korean national symbols and the western architectural designs. The name \"Sejong\" is from the 4th ruling king of the Joseon Dynasty, Sejong the Great.\nOn 23 September 2012, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started on a trial basis, a 550-m designated section of Sejong-ro as pedestrian-only but permitted for cyclists. The section includes the road from the Gwanghwamun three-way intersection, along Gwanghwamun Plaza in front of the Sejong Center to the Sejong-ro intersection.\n\n\nFacilities\n\n\nMain Auditorium\nThe \"Big\" Theater as it is called in Korean, is a technologically advanced theater. It opened in 1999 to show Shim Hyung-rae's Yonggary and has a capacity for 3,000 people and is the biggest Theater at the country.\n\n\nMinor Hall\nCalled The \"Small\" Theater in Korean, is constructed in an interesting style over 2 floors, and can seat 442 people, the stage can allow for 100 people on performance.\n\n\nArts Forum Galleries\nMain Gallery: The Arts Forum is a large room (1,056 m2) that is divided into 4 separate rooms for viewings of different sizes and numbers.\nNew Gallery: The New Gallery is a (594 m2) place for artwork that excels in  the social, popular and cultural side of Korean art.\nGwang Hwa Moon Gallery: Originally part of the 5th Line Subway Metro System, it houses artworks that are considered to be outstanding by the youth and new up-and-coming artists. Considered to be an example of Subway Art Galleries.\n\n\nGwang Hwa Rang\nThe Gwang Hwa Rang is situated underneath the Sejong-ro crossroads, it opened on February 17, 2005, with complete free access to pedestrians and art-discerning Seoulites. It includes a window-gallery that enable by-passers on ground level to peek inside.\n\n\nSejong Convention Center and Hall\nThe Convention Center and Hall is usually used for big events and conferences. With a size of 627 m2, it can house around 400 people. It is available for many different events. It includes 250 translating systems that interprets five different languages simultaneously. The convention hall has a smaller size convention center that is used for similar purposes and is able to accommodate 120 people.\n\n\nSam Chung Gak\nMeasuring in 19417m², Sam Chung Gak is a collaboration of six traditional Korean Housings.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=3195463",
    "text": "Köln was a light cruiser, the third member of the Königsberg class that was operated between 1929 and March 1945, including service in World War II. She was operated by two German navies, the Reichsmarine and the Kriegsmarine. She had two sister ships, Königsberg and Karlsruhe. Köln was built by the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven; she was laid down in August 1926, launched in May 1928, and commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 15 January 1930. She was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm SK C/25 (5.9-inch) guns in three triple turrets and had a top speed of 32 knots (59 km/h; 37 mph).\nLike her sister ships, Köln served as a training ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during the latter part of the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1943, when she returned to Germany in order to be decommissioned as decreed by Hitler after the failure of the Kriegsmarine in Operation Regenbogen; Köln returned to service in 1944, escorting Germans ships to Norway and laying mines. In March 1945, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained on an even keel, with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n\nDesign\n\nKöln was 174 meters (571 ft) long overall and had a beam of 15.2 m (50 ft) and a maximum draft of 6.28 m (20.6 ft). She displaced 7,700 long tons (7,800 t) at full load. The ship had a forecastle deck that extended for most of the length of the ship, ending just aft of the superfiring rear turret. Her superstructure consisted of a conning tower forward with a heavy, tubular mast and a secondary conning tower further aft. Köln had a crew of 21 officers and 493 enlisted men.\nHer propulsion system consisted of four steam turbines and a pair of 10-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines. Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine-type, double-ended, oil-fired water-tube boilers, which were vented through a pair of funnels. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of 32 knots (59 km/h; 37 mph) and a range of approximately 5,700 nautical miles (10,600 km; 6,600 mi) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). \nThe ship was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm (5.9 in) SK C/25 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets. One was located forward, and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft. The rear gun turrets were offset to increase their arc of fire. They were supplied with 1,080 rounds of ammunition, for 120 shells per gun. The ship was also equipped with two 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns in single mounts; they had 400 rounds of ammunition each. Köln also carried four triple torpedo tube mounts located amidships; they were supplied with twenty-four 50 cm (20 in) torpedoes. She was also capable of carrying 120 naval mines. The ship was protected by an armor deck that was 40 mm (1.6 in) thick amidships and an armor belt that was 50 mm (2 in) thick. The conning tower had 100 mm (3.9 in) thick sides.\n\n\nService history\n\nKöln was ordered as \"Cruiser D\" under the contract name Ersatz Arcona, as a replacement for the old cruiser Arcona. The keel for Köln was laid on 7 August 1926 at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven. She was launched on 23 May 1928, and commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 15 January 1930, the last member of her class to be completed. She spent the year conducting sea trials and training in the Baltic Sea. In 1930, she was modified with two dual 8.8 cm SK C/25 anti-aircraft guns to replace the original single mounts, the rear superstructure was enlarged, and a fire control system for the anti-aircraft guns was installed aft. These new guns were unsatisfactoy and were replaced with three pairs of 8.8 cm SK C/32 in 1931. One SL-1 stabilized anti-aircraft fire control director was also installed. Köln departed on a cruise into the Atlantic in early 1932 for more extensive sea trials. After returning to Germany, she took on her first crew of naval cadets for a world cruise, departing Germany in late 1932. The tour lasted a full year; she stopped in ports across the globe, including in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea. In Australia the tour stops included Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart, with the crew taking place in several publicised football games against local teams that included a Royal Australian Navy team in Sydney.\nIn 1935, the ship had an aircraft catapult installed, along with cranes to handle float planes. A pole mast was also installed on the rear side of the aft funnel. Köln continued to serve as a training ship until early 1936, when she was transferred to fishery protection duty. Later that year, she joined the non-intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War. After the German heavy cruiser Deutschland was attacked by Republican bombers in the so-called \"Deutschland incident\", Köln transported wounded crew members from Deutschland back to Germany. Köln conducted a further four patrols off Spain before returning to fishery protection in the North Sea in 1938. Late in the year, she went into drydock for a refit in Kiel.\nIn March 1939, Köln sailed to Memel (now Klaipėda, Lithuania), in connection with the annexation of the Memelland district, which Germany had demanded be returned by Lithuania. Later in the year, she joined the battleship Gneisenau and the heavy cruisers Deutschland, Admiral Scheer, and Admiral Graf Spee for a major series of maneuvers in the Atlantic.\n\n\nWorld War II\n\n\n1939–1941\nIn the final days of August 1939, Köln was stationed in the western Baltic to prevent Polish vessels from fleeing after the planned German invasion of Poland on 1 September; she was unsuccessful in this task. Between 3 and 20 September she participated in laying the 'Westwall' defensive minefield in the German North Sea. Köln joined Gneisenau and nine destroyers for a sortie through the Kattegat and Skagerrak towards the Norwegian coast on 7 October. The goal was to feint a breakout into the Atlantic which would keep pressure on the British to continue convoying, and to relieve pressure from the raiding operation of the Admiral Graf Spee. The goal was also to draw the Home Fleet out of Scapa Flow and lure them into range of the Luftwaffe. The German force is found by British air reconnaissance on 8 April at the Norwegian south coast and promptly returns home, arriving on 10 October in Kiel. The Home fleet left Scapa Flow to intercept the German Force but did not find anything. A total of 148 German aircraft are deployed to attack the Home Fleet but they achieve nothing. The British launched an air attack consisting of 12 Wellington bombers, though it too failed to hit any of the German warships. The Home Fleet did not return to Scapa Flow so when U-47 penetrated the harbour defenses of Scapa Flow on 14 October to attack the Home Fleet, it found only the old battleship HMS Royal Oak lying at anchor.\n\nOn 20–22 November, Köln and the cruiser Leipzig escorted the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst on the first leg of their sortie into the North Atlantic. On the 22nd, Köln and Leipzig were detached to join an unsuccessful patrol for Allied merchant ships in the Skagerrak along with Deutschland and three torpedo boats. The patrol lasted until 25 November, and failed to locate any Allied freighters. On 13 December, Köln, Leipzig, and Nürnberg sortied into the North Sea under the command of vice-admiral Günther Lütjens in order to meet five destroyers returning from an minelaying operation off Newcastle and escort them home. The force was attacked at 10h45 by the British submarine HMS Salmon which scored a hit on both Leipzig and Nürnberg, and then the roles were reversed when the five destroyers had to escort the cruisers back to Germany.\nKöln took part in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway, in April 1940. She was assigned Group 3, tasked with the assault on Bergen, along with her sister Königsberg. She reached the harbor unscathed, but Königsberg was not so lucky; she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal guns. Köln nevertheless supported the German infantry ashore with her main guns. After the port was secured, she returned to Germany, along with a pair of destroyers. In late 1940, she went into drydock for further modifications. A degaussing coil was installed, along with a helicopter landing platform on top of turret \"Bruno\". She thereafter served as a testbed for the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter, a task she performed until 1942.\n\nWhile still conducting experiments with the FI 282 in September 1941, Köln became part of the Baltic fleet. which was assigned to guard the Baltic sea against a possible breakout of the Soviet fleet. On 23 September she left Swinemunde together with the battleship Tirpitz, the cruisers Admiral Scheer and Nürnberg, three destroyers and five torpedo boats. The fleet patrolled in the Sea of Åland and after the Soviet fleet was neutralized by the Luftwaffe in harbour, all ships returned to Gotenhafen by 29 September. As part of Operation Beowulf, Köln participated in a diversionary attack on the east coast of the Baltic island Dagö in the Gulf of Riga during the night of 12 October, so that German forces could land against a weakened defense on the south coast. On 13 October, the Soviet submarine Shch-322 tried to attack Köln, but the cruiser's escorts forced the Soviet submarine to break off the attack. The next day, Köln provided gunfire support to ground troops attacking Soviet positions on Ristna. Toward the end of 1941, she was transferred to the North Sea, and went into drydock for her last major modification. This consisted of the installation of a FuMO 21 radar set on the forward command center roof.\n\n\n1942–1945\nOn 9 July 1942, Köln and the destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt departed Kiel to join the growing naval presence in Norway. On their way to Kristiansand the ships laid a defensive minefield in the Skagerrak. Between 14 and 15 July Köln and the destroyers Friedrich Eckoldt, Z14 Friedrich Ihn and Z24 repeated the minelaying operation. On 17 July Köln and Friedrich Eckoldt arrived in Trondheim.\nOn 13 September, she and the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and Admiral Hipper and two destroyers moved from Narvik to Altafjord in preparation of Operation Doppelschlag, an attack on the Arctic Convoy PQ 18. While en route, the flotilla was attacked by the British submarine HMS Tigris, but the torpedoes passed behind the German ships. PQ-18 had an escort including an escort carrier, and ever since the near-torpedoing by aircraft of the British carrier HMS Victorious of the flagship of the German fleet, the battleship Tirpitz, Hitler was reluctant to risk his capital ships in an attack on a convoy and insisted the aircraft carrier be first disabled by the Luftwaffe before the ships could mount an action. As a consequence permission was not given for the flotilla to proceed with the operation, instead PQ-18 was attacked by U-boats and bombers, which sank thirteen freighters.\n\nThe next Arctic convoy JW 51B did not sail until end of December. As in the Arctic winter and darkness carrier escort was impossible, the Kriegsmarine was determined to attack the convoy in Operation Regenbogen, resulting in the Battle of the Barents Sea. The two available light cruisers Köln and Nürnberg did not participate in the battle as they were not considered full battle worthy. The German Navy failed to destroy JW-51B and was repulsed by the inferior British convoy escort. In the aftermath of that failed operation, a furious Hitler proclaimed that the Kriegsmarine's capital ships would be paid off and dismantled, and their guns used to reinforce the fortifications of the Atlantic Wall. Admiral Karl Dönitz persuaded Hitler to retain a battle group consisting of the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, and the heavy cruiser Lützow. But the light cruisers Köln and Leipzig and the damaged Admiral Hipper were to be decommissioned and the other cruisers were relocated to the training squadron.\nKöln left Altafjord on 23 January 1943 in company with Admiral Hipper and the destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen to return to Germany. The three ships stopped in Narvik on 25 January, and in Trondheim from 30 January to 2 February. After resuming the voyage south, the ships searched for Norwegian blockade runners in the Skagerrak on 6 February before putting into port at Kiel on 8 February. Köln was decommissioned in Kiel on 17 February. She was sent to drydock in early 1944 for an overhaul to prepare her to return to combat duty; this was completed by 1 July. The cruiser served briefly as a training ship before escorting German merchant vessels in Norway.\nOn the night of 13–14 December, Köln was attacked by British bombers in Oslofjord; several near misses caused damage to her propulsion system that required repair in Germany. She then proceeded to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again attacked by Allied bombers repeatedly. On 30 March, B-24 Liberators from the Eighth Air Force attacked the harbor; Köln was hit and sank on an even keel. Since her guns remained above water, the ship was used as an artillery battery to defend the city from advancing Allied forces. She served in this capacity until the end of the war in May. She was partially dismantled in situ after the end of the war, and finally raised in 1956 for scrapping.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\n\nBekker, Cajus (1971).

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15950977",
    "text": "From Sunday to Monday, February 21–22, 1971, a devastating tornado outbreak, colloquially known as the Mississippi Delta outbreak, struck portions of the Lower Mississippi and Ohio River valleys in the Southern and Midwestern United States. The outbreak generated strong tornadoes from Texas to Ohio and North Carolina. The two-day severe weather episode produced at least 25 tornadoes, and probably several more, mostly brief events in rural areas; killed 123 people across three states; and wrecked entire communities in Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the outbreak was an F5 that developed in Louisiana and crossed into Mississippi, killing 48 people, while the deadliest was an F4 that tracked across Mississippi and entered Tennessee, causing 57 fatalities in the former state. The former remains the only F5 on record in Louisiana, while the latter is the deadliest on record in Mississippi since 1950. A deadly F4 also affected other parts of Mississippi, causing 13 more deaths. Other deadly tornadoes included a pair of F3s—one each in Mississippi and North Carolina, respectively—that collectively killed five people.\n\n\nBackground\n\nAt 12:00 UTC on February 21, 1971, surface weather analysis failed to indicate either a well-developed low-pressure area or a defined frontal boundary over the Gulf Coastal Plain, signs that would normally presage a severe weather outbreak. At the time, a diffuse warm front extended eastward from East Texas to portions of Mississippi, and a cold front extended southward over East Texas. Higher up in the atmosphere, conditions were \"close to ideal\" for a significant tornado outbreak: a broad trough imparted substantial divergence over the prefrontal warm sector.\n\n\nImpact\nActivity started early on the morning of February 21. The first tornadoes touched down in Texas east of Austin and north of Waco. The main activity intensified during the afternoon over the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys until the late evening hours. At 15:55 UTC the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) in Kansas City, Missouri, issued a tornado watch for eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and adjoining portions of Tennessee and Alabama. A subsequent watch covered portions of eastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi, more than an hour before the first major tornado developed.\n\nThree violent, long-lived tornadoes—two of which may have been tornado families—in western Mississippi and northeastern Louisiana caused most of the deaths along 330 mi (530 km) of path. The first of the three long-lived violent tornadoes was an F5 that touched down in Louisiana and traveled continuously for 102–110 mi (164–177 km), followed by an F4 in Mississippi that produced continuous damage for 114.8 mi (184.8 km). A third, F4 tornado traveled 69–72+3⁄4 mi (111.0–117.1 km) through Little Yazoo, Mississippi, and near Lexington. The three violent tornadoes moved at up to 55 mph (89 km/h), and eyewitnesses reported more than 50 tornadoes or funnel clouds in the Mississippi Delta region alone, many of which were sightings of the same tornado. At one point, the National Weather Service (NWS) WSR-57, a type of weather radar, in Jackson, Mississippi, reported four simultaneous hook echoes that indicated tornado-producing supercells.\nAlthough authorities issued timely tornado warnings—with an average lead time of about an hour in the worst-hit areas—few homes in the area were well constructed, and many lacked basements or other safe areas, thus contributing to the large number of deaths. Many residents were reportedly aware of the danger but could not find shelter in time. As a result, the violent tornadoes killed entire families and caused as many as 21 deaths in some communities. Many of the dead were blacks who resided in frail structures. The entire outbreak may have killed 113–119 people and injured as many as 2,003 others. In Mississippi alone, tornadoes officially killed 110 people and injured 1,469; of these, 454 persons were hospitalized. Some sources listed 107 deaths and 1,060–1,514 injuries in Mississippi. Losses in the three states of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana totaled $19 million.\n\n\nOutbreak statistics\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\n\nThe actual total was likely considerably higher, especially over rural areas.\n\nOn February 21, between 15:25–15:35 UTC, a funnel cloud and possible tornado may have occurred during a severe thunderstorm at Athens, Henderson County, Texas. One resident reported a \"roaring\" noise like that of many freight trains, but a tornado was not believed to have developed.\nPrior to 1990, there is a likely undercount of tornadoes, particularly E/F0–1, with reports of weaker tornadoes becoming more common as population increased. A sharp increase in the annual average E/F0–1 count by approximately 200 tornadoes was noted upon the implementation of NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in 1990–1991. 1974 marked the first year where significant tornado (E/F2+) counts became homogenous with contemporary values, attributed to the consistent implementation of Fujita scale assessments. Numerous discrepancies on the details of tornadoes in this outbreak exist between sources. The total count of tornadoes and ratings differs from various agencies accordingly. The list below documents information from the most contemporary official sources alongside assessments from tornado historian Thomas P. Grazulis.\n\n\nFebruary 21 event\n\n\nFebruary 22 event\n\n\nDelhi, Louisiana/Inverness, Mississippi\n\nThis devastating, long-lived tornado was of F5 intensity in Louisiana and F4 in Mississippi. It first appeared aloft northwest of Crowville, Louisiana, at 2:50 p.m. CST (20:50 UTC) before finally touching down south-southeast of Delhi. Shortly after developing, the tornado moved northeastward at an average speed of 52 mph (84 km/h), striking the small community of Waverly. Along and northeast of U.S. Route 80, the tornado completely leveled a number of small homes at F5 intensity, though these may not have been well constructed. About 3 mi (4.8 km) east of Delhi, on a farmstead at Joes Bayou, it killed 10 people in a family of 12, five of whose bodies were thrown into nearby swamps and not located for weeks. It also destroyed a rural church, three nearby homes, and half a dozen large, overhead power lines, while downing trees. Afterward it mostly hit woods and farms for the rest of its trek in Louisiana, continuing northeastward. It struck the Melbourne settlement on Pecan Road, a short distance south of Transylvania, near Alsatia. At Melbourne the tornado destroyed a pair of mobile homes and seven homes. 13 other mobile homes, 11 outbuildings, and a mature pecan grove were severely damaged as well. Vehicles and agricultural implements were tossed about, but only minor injuries occurred. In all, the tornado killed 11 people and injured 18 others in Louisiana, though some sources do not list the eleventh fatality. After striking Melbourne, the tornado crossed the Mississippi River and entered Mississippi.\nOnce in Mississippi, the tornado passed near Mayersville in Issaquena County. As it did so, it began to slowly weaken in intensity, but restrengthened in Sharkey County and retained force hereafter. It killed two people near Cameta and destroyed a cotton gin near Nitta Yuma. It then devastated Delta City, killing eight people and destroying the entire community. At Delta City it destroyed 31 houses and most businesses, some of which it swept away. Continuing northeastward, it leveled farms and claimed four additional lives, including a few at Mound Lake Plantation, west of Isola. Afterward, it entered the town of Inverness as a large tornado, destroying an estimated 80–90% of the community, killing 21 people, and injuring 200 more. In town the tornado destroyed 125–153 homes, along with 40 other structures. 52 homes were badly damaged as well, 61 businesses were destroyed or damaged, and 30 outbuildings were destroyed on farms. The tornado destroyed the entire central business district, city hall, an elementary school, and the three largest churches. According to media, it also \"obliterated\" blocks of frail homes in the southwestern section of town, most of whose denizens were African Americans. Hundreds of people were left homeless, and railcars were tipped onto their sides. The tornado then leveled the northwestern side of Moorhead, killing four people there before ending near Schlater. In all, the tornado destroyed hundreds of homes along its path.\nIt is the only official F5/EF5 to have hit Louisiana since records began in 1950, the only F5/EF5 tornado to occur in the month of February, and the deadliest F5 tornado since March 3, 1966 (58 dead), though this was later eclipsed by an EF5 tornado on April 27, 2011, that killed 72 people. In 1984 and 1993 tornado researcher Grazulis rated it F4, but in 2001 accepted the official F5 rating; he also listed it as a tornado family, but a later study of aerial imagery revealed a continuous 104-mile (167 km) path. Estimates of the path length vary from 102 to 110 mi (164 to 177 km). Grazulis also found 400 injuries, while the NCEI tallied 510.\n\n\nCary–Pugh City, Mississippi\n\nThis, the deadliest and longest-lived of the three violent tornadoes, was likely a tornado family. It first touched down just east-northeast of Fitler, approximately 6–8 mi (9.7–12.9 km) southwest of Cary, and moved northeastward. Just south of Cary, the tornado destroyed the Evanna Plantation, killing 14 people there, hurling vehicles several hundred yards, scouring earth, and debarking trees. The tornado then struck southern Cary, leveling Bellgrade Quarter—a predominantly working-class, African-American neighborhood—and killing 13. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado struck Gooden Lake, killing seven people and wrecking 12 homes there. Near Belzoni it hit the Castleman community, leveling a manor there, and destroyed a few dwellings in northeastern Humphreys County. According to reports, the tornado then destroyed the Joe Regh Plantation at Pugh City, reducing frail, low-income, frame housing to \"splinters\", rolling farm machinery, and killing at least 21—and possibly up to 26—people; extensive wind-rowing occurred as well. The tornado left most of the 50 homes and several stores at Pugh City irreparable.\nIt then brushed southeastern Swiftown, destroying three homes, damaging other buildings, and killing two more people. Between Swiftown and Morgan City the tornado followed MS 7, tearing apart 35 dwellings. It then hit northwestern Morgan City, destroying about 12 homes and killing three (possibly six) people. Just west of Greenwood, near Fort Loring, it tossed a vehicle off U.S. 82, killing its two occupants. Four more deaths occurred near Money. The tornado may have weakened and reformed into a separate event that passed through or near Avalon, Oxberry, Cascilla, and Tillatoba, causing scattered damage in those communities. Isolated stands of mature trees and willows were twisted, splintered, or prostrated, and outbuildings on farms were damaged. Bits of roofing, insulation, and wallpaper were torn off in Tillatoba. This and the previous tornado closely paralleled each other, affecting several of the same counties. The tornado is the deadliest in Mississippi since 1950; however, the deadliest Mississippi tornado on record in the 20th century killed 216 people in 1936. Official data and Grazulis tabulated 58 deaths, but one of these was from the Inverness F5.\n\n\nLittle Yazoo, Mississippi\n\nThe final long-lived violent tornado of the outbreak destroyed barns and homes, including a guest house, near Bovina, as well as approximately 100 pecan trees. One home was obliterated, with only concrete blocks remaining on its foundation, and two people died of injuries. Afterward the tornado spent many miles over wooded areas. It then crossed I-20, destroying four chicken coops, a church, and three homes. Next, it passed through and destroyed Little Yazoo, where many homes, businesses, and a church were leveled and swept away, resulting in four fatalities. Beyond Little Yazoo, near Bentonia, it killed half a dozen more and destroyed additional homes. In all, in the Little Yazoo–Bentonia area it leveled 12 homes. It damaged or destroyed 72 homes in the Yazoo County communities of Midway, Benton, and Roadside. In Holmes County, it struck the community of Brozville, extensively damaging homes, barns, chicken coops, and sheds. It finally dissipated near Lexington. In all, it leveled many homes along the path. The NCEI counted 182 injuries, while Grazulis found 200. Estimates of the path length vary from 69–72+3⁄4 mi (111.0–117.1 km). Up to a few more deaths may have occurred as well.\n\n\nOther effects\nThe outbreak generated severe thunderstorm winds, from Texas to Kentucky and North Carolina; winds peaked at 50 kn (58 mph; 93 km/h) in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, on February 21. These strong winds damaged utility lines, vegetation, agricultural outbuildings, warehouses, porches, mobile homes, and barns. At least one built-up roof was partly torn off, along with tar paper. On February 21 at Athens, Henderson County, Texas, vigorous winds caused minor injuries to seven people, all of which took place in trailers. Roofing, a drive-in theater screen, and up to 500 television antennae were downed or otherwise damaged. Hail of up to 1+3⁄4 in (4.4 cm) in diameter was reported in Alabama and Ohio as well, including golfball-sized stones in Cambridge and Toledo, Ohio. The publication Storm Data noted that the hail in Ohio peaked at 1 in (2.5 cm) diameter.\n\n\nAftermath, recovery, and records\nAn internal assessment by the Mississippi Power and Light Company determined that its infrastructure incurred the greatest wind-related damage in the company's history. Roughly half of its transmission towers were damaged in both Sharkey and Humphreys counties. The entire outbreak is the second-deadliest ever in February, behind only the Enigma tornado outbreak in 1884 and ahead of the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak. February 21 was the fourth-deadliest day for tornadoes in Mississippi on record.\n\n\nSee also\nList of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks\nList of F5 and EF5 tornadoes\nTornado outbreak of March 24–27, 2023 – Similar deadly tornado outbreak in the Mississippi Delta\n2023 Rolling Fork–Silver City tornado – Crossed the same areas as the Inverness and Cary tornadoes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nAgee, Ernest M.; Childs, Samuel (June 1, 2014). \"Adjustments in Tornado Counts, F-Scale Intensity, and Path Width for Assessing Significant Tornado Destruction\".

    "summary": "From Sunday to Monday, February 21–22, 1971, a devastating tornado outbreak, colloquially known as the Mississippi Delta outbreak, struck portions of the Lower Mississippi and Ohio River valleys in the Southern and Midwestern United States. The outbreak generated strong tornadoes from Texas to Ohio and North Carolina. The two-day severe weather episode produced at least 25 tornadoes, and probably several more, mostly brief events in rural areas; killed 123 people across three states; and wrecked entire communities in Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the outbreak was an F5 that developed in Louisiana and crossed into Mississippi, killing 48 people, while the deadliest was an F4 that tracked across Mississippi and entered Tennessee, causing 57 fatalities in the former state. The former remains the only F5 on record in Louisiana, while the latter is the deadliest on record in Mississippi since 1950. A deadly F4 also affected other parts of Mississippi, causing 13 more deaths. Other deadly tornadoes included a pair of F3s—one each in Mississippi and North Carolina, respectively—that collectively killed five people.",

    "text": "Glamoč (Serbian Cyrillic: Гламоч) is a town and the seat of the Municipality of Glamoč in Canton 10 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated in southwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the foothills of Staretina and Velika Golija mountains, and on the edge of the central part of the Glamočko Polje.\n\n\nName\nDuring the Ottoman era the town was recorded as Biograd (White town), Belgradčik and Biogradaz.\n\n\nGeography\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Glamoč is classified as an oceanic climate (Cfb in Köppen climate classification system), near the boundary of the humid continental climate. Glamoč has four separate seasons. Summers are warm, and winters are cold, without a discernible dry season.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Glamoč area has been inhabited since at least Neolithic times. In the late Bronze Age, the Neolithic population was replaced by more warlike Indo-European tribes known as the Illyrians, specifically the Dalmatae. Their capital was Delminium, which was located in today's Tomislavgrad. The Dalmatae left many artefacts which allow us to learn about their presence in this area. The most important remains are the gradine, remains of Illyrian settlements which were distributed along the Glamoč field. 34 gradinas were found on the territory of Glamoč. The settlements were strategically placed for defence. The Romans took over 200 years to occupy this region.\nAfter the Roman conquest, municipia was established in this area, which was located in the Roman province of Dalmatia. The most important of them was Salvium, which was previously an Illyrian settlement. Salvium is located 6 km away from the town of Glamoč. An early Christian basilica was discovered on the territory of Salvium. It was built in the 6th century, probably on the remains of a Roman temple. North of Glamoč, a second basilica was built, probably at the same time as the aforementioned basilica in Salvium was built. These basilicas belonged to the diocese of Salona. In 533, they became part of the newly established diocese in Ludrum (Knin, Croatia). The basilicas were probably destroyed during the invasion of the Avars in 597.\n\nWith the collapse of Roman rule in the 5th century, first barbarian tribes and then the Byzantine Empire occupied this region. In the seventh century, South Slavs migrated to the Balkan region. They brought Slavic culture and customs which gradually merged with the Illyrian culture. The community was granted the status of parish (župa) in the County of Hlivno after Tomislav established the Kingdom of Croatia in 925. Therefore, the town, by the end of the 10th century, had developed all the infrastructure necessary for acquiring the status of the parish. In 1078 it was mentioned as a boundary parish of Archdiocese of Split.\nA church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary was built. Near the town, the church of St. Catherine and the Franciscan Monastery of St. Elias was built. Within the monastery, the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was located. The church was mentioned in 1446 when Pope Eugene IV commended it in particular. The remains of the  were found in several surrounding villages which indicates the dense population of the area. Bosnian ban Stjepan II Kotromanić conquered Glamoč and neighbouring towns, Hlivno (Livno) and Dlmno (Tomislavgrad) in 1326. Since then, this area has been called Tropolje, meaning three fields, or Završje. Until 1357, Glamoč was a possession of the Hrvatinić noble family.\nIn 1357, Bosnian ban Tvrtko I succumbed to Hungarian demands and ceded Tropolje to the Hungarian king Louis I the Great. That same year, Grgur Stjepanić was mentioned as Lord of Glamoč. He, along with other nobles of Tropolje, rebelled against Tvrtko, so Glamoč remained under Hungarian rule until 1387. In the meantime, Tvrtko was crowned as the King of Bosnia and with the help of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić he regained the area. At the end of the 14th century, Pavao Maštrović Klešić became Lord of Glamoč. Bosnian King Stjepan Ostoja took his lordship, but when he needed Pavao as an ally he returned it to him in 1404.\n\nGlamoč fell under Ottoman rule in the year 1515. In 1516, it was mentioned as a nahiye Dlamoč or Belgrad in the \nkadiluk of Neretva. It remained a part of the Bosnia Sanjak until 1537. In 1550 and 1574 it was recorded as a nahiye in the Skradin kadiluk in the Sanjak of Klis. After Klis was liberated in 1648, Glamoč became part of the Livno kadiluk.\nDuring the Ottoman period the town was called Biograd or Belgradčik. It was recorded under this name until 1833. A Venetian-Dalmatian source from the first half of the 17th century recorded that Biogradaz was a fortress with several towers. In the second half of the 18th century, it was noted that the town lies along the Dalmatian border, and that it is well fortified, but that it has little artillery. The fortress was abandoned in 1851 and partially demolished in 1882.\n\nIn 1878, with the Congress of Berlin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Glamoč, came under Austro-Hungarian rule. Complete annexation followed in 1908. Administratively, the town was located in the Travnik District. At that time, a significant number of Catholics, mostly from Dalmatia, immigrated, so the Catholic church of Saint Elias was built in 1903.\nAfter the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with Glamoč, became a part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and soon thereafter Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After the Vidovdan Constitution of 1921 established new administrative divisions, the town became part Travnik County. The country changed its name to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, and then Glamoč became part of a new administrative unit, Vrbas Banovina.\nOn 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly adopted the Proclamation of the Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 28 February 1992, the Constitution of Republika Srpska was adopted and declared that the state's territory included Serb autonomous regions, municipalities, and other Serbian ethnic entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Glamoč, where Bosnian Serbs were 79% of the population.\n\nIn early 1992, many Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats left Glamoč. Those who remained suffered at the hands of the Serb forces. An early victim was a Croatian physician, Dr Alojzije Kelava, who was murdered in the city centre on 24 February 1992 by Petar Vrakela, member of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). Shortly thereafter, Serbian forces started ethnic cleansing of the non-Serb population and the destruction of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian cultural and historical heritage. In 1992, the Catholic church, the rectory and the town's mosque were destroyed. The parish priest of Glamoč, Rev. Zvonimir Matijević, was arrested and taken to Knin prison where he was tortured.\nFrom Glamoč field, Serbs besieged and bombarded the nearby town of Livno. By early 1995, most of the non-Serb population had left the municipality. On 25 July 1995, HV and HVO began Operation Summer '95. In the next few days, a large part of the Serb population left Glamoč, led by the VRS. On 29 July, HVO troops attacking from the south captured the town.\nSoon, the area was inhabited by refugees from Republika Srpska and central Bosnia. Some remained in Glamoč. Meanwhile, some of the Croats and Bosniaks who had left Glamoč at the beginning of the war and Serbs who left Glamoč after the Croatian Army captured it have returned. After the signing of the Dayton Agreement, Glamoč became a municipality of Canton 10, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war has caused economic and demographic decline of the municipality. Large funds are dedicated in the reconstruction of destroyed infrastructure, but the area is still underdeveloped.\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\nEthnic composition\n\n\nNotable people\nMiroslav Čangalović, opera singer\nObrad Piljak, politician\nPavao Posilović, Roman Catholic bishop and writer\nSlavko Zagorac, retired footballer and manager\nStojan Srdić, writer\nTodor Petrović, footballer\nVule Trivunović, footballer\nZaim Topčić, writer\n\n\nOther\nIvo Lola Ribar, Yugoslav communist was killed near Glamoč by airstrike\n\n\nSee also\nGlamoč Fortress\nChurch of Saint Elias, Glamoč\nCanton 10\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",

    "text": "Esaias Henrik Wilhelm Tegnér Jr. ( teng-NAIR; Swedish: [tɛŋˈneːr]; 13 January 1843 – 21 November 1928) was a Swedish linguist. He was professor of eastern languages at Lund University 1879–1908, lead editor of Svenska Akademiens ordbok 1913–1919, member of the Bible Commission (writing a new translation) 1884–1917, and member of the Swedish Academy from 1882 onward. Tegnér was the grandson of the well-known poet Esaias Tegnér, also his namesake, and was brother-in-law to the poet and composer Alice Tegnér.\n\n\nBiography\nEsaias Tegnér's parents were Kristofer Tegnér, a provost and vicar, and Emma Sofia Tegnér (née Kinberg). He began studying at Lund in 1859, graduated with a PhD in 1865, and became a Docent in Semitic languages the same year. In 1872 he became an adjunct professor in comparative linguistics. He further studied linguistics in Stockholm beginning 1873, and joined the Scientific Society of Uppsala in 1876.\nIn 1879 Tegnér married Märta Maria Katarina (née Ehrenborg) who was herself born in 1859 in Linde, Gotland County. The same year he joined the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. He also became a member of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg in 1882, doctor of theology at Copenhagen in 1894, and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1896.\nTegnér is buried at Östra kyrkogården in Lund.\n\n\nIndo-European languages\nTegnér wrote just one journal article about the history of the Indo-European languages, De ariske språkens palataler (The palatals of the Aryan languages). It is an important work however, because he there suggests a solution to one of the most pressing questions in linguistics at the time. Between 1860 and 1880 three such problems were solved, represented by Grassmann's Law, Verner's law, and the palatalization law. Tegnér was one of several possible authors of the palatalization law, das Palatalgesetz, which describes a sound change in the Indo-Iranian languages. The discovery had important ramifications on the understanding of vowels in the Proto-Indo-European language.\n\n\nLanguage reform\n\n\nSpelling\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century there was a spelling debate between conservative members of the Swedish Academy and the \"new spellers\", led by Adolf Noreen. Esaias Tegnér would take a moderate position.\nThe spelling debate arose following the release of the first edition of Svenska Akademiens ordlista (Dictionary of the Swedish Academy) in 1874, before Tegnér had joined the academy. In this dictionary, new consideration was given to new spelling suggestions that had been received in 1869 and collected into 15 points in Artur Hazelius's manifesto Om svensk rättstafning (On correct Swedish spelling) (1870–71). The first edition however did not include these modifications, and instead used the traditional spellings, standardized by Carl Gustaf af Leopold since 1801.\nTegnér joined the debate with an essay in 1886. In that essay he suggested the morphological principle of spelling as an alternative to the phonetic spelling proposed by the reformers. This morphological principle suggested that morphemes should as much as possible be spelled the same. The principle was seen as a compromise, and the sixth edition of Svenska Akademiens ordlista in 1889 exhibited Tegnér's influence in several new spellings.\n\n\nBiblical language\nEsaias Tegnér was during 1884-1917 a member of the Bible Commission of 1773, created by Gustav III of Sweden, and was responsible for overseeing the linguistics of the new translation.\n\n\nFamily names\nIn his 1882 paper Om Sveriges familjenamn (On Sweden's family names) Tegnér studied elements of Swedish family names. He found that several endings were not used, although they were common in names of towns and places. Nobody had yet taken names ending in -hed, -lid, -myr, -näs, -rud, -ryd, -säter, -vad, -åker, -ås or -äng. In 1939 professor Jöran Sahlgren included these in his book Svensk namnbok (Swedish book of names), which was provided by the state to aid people seeking new names. During the 20th century they have been used as name elements in several new Swedish family names.\n\n\nBibliography\n\nDe nunnatione Arabica. (Gradualavhandling).

    "text": "Vučje (Serbian Cyrillic: Вучје) is a town in southern Serbia, located some 15km south from the city of Leskovac, its municipal seat. The population of the town is 2,553 people (2022 census). It is known for its archaeological site, Zelen grad, ruins of a medieval town.\n\n\nZelen grad\n\nZelen grad, also known as Skobaljić grad, was a medieval fortified town located on a cliff above Vučje. The locality itself is multi-layered: the oldest traces of settlements in this area go back to Chalcolithic age. Fragments of the ceramics found on the locality testify that it was also important during different phases of the Bronze Age, due to its location and defensiveness. The oldest stone fort dates back to pre-Roman times, while the layer built out of stone and bricks combined with mortar dates back to the early Byzantine ages. According to the archeological discoveries, the fortification was extensively used between the 10th and 13th centuries, to be refortified and expanded in the 15th century. Most of today's visible remains date back to that period. Nikola Skobaljić was governing the town at the time, thus the name Skobaljić grad.\nThe town consisted of upper town, lower town, and the suburb that expanded eastwards up to the Vučjanka river. Upper town's surface is around 400 square meters overall. It had two diagonally placed towers: one being the access tower towards the lower town, and the other being a large donjon tower in the northwestern corner. Surface of the lower town is believed to be as big as 1400 square meters. Based on the pottery found in the compound, as well as some preserved details of the fortification, indicates that the town had a significant importance during the times of Desa Vukanović, Stefan Nemanja, and his successors. The complex is located on steep rock, overgrown with tall trees, above a narrow terrain which is limited by a river. The town silhouette is barely spotted against the trees and terrain until in near immediate vicinity, so it is believed that it was a very well-defensible town. This may be one of the reasons why the town is called Zelen grad (Green town).\n\n\nHPP Vučje\nPhysicist and electrotechnician Djordje Stanojević, nicknamed \"the man who lit up Serbia\", organized construction of a hydro plant on the Vučjanka river in 1903. It was the second such facility in Serbia, after HPP \"Pod Gradom\" on the Đetinja river, near Užice, which became operational in 1900. Hydroelectric power plant \"Vučje\" was officially open on 24 December [O.S. 11 December] 1903, marking the date when Leskovac was liberated from the Ottomans in 1877, during the Serbian-Ottoman War from 1876 to 1878.\nThe financial funds were provided by the industrialists from Leskovac, who, instigated by Stanojević, founded the electrical stock company in 1901. For supplying the already industrialized Leskovac with electricity, the first electric power transmission line in Serbia was built, 17 km (11 mi) long. \"Vučje\" originally had two engines, Siemens and Halske, with 139 kWh. Third generator, ASEA, with 800 kWh, became operational in 1931. As of 2017, it produced 4 million kWh of electricity yearly. The plant has been operational ever since, being interrupted only once, by a diversion during the World War II. In 2005, with another 64 objects, it was included in the world's technical heritage.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Robert William Bower (June 12, 1936 – January 27, 2024) was an American applied physicist. Immediately after receiving his Ph.D. from The California Institute of Technology in 1973, he worked for over 25 years in many different professions: engineer, scientist, professor at University of California, Davis, and as president and CEO of Device Concept Inc. He also served as the president of Integrated Vertical Modules, which focused on three-dimensional, high-density structures. His most notable contribution, however, is his field-effect device with insulated gates—also known as a self-aligned-gate MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor), or SAGFET. Bower patented this design in 1969 while working at the Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California.\nBower also published over 80 journals and articles, patented over 28 inventions, and authored chapters in 3 different books. He died in Maui, Hawaii on January 27, 2024, at the age of 87.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nLife and education\nBower was born in Santa Monica, California, in 1936. He remained in California throughout his life, except for 1954–1958 when he enlisted in the Air Force. After his service with the Air Force, he enrolled in UC Berkeley, and in 1962, earned his A.B. in physics while working at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. One year later, he earned his M.S. in electrical engineering from Caltech. In 1965, he worked in Malibu, California with Hughes Research Laboratories, which specializes in aerospace and defense operations. He later returned to Caltech and received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics in 1973. Bower was latterly Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Davis, where he taught for over 14 years.\n\n\nPrimary accomplishments\nAt the Hughes Research Laboratories in the late 1960s, Bower strove to find the ideal element to integrate in all circuits. In 1920, Lilienfeld conceived of the basic design for this idea but had no platform to build or test his device. In the late 1950s, McCaldin and Hornoi devised of the silicon planar process and Kilby and Noyce established an Integrated circuit (IC) that could serve as a basic platform for Lilienfeld's design. In 1963, Steven Hofstein and Frederic Heiman compiled the ideas from all previous scientists and were able to describe the fundamental nature of the MOSFET on a silicon planar process platform; however, they lacked one key asset that would power the MOSFET. In 1965, Bower conceived of the self-aligned-gate ion-implanted MOSFET which was the key to advances in integrated circuits.\n\n\nSelf-aligned-gate ion-implanted MOSFET\nThe MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) is a device that amplifies or switches electronic signals. However, without the self-aligned gate, the MOSFET lacked a proper source to improve the accuracy of the entire fabrication process. Dr. Bower therefore established a small self-aligned gate designed to arrange a highly doped gate as a mask of the source and drain around it. His patent (U.S. 3,472,712) was filed on October 27, 1966 and issued to him on October 14, 1969.\n\n\nPatent controversy\nBower's invention underwent much controversy when Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace argued that they were the actual inventors of the self-aligned gate transistors. In 1966, Bower and Dill presented the first publication the self-aligned gate transistor at the International Electron Device Meeting in Washington, D.C.  That IEDM publication described the self-aligned gate transistor fabricated with both metal and polysilicon as the gate material and using both ion implantation and diffusion to form the source and drains.  This was presentation 16.6 of this IEDM meeting. To Bower and to the attorneys who litigated the Bower U.S. 3,472,712 patent it was determined in the courts that his patent covered the general principal of using a gate as mask for both metal and polysilicon gates using ion implantation to establish the source and drain regions. Bower does not acknowledge the statement \"Although Bower believed he was first in using aluminum as the gate and later developed the device using polysilicon as the gate, he was unable to prove it to the courts and the patent was awarded to Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace (U.S. 3,475,234)\" is true. Actually it was the Hans G. Dill patent U.S. 3,544,3999, filed on October 26, 1966, that described the formation of the polysilicon gate self-aligned gate FET using diffusion of the source and drain that was disputed by the Kerwin et al. patent, not the Bower patent.  It was also determined in a number of court cases that the vast majority of self-aligned gate FETs were made using ion implantation rather than diffusion to introduce the dopants into the source-drain regions.  Bower conferred with the attorneys who litigated these cases and they confirmed that the statement \"The US patent system grants the patent to the first developer of the invention, not the first one to be issued a patent.\" is not a valid statement of patent law.\n\n\nOther works\nAside from his large contributions in the advancement of MOSFET, Bower has published over 80 journals and articles, patented over 28 inventions, and authored chapters in 3 different books. He has recently been working with Integrate Vertical Modules to focus on three-dimensional, high-density solid structures.\n\n\nRecent patents\nR.W. Bower and M.S. Ismail. ALIGNED WAFER BONDING.

Most notably was his induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1997 for his invention of the self-aligned gate ion implanted MOSFET. In 1999, he was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering, one of the highest professional distinctions granted to an engineer.

    "text": "Jacumba Hot Springs ( hə-KOOM-bə) is an unincorporated community in the Mountain Empire area of southeastern San Diego County, California, United States. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau defined Jacumba  as a census-designated place (CDP) for the first time in the 2010 census, with a population of 561. At the 2020 census, the population decreased to 540. The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The ZIP Code is 91934 and the town lies within area code 619. Its elevation is 2,829 feet (862 m) above mean sea level (AMSL). On February 26, 2013, the United States Board on Geographic Names approved a petition by a citizen committee to change the town's name from Jacumba to Jacumba Hot Springs.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Kumeyaay peoples occupied the Jacumba area prior to European settlement. They were likely attracted by the warm Jacumba hot spring (temperature 104 °F [40 °C]), one of many mineral hot springs which occur up and down the Peninsular Ranges of California. Ranchers occupied the area in the 19th century and were often in conflict with the indigenous population. Fifteen Kumeyaay and one White died in an event connected to alleged cattle rustling during the Jacumba Massacre of February 27, 1880.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, the health and relaxation benefits of natural hot springs began to be commercialized. The Jacumba hot spring is prolific and delivered enough water to fill large public baths, the remains of which can still be seen. The water contains sulfur but has a pleasant clean smell. In 1919 rail service on the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway connected Jacumba to San Diego. By 1925 the town had a world class hotel, the Hotel Jacumba. In the 1930s, Jacumba had developed into a top destination and had a population of about 1,150. Many of the foremost movie stars and celebrities of the time regarded Jacumba as a prime destination for relaxation.\n\nJacumba's role as a prime destination continued through World War II. As the southernmost California hot spring, it began to feel competition from more northern ones, including Murrieta and Palm Springs. After the Interstate 8 bypassed Jacumba by two miles, most of the roadside service businesses folded and the community went into economic decline.\nThe Jacumba Hotel closed and was destroyed in an arson fire in 1983. The ruins stood until 1991. Today, the stub of the massive central fireplace can still be seen. The great public baths closed, the swimming pool was filled in, and the well was capped by its rights-owner.\nIn the 1980s, the Jacumba Motel was the only hotel facility left in Jacumba. The area continues to attract primarily foreign visitors and the motel has acquired rights to the spring and opened a spa. In 2002 the facility was sold with the intent of renovating it into a timeshare spa-type resort. In 2006 it was resold and set up as a bed and breakfast. The facility was closed in from 2010 to 2013. After a complete renovation, it was re-opened on June 28, 2013. It is in operation as the Jacumba Hot Springs Spa and Motel.\n\n\nGeography\nThe town is in a valley in the Jacumba Mountains at an altitude of 2,800 feet (850 m). The area is dry with an annual average rainfall of 11.8 inches (300 mm). It is served by Old Highway 80; Interstate 8 bypasses the town at a distance of two miles (3 km). The town is located in the Pacific time zone (GMT −08:00).\nJacumba Hot Springs is located on the Mexican border. A small settlement exists on the Mexican side, known as Jacume; the unmanned crossing was closed in 1995. The new, enlarged border fence now runs through the area. The United States Border Patrol maintains an increased presence in the area to curtail smuggling and illegal immigration.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 6.1 square miles (15.9 km2), 99.88% of it land, and 0.12% of it water.\n\n\nDemographics\n\nJacumba first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. census.\n\n\n2020\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Jacumba had a population of 540. The population density was 88.2 inhabitants per square mile (34.1/km2). The racial makeup of Jacumba was 325 (60.2%) White, 20 (3.7%) African American, 19 (3.5%) Native American, 1 (0.2%) Asian, 1 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 97 (18.0%) from other races, and 77 (14.3%) from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.24. There were 126 families (52.3% of all households).\nThe age distribution was 115 people (21.3%) under the age of 18, 25 people (4.6%) aged 18 to 24, 108 people (20.0%) aged 25 to 44, 171 people (31.7%) aged 45 to 64, and 121 people (22.4%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 49.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 107.7 males.\nThere were 268 housing units at an average density of 43.8 units per square mile (16.9 units/km2), of which 241 (89.9%) were occupied. Of these, 148 (61.4%) were owner-occupied, and 93 (38.6%) were occupied by renters.\n\n\n2010\nThe 2010 United States census reported that Jacumba had a population of 561. The population density was 91.6 inhabitants per square mile (35.4/km2). The racial makeup of Jacumba was 389 (69.3%) White 322 (57.4%) non-Hispanic White), 4 (0.7%) African American, 15 (2.7%) Native American, 6 (1.1%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 114 (20.3%) from other races, and 33 (5.9%) from two or more races.  Hispanic or Latino of any race were 207 persons (36.9%).\nThe Census reported that 561 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.\nThere were 216 households, out of which 66 (30.6%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 87 (40.3%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 29 (13.4%) had a female householder with no husband present, 12 (5.6%) had a male householder with no wife present.  There were 21 (9.7%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 0 (0%) same-sex married couples or partnerships, while 72 households (33.3%) were made up of individuals, and 24 (11.1%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60.  There were 128 families (59.3% of all households); the average family size was 3.38.\nThe population was spread out, with 141 people (25.1%) under the age of 18, 46 people (8.2%) aged 18 to 24, 128 people (22.8%) aged 25 to 44, 167 people (29.8%) aged 45 to 64, and 79 people (14.1%) who were 65 years of age or older.

Springs that once flowed into the White River issued from the Ogallala Aquifer, which has been heavily tapped by the numerous farming operations on the Llano Estacado.  According to annual depth to water level measurements obtained by the High Plains Underground Water District, the water table beneath the Llano Estacado has declined at a rate of 0.8 ft (0.2 m) per year over the last decade.  Over the 20-year period from 1987 to 2007, the water table dropped a total of 18.6 ft (5.7 m) across the district.  As a result of this depletion, the once-gushing springs along this stretch of the White River have either dried completely or have been reduced to seeps.  Lacking a steady base flow, the White River has ceased to flow, and today, Silver Falls is normally dry unless a strong thunderstorm happens to pass across the watershed.\n\n\nProper name\nThe White River has been known by various names in the past. Alternate names include the Freshwater Fork, Blanco Fork, or White Fork of the Brazos River and Rio Blanco.

The equestrian statue of Ferdinand III of Castile in the Plaza Nueva, Seville, opposite the Town Hall, was sculpted by him.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nJoaquín Bilbao was born on August 27, 1864, in Sevilla. He was the brother of the painter Gonzalo Bilbao.\nBilbao began his studies at the Colegio San Alberto Magno. He studied Baccalaureate at the Provincial Institute. During his high school education, he enrolled with his brother Gonzalo in drawing and watercolor classes under Professor Pedro Vega. In 1881, upon finishing the Baccalaureate, he enrolled in the Faculty of Law of the old Literary University of Seville. He finished his law studies in 1887. In 1890, he started working at the law firm of Manuel de Bedmar y Escudero. At the age of 29 he left the legal profession to devote himself to sculpture.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1900 Bilbao moved to Paris, where he attended his Académie des Beaux-Arts for four years. During that time, he also made trips to Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and England. During his stay abroad, he did not lose contact with the Academia de Bellas Artes in Seville and with the Spanish national exhibitions. In Netherlands and Belgium, he learned from the work of Constantin Meunier. He returned to Seville in 1904. In October of that year, the Academia de Bellas Artes named Bilbao as a member of Sculpture of the Provincial Commission of Historical and Artistic Monuments.\nIn 1909 he moved to Toledo and became professor at the School of Arts and Crafts of Toledo. In this city he was also conservator of the Casa Museo del Greco. In 1902 he was appointed Ordinary Commander of the Civil Order of Alfonso XII. In 1912 he returned to his hometown, where he remained, except for sporadic trips.\nFrom 1914 to 1919 he had a disciple in his workshop Enrique Pérez Comendador, who made a bronze bust of his teacher.\nBilbao died on January 30, 1934, in Seville.\n\n\nList of selected works\nHis works include:\n\n\nDrawing and paintings\n\n\nSculptures\n\n\nLiterature\nMoriana Gómez, Mario (2010).

Nutt, VanderCook College of Music\nHoward Lyons, Lyons Band Instrument Company\nNeil Kjos Sr., Neil A. Kjos Music Company\nThe Midwest Clinic began on December 7, 1946, when approximately 120 directors from the Chicago area assembled in a YWCA gymnasium on Chicago's West Side for a six-hour clinic and new music reading session. In 1947, the event was expanded to two days and moved to the Hotel Sherman to take advantage of the larger facility and accommodations for out-of-town directors.  This second installment brought new features, including a printed program, an additional band, and a new name: The Mid-West Band Clinic. The VanderCook College of Music, Neil A. Kjos Music Company, and Lyons Band Instrument Company sponsored the event. For the next twenty-five years, the Hotel Sherman was home to the Midwest Clinic. In the 1950s, orchestras and jazz ensembles were introduced, and in 1962, the Midwest Clinic held its first official Orchestra Day. In 1963, the clinic expanded to its present format of four-and-a-half days. Since 1973, the Midwest Clinic has been held at the Hilton Chicago, and in 1995, the Blackstone Hotel was used in addition to the Hilton for hosting clinic events.  With the addition of this facility, the Midwest Clinic was able to present more clinics. In 1999, the Congress Plaza replaced the Blackstone Hotel as the second site of conference events.  In 2008, the Blackstone Hotel was once again added as a clinic venue after reopening in 2007.  In 2008, the Midwest Clinic board of directors voted to move the conference to McCormick Place in order to house all Midwest events in one location.\nIn the earliest years of the \"Mid-West Band Clinic\", the organizers - H.E. Nutt, Howard Lyons, and Neil Kjos Sr. - invited outstanding bands to perform, based upon the reputations of the organization and their director. In addition to giving a formal concert, the bands were also expected to provide a sight-reading session, with the selections being requested by audience members on the spur of the moment. Over the years, the focus of the Midwest Clinic has remained on connecting music directors with published music, new and established teaching techniques and the products and services for music educators.\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nConcert Performances\nPerformances are given by organizations from around the world. Grade school, middle school, high school, college, military, adult, and professional groups all present concerts. The VanderCook College of Music Symphonic Band is the only ensemble that has performed at every Midwest Clinic since its start in 1946. Past performers include: Chicago Symphony Orchestra Brass, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the United States Coast Guard Band, the Indiana University Philharmonic, the U.S. Air Force Band, the U.S. Army Blues Jazz Ensemble, the U.S. Navy Band Commodores, the \"President's Own\" United States Marine Band, the Australian Wind Orchestra, the City of Milano Wind Orchestra, the Clarence Wind Ensemble, the Birmingham Symphonic Winds, the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra, the Dallas Wind Symphony, the North Texas Wind Symphony, the Round Rock High School Symphony Orchestra and its ensembles, and the Eastman Wind Ensemble, Lafayette High School Symphonic Band.\n\n\nClinics\n\nMore than eighty clinicians offer guidance and inspiration covering facets of instrumental music. Past clinicians include Gunther Schuller, Tim Lautzenheiser, John Corigliano, Wynton Marsalis, Mark Camphouse, Frank Ticheli, Frederic Fennell, Col. Arnald Gabriel, Himie Voxman, and Karel Husa.\n\n\nBoard of directors\nThe Midwest Clinic is governed by a Board of Directors.  Members are appointed upon being selected and invited by the Board when its members determine a need for new members.  Membership on the board carries responsibilities to attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees and to carry forth projects for the corporation.\nMembers of the current board of directors are: John Clinton (Vice President), Richard Crain (Past-President), Paula Crider, Rodney Dorsey (President), Jose Diaz, Richard Dunscomb (Vice President), Antonio García (Secretary), Corey Graves, Soo Han, Sam Hodson, Mark Kjos, Herman Knoll, Mary Land, Tim Lautzenheiser, Mark Laycock, Lisa MacDonald, Beth Peterson, George Quinlan (Treasurer), and Kevin Sedatole.\n\n\nAwards\nThe Midwest Clinic gives out three different awards: the \"Medal of Honor,\" the \"Industry Award,\" and the \"International Award.\"  Award winners are nominated and chosen by the Board of Directors.

    "text": "Gassantoda Castle (月山富田城, Gassantoda-jō) was a Sengoku period yamajiro-style Japanese castle located in Izumo Province, in what is now part of the city of Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture in the San'in region of far western Japan. Its ruins have been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1934.  Gassantoda Castle was built using the whole of Gassan's ridges and valleys, and is regarded as one of the five largest and most important medieval mountain castles along with Kasugayama Castle (Niigata), Nanao Castle (Ishikawa), Odani Castle and Kannonji Castle (Shiga).\n\n\nHistory\nGassan Toda Castle (月山富田城) is located on Gassan, which is 180 meters tall some 20 kilometers from the mouth of the Hirose River at eastern edge of current Shimane prefecture. The area was an important center from ancient times for the production of tatara steel, which was essential in the production of Japanese swords, and Gassan occupies a central location in the transportation routes of Izumo Province. During the Kamakura period, the Kamakura shogunate awarded the Sasaki clan control over Izumo and Oki Provinces, and the cadet branch of the Sasaki which eventually controlled Izumo during the Muromachi period was the Kyōgoku clan. The Kyōgoku established their stronghold on Gassan, which appears to have already had an ancient fortification from the Heian period.  However, the Kyōgoku were soon overthrown by one of their vassals, Amago Tsunehisa, who through a combination of cunning and ruthlessness, expanded his territory by confiscating lands of temples, shrines and his weaker neighbors. He and captured Gassantoda Castle by leading his army into the castle disguised as festival dancers during a celebration and then launching a surprise attack on the defenders. From 1510 to 1540, Amago Tsunehisa began to expand his territory into neighboring provinces, conquering all of parts of Iwami, Hōki, Bingo, Bitchu, Mimasaka and part of Harima Province. Following the weakening of the powerful Ōuchi clan to the west due to a revolt by their general Sue Harukata, the Amago clan seized the Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine. However, the power of the Amago clan was fragile, and was based largely on personal loyalty to Amago Tsunehisa. After his death in 1540, his successor, Amago Haruhisa could not command the same loyalty, and local lords began to defect to the Ōuchi, or to the rising power of the Mōri clan. In 1542, he was trapped in Gassantoda Castle during the Siege of Toda Castle by an Ōuchi army. Although the Ōuchi could not take the castle after a year and a half, the damage to Amago's prestige was very great. Gassantoda Castle was attacked by the Mōri clan in 1566, after several failed assaults and a prolonged siege, it fell to Mōri Motonari, ending the Amago clan as a force in the Izumo region. This victory confirmed Motonari's rise to the position of the most powerful warlord in western Japan, and the castle would become one of several castles in the region occupied by the Mōri.  The castle was assigned to Kikkawa Motoharu, one of Motonari's sons and the regional commander of the San'in region. Under the Kikkawa, the castle was upgraded with stone walls.\nAfter the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, the Mōri clan was deprived of much of their territory, including Izumo Province. The Tokugawa shogunate awarded it to his general Horio Tadauji as the seat of the Matsue Domain. Tadauji died in 1604 and his father Horio Yoshiharu, while serving as regent for Tadauji's son and successor Horio Tadaharu, commissioned the construction of Matsue Castle in 1607. Yoshiharu relocated the seat of Matsue Domain to the new castle upon its completion in 1611, and Gassantoda Castle was subsequently abandoned and demolished. The ruins of the castle are now a park. Gassantoda Castle was listed as one of Japan's Top 100 Castles by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.\nThe castle site is a 60 minute bus ride from JR West San'in Main Line Yasugi Station to Gassan-Iriguchi bus stop, and 40 minutes from hillside entrance to hilltop castle ruins.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Shimane)\n\n\nFurther reading\nDe Lange, William (2021).

    "text": "Aubrey Park, Redbourn in Hertfordshire is a building of historical significance and is listed on the English Heritage Register. Parts of the building date back to the 16th and 17th centuries and the site on which it is located may have its origins in the 13th century. Today it is a hotel which provides accommodation, restaurant facilities and caters for special events including weddings.\n\n\nOwners of Aubrey Park\n\nAubrey Park was previously called Foster's Farm and it seems that during the 17th century it was owned by the Carpenter family who were wealthy Redbourn residents possessing large areas of land. Until 1640 they lived at Revel End which is adjacent to Foster's farm. They then built Redbourn House in the early 18th century. The Carpenter family named the eldest son George for five generations and all lived in or around the village.\n\nGeorge Carpenter (1713–1782) who was the last of the line had an only child named Mary Elizabeth Carpenter (1783–1811). She was his sole heir. In 1800 she married the 11th Earl of Strathmore (1743–1846) and her marriage settlement mentioned the Carpenters Redbourn Estate which included properties such as Redbourn House and Foster's Farm. The couple had one child Thomas George Bowes-Lyon (1801–1834) called Lord Glamis. In 1820 he married Charlotte Grimstead (1797–1881) who became Lady Glamis. Thomas who was the great-grandfather of the Queen Mother was the eldest son and intended heir of the 11th Earl of Strathmore died in 1834 before his father's death of 1846. Before he died his father gave him the Redbourne Estate which had been part of his mother's marriage settlement.\nIn his will of 1835 Thomas left this property to his wife Charlotte, Lady Glamis. The 1843 tithe map shows that she is the owner of Foster's Farm. After her husband's death Charlotte lived for much of her life at Redbourn House. The 1841 census records her as living at the house with her mother Charlotte Grimstead. In 1865 she moved to \"the Red House\" in High Street.\nLady Glamis retained ownership of Foster's Farm until her death in 1881. The whole of her Redbourn Estate was inherited by her son the 13th Earl of Strathmore. In 1893 the Earl sold the estate and the sale notice for Foster's Farm is shown.\n\nSome of the estate which included Foster's Farm was bought by Sir John Blundell Maple who was a business magnate who owned the furniture manufacturing company Maple and Co. He was the proprietor of Foster's Farm for about twelve years and in about 1905 it was sold to the Dunn family who were residents for over 35 years.\nGeorge Arthur Dunn (1865–1939) was an extremely wealthy businessman. He was the owner of the famous menswear company Dunn and Co which specialised in men's hats. In 1884 he married Lucy Day (1863–1939) and the couple had nine children who can be seen in the photo taken at \"The Aubreys\" in 1918.\nAfter he bought Foster's Farm he made substantial additions to it and renamed it \"the Aubreys\". He was an advocate of the \"back to the land\" movement and \"kitchen farming\" which was very popular in England at the turn of the century and he bought over 1000 acres of land surrounding \"the Aubreys\". He introduced some advanced farming methods into the area and was said to have one of the first combine harvesters in England. He bought the Branksome Dean Hotel in Bournemouth and developed it as a vegetarian establishment.\nHe died in 1939 at \"the Aubreys\" and in 1946 the Dunn family sold the property. The sale notice was in The Times. In the 1960s the house became the Aubrey Park Hotel.\n\n\nThe tenants of Aubrey Park\nDuring the 19th century when it was still called Foster's Farm there were several notable people who were tenants. The 1843 tithe map shows that John Beaumont was the resident at this time. He was the son of John Beaumont (1745–1815) and his wife Ann who had been tenant farmers at Flowers Farm which is nearby. After he died in 1851 Frederic Faircloth (1805–1880) became the resident farmer. In the 1861 census shows that James Draper and his wife Sarah followed in the 1871 by George Saunders (1821–1907) and his wife Faith. The 1881 census records George Farr (1845–1915) and his wife Jessie as the residents. The Farr family remained there as tenants until about 1905 when it was bought by the Dunn family.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nAubrey Park Hotel website\n51.78742188649248°N 0.41404235767777764°W﻿ / 51.78742188649248; -0.41404235767777764",

    "text": "\"What Is... Cliff Clavin?\" is the fourteenth episode of the eighth season of the American television sitcom Cheers, co-written by Dan O'Shannon and Tom Anderson, and directed by Andy Ackerman rather than James Burrows, who directed most of the other episodes of the series. It originally aired on January 18, 1990, on NBC.  In this episode, Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) appears on the game show Jeopardy! and game show host Alex Trebek guest stars as himself. Cliff racks up an insurmountable lead during the game, only to lose it all in the final round. The episode received praise from critics for its concept and its guest star.\n\n\nPlot\nCliff Clavin competes on the television game show Jeopardy!, which has temporarily moved taping to Boston for a special occasion. Cliff amasses $22,000 by the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, more than twice the score of the second place contestant, theoretically ensuring a win. For the Final Jeopardy! clue of \"Archibald Leach, Bernard Schwartz and Lucille LeSueur\" in the category of \"Movies\", Cliff responds incorrectly with \"Who are 3 people who've never been in my kitchen?\" (The correct question was \"Who are the real names of Cary Grant, Tony Curtis and Joan Crawford\"), signing the amount of his wager as \"$22,000 Big Ones!\" Having overconfidently wagered his entire score as revealed, Cliff loses all of his winnings and the match. Cliff objects and argues, demanding that his response be accepted.\nThe show's host, Alex Trebek, later arrives at Cheers. Trebek tells Cliff that his response should have been accepted earlier, and announces to Cliff his resignation as the host of Jeopardy!. However, Cliff convinces Trebek to remain as host by telling him how much the show and Trebek mean to him. After Cliff shares the news with others that he \"saved Jeopardy!\", Norm Peterson praises Trebek for doing this just to make Cliff feel better. However, Trebek says that he did not realize that Cliff was at the bar and that meeting him had been a coincidence. Trebek says that Cliff scares him and that the story about quitting the show was a fabrication to placate him.\nMeanwhile, Sam Malone receives telephone calls from women whom he previously dated; they are angry with him for making dates and then not showing up. Sam eventually discovers that his \"little black book\" has been stolen. Through detective work, Sam discovers that the thief has called Sam's women in alphabetical order, and that Rebecca Howe is the next recipient on the list. Carla Tortelli uses her bluff to blackmail the reluctant Rebecca into helping Sam capture the thief. The thief calls Rebecca, who asks him to meet her at the bar instead of the roller rink. Then the thief enters, turning out to be a teenage boy named Timmy (Greg E. Davis), who wants to become a \"babe hound\" like Sam. After getting his little black book back, Sam lets Timmy go, advising him to start as a \"babe pup\" and to call girls around his age, and gives him $25 for a haircut and a tip for a shampoo girl.\n\n\nProduction\nDan O'Shannon and Tom Anderson co-wrote \"What Is... Cliff Clavin?\", and Andy Ackerman directed the episode. Bernard Kuby portrays Earl, a bar patron in the cold opening returning to Cheers for the first time since he moved to Alaska in the 1960s and explaining the bar's interior differences between the 1960s and 1980s, with only Norm remaining unchanged. Jeopardy! announcer Johnny Gilbert also made a guest appearance as himself announcing the game show. William A. Porter portrays one of the Jeopardy! contestants, Milford Reynolds, a doctor of neurosurgery. Audrey Lowell portrays the other contestant, Agnes Borsic, a lawyer who eventually becomes the top winner after Cliff wagered and then lost all of his winnings. Peter Schreiner and Steven Rotblatt are credited for their background appearances.\n\n\nReception\nGeneral Norman Schwarzkopf said this was the funniest episode of Cheers. Don Leighton from Superior Telegram called this episode the greatest and said the Final Jeopardy! moment was hilarious. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk said the concept of the episode was a riot. Hot Springs Village Voice called Cliff's Final Jeopardy! moment a classic example of his mishaps caused by his own \"know-it-all nature\". Andrew Razeghi, in his book Hope, called this episode \"one of the most memorable episodes\" of Cheers, found Cliff's response to the Final Jeopardy! clue neither right nor wrong and an example of divergent thinking, and called Cliff a poster child for Joy Paul Guilford. Former Jeopardy! contestant turned host Ken Jennings, in his book Brainiac, noted that Jeopardy!-related sitcom episodes had become common at the time.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nOne of the earliest references to this Cheers episode within the Jeopardy! show itself happened just a few months later on the May 18, 1990, airing of the final round of the Jeopardy! College Championship, taped on April 22 for season six. Soon-to-be champion Michael Thayer of Rutgers University bet $0 and wrote \"Who was someone I never met?\" as his response in Final Jeopardy. When the contestants' wagers and responses were revealed, Alex Trebek noted the connection with his comment, \"Michael, looks like you were watching that episode of Cheers.\"\nOn the first episode of Jeopardy! season 31, which aired on September 15, 2014, Jeopardy! champion Elizabeth Williams echoed Cliff Clavin's answer in her response to the Final Jeopardy clue. Williams's $600 wager combined with her opponents' incorrect responses allowed Williams to triumph that day, nonetheless.\nThe question categories from the first round of the game Cliff Clavin played in (\"Civil Servants\", \"Stamps from Around The World\", \"Mothers and Sons\", \"Beer\", \"Bar Trivia\", \"Celibacy\", described in the episode by Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) as \"Mr. Clavin's Dream Board\") were used as categories in the Double Jeopardy! round of a Jeopardy! game played on May 10, 2005, during the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions.\nThe episode inspired the term \"Clavin's Rule\" in reference to maximizing all the winnings at the final round and losing them all. Trebek himself \"ma[de] several references to contestants pulling 'a Cliff Clavin'\" since the episode originally aired. Cameron Martin of The Atlantic magazine, Ashley Burns of Uproxx Tim Graham of ESPN blog, and Christopher Hair of an SBNation blog Five for Howling have also used the phrase \"pull a Cliff Clavin,\" coined as a \"practice\".\n\n\nSee also\nList of Cheers episodes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nRazeghi, Andrew (2006).

    "text": "Air Vice Marshal William \"Paddy\" Harbison,  (11 April 1922 – 25 December 2018), was a British Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter pilot who served during the Second World War and the Korean War. He held senior command roles in the RAF and was the author of a noted technical report that evaluated the performance and tactics of jet combat during the Korean War.\n\n\nEarly years\nWilliam Harbison was born in the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland), but grew up in Northern Ireland and was educated at Ballymena Academy.\n\n\nRAF career\n\n\nSecond World War\nHarbison joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941 shortly after the Battle of Britain. He received flight training in Canada and upon graduation joined No. 118 Squadron RAF and remained with them for the duration of the war. While in the European Theatre, Harbison flew the Supermarine Spitfire and North American P-51 Mustang.\nOn 23 March 1945, Harbison led 118 Squadron on a mission escorting over 100 Avro Lancaster bombers. Shortly before reaching their target in Bremen, Germany, the formation came under attack by twenty Messerschmitt Me 262 fighters. Several members of the squadron, including Harbison, damaged enemy jets, but could not catch them due to their superior speed.\n\n\nInterbellum\nAfter the war, he served with No. 64 Squadron RAF flying the twin-engine de Havilland Hornet, the fastest piston-engine fighter ever to enter service. Harbison also served with No. 263 and No. 257 Squadrons flying the Gloster Meteor. In 1948, Harbison participated in an exchange program with the United States Air Force's 1st Fighter Group. He was stationed at March Air Force Base in California where he flew the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and became the first serving RAF pilot to fly the North American F-86 Sabre. Harbison returned to England in 1950 where he was assigned to the All-Weather Development Squadron at the Central Fighter Establishment (CFE).\n\n\nKorean War\n\nTo obtain first-hand information on Korean air operations, CFE obtained approval from USAF Chief of Staff, Hoyt Vandenberg, to send four RAF pilots to observe and report. Second World War ace, Wing Commander John Baldwin, Squadron Leader Harbison, and two junior officers were selected for this task. Harbison's specific assignment was with the USAF 4th Fighter Group to evaluate combat tactics used by the F-86 against the Soviet MiG-15. On 13 February 1952, Harbison reported to Colonel Harrison Thyng, commander of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea where he was assigned to the 335th Fighter Squadron. After attending \"Clobber College\", a program where newly arrived pilots flew training sorties with experienced instructors, Harbison once again found himself flying combat missions. He enjoyed the flying and considered himself lucky for the opportunity to \"observe the air war along the Yalu River, arguably the best seat in the house\". Harbison was credited with damaging a MiG-15 in combat and was awarded the United States Air Medal. After Baldwin failed to return from a weather reconnaissance mission, responsibility for completing the final report fell to Harbison. Despite the short notice and with little knowledge of the details Baldwin had intended to include, Harbison completed a 152-page report that evaluated the operational characteristics of the F-86 and the tactics used against the MiG-15.\n\n\nSenior command\nAfter completing his tour in Korea, Harbison was once again flying the F-86 as commander of No. 67 Squadron of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force at RAF Wildenrath in West Germany. In 1956, he returned home to attend the Army Staff College at Camberley, Surrey. In 1957, Harbison was assigned to air defence operations in the Ministry of Defence and then served a tour as the commanding officer of the all-weather No. 29 Squadron RAF flying Gloster Javelins.\nHarbison then attended Joint Services Staff College at Latimer, Buckinghamshire. Following graduation, Harbison served in eastern Scotland as commander of RAF Leuchars, the most northerly air defence station in the United Kingdom. He then attended the Canadian National Defence College in Kingston, Ontario followed by a tour as Group Captain Operations at RAF Fighter Command headquarters. Promoted to air commodore in 1969, Harbison served as the director of operations of the National Air Traffic Services in London. He returned to the United States in 1972 as air attaché at the British Embassy, Washington, D.C.\nHarbison was promoted to air vice marshal in January 1975 and shortly thereafter appointed commander of No. 11 Group RAF responsible for the air defence of the United Kingdom. No. 11 Group was the successor to RAF Fighter Command which had defended London and the south-east of England against attacks by the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. At the end of his tour, Harbison retired from the Royal Air Force.\n\n\nLater years\nAfter retiring from the RAF on 31 March 1977, Harbison joined British Aerospace (BAe) and returned to the United States as vice president of their Government Programs Office in Washington, D.C. He continued working as a consultant for the company after retiring from BAe. Nearly fifty years after its original publication, Harbison's report found new life as a training guide included in the computer game, MiG Alley. Impressed by the mix of technical and tactical analysis that applied just as much to a 1999 flight simulation as to real jet combat in 1952, one reviewer described Harbison's report as, \"the best game strategy guide I've ever read.\" Harbison remained active in the aviation community after his second retirement, attending reunions and speaking at symposiums including:\n\nThe Jet Age: Korea, Vietnam, Cold War — A panel of four war veterans (Gen. Hal Hornburg, Air Vice Marshal Paddy Harbison of the Royal Air Force, Maj. Gen. James McInerny and Lt. Col. Tom Hanton) discuss the challenges and triumphs of air power over the years. The event was held on 14 June 2007 at the Pentagon Conference Center to commemorate the Air Force's 60th anniversary.\nThird No. 118 Squadron Reunion — Members of No. 118 Squadron RAF meet for their 3rd reunion on 8 May 2009 in Coventry.\n70th Anniversary of V-E Day — Harbison and his wife Helen were among the honorees at the National Air and Space Museum's observance of the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Harbison described his success in shooting down the German V-1 flying bomb and shared his pilot logbook that documented his wartime missions including photographs of aircraft and crew.\nHarbison was married to Helen née Geneva, a 1947 graduate of Illinois Wesleyan University. The Harbisons raised two sons and lived in the town of Falls Church, Virginia. Harbison died on 25 December 2018, aged 96.\n\n\nHonours\nIn 1953, Harbison was awarded the United States' Air Medal for service as a fighter pilot in Korea. In the 1955 Birthday Honours, Harbison was awarded the Air Force Cross while serving as the commander of No. 67 Squadron RAF in Germany. In the 1965 Birthday Honours, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), and in the 1977 New Year Honours, Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nCaygill, Peter (1999).

    "text": "Hanuman Jayanti (Sanskrit: हनुमज्जयंती, romanized: Hanumajjayantī), also called Hanuman Janmotsav, is a Hindu festival celebrating the birth of the Hindu deity, and one of the protagonists of the Ramayana and its many versions, Hanuman. The celebration of Hanuman Jayanti varies by time and tradition in each state of India. In most northern states of India, the festival is observed on the full-moon day of the Hindu month of Chaitra (Chaitra Purnima). In Telugu states Anjaneya Jayanthi celebrate on every Bahula (Shukla Paksha) Dashami in Vaishakha  month according to Telugu calendar. In Karnataka, Hanuman Jayanti is observed on Shukla Paksha Trayodashi, during the Margashirsha month or in Vaishakha, while in a few states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, it is celebrated during the month of Dhanu (called Margazhi in Tamil). Hanuman Jayanti is observed on Pana Sankranti in the eastern state of Odisha, which coincides with the Odia New Year.\nHanuman is regarded to be an ardent devotee of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, widely known for his unflinching devotion. He is revered as a symbol of strength.\n\n\nBirth\n\nHanuman is a vanara, born to Kesari and Anjana. Hanuman is also known as the celestial son of Vayu, the wind-god. His mother, Anjana, was an apsara who was born on earth due to a curse. She was redeemed from this curse upon giving birth to a son.\n\n\nTelugu origin story (Japali, Tirumala)\nIn Venkatachala Mahatyam and Skanda Puranam, it was explained that Anjana Devi, mother of Hanuman, approached sage Matanga seeking a way for her to be blessed with a son. She was advised to do penance on Venkatachalam. After several years of penance, she was blessed with a son. The place where she did penance and where Hanuman was born, had become famous as Anjanadri.\nVaraha Purana and Brahmanda Purana, it was clearly explained that after Hanuman was born, he leapt into the sky assuming the rising Sun as a fruit to satiate his hunger. The place from where he made the jump was Venkatagiri. After Lord Brahma and Lord Indra attacked him with their weapons, he fell down and Anjana Devi started crying for her son. To pacify her, the gods descended on Venkatachalam and bestowed several boons on Hanuman and said the place would be called Anjanadri Hill. That's why in seven hills Thirumala one hill got Anjanadri.\n\n\nKannada origin story (Hampi)\nThe Valmiki Ramayana states that his father, Kesari, was the son of Brihaspati, the king of a region named Sumeru, located near the kingdom of Kishkindha near Hampi in present-day Vijayanagara district of Karnataka. Anjana is said to have performed intense prayers lasting twelve years to Shiva to bear a child. Pleased with their devotion, Shiva granted them the son they sought.\nEknath's Bhavartha Ramayana states that when Anjana was worshiping Rudra, King Dasharatha of Ayodhya was also performing the ritual of Putrakameshti under the guidance  of Sage R̥śyaśr̥ṅga in order to have children. As a result, he received some payasam (Indian pudding) to be shared by his three wives, leading to the births of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. By divine ordinance, a kite (bird) snatched a fragment of that pudding and dropped it while flying over the forest where Anjana was engaged in worship. Vayu, delivered the falling pudding to the outstretched hands of Anjana, who consumed it. Hanuman was born to her as a result.\n\n\nWorship\nHanuman is worshipped as a deity with the ability to gain victory over evil and provide protection. On this festival, devotees of Hanuman celebrate him and seek his protection and blessings. They join in temples to worship him and present religious offerings. In return, the devotees receive prasadam. People who revere him read from Hindu texts like the Hanuman Chalisa and Ramayana. Devotees visit temples and apply a vermillion to their foreheads from Hanuman's murti. According to legend, when Hanuman found Sita applying sinduram to her forehead, he enquired about this custom. She replied that doing so would ensure a long life for her husband, Rama. Hanuman then proceeded to smear his entire body with vermillion, thus ensuring Rama's immortality.\nAlso, it is believed that the person who meditates while keeping Lord Hanuman in their mind and chants his mantras always receives the blessings of Bajrang Bali. Additionally, all the troubles and problems in their life are eliminated leading to various miracles. \n\n\nSouthern India\n\nIn Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Hanuman Jayanti is celebrated on the new moon day in Margali (Dhanu) month. Famous Hanuman temples in these states like Nanganallur, Namakkal, Suchindram, Thrikkaviyoor and Alathiyoor celebrate this day with pomp.\nIn Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Hanuman Jayanti is celebrated for 41 days, beginning on Chaitra Purnima, and concluding on the tenth day during Krishna Paksha in Vaishaka.\n\n\nMaharashtra\nIn Maharashtra, Hanuman Jayanti is celebrated on the full moon day (pūrnima) of the Hindu lunar month of Chaitra. A special feature of Hanuman Jayanti is that according to some religious almanacs (panchāngs) the birthday of Hanuman falls on the fourteenth day (chaturdashi) in the dark fortnight of the month of Ashvin, while according to others it falls on the full moon day in the bright fortnight of Chaitra. On this day in a Hanuman temple, spiritual discourses begin at dawn since Hanuman is believed to have been born during sunrise. During the time frame of birth, the spiritual discourse are halted and the offering of food (prasadam) is distributed to everyone. Spiritual discourses are organised in most of the Hindu temples of the region on this day.\n\n\nOdisha\nIn Odisha, Pana Sankranti (April 13/14/15) is believed to be the birthday of Hanuman. Devotees visit temples and chant the Hanuman Chalisa throughout the day. Reading the Sundara Kanda book of the Ramayana on this day is also said to be a pious exercise. The day also marks the beginning of the New Year in the traditional Odia Solar Calendar. The festival occurs in the solar Odia calendar (the lunisolar Hindu calendar followed in Odisha) on the first day of the traditional solar month of Meṣa.\n\n\nSee also\nNarasimha Jayanti\nRama Navami\nKrishna Janmashtami\nAnjaneya Temple, Nanganallur\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Hanuman Jayanti at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "The fourth series of the British medical drama television series Casualty commenced airing in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 8 September 1989 and finished on 1 December 1989.\n\n\nProduction\nPeter Norris serves as the producer of series four, replacing original producer Geraint Morris, who left to produce The Bill. He was hired by Jonathan Powell, the head of drama at the BBC, following his work on The Rainbow. Norris admitted that he jumped at the chance to produce Casualty. He then hired a casting director and worked with script editor Susan Gander to create new characters. Casualty is based in the fictional city of Holby, which was originally localised to Bristol, where the drama is filmed. Norris wanted to change this and removed the show's obvious Bristolian mannerisms. One of these included Duffy's West Country accent, which was dropped suddenly, as well as the introduction of Geordie character Jimmy Powell.\nThe drama was moved to a post-watershed Friday night time slot from a Saturday night time slot for this series. Shipton explained that producers wanted to create an \"urban feel\" to the show by moving it to a later time slot. Norris wanted to use this opportunity to portray \"tougher\" stories, so he hired writers who wanted to tell stories about special issues and gave them the freedom to do so. While the first three series of Casualty explored the political side of the NHS, Norris wanted series four to explore social issues which were not portrayed in the media. The change in time slot and difference in stories proved successful and ratings grew to over 13 million viewers.\nThe series opens with a road accident, described as \"spectacular\" by Hilary Kingsley, the author of Casualty: The Inside Story. The stunt features the most vehicles the show had included to date and used drums of hydrofluoric acid. During filming, one of the drums was pushed too fast, causing it to head towards the camera crew. Norris confessed that he was completing paperwork about the incident for a year afterwards. The series finale features a terrorist attack at a department store. Norris described the making of the episode \"a lark\" and compared the set to Gone with the Wind with the blood stains on-set. The episode was scheduled for the same week as a remembrance service for the victims of the 1987 Remembrance Day bombing, which concerned the production team. However, there was no complaints, which Norris accredited to Morris previously defending other series of the drama. \n\n\nCast\n\nThe fourth series of Casualty features a cast of characters working in the emergency department of Holby City Hospital. Derek Thompson continues his role as charge nurse Charlie Fairhead, while Brenda Fricker plays state enrolled nurse Megan Roach. Cathy Shipton stars as sister Lisa \"Duffy\" Duffin, and Eddie Nestor appears as staff nurse Cyril James. Geoffrey Leesley portrays paramedic Keith Cotterill, and Susan Franklyn appears as administrator Valerie Sinclair.\nRobson Green was cast as Geordie hospital porter Jimmy Powell following the decision to delocalise the show's setting. Three actors were cast in single-series regular roles. Tam Hoskyns joined the cast as senior house officer Lucy Perry, who was billed as \"all books and brains but no practice and compassion\". Alex Spencer, portrayed by Belinda Davidson, was introduced as a middle-class student nurse, and Julie Stevens, played by Vivienne McKone, appeared as the overcompensating receptionist.\nEpisode one also marked the first appearance of paramedic Josh Griffiths, portrayed by Ian Bleasdale. The actor had been hired by director Andrew Morgan in a guest role for a couple of episodes and would later join the regular cast in future series. William Gaminara appeared in four episodes as registrar Andrew Bower, who became a love interest for Duffy. He departed after writers decided to create tragedy for the character of Duffy. At the conclusion of the series, Nestor and Franklyn left their roles as Cyril and Valerie, respectively.\n\n\nMain characters\n\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nKingsley, Hilary (1995).

She made her major label debut with Universal Music Japan in 2020. Her stage name is short for \"Asian wish child,\" which is the literal meaning of the Japanese characters in her given name.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAwich was born in Naha, Okinawa on December 16, 1986. Because Okinawa is home to many U.S. military bases, Awich was exposed to American culture at an early age. As a young girl, she idolized Tupac and credits Tupac songs with helping her learn English. She wrote her first lyrics at age 13, and gave her first public hip hop performance at age 14. At age 19, she moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where she met and married an American husband and gave birth to a daughter. She also earned a bachelor's degree in business and marketing from the University of Indianapolis in 2011. However, her husband was incarcerated and later was murdered after his release from prison, at which point Awich returned to Japan with her daughter.\n\n\nCareer\nAwich made her musical debut in Japan prior to her move to the United States. In 2006, she independently released an album titled Asian Wish Child.\nFollowing her return to Japan from the United States, Awich initially focused on building up her self-founded branding company Cypher City, which works to market Okinawan products overseas. However, she soon returned to the world of hip hop music.\n\nIn 2017, Awich joined the Japanese hip hop collective Yentown as its only female member, and began building her mainstream career. With the label, she released two studio albums, 8 and Peacock, as well as two extended plays, Beat and Heart. In 2020, Awich signed with Universal Music Japan sublabel Universal J. Her first release under the label was Partition, her fifth extended play. Two promotional singles, \"Shook Shook\" and \"Bad Bad\" were released from the EP. Later that year, she released a cover of \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" and an original song titled \"Present\". In 2021, Awich released two singles, \"Gila Gila\" and \"Kuchi ni Dashite\". Her 2007 debut album was re-released digitally by LD&K Inc in September. In March 2022, her major label debut album, Queendom was released. In May, Awich released the single \"Tsubasa\" to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Okinawa's return to Japanese sovereignty in 1972. The song features vocals from her daughter, Yomi.\n\nAwich headlined at Budokan in 2022 after the release of her fourth studio album. With five studio albums (produced primarily by music producer Chaki Zulu), Awich also performed at Fuji Rock Festival in 2022. Her aim has been to become the \"Queen of Japanese hiphop\":Before I knew I had the potential to be big and famous, but I didn’t have the guts to be at the center of everything. Now, I’m aiming to be the queen of Japan. Period. With that comes responsibility.

He was born and raised in Armenia.\n\n\nKingship\nArtaxias II ascended to the Armenian throne in 30 BC as he regained the throne lost by his father. The Roman Triumvir Mark Antony, had captured Artavasdes II with his family, who were then taken as political prisoners to Alexandria where Artavasdes II was later executed on the orders of Cleopatra VII of Egypt. Artaxias II managed to escape and fled to King Phraates IV of Parthia. Phraates IV invaded Armenia and placed Artaxias II on the throne.  As a result, Artaxias II was pro-Parthian and anti-Roman.  With the support of Phraates IV, Artaxias II was successful in a military campaign against Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, a former enemy of Artavasdes II.\nArtaxias II was said to be spiteful and vengeful.  He massacred the remaining Roman garrison and slaughtered all the Roman traders in Armenia. A possible consequence of this action, when Artaxias II sent emissaries in Rome to try to secure the release of his family then in Roman captivity and the Roman emperor Augustus refused Artaxias II's request.\nArtaxias II proved to be an unpopular leader with his people. As the Armenians lost faith in their ruling monarch, they sent messengers to Augustus requesting him to remove Artaxias II from his throne and to install his brother, Tigranes III as his successor. By 20 BC, Tigranes III had lived in Rome for 10 years. Augustus agreed to the request from the Armenians. Augustus sent his step-son Tiberius, with Tigranes III and a large army to depose Artaxias II. Before Tiberius and Tigranes III arrived in Armenia, a cabal within the palace was successful in murdering Artaxias II. The Romans installed Tigranes III as the new king of Armenia unopposed.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nR. Naroll, V.L. Bullough & F.

    "text": "The Comminges (French pronunciation: [kɔmɛ̃ʒ]; Occitan/Gascon: Comenge) is an ancient region of southern France in the foothills of the Pyrenees, corresponding approximately to the arrondissement of Saint-Gaudens in the department of Haute-Garonne. This region is normally associated with the former domain of the Counts of Comminges, although earlier definitions are based on the Diocese of Comminges or the territory of the Convenae.\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence of early human habitation has been found at several caves or rock shelters in the area, including the Cave of Aurignac where artifacts indicated habitation about 35,000 years ago.\nIn pre-Roman times, Comminges was part of a larger area inhabited by the Aquitani. Classical authors such as Julius Caesar and Strabo clearly distinguished the Aquitani from the other peoples of Gaul, and noted their similarity to the tribes of the Iberian Peninsula.\nComminges takes its name from the Convenae, the name the Romans gave to the inhabitants of the region.   Whilst it is unclear whether this was originally a distinct tribe (the latin word convenae can be translated as 'strangers', or 'those gathered here'), the Romanisation of the region established this as the identity of the area and its inhabitants.\nThe main town of the area was named Lugdunum Convenarum by the Romans. Saint Jerome claimed that the town was founded by Pompey in 72 BC, but extensive archaeological investigations have failed to find any evidence of this and scholars doubt the claim.  During the Augustan period, the town was substantially Romanised and expanded.  The remains of large Gallo-Roman villas at Valentine, Martres-Tolosane and Montmaurin suggest that the process of Romanisation spread well beyond Lugdunum.\nThere was a growing Christian community, which by the late fourth century became the Diocese of Comminges based at Lugdunum.  In 1083 Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain became bishop of Comminges and built the cathedral and Romanesque cloister at Lugdunum.  He was canonised as Saint Bertrand in the 13th century and the town took the name Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges.\nThe origin of the name Comminges is uncertain.  It is often claimed to date from 473, when Sidonius Apollinaris wrote of the death of the bishop of Comminges, or 506 when Suavis, Bishop of Comminges, attended the Council of Agde.  However, the original latin texts of the relevant documents use the term Convenae or Convenis rather than Comminges.  There are a number of documents concerning the Counts of the Comminges from the 12th century.  Those written in latin typically use the name Convenarum, whilst those written in Gascon or Old French usually use the name Comenge.\n\nComminges was part of Gascony. Around 820, Aznar Sanchez was made Count of Vasconia Citerior (i.e. Gascony) by King Pepin I of Aquitaine, the grandson of Charlemagne. He made his son Garcia Aznar Viscount of Comminges (or Convenarum) in 833.  After his father died Garcia Aznar became Count of Comminges and Couseran.\nOver the centuries, the size of the county varied, stretching to Toulouse at times. The small, discontinuous province of Nébouzan was contained within the Comminges and its viscounts were vassals of the counts of Comminges.\nAlthough the Comminges was just outside the Cathar area, during the Albigensian Crusade Count Bernard IV de Comminges sided with the Cathar forces led by Peter II of Aragon and Raymond VI of Toulouse but, at the Battle of Muret in 1213, they were defeated by the forces of Simon de Montfort the elder  who occupied the Comminges. In 1215, the fourth Lateran Council awarded the County of Toulouse to de Montfort, but returned the Comminges to Bernard IV.  However, it was not until the death of Simon de Montford in the siege of Toulouse in 1218 that Bernard regain control of his county.\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, the army of Edward the Black Prince passed through the Comminges twice in 1355, burning towns in the north of the county.\nThe line of the Counts of Comminges continued until Marguerite died in 1443, when the county was willed to the French crown. After two interim rulers, it finally came under the rule of the French crown in 1498, although it retained its identity as a county.  It was established as a pays d'état, meaning that it was effectively run by the Estates of Comminges (a type of local parliament), until 1622.\nDuring the French wars of religion (1562–1598) the Comminges remained Catholic. A few towns were attacked by Huguenot forces and Saint-Gaudens was looted in 1569, but most of the county remained safe. However it was required to provide troops and taxes to support the wars.\nWith the reorganisation of the regions into departments in 1790, Comminges wanted to join its eastern neighbour, the county of Couserans, to form a department but this broke down over arguments about where the prefecture would be located. Eventually Couserans joined with the county of Foix, leaving the Comminges to be joined with the larger county of Toulouse to form the Haute-Garonne département. At the same time the diocese of Comminges was abolished and replaced with a larger diocese aligned with the new department.\nThe region still identifies itself as the Comminges and Saint-Gaudens, its largest town, calls itself \"capital of the Comminges\".\n\n\nIn film and television\nIn 2017, the Netflix TV series The Frozen Dead (aka Glacé) was filmed in the region.\n\n\nSee also\nSaint Bertrand of Comminges\nDuchy of Vasconia\nSpanish: House of Comminges\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources and external links\nRome in the Pyrenees - Lugdunum and the Convenae from the first century B.C. to the seventh century A.D.

    "text": "Hideaki Sorachi (空知 英秋, Sorachi Hideaki; born May 25, 1979) is the pen name of a Japanese manga artist, most well known for his manga Gintama, which began serialization in 2003 and ended in 2019. He has also written numerous one-shots, including Dandelion, for which he won the Tenkaichi Honourable Mention Manga Award in 2002. Sorachi's distinctive sense of humour and writing style has been the subject of academic research papers. As of February 2018, the Gintama manga has sold 55 million units in Japan.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nHideaki Sorachi was born on May 25, 1979, in Takikawa of Hokkaido, Japan. Sorachi has stated that his pen name is derived from the Sorachi prefecture in Hokkaido, but Hideaki is a part of his real name. He has an older sister, and occasionally shares stories about her in the end notes of manga volumes.\nSorachi has commented that he prefers using analog writing implements as opposed to creating digital art; his most used writing utensil being the calligraphy brush pen. He also uses felt-tip and permanent markers, and a round-nib and G-pen.\nIn an interview, Sorachi described how watching Castle in the Sky in his childhood inspired him to start drawing manga, and how he feels like he “is always chasing after a castle in the sky”. From a young age, he read various manga series, and he drew manga during breaks in elementary school. However, after his father ridiculed a manga he drew in 4th grade, Sorachi decided to give up on his dream of becoming a manga artist.\nSorachi entered a university in Hokkaido, studying a degree in advertising. He recounted feeling unsure of his career path while enrolled at university, considering following his interests in both architecture and creating computer graphics. After graduating, Sorachi considered himself to be a \"NEET\", and sent his first work, Dandelion, to a publisher whilst being unsure of its potential success.\nSorachi has stated that he does not use social media, including Twitter, as he “intend[s] to eliminate stress through manga”.\n\n\nCareer\nSorachi, unemployed after graduating university, was able to live off Dandelion. Soon afterwards, he began writing the storyline for Gintama.\nAt the start of the serialisation of Gintama, the series lacked popularity and support, leading to a potential cancellation. While the first edition of the physical tankōbon volumes completely sold out, Shueisha had only printed the minimum number of volumes and still considered the sales to be “poor”. Sorachi believed that the manga was unlikely to become popular, and recounted other people also telling him that the manga would not surpass the printing of two tankōbon volumes. However, interest in the manga slowly increased, to the extent that Sorachi found he did not have “any fresh material to use” after the release of the third volume. He later stated that he was overjoyed when the manga was adapted into an anime, and, until then, hadn't fully grasped the extent to which the series was popular. Gintama was featured in the 2005 Jump Festa Anime Tour, which Sorachi visited and recounted seeing “the crowd’s reaction and realised that people actually knew about Gintama.”\n\n\nWriting style and influences\nResearchers have credited the popularity of the Gintama series to Sorachi's uniquely humorous characters and satirisation of contemporary themes. It has been described by Sorachi as “Gently painting the life of a loser, a really likeable kind of humanity and reality”, stating that the appeal of the manga's characters are due to their relatable, flawed nature. Smith has described the series as an “Edo-era comedy decked out in science fiction trappings and alternative historical versions of famous characters”.\nCritics have also complimented Sorachi's distinctive sense of humour, often satirising Japanese pop culture, or frequent use of vulgar language and toilet humour. Smith has considered Gintama’s balance of comedic elements and drama as representing Sorachi’s unique style and approach to characters.\nSorachi stated that reading Wanpakku Comics had the greatest influence on his work as a manga artist, though was also inspired by popular series such as Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball and Shigeru Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitarou. He also mentioned that watching various variety shows and historical films served as creative inspiration for Gintama. Sorachi has stated that the midnight radio program Attack Young, by Akashi Eiichirou, inspired his satirical humour.\n\nIn the early stages of production for Gintama, Sorachi stated that his editor encouraged him to write a story about the Japanese shinsengumi, due to the popularity of a TV drama called Shinsengumi! that was airing at the time. However, he felt that his creativity would be limited by the genre of historical fiction and thus decided to incorporate the shinsengumi as side characters in a science-fiction and comedy manga.\nThe first year of the release of Gintama coincided with the airing of Shinsengumi!, during which the manga consisted mostly of shorter stories to establish the characters and the world they were situated in, as Sorachi wanted to minimise the potential overlap of the two texts. However, following the first year of serialisation, Sorachi stated that he grew more comfortable with extending the storyline of the manga to include more serious themes and dramatic moments, whilst keeping his uniquely comedic and fantastical characterisation of modern Japan.\nSorachi's inspiration for the initial characterisation of the shinsengumi in Gintama was Ryotaro Shiba’s Moeyo Ken. This characterisation was then further developed and adapted through the audience reception of Gintama, by mail, weekly surveys, and sales data.\nThe character Hijikata Tōshirō in Gintama is considered to be Sorachi’s rendition of the popular protagonist Hijikata Toshizō in Moeyo Ken. Critics consider Tōshirō’s character to be the “embodiment of [Shinsengumi] values and virtues” within the manga, and is a major supporting character. Sorachi stated that he initially wanted to make Hijikata the main character, but instead decided to create Gintoki Sakata as a “strong main character . . . who’s not part of an organisation” to make the series more memorable.\nIn an interview with QuickJapan, Sorachi details the romantic appeal of the shinsengumi as characters and in Japanese pop culture:\n“As for historical periods that see great changes, like Bakumatsu or Sengoku, you witness humanity under extreme conditions, and it brings out the good and the bad of humanity. I like that.”\nSorachi's characterisation of women has been considered by academic reviewers as a subversion of stereotypical female archetypes in fiction, particularly through the rejection of conventional behaviours of women in manga. He mentioned that he dislikes the trope of typical manga with “unnaturally” cute female leads, and therefore created the character of Kagura in Gintama with the intention of portraying a “female lead who could throw up but still make people think she’s adorable”. However, Sorachi later realised that such characters were also unrealistic, though considered her character as a creative “challenge”.\n\n\nAppearances on Gintama\nSorachi has appeared on Gintama, both the manga and the anime, in a short comedy segment, often on the subject of writing and working as a manga artist. His character is drawn as a humanoid gorilla wearing a yellow shirt with the Japanese kanji 俺 (I, me). Sorachi voices this character himself in the Japanese Gintama anime. Sorachi has also appeared in a life-sized suit of this character for promotional interviews on Gintama movie releases. In these appearances, a cast member will read out a letter written by Sorachi, about the stages of production or effort which went into creating the movie, frequented by sudden, comical one-liners.\n\n\nCrossovers and appearances\nKenta Shinohara (author of Sket Dance) used to be his assistant, as well as Yōichi Amano (author of Akaboshi: Ibun Suikoden). Gintama and Sket Dance had a crossover chapter in Weekly Shōnen Jump, marking the 360th chapter for Gintama and the 180th for Sket Dance. The author for One Piece, Eiichiro Oda, also drew the main characters Gintoki Sakata from Gintama and Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece for the Gintama exhibition, and gave commentary on the series.\nSeveral other Weekly Shōnen Jump series have been referenced or parodied in Gintama, including One Piece, Naruto, and Dragon Ball. The second season of the anime adaptation of Shūichi Asō's The Disastrous Life of Saiki K also featured a crossover with Gintama.\nDuring the premiere of the film Gintama: The Very Final, Sorachi hand drew physical cards of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba characters, including the protagonist Tanjiro, which were then offered to those attending the film's release. Sorachi wrote that the cards were acknowledging the success of the movie Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train.\n\n\nWorks\nDandelion — one shot, 2002 (featured in volume 1 of Gintama)\nShirokuro — one shot, 2003 (featured in volume 2 of Gintama)\n13 — one shot, 2008 (featured in volume 24 of Gintama)\nBankara — one shot, 2010 (featured in volume 38 of Gintama)\nGintama — manga series, 2003–2019\n3rd Year Z Class: GinPachi Sensei — light novels, 2006 – 2013 (illustrator)\n\n\nAwards\nHideaki Sorachi received an honourable mention for the 71st Tenkaichi Manga award for his debut work, Dandelion. The Tenkaichi Manga Award was held from August 1996 to March 2003, replacing the Hop ☆ Step Award as a monthly newcomer award for Shōnen Jump, held by Shueisha. Sorachi later described, in an interview, that winning the award aided his career as a manga artist.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHideaki Sorachi  at Anime News Network's encyclopedia",

    "text": "Harvey A. Marcelin (born May 21, 1938), also known as Marceline Harvey, is an American transgender identified murderer and suspected serial killer of women.\nConvicted of murdering two girlfriends in New York in separate instances over several decades, both of which were committed after being released from prison. Marcelin is currently awaiting trial for a third murder committed under allegedly similar circumstances.\n\n\nEarly life\nHarvey A. Marcelin was born on May 21, 1938, in Harlem, New York City, the only son and child of a shipping clerk and a seamstress who later moved to Washington Heights. According to later interviews, Marcelin was spoiled by both of her parents and grew up in a relatively stable environment.\nWhen she was ten, her father died, after which Marcelin had to be brought up by her mother. She attended kindergarten and later a Catholic school run by the St. Aloysius Catholic Church in Harlem where, according to Marcelin, she was sexually abused, whipped and forced to eat expired food by the nuns. As a result, she experienced many emotional and behavioral problems, and by her teenage years, she had begun to engage in sexually deviant behavior.\nBy her own admission, Marcelin first began cross-dressing in 1951 after attending a Halloween party, after which she reportedly began suffering from gender dysphoria and had sex with a man for the first time. Around this time, her mental health began to decline rapidly, with the then-14-year-old being accused of attempting to sexually assault an 8-year-old girl in 1952. Not long after, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the summer of that year for evaluation on behalf of Catholic Charities USA. The medical reports noted that at that time, Marcelin was a noted truant who committed thefts and regularly engaged in sexual activity with men and women alike. Upon her release, Marcelin returned to school and graduated in 1956, but soon returned to her criminal lifestyle.\n\n\nHospitalization\nIn 1957, she was charged with a burglary, convicted and spent several months in the county jail. After being released, Marcelin spent the period from the late 1950s to 1963 living with her mother and working as a copy machine operator, as she had difficulty finding a stable source of income due to her mental illness and drug addiction. Despite her repeated internments, psychiatrists could never reach a consensus on what exactly she suffered from.\nOn April 9, 1962, Marcelin voluntarily sought treatment at the Bellevue Hospital, where she remained until April 16, whereupon she was discharged to her wife's custody. Tests conducted during this time established that she showed signs of chronic schizophrenia, delusions and a paranoid personality.\n\n\nPrevious murders\n\n\nJacqueline Bonds\nIn the early 1960s, Marcelin married a woman named Florence Jackson, but their relationship proved troublesome, as Marcelin often cheated on Florence with other women. In early 1962, Marcelin met 24-year-old Jacqueline Bonds, with whom she soon began an intimate relationship. However, Bonds soon began to accuse her of being aggressive and eventually ended their affair – this caused Marcelin to start stalking and sexually harassing her, as well as threaten to \"get her\" in front of her mother.\nIn March 1963, Marcelin, along with her newest girlfriend, Clementine Benifield, were arrested in Brooklyn on charges of attempted rape, second-degree assault and burglary. After her arrest, she claimed that Bonds was with them at the time of the crimes, and Bonds was promptly detained, but when it later became clear that she played a small role, the prosecutors offered her a plea deal - in exchange for testifying against her co-defendants, she would be granted immunity from prosecution. While the investigation was still underway, Marcelin was released from prison after her mother paid her bail.\nOn April 18, Marcelin went to Bonds' apartment on 2216 Eight Avenue in Manhattan and got into an argument with her in the hallway, during which Marcelin pulled out a .32 caliber revolver and shot her. Bonds then ran into her bedroom, but was shot again twice, staggering and collapsing into the living room, where she succumbed to her injuries. She was arrested shortly afterwards and taken to the Bellevue Hospital for a psychiatric assessment. The examining psychiatrists ruled that while she suffered from a schizoid personality disorder with sociopathic traits, Marcelin was sane and could stand trial.\n\n\nTrial and incarceration\nAt the trial, Marcelin was found guilty of murdering Bonds on November 18, 1963, and was sentenced to a life term with a chance of parole after a jury deadlocked on the death penalty. When asked why she did it, she claimed that she killed Bonds out of jealousy, since Bonds was beautiful and popular and Marcelin did not want her to be with other men.\nAfter her conviction, Marcelin was transferred between the various prison facilities across New York. In 1971, she participated in the Attica Prison riot, which would later become one of the most famous and significant events of the prisoners' rights movement by bringing more attention to their demands for political rights and better living conditions. The riot caused a public outcry across the nation and attracted media attention after it was violently suppressed by the police. After the riot ended, a number of inmates were transferred to other prisons, including Marcelin. In November of that year, she was interviewed by reporters and described what had happened, stating that the rioters had been bullied by prison staff at the facilities they were transferred to.\nFor many years, her parole applications were repeatedly denied due to her aggressive behavior towards women and sending inappropriate letters to hospital volunteers. In May 1984, after serving more than 21 years in prison, Marcelin was granted parole with lifetime supervision and released.\n\n\nAnna Miranda\nAfter her release, Marcelin returned to New York City, where she found lodging in a room at the Cambridge Residence Hotel in Harlem. Due to financial difficulties, she had trouble finding employment after her release and earned a living by renting out her hotel room. She also spent a great amount of time amongst prostitutes and pimps, as well as homeless people who struggled from various forms of alcoholism and drug addictions.\nIn early 1985, she met 29-year-old Anna Laura Serrera Miranda, a heroin addict and prostitute who soon became her lodger and roommate. On October 29, Marcelin, who had recently ingested crack cocaine, stabbed Miranda to death during an argument, after which she dismembered the corpse, put it into black plastic garbage bags and then scattered them around various areas of Central Park. She was quickly arrested after the remains were discovered, as her neighbor Roberto Romano had seen her carrying blood-soaked bags the day after the murder.\n\n\nTrial and incarceration\nDuring interrogations, Marcelin fully admitted to killing Miranda, but insisted she had done so in self-defense. According to Marcelin, they had gotten into an argument because Miranda stopped paying her rent and stole several items from the hotel room, including a flute and cufflinks. She claimed that she was never aggressive with Miranda and cared for her, while she often left for days at a time without explanation. An autopsy concluded that Miranda had been stabbed a total of 33 times.\nBecause she had committed a felony, Marcelin's parole was revoked and she was returned to prison to continue serving her life term. In 1986, she was convicted of killing Miranda, but the charges were downgraded to manslaughter following a guilty plea, adding only 12 years to her existing life term. She was allowed to apply for parole, and as a result, from 1985 to 2019, she applied for parole a total of 15 times, but was always denied due to the severity of her crimes. Some of the arguments for her parole ranged from asking for a new trial to getting involved in a class action lawsuit for her involvement in the Attica prison riot, as well as labeling an all-female parole board \"sexist\" for denying her parole.\nIn 1993, while incarcerated at the Auburn Correctional Facility, Marcelin met with a transsexual inmate who advised her to start taking the hormone therapy medication Premarin, after which Marcelin completely dedicated herself to transitioning. In 2019, she was finally granted parole by the Parole Board after they took into account her advanced age; successful completion of multiple rehabilitation programs; graduate degree in computer science and technology; and letters from various volunteer organizations that pledged to provide her with housing and employment if released.\nMarcelin was granted parole a second time on August 7, 2019, at the age of 81, having spent nearly 55 years incarcerated since the murder of Jacqueline Bonds.\n\n\nMurder of Susan Leyden\n\n\nMeeting and falling out\nAfter her release, the 81-year-old Marcelin returned to New York City, now presenting as a transsexual woman and going under the name \"Marceline Harvey\". In late 2019, while visiting the Tompkins Square Park in East Village, she met Susan Leyden, a 68-year-old lesbian living in a Fort Greene-based homeless shelter for LGBT people. At the time she met Marcelin, Leyden suffered from an undisclosed mental illness and was addicted to drugs, but was formerly a successful entrepreneur who owned a jewelry store in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which she had to abandon in the late 2010s due to her declining mental health.\nSoon after they became acquainted with one another, they started living at the shelter and developed romantic feelings for one another. A few months later, Marcelin and Leyden found housing in Manhattan, which they paid for with their various welfare checks. Despite her advanced age and long imprisonment, Marcelin was able to quickly adapt to social life and to the Internet, establishing accounts on social networks such as Facebook. She also began to live an active social life, spending much of her free time outdoors, trying to get to know women and having intimate relationships. On her social media accounts, Marcelin posted pictures of herself with makeup and various female wigs. At around this time, two other women became close friends with her and often came to the apartment she shared with Leyden.\n\n\nDiscovery and arrest\nIn late February 2022, investigators allege that Marcelin stabbed Leyden to death and later dismembered her corpse, parts of which were subsequently scattered around various blocks in New York City. Leyden's torso was found wrapped in a multicolored bag with a flower decal by a passer-by in a shopping cart several blocks away from the apartment on March 3, prompting police to question her about the gruesome discovery.\nOn the following day, Marcelin was arrested at the apartment following a police search which uncovered Leyden's severed head, a power saw, and bloody sheets. Police also reviewed surveillance footage that covered the entryway of the apartment building where Leyden and Marcelin lived, with the footage showing that Leyden was last seen alive entering the building on February 27. In the following days, only Marcelin was seen on the footage, and until her arrest, she was seen traveling with a purse that belonged to Leyden. In addition to this, surveillance footage from a local hardware store taken on March 1 showed her and an unidentified woman purchasing a power saw, trash bags and cleaning supplies. On the next day, footage from a grocery store showed Marcelin riding a mobility scooter with what appeared to be a severed human leg on the seat, which was clearly visible when she got off the scooter to browse the merchandise.\n\n\nCharges and theories about motive\nOn March 30, 2022, Marcelin was charged with second-degree murder and concealment of a corpse, to which she pleaded not guilty. Police have thus far been unable to establish a motive for the murder. An examination of Marcelin's social media accounts revealed that she initially established contact with Leyden in 2019, and throughout 2020 and 2021, she repeatedly used Leyden's photos as her social media profile picture. In October 2021, just months before Leyden's murder, Marcelin responded to a comment made by Leyden by simply saying \"Love personified\". Police speculate that the feelings were not mutual and that Leyden was actually afraid of Marcelin and wanted to end their relationship, which in turn could have further motivated the murder. In November 2020, Marcelin uploaded a photo of a young blonde woman as her Facebook profile's main picture - in response, Leyden posted a negative comment, calling her a \"freak\".\n\n\nMarcelin's version of events\nAfter her arrest, Marcelin was interviewed in Rikers Island by a reporter for The New York Post, during which she gave details of her biography and her version of events. In the interview, she admitted responsibility for the murders of Bonds and Miranda, but categorically denied killing Leyden, instead blaming one of the female acquaintances who frequented the apartment. She claimed that the two women were sexually attracted to her and were jealous of Leyden, but as she did not reciprocate, they decided to kill Leyden while she was away and frame her for the murder.\nMarcelin also said that she has a split personality, with one identity periodically replacing the other. She described the female identity, Marceline Harvey, as a peaceful, caring lesbian, while the male one - Harvey - was a \"bad guy\" who was misogynistic, a deviant and very aggressive. A number of acquaintances of Marcelin who were interviewed at a later date expressed disgust and disbelief in regards to the crime committed, with a friend of Leyden's saying that whoever the killer was, they deserved either life without parole or the death penalty.\n\n\nTrial\nMarcelin's trial for the murder of Susan Leyden began on March 1, 2024, and is currently ongoing.\n\n\nIn the media\nNBC New York TV report — The Timeline of Harvey Marcelin.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMarcelin v.

It is located in the City of Charles Sturt.\n\n\nHistory\nThe 'Village of Bowden' was established in 1839 by James Hurtle Fisher, who named it after his native village in Northamptonshire.\nBowden had a post office open from 1970 until 1991. Before 1970 the office in the area was named Ovingham; after 1991 the Brompton office has provided postal services.\nIn October 2008, Premier Mike Rann and Infrastructure Minister Patrick Conlon announced the purchase of the 10-hectare Clipsal factory site in Bowden to become a new \"green village\".  They announced plans for up to 1,500 medium- and high-density Green Star residential apartments, with retail outlets and commercial offices set around a town centre, for the former industrial site. The $1 billion Bowden development was designed to be a \"transport-oriented development\"(TOD) as envisaged by The 30-Year Plan for Greater Adelaide. At the on-site announcement, Mr Rann said the development was expected to take 12 to 15 years to complete.\nIn 2010, the State Government purchased the adjacent Origin Energy site (formerly Brompton Gasworks).\nConstruction on the first stage and parks were officially opened in May 2013 by Premier Jay Weatherill. Construction commenced on first residential dwellings in 2013. First residents moved into their homes in 2014.\n\n\nGeography\nThe suburb is primarily bounded by the Grange/Outer Harbor railway line, the Gawler railway line and Park Terrace.\n\n\nDemographics\n\nThe 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 648 persons in Bowden on census night. Of these, 51.2% were male and 48.8% were female. Within ten years, the 2016 Census recorded 911 people in Bowden, with 52% being male and 48% being female, and further increased to 1,808 people in 2021, with 51.1% recorded as male and 48.9% as female.\nThe majority of residents (60.8%) are of Australian birth, with other common census responses being England (4.6%), China (4.1%), Malaysia (2.0%), and India (1.5%), New Zealand (1.3%). Additionally, people of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander descent made up 1.2% of the suburb. \nIn terms of religious affiliation, 58.2% of residents attributed themselves to being irreligious, 11.4% attributed themselves to being Catholic, 3.7% attributed themselves to be Anglican, and 2.9% attributed themselves to being Muslim. \n\n\nPolitics\n\n\nLocal government\nBowden is part of Hindmarsh Ward in the City of Charles Sturt local government area, being represented in that council by Paul Alexandrides and Alice Campbell.\n\n\nState and federal\nBowden lies in the state electoral district of Croydon and the federal electoral division of Adelaide.

The government's efforts to regulate, monitor, and provide oversight regarding Internet use has been referred to as a \"Bamboo Firewall\". \nThe OpenNet Initiative classified the level of filtering in Vietnam as pervasive in the political, as substantial in the Internet tools, and as selective in the social and conflict/security areas in 2011, while Reporters Without Borders consider Vietnam an \"internet enemy\".\nAccording to a 2006 report by the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University while the government of Vietnam claims to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content through its blocking efforts, most of its filtering efforts are aimed at blocking sites with politically or religiously sensitive materials that might undermine the Communist Party and the stability of its one-party rule. Amnesty International reported many instances of Internet activists being arrested for their online activities.\n\n\nBackground\nUnder its 1997 decree regarding Internet usage, the General Director of the General Postal Bureau has the exclusive authority and primary role in managing the Internet. \n\n\nLegal framework\nRegulatory responsibility for Internet material is divided along subject-matter lines with the Ministry of Culture and Information focusing on sexually explicit or violent content, while the Ministry of Public Security monitors politically sensitive content. Vietnam nominally guarantees freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly through constitutional provisions, but state security laws and other regulations reduce these formal protections in practice. All information stored on, sent over, or retrieved from the Internet must comply with Vietnam's Press Law, Publication Law, and other laws, including state secrets and intellectual property protections. All domestic and foreign individuals and organizations involved in Internet activity in Vietnam are legally responsible for content created, disseminated, and stored. It is unlawful to use Internet resources or host material that opposes the state; destabilizes Vietnam's security, economy, or social order; incites opposition to the state; discloses state secrets; infringes organizations’ or individuals’ rights; or interferes with the state's DNS servers. Law on Information Technology was enacted in June 2006. Those who violate Internet use rules are subject to a range of penalties, from fines to criminal liability for offenses such as causing chaos or security disorder.\nA 2010 law required public Internet providers, such as Internet cafes, hotels, and businesses providing free Wi-Fi, to install software to track users' activities.\nIn September 1, 2013, Decree 72 came into effect; making it illegal to distribute any materials online that \"harms national security” or “opposes\" the government, only allows users to \"provide or exchange personal information\" through blogs and social media outlets—banning the distribution of \"general information\" or any information from a media outlet (including state-owned outlets), and requires that foreign web companies operate servers domestically if they target users in Vietnam.\n\n\nCensored content\n\n\nSubversive content\nAccording to a 2007 research by OpenNet Initiative, blocking is concentrated on websites with contents about overseas political opposition, overseas and independent media, human rights, and religious topics. Proxies and circumvention tools, which are illegal to use, are also frequently blocked.\nThe majority of blocked websites are specific to Vietnam: those written in Vietnamese or dealing with issues related to Vietnam. Sites not specifically related to Vietnam or only written in English are rarely blocked. For example, the Vietnamese-language version of the website for Radio Free Asia was blocked by both tested ISPs while the English-language version was only blocked by one. While only the website for the human rights organization Human Rights Watch was blocked in the tested list of global human rights sites, many Vietnamese-language sites only tangentially or indirectly critical of the government were blocked as well as sites strongly critical of the government.\nThe website of the British Broadcasting Corporation (www.bbc.co.uk), which has a significant journalistic presence, is an example of a website that is blocked—albeit intermittently.\n\n\nPornography\nIn November 2019, Vietnamese ISPs blocked porn sites.\n\n\nSocial networking\nThe popular social networking website Facebook has about 8.5 million users in Vietnam and its user base has been growing quickly after the website added a Vietnamese-language interface. During the week of November 16, 2009, Vietnamese Facebook users reported being unable to access the website. Access had been intermittent in the previous weeks, and there were reports of technicians ordered by the government to block access to Facebook.\nA supposedly official decree dated August 27, 2009, was earlier leaked on the Internet, but its authenticity has not been confirmed. The Vietnamese government denied deliberately blocking access to Facebook, and the Internet service provider FPT said that it is working with foreign companies to solve a fault blocking to Facebook's servers in the United States.\nIn June 2025, Vietnamese authorities ordered a nationwide block of the Telegram messaging platform, citing concerns over national security and the spread of illegal content. The ban followed a government report claiming over 68% of Vietnamese Telegram channels were used for activities breaching national laws, and represents a continued tightening of state control over digital communications and social media platforms.\n\n\nBlogging\nIn 2013, Associated Press reported that the Ministry of Information and Communications were preparing new rules that would restrict blogs to personal matters.\nGlobal Voices Advocacy maintains a list of bloggers who have been arrested for their views expressed online. Many bloggers were arrested by the Vietnamese government during the 2011 crackdown on Vietnamese youth activists.\nIn 2020, Medium was blocked.\n\n\nOnline gaming\nOn 7 May 2024. the digital game distribution platform Steam was blocked by most major Vietnamese ISPs, with many users reports an inability to access the storefront. Speculations on the reasoning behind the block was due to government officials \"finding solutions to prevent cross-border services from reaching Vietnamese users\" on grounds of \"releasing games without permissions\". According to the Ministry of Information and Communications, Steam did not respond and comply with them for licensing games to be sold in Vietnam leading to Steam's online services being blocked through ISPs.\n\n\nPersecution for illegal Internet activities\nA component of Vietnam's strategy to control the Internet consists of the arrest of bloggers,\nnetizens and journalists. The goal of these arrests is to prevent dissidents from pursuing their activities, and to persuade others to practice self-censorship. Vietnam is the world's second largest prison for netizens after China.\n\nPhan Thanh Hai, also known as Anh Ba Saigon, was arrested in October 2010 and later charged with promoting \"propaganda against the State\" for spreading false information on his blog, where he had discussed topics such as maritime disputes with China and bauxite mining operations, and had actively supported Vietnamese dissidents.\nBlogger Paulus Lê Sơn was arrested on August 3, 2011, in Hanoi for his attempt to cover the trial of the well known cyberdissident Cu Huy Ha Vu.\nLong time dissident and Catholic priest Nguyen Van Ly is a member of the Bloc 8406 pro-democracy movement. He was arrested on 19 February and sentenced on 30 March 2007 to eight years in prison for committing \"very serious crimes that harmed national security\" by trying to organize a boycott of the upcoming election. He may have suffered a stroke while in prison on 14 November 2009. He was released from prison to receive medical care on 17 March 2010 and was returned to prison in July 2011 despite his old age and poor health.\nBlogger Lư Văn Bảy, also known by the pen-names Tran Bao Viet, Chanh Trung, Hoang Trung Chanh, Hoang Trung Viet and Nguyen Hoang, received a four-year prison sentence plus three years of house arrest in September 2011 on a charge of anti-government propaganda under article 88 of the criminal code. Ten articles calling for multi-party democracy, which he had posted online, were cited by the prosecution during the trial. He was not allowed access to a lawyer at his trial.\nLe Cong Dinh, a prominent Vietnamese lawyer who sat on the defense of many high-profile human rights cases in Vietnam and was critical of bauxite mining in the central highlands of Vietnam was arrested by the Vietnamese government on 13 June 2009 under article 88 of Vietnam's criminal code for \"conducting propaganda against the government\". On 20 January 2010, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for subversion. His co-defendants, Nguyễn Tiến Trung, Trần Huỳnh Duy Thức, and Lê Thang Long received sentences from 7 to 16 years.\nFranco-Vietnamese blogger Pham Minh Hoang was released from prison after serving his 17-month sentence, but remains under a three-year house arrest. He was arrested on 13 August and charged on 20 September 2010 with “carrying out activities with the intent of overthrowing the government\" by virtue of Article 79 of the Penal Code, for having joined the banned opposition party, Viet Tan, and publishing on his blog (pkquoc.multiply.com) opposition articles under the pen name Phan Kien Quoc. According to his wife, Le Thi Kieu Oanh, Pham Minh Hoang was arrested because of his opposition to a Chinese company's plans to mine bauxite in central Vietnam's high plateau region.\nBlogger Dieu Cay was arrested in April 2008 and sentenced in September 2008 for \"tax fraud\". The authorities were actually seeking to silence him after he had publicly called for people to boycott the Ho Chi Minh City leg of the Olympic torch relay on the occasion of Beijing's 2008 Summer Olympics. He was initially supposed to be released in October 2010 after serving his two and one-half year prison sentence, but he was still in detention, while also charged for propaganda against the state and the Party by virtue of Article 88 of the Vietnamese Penal Code. His relatives have had no news of him for months, leading to widespread alarmist rumors. Concerns about his fate and health remain justified as long as the authorities refuse to grant his family visitation rights. He was eventually released in October 2014 and moved to the US\nBlogger Nguyen Van Tinh and poet Tran Duc Thach were released in 2011 after being sentenced in 2009 to three and one-half and three years in prison, respectively, for “propaganda against the socialist state of Vietnam”.\nIn February 2017, the Vietnamese government arrested and prosecuted bloggers and citizen journalists in a crackdown, including Nguyễn Văn Oai and Nguyễn Văn Hoá. Hoá was prosecuted to seven years in prison for reporting about the 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster.\nPham Chi Dung, a prominent independent journalist, chairman of the Vietnam Independent Journalists Society (IJAVN) and founder of the news website vietnamthoibao.org, was arrested on November 21, 2019, by the public security forces of Ho Chi Minh City. He is charged under Article 117 of Vietnam 2015 Criminal Code for “producing, storing, and disseminating” documents opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. While state media asserts that he has participated in “very dangerous and serious conduct that negatively affects national social stability, public order of Ho Chi Minh City,” they can only point out one fact to support that accusation: that he established and organized a “civil society organization.”  The arrest of Pham Chi Dung, is the continuation of an intensified crackdown against political activists.\nNguyen Tuong Thuy, a 68-year-old blogger and IJAVN vice-president, was arrested on 23 May 2020 in Hanoi, where he lives, and was immediately transported 1,700 km south of the capital to Ho Chi Minh City, where he continues to be held. Nguyen Tuong Thuy served in the PAVN for 22 years. Thuy became a reporter for Radio Free Asia (RFA), which is funded by the US Congress.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Jolly Fellows (Russian: Весельчаки, romanized: Veselchaki) is a 2009 comedy-drama film, feature film directorial debut of Felix Mikhailov. It was described as the first Russian film about drag queens.\nIt was screened at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival, and also was the first Russian picture to be chosen as the opening film of the Panorama section at the festival.\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nOverview\nThe action takes place in the late 1990s in Moscow, Russia. At the center of the film is the difficult fate of five men, performers of a drag revue, who meet at a restaurant after the dissolution of their creative troupe. They take turns to give an interview to a young journalist who, after being carried away by their interesting stories, permanently forgets the purpose of the conversation. Everyone has his own way of getting into a drag show, everyone has his own goals in life, everyone has his own destiny.\n\n\nCharacters\n\n\nLusya\nLusya is a young and determined guy who left his home in a remote village deep in the province to conquer the capital. Deciding that everyday life in Moscow did not live up to his expectations, Lusya decides to leave the show and return home to his mother. His colleagues from the show arrange a farewell concert, and in the morning, all five of them as their female alter-egos, put Lusya on the train, arranging an impromptu show at the station. Arriving in his native village, Lusya understands that there is nothing left from his former life. On his way home, he meets an old woman neighbor who tells him the latest news and offers him to stay at her place if he needs to. Suspecting something wrong, Lusya enters the house and sees his inebriated mother in the company of drinking companions. In the evening, Lusya meets a girl who was romantically interested in him but with whom their relationship did not work out. The girl, having learned that Lusya became an artist in Moscow, rushes at him with kisses. Lusya realizes that he must make a coming-out; in a pink suit, Lusya arranges a mini-performance, the audience of which are local village old women and geese.

Owns the club in which the other characters of the film perform. Rosa lives on two fronts and tries to provide his daughter proper attention, but she constantly complains that he spends too little time with her, dresses badly and looks like a \"crazy man\". Despite a sociable facade, Rosa is deeply lonely, which eventually ruins him. Rosa becomes acquainted with an attractive man in a romantic setting, falls for the gentleman act skillfully crafted by the new acquaintance, and ill-advisedly goes along with him to continue their socializing. This affair ends with the death of Rosa at the hands of this new acquaintance; for him the murder of Rosa becomes a kind of revenge for all homosexual humanity as in his early childhood he was raped by a pedophile maniac and since then he has had anger and desire to destroy homosexuals.\n\n\nGelya\nA young boy, whose mother is a well-known Moscow dressmaker who makes costumes for the city's elite. Mother does not know about the passion of her son to wear women's dresses, to wear makeup and copy women's manners. Teenagers suspect Gelya of this interest and a tendency to homosexuality, and tease him in every way, sometimes they beat him and do nasty things to him. Gelya's patience ends, and he, disguised as a girl, goes to a nightclub where he seduces a young man who was the main one among the guys who spoiled his life. The next morning, the guy decides to boast to his friends about his romantic conquest, but the guys become surprised and start laughing at him. In bed, everyone sees Gelya without a woman's costume. In the end, Gelya becomes the youngest participant in the drag show and begins to perform regularly. Once a costume designer comes to their dressing room whom Gelya had never encountered before. Ironically, this costume designer is his own mother. They talk for a long time and as a result the mother accepts Gelya for what he is.\n\n\nFira\nThe soul of the show and one of the oldest participants in it.

At the end of the film, he receives a letter from his boyfriend, in which he confesses that he made a decision to leave home, because Fira is infected with HIV. Heartbroken, Fira decides not to show any emotion and continues on her way to the dacha, where the whole company decided to go on a weekend. Entering the supermarket, the cheerful four arrange another extravagant show.\n\n\nLara\nThe most unusual drag queen of all, who wears a women's costume only on the stage and nowhere else. His story began with during the student years when Lara had to play the role of a gypsy woman at a Komsomol concert and was dressed this way by the organizers. The leadership, who watched the ensemble's rehearsal, was indignant at the performance, especially with the choice of music and Lara was even reprimanded for it. However, this meeting ended in an unexpected way, the talk continued in the apartment of the leader, who suddenly appeared in a female guise. But the encounter ended in a heart attack, and as a result the Komsomol leader's career broke down because the ambulance took him away in a woman's dress.\n\n\nCast\nVille Haapasalo as Rosa (Rosolinda Stein), Robert\nDanila Kozlovsky as Lusya (Lyusya Mohnataya), Dima\nIvan Nikolayev as Gelya (Gertrude Moscow), Gene\nPavel Bryun as Lara (Lara Conti), Alexey Viktorovich Gusev\nAlexey Klimushkin as Fira (Felomena Bezrodnaya)\nRenata Litvinova as Yevgenia, wife of Rosa\nIngeborga Dapkunaite as Margot, mother of Gena\nAlyona Babenko  as Alvetochka, journalist of the publication  City News\nYevgenia Dobrovolskaya as Valentina, mother of Lusya\nMariya Shalayeva as Sasha, daughter of Rosa\nAlexey Mokhov as Ponomarin\nSergei Brun as Alexei Gusev (Lara in his youth)\nAndrey Rudensky as Gosha\n\n\nProduction\nThe idea for the film was born from real stories of drag artists, with whom the director Felix Mikhailov met in a nightclub. It took ten years for the project to be realized because LGBT related films are rarely produced in Russia.\nWhen working on his role, Danila Kozlovsky observed a strict diet and carefully studied documentary recordings of drag shows and rehearsals with the director of the picture.\nWhen the entire film was almost finished, but it seemed that there was still something missing, Alyona Babenko was hired for the role of a journalist who interviews the performers.\nRenata Litvinova gave some advice concerning the screenplay to the director.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJolly Fellows at IMDb\n\nOfficial website\nFull film on YouTube",

    "title": "Gravel v. United States",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=11134730",
    "text": "Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), was a case regarding the protections offered by the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution. In the case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the privileges and immunities of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause enjoyed by members of Congress also extend to Congressional aides, but not to activity outside the legislative process.\n\n\nHistory\nOn Saturday, June 26, 1971, Senator Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) received a copy of the Pentagon Papers from Ben Bagdikian, an editor at The Washington Post, in a midnight meeting in front of the Mayflower Hotel. Over the next several days, Gravel (who was dyslexic) was assisted by his congressional office staff in reading and analyzing the report. Worried his home might be raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Gravel smuggled the report (which filled two large suitcases) into his congressional office, which was then guarded by disabled Vietnam veterans.\nOn the evening of June 29, 1971, Gravel attempted to read the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record. A lack of a quorum, however, prevented the Senate from convening. As chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, Gravel convened a meeting of the subcommittee and spent an hour reading part of the Pentagon Papers into the record. Prevented by his dyslexia from continuing, Gravel had the remainder of the Pentagon Papers entered into the record.\nGravel subsequently arranged to have the Pentagon Papers published by a private publisher. The publisher was Beacon Press, a non-profit book publisher owned by the Unitarian Universalist Association.\nA federal grand jury was subsequently empaneled to investigate possible violations of federal law in the release of the report.  Leonard Rodberg, a Gravel aide, was subpoenaed to testify about his role in obtaining and arranging for publication of the Pentagon Papers. Senator Gravel intervened and asked a court to quash the subpoena, contending that forcing Rodberg to testify would violate the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.\nA district court refused to grant the motion to quash but did agree to proscribe certain questions. The trial court also held that publication of the Pentagon Papers by a private press was not protected by the Speech or Debate Clause. The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling (although it modified the categories of barred questions). The United States appealed the barring of questions, and Senator Gravel appealed the ruling regarding publication.  The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.\n\n\nMajority holding\nIn a 5–4 ruling, the Supreme Court held that the privileges of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause enjoyed by members of Congress also extend to Congressional aides. Rejecting the reasoning of the court of appeals and substituting its own, the court declared that \"the privilege available to the aide is confined to those services that would be immune legislative conduct if performed by the Senator himself.\" However, the Court refused to protect congressional aides from prosecution for criminal conduct, or from testifying at trials or grand jury proceedings involving third party crimes. The Supreme Court also threw out the lower courts' order permitting some questions and barring others, concluding that if the testimony is privileged then the privilege is absolute.\nHowever, the Court upheld the district court's ruling regarding private publication. \"[Private] publication by Senator Gravel through the cooperation of Beacon Press was in no way essential to the deliberations of the Senate; nor does questioning as to private publication threaten the integrity or independence of the Senate by impermissibly exposing its deliberations to executive influence.\"\n\n\nDissents\nAssociate Justice Potter Stewart dissented in part, concluding that the Court had too narrowly construed the protections granted by the Speech or Debate Clause.  Justice Stewart would have extended the protections of the clause to cover testimony before a grand jury about preparing for legislative acts as well.\nIn his dissent, Associate Justice William O. Douglas argued that the private publication was an adjunct of speech or debate function of Senator Gravel, and was therefore protected speech.  He further condemned politicians for excessive secrecy and the media for largely failing to challenge it:\n\nThe story of the Pentagon Papers is a chronicle of suppression of vital decisions to protect the reputations and political hides of men who worked an amazingly successful scheme of deception on the American people. They were successful not because they were astute, but because the press had become a frightened, regimented, submissive instrument, fattening on favors from those in power and forgetting the great tradition of reporting. To allow the press further to be cowed by grand jury inquiries and prosecution is to carry the concept of \"abridging\" the press to frightening proportions.\nIn his dissent, Associate Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. disagreed with the majority's narrow construction of the Speech or Debate Clause, and defined a much broader conception of the right.  Brennan was joined by Justices Douglas and Marshall.\n\n\nSignificance\nThe case is considered a landmark for not only reaffirming the constitutional protections offered by the Speech or Debate Clause, but for narrowing it as well.\n\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 408\nUnited States v.

    "text": "Live in London is a live album by American rock band the Beach Boys released by EMI in the UK in May 1970. When released in the US on November 15, 1976, the album was renamed Beach Boys '69 (The Beach Boys In London) via Capitol Records.\n\n\nHistory\n1968 was a difficult year for the Beach Boys in the USA, where their reputation had soured considerably. Yet enthusiasm for the group in Europe was still strong, as evidenced by the performance recorded in December while the group were finishing their 20/20 album.\nAfter the surprise success of the Endless Summer and Spirit of America hits packages in 1974 and 1975, the Beach Boys had a resurgence of popularity in America, especially on the concert circuit. It was during this time that Capitol decided to issue a renamed edition of the album for the first time in the US. The reissue had art by rock artist Jim Evans, and a new title, Beach Boys '69. Besides the fact that the live performance was recorded in December 1968, the LP's appearance added confusion to the marketplace as the group had recently issued a new, live double album—The Beach Boys in Concert—on their own Brother Records label, as part of a distribution deal with their new label, Reprise. Despite this, the record became a small chart success in the US, following the Top 10 placing of 15 Big Ones, reaching #75 in the Fall of 1976 during a US chart stay of 10 weeks. The UK edition failed to chart.\nBeach Boys observers believe that the group owed Capitol one more album (this may have been offered to fill such a role, instead of the Fading Rock Group Revival/Reverberation project), and that this release ended their relationship with that record label. When the Beach Boys' albums were remastered for CD in 1990 (and again in 2001), Live in London was paired with their 1964 live release Beach Boys Concert.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, unless otherwise noted.\n\nSide one\n\"Darlin'\" – 2:41\n\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (Brian Wilson, Tony Asher, Mike Love) – 1:53\n\"Sloop John B\" (Traditional; arranged by Brian Wilson) – 2:30\n\"California Girls\" – 2:19\n\"Do It Again\" – 2:47\n\"Wake the World\" (Brian Wilson, Al Jardine) – 2:26\n\"Aren't You Glad\" – 3:09\nSide two\n\"Bluebirds over the Mountain\" (Ersel Hickey) – 2:53\n\"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring\" (Bobby Troup) – 2:49\n\"Good Vibrations\" – 4:36\n\"God Only Knows\" (Brian Wilson, Tony Asher) – 3:27\n\"Barbara Ann\" (Fred Fassert) – 2:32\nIn 1990, Live in London was paired on CD with Beach Boys Concert, featuring two live bonus tracks from 1964 (\"Don't Worry Baby\") and 1967 (\"Heroes and Villains\").

    "text": "Thomas Anthony Dooley III (January 17, 1927 – January 18, 1961) was an American physician who worked in Southeast Asia at the outset of American involvement in the Vietnam War. While serving as a physician in the United States Navy and afterwards, he became known for his humanitarian and anti-communist political activities up until his early death from cancer. After his death, the public learned that he had been recruited as an intelligence operative by the Central Intelligence Agency, and numerous descriptions of atrocities by the Viet Minh in his book Deliver Us From Evil  had been fabricated.\nDooley has been called \"a key agent in the first disinformation campaign of the Vietnam War,\" garnering support for the US government's growing involvement there. Dooley, one critic said, is an example of \"celebrity sainthood\" and the \"intersection of show business and mysticism occupied the space where Tom Dooley was perhaps most at home\"; nevertheless, he \"helped to pull American Catholicism away from its insular, angry anti-Communism\" and he lived a life that does not \"invite facile judgment.\"\n\nDooley authored three popular books that described his activities in Vietnam and Laos: Deliver Us From Evil, The Edge of Tomorrow, and The Night They Burned the Mountain.\n\n\nEarly life\nDooley was born January 17, 1927, in St. Louis, Missouri, and raised in a prominent Roman Catholic Irish-American household. He attended St. Roch Catholic Elementary School and St. Louis University High School; at both he was a classmate of Michael Harrington. He then went to college at the University of Notre Dame, but completed only five semesters of course work. In 1944, he enlisted as a hospital corpsman in the United States Navy, serving in a naval hospital in New York City. In 1946, he returned to Notre Dame, but left without receiving a degree. Later, on June 5, 1960, Notre Dame presented him with an honorary degree. He entered the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. When he graduated in 1953, after repeating his final year of medical school, he joined the Navy. He completed his residency at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, and then at Yokosuka, Japan. In 1954, he was assigned to the USS Montague, which was traveling to Vietnam.\n\n\nHumanitarian, author, and intelligence operative\nIn May 1954, the Geneva Agreements divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel north into two political zones. People north of the 17th parallel lived under the Viet Minh government, and those south of the 17th parallel lived under the government of Ngo Dinh Diem. Hanoi and Haiphong remained free zones until May 1955. In August 1954, Dooley transferred to Task Force Ninety, a unit participating in the evacuation of over 600,000 North Vietnamese known as Operation Passage to Freedom. Here he served as a French interpreter and medical officer for a Preventive Medicine Unit in Haiphong. He eventually oversaw the building and maintenance of refugee camps in Haiphong until May 1955, when the Viet Minh took over the city. He returned to Yokosuka, Japan in June 1955.\n\n\nCIA recruitment and Deliver Us From Evil\nDooley was assigned to the medical intelligence task force sponsored by the Military Advisory Assistance Group, whose leader, Lt. Gen. John W. O'Daniel, was an active ally of Ngo Dinh Diem. His official duties involved collecting samples for epidemiological work, \"but his primary role was as a liaison between the refugee campaign...Operation Passage to Freedom and American reporters and politicians with an interest in Southeast Asia.\" In return for his work as a \"spokesman\", the doctor was awarded the highest presidential honor by Diem. During this period, he wrote numerous letters to his mother, many of which she shared with reporters; the letters were then printed in the local press, including the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. Most of the letters exaggerated his personal contribution to the refugee work. Despite his self-promotion, he \"was indefatigable in taking care of his patients.\" Concerning the \"self-aggrandizement\" aspect of his personality, he said that to be a humanitarian in the modern world \"you've gotta run it like a business. You've gotta have Madison Avenue, press relations, TV, radio...and of course you get condemned for being a publicity seeker\"; he argued that being able to care for 100 people per day, between 1954 and 1958, with MEDICO later treating 2,000 per day, justified this approach to humanitarianism.\nDooley was soon recruited as an operative by Lieutenant Colonel Edward G. Lansdale, head of the CIA office in Saigon. He was chosen as a symbol of Vietnamese-American cooperation, and was encouraged to write about his experiences in the refugee camps. The CIA, USAID, and several other agencies \"conducted fund-raising campaigns for the refugees\" later described in his books. The Pentagon Papers would later note that he \"significantly aided\" in the gathering of intelligence information.\nWilliam Lederer, author of The Ugly American, helped initiate this phase of Dooley's career. Lederer, who was at the time serving as a Navy press officer attached to the admiralty, appreciated the eloquence of Dooley's situation reports, and suggested that he write a book. Immediately prior to publication, he and Lederer spent two weeks living together polishing the manuscript. Lederer was also on \"special assignment\" for the CIA during this period.\nIn 1956, Dooley's book Deliver Us from Evil became a best-seller, establishing him as an icon of American humanitarian and anti-communist activities abroad. His vivid accounts of communist atrocities committed on Catholic refugees were not verifiable. It has been alleged that Dooley was passing along descriptions of events that had been created by Landsdale and his team. In 1956, U.S. officials who were stationed in the Hanoi-Haiphong area during his tour of duty submitted a lengthy report to the U.S. Information Agency holding that Deliver Us from Evil was \"not the truth\" and that the accounts of Viet Minh atrocities were \"nonfactual and exaggerated.\" However, these reports remained classified for nearly thirty years. James Fisher allows that the U.S. Information Agency report was \"valid,\" but he also argues it \"must be viewed with some suspicion\" because they were preparing to \"discredit Dooley\" as \"an insurance policy against a renewed outbreak of anti-internationalism.\"\nDooley's book featured exceptionally gory tales of religious persecution. The doctor claimed the Viet Minh jammed chopsticks into the ears of children to keep them from hearing the Lord's Prayer and regularly mutilated Catholic instructors. Most sensationally, he fabricated a story of the Viet Minh pounding nails into the head of a priest—\"a communist version of the crown of thorns, once forced on the Savior of whom he preached.\" He also claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces had \"disemboweled more than 1,000 native women in Hanoi.\" Thirty years after his death, in response to a journalist's question, Lederer said that \"the atrocities the doctor described 'never took place.\" At the time, however, Lederer brokered a deal with Reader's Digest to publish Dooley's claims and he used him as the \"real-life model\" for Father John Finian, a heroic character in The Ugly American. Critics noted the book's ability to describe horror and suffering, but one noted that \"His book is less happy when he attempts to fill in the historical background.\" Dooley's grasp of the geo-political situation was superficial. \nCommenting on these allegations, Seth Jacobs wrote that although Dooley \"may have exaggerated or fabricated,\" this was not done to make his book more sensational. Instead, these atrocity stories grew out of a period of immersion in refugee life, from September 1954 to May 1955, a period during which he drove himself so mercilessly that he went from 180 to 120 pounds, \"nearly died of malarial fever, acquired four types of intestinal worms, and suffered so acutely from sleep deprivation that he frequently hallucinated.\" Whereas Dooley had previously avoided responsibility, now \"he could not get enough of it\": he regularly performed major surgery and lobbied pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nNaval discharge and Laotian activities\nDooley was on a promotional tour for this book when he was investigated for participating in homosexual activities. It seems that what the Navy discovered about his private life resulted in a negotiated agreement that he would announce he was leaving the Navy in order to serve the people of Vietnam.\nAfter leaving the Navy, Dooley and three former Navy corpsmen established a hospital near Luang Namtha, Laos, with the sponsorship of the International Rescue Committee. At this time, the International Rescue Committee had a secret working relationship with the CIA in Southeast Asia, coordinated by Joseph Buttinger. In an article entitled \"Why I'm A Jungle Medic,\" printed in Think magazine, June 1958, he said they chose Laos because the country, with 3,000,000 people, had only one \"bonafide\" doctor. He explained to the Laotian Minister of Health that he wished to work in an area near the Chinese border because \"there are sick people there and furthermore people who had been flooded with potent draughts of anti-Western propaganda from Red China.\"\nDooley founded the Medical International Cooperation Organization (MEDICO) under the auspices of which he built hospitals at Nam Tha, Muong Sing (five miles south of the Chinese border), and Ban Houei Sa. The plan for MEDICO was that it would build, stock, supply, and train staff for small hospitals; after 16 months, MEDICO planned to turn over these hospitals to the host country's government.\nDuring this same time period, he wrote two books, The Edge of Tomorrow and The Night They Burned the Mountain, about his experience in Laos, including further descriptions of atrocities he said were committed by communist soldiers. In the latter book, he voiced strong political opinions about the Laotian crisis of 1960, defending the right-wing coup led by \"one of his closest friends,\" Phoumi Nosavan. He also wrote that the rigging of elections \"cut through the red tape and kibbosh you get involved with in Asia,\" asserting that \"Democracy, as championed in the US, does not translate well into Lao...Not yet.\"\nWhile Dooley was providing medical care to Lao refugees, he also collected intelligence for the CIA, tracking civilian movements, and he provided cover for United States Special Forces medics who posed as civilian doctors. Dennis Shephard, a physician who worked with him, claimed that he would round up as many of his former patients as he could whenever potential sponsors came to tour the Vientiane clinic, giving the impression that he had a full and active clinic. Shephard remembered local CIA officers coming by often to find out if Dooley had picked up anything about the movement of Chinese troops, as well as to ensure that the weapons he had brought up with his medical supplies were well-hidden and secure. Shephard helped him establish a clinic at Vang Vieng; His obituary records that he was a guest when he was featured on This Is Your Life and that he traveled with him \"from village to village, where they treated illness and injuries, and taught Laotians about sanitation and medication.\"\n\n\nTelevised cancer surgery, death, and Peace Corps\nIn 1959, Dooley returned to the United States for cancer treatment. He agreed to Fred W. Friendly's request that his melanoma surgery be the subject of a CBS News documentary. On April 21, 1960, Biography of a Cancer was broadcast; it was hosted by Howard K. Smith, and included the surgery and an interview with him. In response to Smith's suggestion that his attitude toward his cancer was \"blithe\", he replied: \"I'm scared to death of this thing becoming maudlin; I'm scared to death of somebody saying 'a clutching, agonizing sort of a thing'...I don't want anyone to get sloppy over this; I don't like anything that says 'a dying doctor's anguish bit'; that's stupid.\" He proceeded to say that he agreed to the televising of his surgery to help reduce American ignorance and fear of cancer, and so that he could promote MEDICO. After the surgery was performed, he described it candidly and revealed that his prognosis was bad; he died less than a year later.\nAccording to James Fisher's comprehensive biography, Dooley remained a devout Catholic until his death. At his funeral, U.S. Sen. Stuart Symington described him as \"One of those rare Americans who is truly a citizen of the world.\" After his death, John F. Kennedy cited his example when he launched the Peace Corps. He was also awarded a Congressional Gold Medal after his death. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.\n\n\nImportance and legacy\nIn 1961 Gallup Poll named Dooley the third most admired man in the world according to the American public, behind only President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Pope John XXIII. Later, his legacy became intertwined with controversy surrounding the Vietnam War. As a result, writers continue to struggle with the doctor's record of philanthropy and the later American war in Southeast Asia.\nDuring the height of the Vietnam War, when attention began to be given to the propaganda aspect of Dooley's work, one journalist charged that he was responsible \"for helping to create 'a climate of public misunderstanding that made the war in Vietnam possible.'\"  More than a decade later, after examining more than 500 unclassified CIA documents, another writer argued that although he did provide the CIA with some information, he never initiated contact with them, he took no money, his motivation was patriotism, and he hoped this would afford him \"more freedom to do his work and a little less harassment.\"\nDespite Dooley's problematic descriptions of Southeast Asia, Prince Souphan of Laos said that he was \"known to his grateful Lao admirers as 'Thanh Mo America' (Dr. America)\". He himself was frequently critical of United States actions in the region. He observed: \"We are hated in most of the Orient. ... They think freedom means freedom of the capitalist to exploit the Oriental people. No Americans have ever gotten down to their level.\" At the same time, he opposed concrete reforms to foreign aid in Laos when Congress proposed them, defending the \"first-class administrators\" at the US embassy. He also rejected all compromises with communists, even when the Laotian public supported them, going so far as calling the popular neutralist leader Kong Le \"an idiot.\"\nMEDICO depended primarily upon volunteers and private donations; by 1960 over 2000 physicians had applied to serve as volunteers, and new teams for medical assistance were established in Haiti, Cambodia, and Afghanistan. According to Ted Hesburgh, Dooley refused Dwight D. Eisenhower's offer to use government funds to assist in his work. Eisenhower did, however, personally raise funds for MEDICO. After Dooley died, funding for MEDICO dried up and it was taken over by CARE.\nDooley's principal biographer, James Fisher, wrote that he \"tried never to forget what this man's toil and suffering meant to untold people of all backgrounds.\" Nearly four years after his death, The New York Times wrote that his work was \"more active than it was even at the time of his death.\" Although medical experts criticized his approach as naive and simplistic, numerous people have been inspired by Dooley to do similar work:\n\nVerne Chaney, a surgeon who worked with him, founded the Dooley Intermed International – Medical Aid Around the World, an organization that provides medical equipment, supplies, personnel and financial support for the improvement of health services in underdeveloped countries.\nBetty Tisdale, who met him and was inspired by his work, founded H.A.L.O. (Helping And Loving Orphans). Just prior to the fall of Vietnam, she orchestrated the evacuation and adoption of 219 Vietnamese orphans to homes in the US. Betty Tisdale and H.A.L.O. continue his work not only in Vietnam, but also in other countries.\nTeresa Gallagher, a volunteer who worked with him, along with his brother, Malcolm, established The Dr. Tom Dooley Foundation that is dedicated to delivering medical care to people of the Third World. Dr. Jerry Brown, a 2013 graduate of an affiliated program in Cameroon was among the \"Ebola Fighters\" named as the Time Person of the Year for 2014.\nDavida Coady, an activist pediatrician, who was also inspired by Dooley, devoted herself to caring for impoverished people in Africa, Central America, Asia; she was involved in the famine relief efforts in Biafra, the hunting down of the last smallpox cases in India, and the rebuilding of medical infrastructure in Nicaragua.\nThe Dr. Tom Dooley Foundation has an endowed scholarship at the St. Louis University Medical School intended \"to inspire students to follow the footsteps of Dr. Tom Dooley.\" Dooley is memorialized at the University of Notre Dame's Grotto of Our Lady, with a statue as well as an engraved copy of a letter he wrote to former Notre Dame president Ted Hesburgh.\n\n\nDecorations\nCongressional Gold Medal: On May 27, 1961, Congress authorized the issuance of a gold medal to honor Dooley and his work. President John F. Kennedy presented the medal to Dooley's mother, Agnes Dooley, in a White House ceremony on June 7, 1962. Kennedy commended him for providing a model of American compassion before the rest of the world.\nLegion of Merit\nNational Order of Vietnam, 4th Class (Degree of Officer)\nThe Saint Francis Xavier Medal: Distinguished achievement award of Xavier University\nKey to the City of Mishawaka, Indiana\nRotary Club of Hong Kong Pennant\nKey to the City of South Bend, Indiana\nKey to the City of Baltimore, Maryland\nKey to the City of Worcester\nChristopher Award: 1956\nChristopher Award: 1961\nMutual of Omaha-Criss Award: At the 1959 awards dinner in Omaha, the speakers were General James Doolittle, Fred Astaire, and Charles Mayo, son of one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic.

    "summary": "Thomas Anthony Dooley III (January 17, 1927 – January 18, 1961) was an American physician who worked in Southeast Asia at the outset of American involvement in the Vietnam War. While serving as a physician in the United States Navy and afterwards, he became known for his humanitarian and anti-communist political activities up until his early death from cancer. After his death, the public learned that he had been recruited as an intelligence operative by the Central Intelligence Agency, and numerous descriptions of atrocities by the Viet Minh in his book Deliver Us From Evil  had been fabricated.\nDooley has been called \"a key agent in the first disinformation campaign of the Vietnam War,\" garnering support for the US government's growing involvement there. Dooley, one critic said, is an example of \"celebrity sainthood\" and the \"intersection of show business and mysticism occupied the space where Tom Dooley was perhaps most at home\"; nevertheless, he \"helped to pull American Catholicism away from its insular, angry anti-Communism\" and he lived a life that does not \"invite facile judgment.\"",

    "text": "Son of the Mob 2: Hollywood Hustle is a book written by Canadian author Gordon Korman in 2004. It is a sequel of Son of the Mob, written two years previously in 2002.\n\n\nPlot\nSet approximately two years after the first book, Vincent Luca drives to university in California, accompanied by best friend Alex Tarkanian and girlfriend Kendra Bightly. During a rest stop in an Illinois motel, Vincent discovers his suitcase to be packed with a rough $3,000,000 instead of his own property. In a cross country phone call later on, Vince's older brother Tommy reveals that his suitcase was switched out with the cash due to the FBI searching for it. He also arranges for \"Uncle Bignose\", one of the Luca's men, to pick up the suitcase at the Kansas City International Airport, which is done with some confusion as well as an accidental carjack. The trio continue their trip to California, dropping Alex off at college in Vegas, and Kendra at the Burrel Music Academy in Los Angeles, before making his way to the University of Santa Monica.\nWhile settling into his dorm, Vincent meets his enthusiastic roommate Trey Sutter, as well as other neighbours and Trey's congressman father William Sutter. Trey also starts dating the fascinating senior Willow Danziger, who then invites them to a fraternity party. While buying new clothing, due to the fact that the FBI had confiscated Vince's suitcase believing it to contain the cash, Trey is revealed to be a kleptomaniac.\nOn his first day of university, Vincent meets a fellow student neighbour of his in film production class; P. Richard Shapiro, a snobby student who plans to go above and beyond with his production, bringing out the worst of Vince. The same day, when Richard begins his search for cast members, Vince stupidly gives him Kendra's number. Kendra later accepts a role in Richards musical, much to Vince's annoyance. That same night, at the fraternity, Trey is quickly accepted by the brothers but Vince is barred from premises due to his act of dumping a beer on their half-century old rubber tree, Stedman.\nLater on, during work at the foreign student office, Vince discovers that Tommy had ventured out to California to bunk with Vince, supposedly to hide from a mobster who was searching for him over a \"piss on car\" incident. Tommy informs Vince that he is thinking of leaving the mob, much to Vince's surprise. Tommy instantly jumps into the middle of things, such as intimidating Trey's fraternity into re-inviting Vince, messing up Vince's film project, and unsuccessfully trying to beat up Trey's girlfriend.\nLater on, Trey is disgusted that he is to take part in his father's upcoming press conference. He also explains to Vince that the conference is based on the sudden disappearance of the president of the Southern California Concrete Workers Union, Ellis Rank, and the congressman intends on resolving the issue. Around the same time, the two discover \"Uncle Uncle\", a top Luca mob captain, inside their apartment, and Vince begins to get suspicious.\nThe day of the press conference, Trey steals a barbecue in an attempt to avoid it, but is ratted out by Vince, who decides to attend for support. While at the conference, he notices Uncle Uncle and various Luca men spread out through the crowd. Vince also encounters Willow, who flirts with him and goads him into a kiss right after chaos breaks out among the crowd, possibly due to the acts of the Luca men. When Vincent returns to the dorm, he finds all six men inside as well as Tommy. They easily befriend Trey, and party for countless hours. Meanwhile, Vince suspects them of tampering with the union.\nThe next day, in a phone call, Alex reveals to Vince that he is currently offering homage to Frankie Toronto, one of Tommy's friends whose apartment is currently undergoing renovations. Meanwhile, Tommy helps the foreign student apply for massive grants, and Vince attempts to wheedle the reasons for the uncle's stay out of his father over a cross country phone call.\nLater, a date with Kendra goes terribly wrong when Willow comes between them at a bar, thus causing a fight between the couple. Around that time, Trey reveals to Vince that Willow had lost interest in him, and suspects an older man he saw meeting with her in secret.\nThe night before Vince's first film project is due, he makes a last ditch attempt to film an ill fated movie at the fraternity, but accidentally switches the film with an Ellis Rank kidnapping tape he found in his room, confirming that the uncles were involved. He tries to tip off Sutter, but instead receives an anonymous message about a late night beach meeting. The \"meeting\" instead turns out to be an accidental make-out session with Willow, which leaves Vince wet from the ocean and disoriented. That night goes from bad to worse, as Trey and Tommy are both offended and run out on Vince. Trey ends his friendship with Vince, while Tommy disappears.\nVince is miserable and the uncles are out of the action. Meanwhile, Vince discovers that his father has arrived in Los Angeles; a rare move on his behalf. Meanwhile, the foreign students show up in Vince's room complaining that Tommy had stolen their grant money, which Vince promises to return. Alex complains that Frankie probably never had a place, and was just using his room as a hideout. Kendra also shows Vince photo proof of him and Willow on the beach that night, revealing that her father came to town to show her, and breaks up with him. Trey also sees the photos, prompting Vince to reveal his mob status, causing Trey to run off.\nVince goes after him, and finds out that he had stolen a 1960s Volkswagen and was following a limo that supposedly contains Vince's father as well as the uncles. After switching tactics multiple times and picking up Scooby, a foreign student in danger of deportation, Vince, Trey, and the limo end up at an abandoned warehouse where Ellis Rank is being kept. Followed by Scooby, who films the entire event, Vince reunites with his father, Anthony Luca, who protects him from a shootout, and reveals that they had come to rescue Rank, who is momentarily seen chatting with Luca right before Trey purposely crashes his stolen vehicle into a tree. Congressman Sutter and his henchmen were revealed to be behind the kidnapping, and paid Rank's driver, Toothpick, to help them out. The mob manages to restore the Volkswagen to its proper state, and Vince exchanges some last words with his father.\nThe next day, as the uncles leave, Vince believes he knows where Toothpick is, and in Vegas, reveals to Alex that his \"roommate\" helped capture Rank. Toothpick, however, is aided by Vince in fleeing the country. While in Vegas, Vince also tracks down the real Frankie Toronto, who has Tommy staying at his place. Vince angrily plays Tommy for the stolen grant cash in a game of blackjack, and wins. At the same time, Congressman Sutter turns himself in to the authorities.\nWhile returning the grant cash to the foreign students, Scooby reveals to Vince that he taped the entire warehouse scene, which Vince uses for his final project in class. It ends up being better than Richard's musical, which was a flop. Meanwhile, Trey discovers that Willow was working with Agent Bightly (Kendra's father), to spy on Congressman Sutter and Anthony Luca via Trey and Vince. Kendra figures it out and reunites with Vince. The book ends with Vince's warehouse tape disappearing, but his father promises that it is still intact and will be preserved by the family.\n\n\nCharacters\nVince Luca; the son of a mob boss who tries hard to stay out of the business.\nTrey Sutter; the enthusiastic son of a local congressman.

    "title": "St Luke Old Street",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=3865972",
    "text": "St Luke's is a historic Anglican church building in central London, and in the London Borough of Islington. It served as a parish church from 1733 to 1959. It was designed by John James and Nicholas Hawksmoor, and is a Grade I listed building.\nFollowing closure in 1959, the church stood derelict and roofless for some 40 years, but since 2003 has been a music centre operated by the London Symphony Orchestra and known as LSO St Luke's. It is the home of the LSO's community and music education programme, LSO Discovery. The main body of the building seats up to 372 and is used by the LSO for rehearsals, and by a wide variety of musicians for performances and recording. Additional rooms in the crypt provide practice facilities for professional musicians, students and community groups.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe church is sited on Old Street, north of the City of London. It was built to relieve the City church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Cripplegate, under the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, an attempt to meet the religious needs of London's burgeoning 18th-century population. The ancient parish of St Giles lay partly within the City and partly outside its boundaries in Middlesex: under the Commissioners' scheme these two parts were to be separated, with the Middlesex portion (historically the Manor of Finsbury) becoming a new parish of St Luke's. Construction began in 1727 and was completed in 1733, when the church was consecrated on 18 October (St Luke's day), and the parish detached from that of St Giles.\nThe architects were the joint salaried surveyors to the Commission, John James and Nicholas Hawksmoor. James is thought to have been responsible for the body of the church, and Hawksmoor for the west tower, the flanking staircase wings, and the obelisk spire (a most unusual feature for an Anglican church). The spire was topped by an unusual weather vane depicting the head of a dragon with a fiery comet-like tail: this was misinterpreted locally as a louse, and by the mid-20th century had gained the church the nickname \"lousy St Luke's\".\nThe church stood on often waterlogged ground, near the (historically) notoriously marshy Moorfields area, and from an early date (but particularly from the beginning of the 20th century) suffered from problems of subsidence. The effects of the subsidence remain visible in the distorted shapes of the windows on the north side of the building.\n\n\nBurials\n\nBurials in the small churchyard included:\n\nMark Catesby (1683–1749), naturalist. His grave is lost.\nWilliam Caslon the elder (1692/1693–1766), type founder, his son William Caslon II (1720–1778) and other members of the family. They are commemorated by a listed chest tomb.\nGeorge Dance the Elder (1695–1768), architect, and at one time a member of the vestry. His grave is lost.\nIn preparation for the conversion of the church into a music centre, the crypt was cleared of burials in the year 2000. A total of 1053 burials were archaeologically recorded, removed, and reburied at Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey. A television documentary, \"Changing Tombs\" (2001), recorded the process.\n\n\nDeconsecration and reuse\nIn 1959, in response to structural problems at the church resulting from subsidence, and to a declining inner-city population, the Diocese of London closed St Luke's and the parish was re-absorbed into that of St Giles-without-Cripplegate. The following year the font and organ case were moved to St Giles' church, the reredos and altar rails to St Andrew Holborn, and the roof was removed for safety reasons. The crypt was bricked up in 1964. The empty shell of St Luke's became a dramatic ruin for some 40 years, overgrown with trees, despite being a Grade I listed building.\nAfter several controversial proposals to redevelop offices inside the retained walls, it was converted by the St Luke Centre Management Company Ltd for the London Symphony Orchestra as a concert hall, rehearsal and recording space, and educational resource. The conversion was designed by Axel Burrough at London architects Levitt Bernstein, who installed a heavy concrete slab roof which keeps out traffic noise from the nearby road. Though this is similar in profile to the former eighteenth-century roof, its great weight is supported on tall steel columns inside the hall described by the designer as \"tree-like\". The interior acoustic can be varied for different events, from full orchestra to soloists, by the use of absorbent surfaces that unroll like blinds across the ceiling and down the walls, whilst the seating and staging are also highly flexible. Work was completed in 2002, and the centre was brought into use early in 2003.\n\n\nSpecial events\n\nThe venue regularly hosts open rehearsals by the London Symphony Orchestra in advance of concerts at the nearby Barbican Hall, and has pioneered genre-busting events such as the Eclectica series, which combines classical, jazz, experimental and electronic sound-worlds.\nJunior Trinity, the junior department of Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance have also performed at LSO St Luke's as part of their seasonal concerts with their Symphony Orchestra, Wind Orchestra, Sinfonia, Big Band, and other notable groups.\nDuring 2006 the BBC used the venue to record concerts by Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon for broadcast.\nIn October 2006, Sting performed the songs of John Dowland with Edin Karamazov. The concert was later released on the CD/DVD, The Journey and the Labyrinth.\nSir Elton John also recorded a concert to publicise his album The Captain & the Kid.\nMTV used the venue in 2007 to record a concert from Editors, for broadcast in the same year.\nPatti Smith, Philip Glass and Lenny Kaye performed a tribute to Allen Ginsberg in 2007.\nVan Morrison recorded a concert at St Luke's on BBC Four Sessions on 25 April 2008 featuring songs from his 2008 album, Keep It Simple.\nIn September 2008, Duffy played there for BBC Sessions; the concert was televised on 12 October 2008.\nIn December 2008, BBC Four broadcast Sacred Music: The Story of Allegri's Miserere, presented by Simon Russell Beale, with a performance by The Sixteen conducted by Harry Christophers at St Luke's.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nBoyle, Angela; Boston, Ceridwen; Witkin, Annsofie (2005).

    "text": "\"Última\" (English: \"Last One\") is a Latin pop song by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira. It was released on 22 March 2025 as a promotional single from Shakira's twelfth studio album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran.\n\n\nBackground and release\n\"Última\" was initially announced on 29 February 2024, when Shakira shared the tracklist of her twelfth studio album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran on her social media accounts. The song is one of the two piano ballads on the album, the other one being \"Acróstico\", and the last song she wrote for the album. Shakira shared that creating the album was an \"alchemical process\" and that she \"rebuilt herself\" writing each song: \"As I sang them, my tears were transformed into diamonds and my vulnerability into resilience\".\n\"Última\" is written about Shakira's ex-partner Gerard Piqué, who she was in a relationship with for 11 years and who she separated from following his infidelity. Lyrically the song is a heartfelt ballad in which she bids a final farewell to the retired soccer player. She said in an interview that she hopes it's the last song she'll write about him. Before creating the song she felt that she had to create it: \"I have to spit it out or I won't be able to do it, you know,  I'll choke\". Being able to finish the song was \"a great relief\" for her.\nOn 19 March, Shakira posted a preview of the song on her social media accounts. Based on the preview, Judith del Rio from La Vanguardia called the song \"the final farewell to her great love\". Europa FM emphasized how in the song Shakira \"shows that all the pain that [Piqué] has caused her is definitively behind her\".\nDuring an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Shakira discussed why \"Última\" will be the last song she writes about Piqué: despite pressure from her record label to finish her album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, Shakira insisted on including the song and ultimately recorded and mixed it in one afternoon. When she shared the song with Sony Latin, the head of marketing cried, leading Shakira to reflect that the song is not just about her, and how music can have a universal connection and emotional impact on people.\n\n\nReception\nPablo Gil from El Mundo described the song as a \"piano ballad with a soap opera echo\", adding that it's perhaps the most 'morbid' song on the album. Thania Garcia from Variety depicted how the 'confessional' \"Última\" is one of the two \"most vulnerable songs\" on the album alongside \"Acróstico\". Lucas Villa from NME emphasized that \"Shakira is one of Latin music’s most prolific and poetic songwriters, and she offers the most insight into her breakup with Piqué on the heartbreaking ballad\", outlining how she \"sounds like she’s on the verge of tears as she reflects on what went wrong\" on the song.\nOn 23 June 2024, Rolling Stone included \"Última\" on their list of great songs of 2024 by Spanish-speaking artists that far.\n\n\nMusic video\nOn 30 March 2024, Shakira was seen filming the music video for \"Última\" in the New York City Subway at nighttime. Wearing a black coat, she was shivering in the cold wind yet appeared dedicated to her work. The music video, co-directed by Shakira and Jaume de la Iguana, was released on 22 March 2025, a year after the album's release.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nReferences",

The series began in order to challenge what Ache Records called \"finicky sub-genrifying\", believing instead that \"underground art forms should not be defined\". Although Ache does not describe the genres of its releases, the Montreal Mirror says that the pairings on these records are typically between electronic and indie rock acts. The split releases in the series include:\n\nThe ninth and final installment was slated to come out in 2011, but it never did, and the series remained incomplete forever.\n\n\nProject: Bicycle\nAnother project of Ache Records was its compilation album Project: Bicycle. The album had eleven songs by various electronic or electro-acoustic musicians. These musicians were given a single sample of music, a recording of a bicycle recorded by Jesse Gander at Hive Studios in Vancouver, and they were tasked with composing a song using only that sample.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Belfast Zoological Gardens (also known as Belfast Zoo) is a zoo in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is in a relatively secluded location on the northeastern slope of Cavehill, overlooking Belfast's Antrim Road. Opened in 1934, it is the second-oldest zoo in Ireland, after Dublin Zoo, which opened in 1831.\nBelfast Zoo is one of the top fee-paying visitor attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 300,000 visitors a year. Located in north Belfast, the zoo's 55-acre (22 ha) site is home to more than 1,200 animals and 140 species.\nThe majority of the animals in Belfast Zoo are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo carries out important conservation work and takes part in over 90 European and international breeding programmes which help to ensure the survival of many species under threat.\nThe zoo is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe story of Belfast Zoo begins with the city's public transport system. At the beginning of the 20th century, passengers from Belfast were transported to the villages of Whitewell and Glengormley by horse-drawn trams belonging to the Belfast Street Tramway company and steam tramways from Cavehill and Whitewell.\nIn 1911, the tram line was taken over by Belfast Corporation, now Belfast City Council. The corporation decided to build a miniature railway, playground, and pleasure gardens. The area was named Bellevue, meaning 'good or pretty view'.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the gardens were a popular destination for day trips. In 1933, the corporation decided to install a representative zoological collection on the site. Then, in 1934, 12 acres (4.9 ha) on either side of the Grand Floral Staircase, a series of steps designed to reach the top of the hillside, were laid out as Bellevue Zoo.\nIt took 150 men to build the site and the steps can still be seen from Antrim Road today. The zoo was opened on 28 March 1934 by Sir Crawford McCullagh, the then Lord Mayor of Belfast. The venture was supported by Councillor RJR Harcourt from Belfast Corporation and was partnered by George Chapman, an animal dealer and circus entrepreneur.\nIt cost £10,000 (approximately £700,000 in today's money) to build and a total of 284,713 people visited the zoo in its first year.\n\n\nManagement\nBelfast Zoo is owned by Belfast City Council. The council spends over £2.5 million every year on running and promoting the zoo, which is one of the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland.\nThe zoo's work is overseen by the council's Parks and Leisure Committee. The committee is made up of 20 locally elected councillors.\n\n\nCollections\nThe zoo is home to over 120 species:\n\n\nPrimates\nWestern lowland gorilla\nPygmy marmoset\nWhite-belted ruffed lemur\nRed-bellied lemur\nRing-tailed lemur\nCrowned lemur\nRed titi monkey\nBlack and white colobus\nPied tamarin\nMoloch gibbon\nGolden lion tamarin\nFrancois langur\nEmperor tamarin\nColombian spider monkey\nCommon chimpanzee\nCotton-top tamarin\n\n\nOther mammals\n\n\nBirds\nCitron-crested cockatoo\nRed-tailed black cockatoo\nPalm cockatoo\nBali starling\nVon der Decken's hornbill\nWhite-tailed sea eagle\nBarn owl\nChilean flamingo\nIndian peafowl\nNicobar pigeon\nWhite-crested turaco\nGentoo penguin\nRockhopper penguin\nSunbittern\nOstrich\nDarwin's rhea\nTawny frogmouth\nCoscoroba swan\nSouthern crowned pigeon\nSouthern screamer\nLaughing kookaburra\nPied imperial pigeon\n\n\nReptiles\nBeaded lizard\nRoyal python\nMediterranean tortoise\nRed-footed tortoise\nCuban tree boa\nBox turtle\nJamaican boa\nMadagascar tree boa\nMangrove snake\nPancake tortoise\nTurqoise dwarf gecko\nUtila iguana\nBearded dragon\n\n\nDomestic animals\nThe zoo also has a farm which houses domestic animals such as pygmy goats, Shetland ponies, miniature donkeys, rabbits, and Norfolk Grey chickens.\n\n\nDevelopments\n\nBelfast Zoo is always making changes and welcoming new arrivals or celebrating births.\nIn June 2007, a Barbary lion cub was born at the zoo. This was the first Barbary lion to be born in Ireland. The cub was rejected by its mother and hand-reared at home by keeper Linda Frew. Lily the lion moved to Hodonín Zoo in the Czech Republic in August 2009, as part of a breeding programme.\nIn 2008, the zoo opened a new tropical rainforest which houses such animals as two-toed sloth, red-footed tortoises and Rodrigues bats. The Rainforest House is a walk-through exhibition with tropical landscaping and a constant temperature of 27 degrees.\nMore recently, renovations have included work on the gorilla and chimpanzee enclosures, giraffe and elephant enclosures, including a raised giraffe feeder, and new frames in the spider monkey and Andean bear enclosures.\nIn 2009, on its 75th birthday, the zoo opened a new state-of-the-art Visitors' Centre and \"Zoovenir\" Shop. The refurbishment features high-level roofing with plenty of natural light and multimedia presentations showing the history of Belfast Zoo and wildlife in Northern Ireland.\nThe zoo was awarded £250,000 from the Tourism Development Scheme (TDS) from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to build the new reception area. The council has donated a further £300,000 to help with the increase in visitor numbers.\n2009 was a successful year with plenty of new arrivals including a Sumatran tiger called Kabus, and the only tree-kangaroo in the UK, called Kwikila. 2009 also brought the zoo's highest level of visitors in its history with over 302,000 visitors. Over 90 babies were born in the zoo in 2009.\n2010 saw the arrival of two smooth-coated otters, coppery titi monkeys and a pair of toco toucans. Other new arrivals that year included a female Sumatran tiger to join Kabus. May Day in 2010 had more than double the visitors of the same day in 2009.\nBabies since 2009 have included a Malayan tapir, ring-tailed lemurs, a Grant's zebra, California sea lions, black-tailed prairie dogs, litters of piglets, spider monkeys, red kangaroos and many more.\n2012 saw the birth of two eastern bongos, a blesbok foal, a giraffe foal and a baby chimpanzee and 2013 has seen the birth of coppery titi monkeys, a two toed sloth, another chimpanzee, twin white-belted ruffed lemurs as well as the arrival of two goodfellow's tree-kangaroos. Belfast zoo is only one of 22 worldwide zoos to hold the Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo.\n\n\nIncidents\nIn 2001, a wolf-like dog broke into the kangaroo enclosure and killed one of the younger kangaroos that had been born at the zoo. The same year, vandals broke into the zoo and attacked several penguins in their enclosure with an iron bar. One was thrown into the lion's den and killed.\nIn 2010, a female white-nosed coati escaped and was not found for more than five weeks.\nIn 2013, and again in 2015, several macaques escaped. They were found several days later.\nIn 2018, a spider monkey escaped and died after being hit by a car on the nearby motorway.\nIn 2019, a red panda escaped due to a power fault in her enclosure. She was found the next day in a residential area, a mile away from the zoo.\n\n\nFloral Hall\n\nLocated within the grounds of the zoo is a 1930s art deco ballroom, the Floral Hall. The hall was popular dance venue. During World War II, it had blackouts fitted to the windows so that dances could continue. In the 1960s, the hall was visited by musicians such as Pink Floyd and Small Faces. The Floral Hall closed to the public on 2 April 1972 and has fallen into dereliction since then. During the 1990s, it was given the Listed Building status.\nBelfast Buildings Preservation Trust plans to renovate the building, although Belfast City Council has yet to provide funding.\nIn 2010, meetings were held to discuss potential uses for the hall and the carrying out of a feasibility study. In December 2011, a social media account was created to share old photos of the hall and contemporary photos of its interior. In 2012, an online petition addressed to Belfast City Council was created to request progress with the restoration project. In March 2018, Liverpool based developer Signature Living submitted a £5 million proposal to revive the hall. Lawrence Kenwright, owner of Signature Living, said he hoped to restore the hall for use as a \"leading entertainment, conference and wedding venue\".\n\n\nReferences\n\nBelfast Zoo website",

    "text": "Lidia Elsa Satragno (11 November 1935 – 8 December 2022) was an Argentine actress and politician, where she was popularly known as Pinky.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nLidia Elsa Satragno was born in the western Buenos Aires suburb of San Justo in 1935. She debuted on Argentine television in a 1956 vinegar advertisement and, by 1957, appeared on as many as 22 television ads on any given day. This success led to her own talk show on Argentine Public Television, Buenos Días Pinky, during which she was invited as a guest of honor by German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. The show also earned renown for its screenwriter, María Elena Walsh, and helped pave the way for women in Argentine television, generally. Cast by noted period piece Director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson in La caída (The Fall) in 1959, in 1961 she was offered a co-anchorship in news anchorman Bernardo Neustadt's Nosotros (Us), becoming the first Argentine woman on television so honored. Co-hosting Incomunicados with Neustadt in 1963, the show became memorable for an interview held with Arturo Frondizi, the first granted by a former president on Argentine television. Her work with Neustadt and introduction to the world of politics led to a friendship with a young UCR strategist, Rodolfo Terragno, that she maintained.\nPinky hosted or co-hosted a number of other talk and variety shows during the 1960s and 1970s, the most successful of which were Feminísima, El pueblo quiere saber (People Want to Know), Pinky y la noticia (Pinky and the News) and La década del '60. She set time aside for other projects, as well, cast by Argentine and Mexican directors in a number of film roles in the 1960s. One of her interview guests in 1962, a rising figure in Argentine tango named Raúl Lavié, had recently been separated and quickly developed a relationship with the avuncular hostess; the two were married in 1965.\n\n\nLater career\nEnjoying a stellar career, she soon became known as \"Ms. Television\" in Argentina, though her private life entered a difficult phase. She and Lavié had two sons, but soon grew apart and were separated and reunited a number of times before parting ways in 1974, something Pinky has attributed to infidelity on his part. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970, but recovered a few years later. Pinky was among the stars on hand to inaugurate Argentine color television broadcasting in 1978, but soon fell out of favor with the prevailing dictatorship after agreeing to interview Norma Aleandro, a renowned actress and dissident. This led her to turn to Argentina's vibrant theatre scene, where she accepted leading roles in local productions of Two Women, The Vagina Monologues and The Prisoner of Second Avenue, among others. Pinky produced a successful Buenos Aires presentation of Annie, as well. She hosted, along Juan Alberto Badía, the OTI Festival 1988.\n\n\nPolitical career\nHer decision to co-host in 1982 Las 24 horas de las Malvinas, a television fundraiser devoted to the ongoing Falklands War, cost the hostess professional clout following the advent of democracy in 1983, whose victorious UCR she supported, ironically. Continuing to host a number of radio and television shows, she relocated to Azul, where she hosted the nationally broadcast La década del '80. Pinky became officially affiliated to the struggling, centrist Radical Civic Union following that party's 1995 election of Rodolfo Terragno as its president and, in 1999, she ran on the UCR-led Alliance for Mayor of La Matanza, the most populous district in the Province of Buenos Aires. Claiming victory after early returns on election night put her narrowly ahead, she was forced to concede defeat later in the evening after a complete tally gave the Justicialist (Peronist) Party candidate, Alberto Balestrini, a narrow edge.\nBuenos Aires Mayor Enrique Olivera named her Secretary of Social Policy Promotion for the city in 2000, where she earned plaudits for her efforts against domestic violence. She returned to television to host Pinky y la conversación in 2001 and was awarded the prestigious Martín Fierro Award for Broadcasting Excellence in 2006.

    "text": "Responsa of the Geonim (Hebrew: תשובות הגאונים) are responsa written by rabbis of the Geonic period in response to questions addressed to them.\n\n\nStyle\nIn the geonic period the elucidative letter and the scholarly responsum are characterized by a developed and rounded literary style. The Mishnah and Talmud had been definitively completed and were recognized as authoritative, and, being committed to writing, were accessible to scholars, even though they lived far from the academies, the seats of Talmudic learning. With an accurate knowledge of the Talmud and a correct interpretation of it, scholars might deduce for themselves rulings for any of the specific cases which might present themselves. Even in instances in which the questioner was not versed in the Talmud and the responsum was required to give only a brief decision on the case under consideration, the ruling was not a mere \"yes\" or \"no,\" \"permitted\" or \"forbidden,\" \"right\" or \"wrong,\" but in the shortest responsa themselves it was generally the custom for the scholars who prepared them to cite a passage from the Talmud in support or proof of their decisions, or to controvert any possible opposition on the basis of some other Talmudic passage by a refutation of it and a correct exegesis of the section of the Talmud in question. In most instances, however, the questioner himself knew the Talmudic passage from which he might draw the ruling for any specific case, the problem being whether he was able to apply this passage correctly. There were cases, on the other hand, in which he was either altogether ignorant of the application, or made it falsely, thus reaching an erroneous conclusion. In such instances the respondent was required to give an explanation of the Talmudic passage in question and its correct application to the specific case, often proving the correctness of his decision by a comparison with another passage, and adding a refutation of any other possible interpretation. He was frequently obliged, moreover, to take into consideration any consequences which might result from his decision or exegesis, and was constrained many times to explain points which, strictly speaking, had not been asked specifically, although they were more or less closely related to the subject under discussion. Many of these questions have no practical contingencies for their basis, but are concerned with the correct comprehension and explanation of certain passages of the Talmud, and the corresponding responsa are therefore restricted to detailed elucidations and fundamental interpretations. In the main, therefore, the geonic responsa are scholarly treatises, although this does not characterize them all to an equal degree, since in the course of the four centuries of the geonic period the responsum developed, in form and character, and was subjected to many changes.\n\n\nEarlier Geonim\nIn the days of the earliest geonim, the majority of the questions asked them were sent only from Babylonia and the neighboring lands, where the inhabitants were more or less acquainted with the Talmud and could, in case considerable portions of it were unintelligible to them, visit the academies in the Kallah months to hear Talmudic interpretations and explanations. The questions which were submitted in writing were accordingly limited to one or more specific cases, while the responsum to such a query gave in brief form the required ruling and a concise reason for it, together with a citation of an analogous Talmudic instance and a refutation of any possible objection.\n\n\nLater Geonim\nMore discursive were the responsa of the later geonim after the first half of the ninth century, when questions began to be sent from more distant regions, where the inhabitants were less familiar with the Talmud, even if they possessed it, and were less able to visit the Babylonian academies, the only seats of Talmudic learning. Talmudic difficulties were often the subject of these inquiries.\nAlthough a gaon declared it difficult to write elucidations of perplexing problems in many Talmudic passages, he sought, nevertheless, to give such interpretations for entire treatises and themes in the Talmud. In like manner, even those responsa which were not sent to distant lands assumed a discursive and prolix form, for though the questioner sought information only for a specific case and requested a Talmudic basis for it, the responsum was not restricted to the mere decision which might be deduced from the Talmudic passage under consideration, but included the entire context as well. It thus frequently contained more than a simple basis and foundation for the ruling drawn from the Talmud, and discussed the subject under consideration in fullest detail and in all its import, even though this had not been requested. More than this, other subjects which had but a slight bearing on the problem in question received their quota of discussion; and the respondent added also the ruling which would have been given had the point at issue been slightly different from that on which information was requested.\n\n\nMode of reply\nThe later geonim did not restrict themselves to the Mishnah and Talmud, but used the decisions and responsa of their predecessors, the elder geonim, whose sayings and traditions were generally regarded as authoritative, although there were occasional exceptions, such as the assertion of Hai Gaon that the ruling of Rabbi Naṭronai was incorrect. These responsa of the later geonim were, strictly speaking, disquisitions on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently attained the compass of an entire book. The letters of the Geonim, which, for the most part, contained replies to many problems, assumed a definite and official form. They began with the statement that the questions had been correctly received, read, and considered, and that the corresponding answers had been given in the presence of the gaon and with his approval. The introductory formula, used in the letters of the Geonim, may be illustrated by the following example:\"Amram ben Sheshna, head of the academy of the city of Meḥasya [Sura], to all scholars and their disciples and to those of our brethren of the house of Israel who dwell in Barcelona, and who are dear, beloved, and revered unto us, may their prosperity increase and wax great! Receive ye greeting from us and from Rabbi Ẓemaḥ, the president of the court, from the heads of the Kallah [\"reshe Kallah\"], from the authorized teacher, and from all other scholars and disciples of the academy, all of whom ever pray for your health, that God in His great mercy may have compassion on you. The questions which ye have laid before us we have caused to be read unto us, while the president of the court and the allufim and the other sages and disciples sat before us. We have studied them, and weighed all that is written in them, and with divine help have given to them the following answers.\" In other introductions are found the concluding words:\"We commanded and directed that the answers to your questions be written you as we have perceived them with the help of God\". This citation shows that there were regular secretaries who prepared the letters, and it is likewise clear that the judicial board and its president formulated the replies and then presented them to the gaon, who approved and signed them if they were found correct. After this general introduction the various questions and their answers were given in regular order in the letter. Each question was introduced by the phrase \"she-sh'altem\" (= \"as to what ye have asked\"), and was then repeated, either word for word or in content. The answer to each question then followed, either without any introductory phrase, or with the words, \"thus is it,\" \"the answer to this question is,\" \"if the matter is as your letter of inquiry states, it seems to us as follows,\" \"we regard it thus,\" \"thus the sages say,\" \"thus have we learned from earlier sages,\" \"know ye,\" or \"thus hath Heaven revealed unto us,\" which, however, is simply equivalent to the phrase \"with divine help we have found.\" The answer was frequently concluded with the formulas, \"thus is the final decision\" (\"halakha\"), \"thus is the correct practise,\" \"thus is the usage in the academies,\" or \"such cases come daily before the academies, and in them all we decide thus.\" After all questions and their answers had been given, the formal conclusion of the letter came. Occasionally this was the brief phrase, \"may God grant us to decide according to the Law, and to teach according to valid decision\", but more frequently, especially when the letter was sent to foreign lands, it concluded with a blessing on him who had asked the question, such as:\"May the King of Honour open for thee the light of our eyes, and for all the scholars of Kairouan, joy of our heart, our friend, our colleague, the gates of wisdom and the gates of understanding, and clothe you with a mantle of glory\".\n\n\nLanguage\nGeonic responsa are written in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. In the earliest period, Aramaic, the language of the Gemara, prevailed exclusively, but in the middle of the ninth century Hebrew began to appear in the responsa side by side with it. This innovation was doubtless due, on the one hand, to the study and knowledge of Hebrew (which spread through rabbinical circles as a result of the Karaite movement), and, on the other, to the fact that the rulings of the Geonim were thenceforth sent to distant lands, where the inhabitants were unfamiliar with Aramaic, so that it became necessary to write to them in Hebrew, the dialect of the Mishnah. When Arabic became the prevailing language of the Jews in the dominions of the caliphs, questions were frequently addressed to the Geonim in that tongue, whereupon the scholars of the academies used the same language in reply, thus accounting for the mass of Arabic responsa.\n\n\nCollections of Geonic responsa\nSome of the responsa that have survived are unmutilated and in their original form, while others are extant only in extracts.In addition to these collections, a number of geonic responsa have been published in other works, as in the Ṭa'am Zeḳenim of Eliezer Ashkenazi of Tunis (Frankfurt, 1854) and the Ḳebuẓat Ḥakamim of W. Warnheim (Vienna, 1861), as well as in the halakhic works of older authorities, such as the Halakhot of Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel and the responsa of Rabbis Shlomo ibn Aderet and Meir of Rothenburg.\n\nThe responsa of the Geonim were by no means restricted to problems of legalism or ritualism, but in addition referred to all departments of human life and knowledge, treating of liturgical, theological, philosophical, exegetic, lexicographical, archeological, and historical questions; and they likewise contain abundant material for a study of the conditions of the times in which they were written, and for the culture-history and the commercial relations of the Jews, as well as for a knowledge of the manners and customs then prevailing in Judaism. A few examples of brief geonic responsa may be cited as characteristic of the views and customs of the times:\"As to what ye have asked: 'How is it with regard to the theft of non-Jewish property in cases where it has not already been forbidden as a desecration of the divine name?' thus is our ruling: The prohibition of theft has naught to do with desecration of the divine name, but is a clearly established law which forbids any theft whatever from a non-Jew. Desecration of the divine name is mentioned only in association with objects which have been lost. According to Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, 'Whensoever it leads to a desecration of the divine name, one is forbidden to appropriate anything which a non-Jew has lost.' The vine said to have been abstracted from the garden of a Gentile by Rav Ashi was evidently taken in return for compensation,\" etc.\"And as to what ye have asked: 'After the burial of a corpse many wipe their hands on the ground,' no such custom prevails among us. And as to what ye have heard: 'While returning from the cemetery many are wont to wash their hands before reaching the house and to sit down on the way; what is the reason for this?' thus is our opinion: The washing of the hands is not obligatory, but where it is the custom one should wash them. The bidding of the sages that one must sit down seven times while returning from a corpse is intended to apply solely to the case in which one goes to the place of burial and returns from it, and solely for the kinsmen, and solely for the first day, and, above all, solely for those places where the usage is customary. The sevenfold repetition of sitting down is on account of the evil spirits which follow the returning mourners, that a demon may disappear each time the bereaved sit down\". The famous Letter of Sherira Gaon, which is the chief historic source for the Talmudic and geonic periods, was a responsum of this character, sent in reply to the questions of an African community.\n\n\nSee also\nHistory of responsa in Judaism\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "History of the PTE bus operations",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=14555970",
    "text": "The passenger transport executive (PTE) bus operations were the bus operating divisions of the passenger transport executives in the United Kingdom. In 1986 they underwent a process of deregulation and privatisation, forming some of the largest private bus companies in the UK outside London, with all being sold to their employees or management. Despite their relative size and lucrative operating areas, none of the companies survived beyond the late 1990s, with all falling into the hands of the major bus groups, who had their origins in privatised regional subsidiaries of the former National Bus Company and the Scottish Bus Group.\n\n\nBackground\nThe first passenger transport executives (PTEs) and passenger transport authorities (PTAs) were established by the Transport Act 1968.\nThe PTEs were local authority bodies responsible for running transport operations in their respective regions, accountable to the PTAs. Although trams, underground trains and light rail systems were included, the majority of transport operations controlled by the PTEs were bus services.\n\n\nFormer municipal bus companies absorbed into passenger transport executives\n\nMany municipal bus companies in the largest conurbations came under the control of passenger transport executives following the Transport Act 1968. The following is a list of the seven PTEs established in either 1968 or 1974, and the municipal bus companies which became part of combined bus fleets.\n\nMerseyside (1969)\nBirkenhead\nLiverpool\nSt Helens (1974)\nSouthport (1974)\nWallasey\nSELNEC (South East Lancashire North East Cheshire, 1969), later Greater Manchester (1974)\nAshton-under-Lyne\nBolton\nBury\nLeigh\nManchester\nOldham\nRamsbottom\nRochdale\nSalford\nStalybridge, Hyde, Mossley and Dukinfield\nStockport\nWigan (1974)\nSouth Yorkshire (1974)\nDoncaster\nRotherham\nSheffield\nStrathclyde (1972)\nGlasgow\nTyneside (1969), later Tyne and Wear (1974)\nNewcastle upon Tyne\nSouth Shields\nSunderland (1973)\nWest Midlands (1969)\nBirmingham\nCoventry (1974)\nDudley Midland Red operations (1973)\nWalsall\nWest Bromwich\nWolverhampton\nWest Yorkshire (1974)\nBradford\nHalifax\nHuddersfield\nLeeds\n\n\nDeregulation\nIn 1986 as a result of deregulation of bus services all PTEs were compelled to transfer their bus operations to \"arms length\" public transport companies.\nThis meant that the PTE/PTA could no longer regulate the routes and fares of the bus operators, nor could they prevent (legal) competition from external operators. The PTEs moved to a role of maintaining common facilities and financing less profitable but socially necessary services, although these had to go to open tender.\nAs a result of the split, all bus operations were re-branded:\n\nSouth Yorkshire as SYT (South Yorkshire Transport)\nWest Yorkshire as Yorkshire Rider\nWest Midlands as West Midlands Travel\nStrathclyde Transport as Strathclyde Buses\nGreater Manchester as GM Buses (split into North and South divisions in 1993)\nMerseyside Transport as Merseybus\nTyne and Wear as Busways\nThe rebranding served to underline the new separation of responsibilities between the PTEs and the bus companies. In order to promote competition, the GM Buses operation was split in two in 1993.\n\n\nPrivatisation\nAll the arms length bus companies were privatised by 1994:\n\nSYT sold in 1993 to employees\nYorkshire Rider sold in 1988 in a management buyout\nWest Midlands Travel sold in 1991 as an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)\nStrathclyde Buses sold in 1993 to employees\nGM Buses North sold in 1994 in a management buyout\nGM Buses South sold in 1994 in a management buyout\nMerseybus sold in 1993 to employees as MTL (Merseyside Transport Limited)\nBusways sold in 1989 as an ESOP\n\n\nCompetitive strategies\n\n\nCompetition with new companies\nAs a result of deregulation, all the new bus companies faced competition from both regional operators and small independents. Some of the biggest competition occurred in Liverpool, with competition with Merseybus from North Western and generally professional medium to large-sized independents like CMT Buses, Fareway, Liverbus and Liverline. When Merseybus was sold to its management and employees and transformed into MTL it acquired most of these competitors, most notably Fareway and Liverbus with Liverline acquired by British Bus and integrated into its North Western operation.\nSeveral PTEs faced competition from operators set up by former PTE employees made redundant during deregulation and/or privatisation. Several new competitors appealed to local customers by resurrecting former municipal company liveries which had disappeared with creation of the PTEs.\n\n\nCompetition by the new companies\nAs PTEs had historically held operating areas limited by authority boundaries, expansion into neighbouring areas was a viable strategy. Busways had looked to expand into other areas, notably Darlington. This was put on hold as the company was sold to Stagecoach Group, although the Busways company proceeded to immediately renew interest in Darlington, resulting in the events of the Darlington Bus War. Strathclyde Buses merged with the neighbouring ex Scottish Bus Group operator Kelvin Central Buses.\nSome companies competed by setting up low cost units to compete for tendered services, such as Blue Bus and TWOC of Busways, and Merseyrider of Merseybus. West Midlands Travel set up an express coach service with London Regional Transport to compete with National Express, who would ironically later purchase WMT.\nOne of the largest pieces of competition came from competition between MTL and GM Buses South, with both operators setting up operations in each other's areas. This led to both operators losing money, and was ended in a gentleman's agreement. A similar tit for tat occurred between SYT and West Riding Buses, using investment in Compass Travel and new operation Sheffield & District respectively.\nSeveral of the companies had difficulties in competing or upgrading their fleets due to repayments due to be made on loans made to finance the privatisations.\nStagecoach Group adopted a strategy of taking minority stakes in the new companies. At Mainline, a 20% stake was taken to assist in financing fleet upgrades, and to give Stagecoach first refusal in any event that the company was sold. Stagecoach also took a 20% stake in SB Holdings, Strathclyde's owning company, ostensibly to prevent imminent competition from Stagecoach West Scotland. Following a Monopolies & Mergers Commission inquiry investigating the Darlington Bus War, Stagecoach sold its stakes in both SBL Holdings and Mainline to FirstGroup.\n\n\nSell out to the major groups\nDespite their large fleets and high density operating areas, most of the former PTE groups were eventually surpassed by the growth of the emerging national bus groups. MTL was arguably the most successful former PTE, acquiring one of the former London Buses subsidiaries, London Northern (and expanding the operation), and securing two rail franchises (Merseyrail Electrics and Regional Railways North East), surviving the longest. However, even MTL was later declared bankrupt in 1999, and the majority of the business was acquired by Arriva.\nFirstGroup was by far the most successful national group at acquiring former PTE bus companies. The former PTE companies were sold to national groups as follows:\n\nMainline (ex SYT) sold to First South Yorkshire in 1998\nYorkshire Rider sold to Badgerline in 1994\nWest Midlands Travel sold to National Express in 1995\nStrathclyde Buses sold to First Glasgow in 1996\nGM Buses North sold to First Manchester in 1996\nGM Buses South sold to Stagecoach Manchester in 1996\nMTL bought as a bankrupt concern by Arriva in 2000\nBusways sold to Stagecoach North East in 1994\n\n\nLiveries\nAs a result of the rebranding, nearly all the bus companies produced bright new liveries, to contrast with the more understated liveries of the PTE operations.\nSeveral companies proceeded to make their services appear more local, by introducing local branding. Busways introduced different coloured stripes and location names. Yorkshire Rider branded its buses with a depot strapline. Once privatised, SYT (as Mainline) introduced local brands (later dropped). Merseybus, once privatised, introduced local branding for its services in Wirral and Southport. Privatised West Midlands Travel maintained a network wide livery.\nAll PTE acquisitions by Arriva, First and Stagecoach were quickly repainted into the respective corporate liveries. Busways livery survived for a few years after purchase. National Express rebranded the West Midlands Travel business as Travel West Midlands with a revised mostly white livery, latterly resurrecting a Coventry identity, Travel Coventry. The local company names persisted within the corporate schemes until the trend of regional re-grouping along geographic lines.\n\n\nSee also\nMunicipal bus companies\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Passenger Transport Executives at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "On March 1, 1951, the Soviet-controlled Communist Polish secret police, Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (UB), carried out the execution of seven members of the 4th Headquarters of the anti-Communist organization Wolność i Niezawisłość (WiN) in the Mokotów Prison in Warsaw. All those executed were members of WiN who, during World War II, took an active part in anti-Nazi resistance.\n\nThe executed men were: Łukasz Ciepliński, Karol Chmiel, Adam Lazarowicz, Józef Rzepka, Józef Batory, Mieczysław Kawalec and Franciszek Błażej. All of the men were apprehended in late 1947 and early 1948, and almost all came from the Rzeszów area. They were personally chosen to take part in the anti-Communist resistance by Ciepliński, commanding officer of the WiN's 4th Headquarters, who chose them because of their moral fortitude and their unbroken spirit.\nThe interrogations conducted by Communist investigators that ensued were particularly brutal. All seven were tortured and severely beaten. Cieplinski's legs and hands were broken, and he had to be carried by his fellows for meals in a blanket. A staged trial that took place on October 5, 1950, was led by a group of ruthless military prosecutors from the Warsaw Military District—Colonel Aleksander Warecki (real name Warenhaupt, who served as the presiding judge), Major Zbigniew Furtak, Major Zbigniew Trylinski and Lt. Col. Jerzy Tramer, who served as the Public Prosecutor.\nThe accused were not given an opportunity to refute charges brought against them, despite the fact that on several occasions Ciepliński had stated that he was tortured and that his confessions were extracted with the use of torture. The Communist judges disregarded his testimony. The courtroom was filled with UB functionaries. With approval of the presiding chief judge Warecki, the prosecutors publicly mocked the accused. The newspaper articles which covered the case ran stories that the accused men were: \"Traitors, spies and American servants [who] will be prosecuted\".\nThe accused accepted their sentences with calmness, as they had anticipated the outcome of the trial to result in their deaths. With the court ruling of five consecutive death sentences, the first of the seven men to be executed was Łukasz Ciepliński. Colonel Warecki stated afterwards that all seven were collaborating with Nazi occupiers and had betrayed Poland. After the trial, the men were moved to the Mokotów Prison, where they spent the next 137 days awaiting their execution.\nAppeals for clemency sent to then Communist Poland's president Bolesław Bierut remained unanswered, and the condemned men prepared themselves for death. Realizing that his tormentors would dispose of his body, Ciepliński decided to swallow a small portrait of the Virgin Mary, which he had worn from his neck. During this time, the condemned men shared the same large cell with 80 other anti-Communist fighters, among them Zygmunt Szendzielarz. According to the surviving witnesses, the WiN members supported and helped each other, tending particularly to Ciepliński and Błażej, both of whom suffered the most during brutal interrogations.\nIn the letter to his wife Jadwiga smuggled out of the prison shortly before his death, Ciepliński wrote:\n\"My time is near. When they will be leading me out of my cell to die, my last words to my friends will be: I am happy that I will be murdered as a Catholic for my faith, as a Pole for my country, and as a human being [I will die] for justice and truth […] My last farewell will be only to you. I believe that the Holy Mother will take my soul […] and I will continue to serve Her and report to Her about the tragedy of the Polish Nation—murdered by one [nation] and abandoned by the others.\"\nShortly before the execution, which took place in the old boiler-room of the prison, Karol Chmiel tried to escape by running along the courtyard and screaming, \"They are murdering us.\" He was captured on a pile of coal. Even though he had been promised that his letters would be mailed to his sons, the promise was never kept.\nAll seven men were shot on March 1, 1951, at five- to ten-minute intervals. They were executed with a single shot to the back of the head, the standard Communist execution method and consistent with the executions at Katyn Forest. The executions began at approximately 8 p.m., with Ciepliński being shot first, followed by Batory at 8:05, Chmiel at 8:15, Kawalec at 8:20, Lazarowicz at 8:25, Blazej at 8:35, and Rzepka at 8:45. Two of the executed men, that is, Ciepliński and Rzepka, were previously awarded Poland's highest military decoration for valor, the Cross of the Virtuti Militari.\nThe burial place of the seven WiN soldiers executed by the Communist regime remains unknown to this day. The 1950 court ruling rendered by the Communist court was overturned in 1992 by the Warsaw Military Court and the seven convicted and executed men were acquitted retroactively on all counts. In the 1992 court ruling, it is stated that the executed WiN soldiers \"Fought and Died for a Free and Sovereign Poland.\" In 2011 Polish parliament declared 1 March a National Remembrance Day for Cursed Soldiers.\n\n\nSee also\nCursed soldiers and the Polish resistance movement in World War II\nRaids on communist prisons in Poland (1944–1946)\nSoviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)\n\n\nNotes and references\n\nhttp://www.honor.pl/poprzednicy.php\n(in English) Polish secret police torture methods\n(in English) WiN | Freedom and Independence - A Historical Brief by Dr. Janusz Marek Kurtyka, Ph.D., Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN, Poland.",

    "title": "Northrop Mall Historic District",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=75009963",
    "text": "The Northrop Mall Historic District is a historic district located at the University of Minnesota's east bank campus in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It covers buildings along Northrop Mall and in the surrounding area. The district was found eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, and was officially added in January 2018. Most of the buildings are connected by the Gopher Way; a tunnel and skyway network providing easy and direct enclosed pedestrian access. The district is roughly bounded by Pillsbury Drive SE to the north, East River Parkway to the west, Union Street SE to the east, and Delaware Street SE to the south. It is located directly south of the university's Old Campus Historic District.\nThe Mall was originally envisaged by architect Cass Gilbert in a 1908 plan.  The funding for University campus expansion that enabled  construction of the Mall was largely credited to Minnesota Senator James Elwell.\n\n\nLind Hall, 1911\n\nHoused most of the university's English department until they moved to Pillsbury Hall. Currently, the building is home to the College of Science and Engineering, after a major renovation completed in 2023, providing 57,500 square feet of space for the Industrial and Systems Engineering department and additional space for the Computer Science & Engineering departments. Also inside the building is the Taylor Center, a study space which doubles as a computer lab, located in the former Engineering Library. The first floor contains a Starbucks restaurant.\n\n\nSmith Hall, 1913\n\nOne of the first University buildings in the country to be entirely devoted to Chemistry, and the first building to be constructed along what is now Northrop Mall, with work having begun in 1910. It was opened without its planned fourth floor and the west section still under construction. The building was fully completed in 1922 when funding was finally allocated for the remainder of the project. After a fire in the basement in 1959, the building required repair, and a full renovation later occurred in 1972. A second renovation, in 1987, added air conditioning. Currently, the building contains offices for the NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers.\n\n\nAppleby Hall, 1914\n\nFormerly the location of both the university's General College and College of Pharmacy; the building houses several student services, such as the Multicultural Center for Academic Excellence, the Aurora Center for Advocacy and Education, and the Gender and Sexuality Center for Queer and Trans Life. In April 2023, a deceased person was found inside a classroom within the building. While the individual had no relation to the university, they were able to gain entry due to the building being designed for public use, and as such, not requiring ID access during public hours. The incident has heightened requests for more security around campus.\n\n\nWalter Library, 1924\n\nArchitect: Clarence H. Johnston Sr.\nReplaced Burton Hall as the main library of the university. In 1959, the building was named after Frank Keller Walter, the university librarian from 1921 to 1943. In 1999, construction began on a renovation, where it received technical upgrades and historical restorations, before reopening in 2002. Today, the building houses the College of Science and Engineering Library and Dean's Office, the Digital Technology and Media Centers, the Learning Resources Center, and the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. It also features a small café in the basement, the Wise Owl Café, named in reference to the estimated 225 owl engravings in the library.\n\n\nMorrill Hall, 1925\n\nBuilt as an administration building and home to the Alumni Association until they moved to the McNamara Alumni Center.\nOn January 14, 1969, about seventy black students belonging to the Afro-American Action Committee occupied the building to protest the treatment of African Americans on campus and the absence of an African American studies department; the event becoming known as the \"Morrill Hall Takeover\". Entry to the building was blocked by the demonstrators, however the staff inside were allowed to leave. Though some office equipment was damaged and an angry white student attempted to force his way into the building, the protest was peaceful. Students Rose Mary Freeman, the president of the AAAC; Horace Huntley, the group's secretary; and Warren Tucker Jr., the leaders of the occupation, were indicted on charges of aggravated criminal damage to property, rioting, and unlawful assembly; the former two receiving a ninety-day suspended sentence and one-year probation, while the latter was acquitted. As a result of the event, many scholarships and programs for black students became available and the Department of Afro-American studies was created, becoming eventually known as the African American & African Studies department. In 2012, the Huntley House for African American Men, named after Horace Huntley, was opened by the university.\nOn October 21, 2024, pro-Palestinian protesters organized by the university's Students for a Democratic Society chapter occupied the building by barricading themselves in. Property damage was reported and 11 arrests were made. An SDS representative claimed that the building was chosen due to its history with the previous Morrill Hall Takeover.\nCurrently, Morrill Hall houses the university's administrative offices, the Undergrad Education office, and the Office of Equity and Diversity. It is also the location of President Rebecca Miriam Cunningham's office. The building is undergoing a revamp to make it more accessible to students and faculty.\n\n\nTate Hall, 1926\n\nBuilt as the Physics Building, it was later renamed to John T. Tate Hall, after John Torrence Tate Sr., a physics professor at the university. Having already had two renovations in the 1960s, the building underwent a third in 2017, at the cost of 92.5 million dollars. A significant portion of the interior was replaced, labs considered to be obsolete were turned into flexible spaces, and a large auditorium was constructed. The building currently houses the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, and the School of Physics and Astronomy, including the Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics and the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute. Tate also contains a historic observatory with a 10 and a half inch refracting telescope.\n\n\nFraser Hall, 1928\n\nBuilt to replace Pattee Hall as the home of the university's Law School at the request of its third dean Everett Fraser—after whom the building was named—as he believed Pattee's classrooms were inadequate and its library too flammable. The Law School remained at Fraser Hall for 50 years until it moved to Mondale Hall, after which Fraser became a multi-purpose building. It was expanded once in the 1950s but received no structural upgrades for almost 70 years afterwards, resulting in the approval of a $144.7 million expansion by the State Legislature in 2023. The state's grant covers two-thirds of the cost, while the remaining third is set to be paid by the College of Science and Engineering over the course of 20 years. Construction began in September of that year, and is expected to last through 2025. The original expansion is to be removed, while 18 new chemistry labs, collaboration spaces, and general-purpose classrooms will be added.\n\n\nNorthrop Auditorium, 1929\n\nArchitect: Clarence H. Johnston Sr.\nConceptualized as far back as 1908, it was built as part of a major University expansion project and was designed to host the entire 1929 student population. The auditorium was dedicated to honor Cyrus Northrop, the second president of the university, and veterans who served in World War I. Northrop's opening ceremonies included performances by the Minnesota Orchestra, the Boston Symphony, and the \"Alumni and State Program\". A pipe organ, the largest in the Upper Midwest, was installed in 1936 but later removed in 2011, during an extensive renovation of the building which reduced seating, but improved sight lines and acoustics in the main theater, and saw a second theater space added on the fourth floor. The building reopened in 2014 and the pipe organ was reinstalled three years after, in 2017.\nIn January 2023, a parapet wall failure caused a portion of the roof to collapse on the east side of the building. No injuries were reported and the theaters did not sustain any damage. The building reopened three weeks later, though repairs lasted through the year and were completed by January 2024.\n\n\nVincent Hall, 1938\n\nNamed after George Edgar Vincent, the third president of the university, and at one time housed parts of the university's English and Mortuary Science departments. In 1960, a renovation project connected Vincent to the nearby Murphy Hall, directly behind it. A later renovation project, carried out by Loeffler Construction and Consulting, upgraded floors, interior finishes, and general accessibility, along with replacing the windows and adding several fixed tables within classrooms. The building currently contains the School of Mathematics and its Library, though the latter is set to close in the summer of 2025.\n\n\nMurphy Hall, 1940\n\nThe home of the Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication. When a connection between Murphy and Vincent Halls was built, several offices within Murphy were transferred to the Math Department. The building began to fall into disrepair until it underwent a renovation in 1999, filling it with $1,000,000 worth of modern equipment, reclaiming the offices previously occupied by the Math Department, adding fire escapes to the Vincent Hall connection, and installing a sprinkler system. Additionally, several group work areas were constructed. The basement at one time contained a photography lab and offices for the Gopher yearbook, the Ski-U-Mah humor magazine, the Literacy Review, and the Minnesota Daily. The basement classrooms lacked walls, however, which students often found distracting, so proper separation was constructed during a 2023 renovation. Additionally, it now contains an upgraded space for the Sevareid Journalism Library, and studios for podcasts and broadcasting.\n\n\nCoffman Memorial Union, 1940\n\nArchitect: Clarence H. Johnston Jr.\nNamed after Lotus D. Coffman, the fifth president of the university, and originally designed to accommodate 14,000 students. Beginning in May 1970 and lasting for a month, students protesting against the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War occupied the building for 24 hours a day. In 1972, after President Richard Nixon announced a plan to blockade and mine North Vietnam's harbors, the most significant demonstrations took place around campus, including a rally at Coffman during which former United States Senator, from Minnesota, Eugene McCarthy spoke.\nIn 1976, a renovation was completed, though it became highly criticized, as it removed large portions of the structure's interior Streamline Moderne design, changed the color scheme, and made it harder for large groups to congregate in the building, as a direct response to the protests. A third of the back terrace was covered in glass, extending the main lounge which was renamed as the Ski-U-Mah lounge, though the new glass was found to often heat up the room during the summer and not maintain heat during the winter. Overall, the remodel allowed the building to accommodate 42,000 students.\nIn 1999, the building underwent a second, major renovation, with construction lasting until 2003. This renovation reversed most of the changes made in the 1976 remodel and restored much of the original building, along with constructing a new 1,900 car underground parking garage behind the structure. Additionally, the renovation saw the opening of an expansion connected to the basement of the main structure; a building known as the cube, which contains seating, a post office, an entryway to the campus bookstore, a convenience store, and a Starbucks coffee shop.\nIn 2013, a large statue of the university's mascot, Goldy Gopher, was unveiled in front of Coffman. The statue has since become a popular spot for students to take pictures at.\nIn 2019, a university task force suggested renaming the building, due to Lotus Coffman's racist and anti-Semitic policies.\n\n\nAkerman Hall, 1948\n\nHome to the Aerospace Engineering Department and built to connect to the Mechanical Engineering building, which was constructed at the same time. In 1985, a large space within the building, known as \"The Hangar\" due to it originally housing aircraft, was renovated, in which temporary laboratory spaces were added and a hallway was constructed that led to the building's driveway. The Aerospace Engineering Department later grew unhappy with these changes and for several years pushed for the space to be renovated again. In 2010, at the cost of $5.3 million, the building's fire safety systems were upgraded. Concurrently, the Hangar was renovated by BWBR Architects Incorporated for $7.6 million. Though much of the original structure was retained and returned to its pre-1985 renovation layout, including removal of the hallway to Akerman's driveway, its sixteen feet tall steel hangar doors were replaced with a glazed curtain-wall entrance and both its ground floor and second floor mezzanine were repurposed to provide collaborative spaces for students. Additionally, in 2015, the Hangar was renamed to the Gary J. Balas atrium, after Gary Balas, an Aerospace Engineering professor at the university who died from cancer in November 2014.\n\n\nMechanical Engineering, 1948\n\nBuilt as a connecting structure to a previous 1923 building, and houses the Department of Mechanical Engineering, along with the Anderson Student Innovation Labs. The building was designed to connect to the next door Akerman Hall, which was constructed at the same time. While a major expansion, the south wing, was constructed in 2000 and opened in 2001, the original building was not upgraded for over 65 years. By the time renovation started in 2014, the original west and north wings had numerous code violations in its electrical systems, HVAC, restrooms, elevators, and windows; and a mercury spill had temporarily closed a teaching lab. The renovation brought many improvements, including new electrical services, elevators, and accessibility features. The north wing received a mechanical penthouse with new piping and air handling units, while the building's windows were replaced.\nIn 2017, a 78 year old Mechanical Engineering professor, Barney Klamecki, was found dead within the building, appearing to have died of natural causes, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner.\nIn 2019, a minor chemical fire broke out at the Mechanical Engineering building, which the Minneapolis Fire Department quickly responded to and put out. Fears of the chemical's fumes caused the building to temporarily close, though it reopened later that day after it had been extensively vented.\n\n\nJohnston Hall, 1950\n\nNamed after John Black Johnston, professor of Comparative Neurology from 1907 to 1914, and professor and dean of the College of Science, Literature and the Arts from 1914 to 1937. It currently houses the College of Liberal Arts' administrative offices and student advising center, along with the Graduate School.\n\n\nFord Hall, 1951\n\nReplaced a previous two-story structure and named after Guy Stanton Ford, the sixth president of the university. The building currently houses the Department of Speech Communication, the Department of Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies, and the School of Statistics.\n\n\nVincent Murphy Courtyard, 1968\n\nArchitects: Roger Martin with Winston Close and Ralph Rapson\nA critically acclaimed example of modern architecture, built as part of a renovation linking Vincent and Murphy Halls together, and located between the two buildings. The design, created by landscape architect Roger Martin with support from University Architect, Winston Close, and Head of the university's School of Architecture, Ralph Rapson, replaced an earlier concept by the architecture-engineering firm Toltz, King & Day, who were in charge of building the connections between the two buildings, that was considered to be less sophisticated. No evidence exists about the condition and usage of the space prior to its construction. The courtyard's furnishings, circulation, and recessed design is meant to invoke a sense of peacefulness, unique from the rest of the campus. A 15-foot diameter dome-shaped fountain made of concrete is set in the middle of the space with a jet of water flowing from the top and down the sides; the initial jet reaching a height of three feet and eight inches, and meant to be visible when entering.\n\n\nKolthoff Hall, 1971\n\nBuilt to accommodate the large number of students attending the School of Chemistry and named after Izaak “Piet” Maurits Kolthoff, a professor of analytical chemistry at the university from 1927 to 1962. In May 1972, during the student anti-Vietnam War rally at the nearby Coffman Memorial Union that former United States Senator Eugene McCarthy spoke at, an explosion occurred at Kolthoff Hall, injuring a graduate student. The building was renovated in 2006, in which laboratory space was expanded, equipment was upgraded, and the offices were separated from the lab areas. Within the mall-facing entryway of the building is a periodic table made up of the actual elements.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences",

He wrote the Ḡazā-nāma-ye Rum, an epic Persian-language poem about the lives of Sultans Murad II (r. 1421–1444) and Mehmed II (r. 1444–1446, 1451–1481).\n\n\nBiography\nDetails about Kasifi's personal life are scant. The date of his birth is unknown, although he flourished in 1456 or c. 1478. According to Osman G. Özgüdenlı, his place of birth is also unknown. According to Sara Nur Yildiz, however, he was originally from Baku (present-day Azerbaijan Republic), which at that time was part of the domains of the Shirvanshahs. \"Kashifi\" is a pseudonym he used to refer to himself in his only extant work, the Ḡazā-nāma-ye Rum. The poet wrote few details about himself; he traveled through parts of the Islamic world and lived for some time in Aleppo and Urfa (Ruha, ancient Edessa), which were then ruled by the Mamluks, but was forced to leave these areas due to political upheaval.\nAfter a lengthy, difficult period during which he endured many hardships, Kashifi reached Constantinople, which had recently become the capital of the Ottoman Empire, where he worked for some time as a jester and minstrel, and lived in poverty. Eventually, he met Ottoman statesman and poet Ahmed Pasha (died 1496), who in 1478 arranged a meeting between Kashifi and Karamani Mehmed Pasha, the Grand Vizier. Kashifi took with him an unfinished Persian-language masnavi poem about  the military exploits of Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1444–1446, 1451–1481), the Ğazā-nāma-ye Rum. The Grand Vizier presented Kashifi to Mehmed II, who was very generous towards Kashifi and invited him to stay as a poet at the royal palace. Nothing more about Kashifi's life, including the precise date of his death, is known; he died in the 15th century.\n\n\nWork\nThe Ḡazā-nāma-ye Rum is Kashifi's only extant work; the only known manuscript is stored at Istanbul University. An epic poem consisting of 1,139 couplets in the motaqareb meter, he probably wrote it for Ahmed Pasha in c. 1456 or 1478. The text narrates the life and reign of (r. 1421–1444) and Mehmed II, including the Crusade of Varna (1444) and the Battle of Kosovo (1448). The work ends abruptly with an announcement of Mehmed II's wedding with the Dulkadir (Zu'l-Qadr) princess Sittişah Hatun. It remains unknown whether the text was ever completed.\nKashifi used eyewitness accounts as references, which makes the Ḡazā-nāma-ye Rum a pivotal piece of information about contemporaneous strategy, weapons and conduct of warfare. The text is the oldest Persian work written in the style of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh during the Ottoman Empire. The work also contains several couplets from Shahnameh.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nKim, Sooyong (2019). \"An Ottoman Order of Persian Verse\".

In 1967 she participated in 29 events including the 24 Hours of Spa with Marie-Claude Beaumont, and won her first title as Belgian Drivers' Champion.\nIn 1968, after several successes in an NSU Prinz and a few races in single-seater Formula Vee, she was contracted by Alfa Romeo Benelux as a works driver. In 37 events, both on circuits and rallying, she regularly won her class in an Alfa Romeo GTV. The highlight of her season was winning the overall ranking at the Houyet hillclimb race driving the Alfa Romeo GTA SA of Team Lucien Bianchi.\nShe competed in the 24 Hours of Spa eleven times, contesting her last official race on a circuit in July 1980. She also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times between 1973 and 1977, and particularly distinguished herself in 1974, supported by the French Marie Laurent and Belgian Yvette Fontaine, winning the 2-liter class in a Chevron. In 1976, she joined the prestigious Inaltéra team, with Henri Pescarolo and Jean-Pierre Beltoise, in a team with Jean-Pierre Jaussaud and Jean Rondeau. In the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans, together with Lella Lombardi (the only woman to have scored a point in the Formula One World Championship), she obtained the best female ranking in the competition to date (11th overall), despite a series of spins following an electrical failure at more than 320 kilometres per hour (200 mph) on the Mulsanne Straight. In the middle of the night, she repaired the Inaltéra alone, costing her more than two hours of downtime, both on the track and in the pits.\nIn addition, she participated in three editions of the Paris–Dakar Rally, in 1979, 1980 and 1982, and was the first woman to do so.\nIn 1977 Beckers and Lombardi were invited by NASCAR to drive in the Firecracker 400 at the Daytona International Speedway. She also took part in two editions of the 24 Hours of Daytona at the same circuit, driving an Inaltera and a BMW M3.\nIn 2024 the 80-year-old Beckers is planning to set a Guinness World Record by becoming the oldest person to drive a Formula One car. On 21 July, she intends to drive a 1980s-era Arrows A8 around Belgium's Circuit Zolder.\n\n\nPersonal life\nShe was engaged to French driver Roger Dubos, but he died during the 1973 edition of the 24 Hours of Spa in a crash with the German Hans-Peter Joisten.\nTrained as a journalist, she returned to this profession after her retirement from competition, notably in automobile magazines. She also rides motorcycles, flies, paraglides, and drives ATVs. She made several desert crossings with her second husband, Louis Schmitz. Together, they sponsored Thierry Boutsen in Formula 1, before adopting, with the help of Boutsen and Ayrton Senna, two children from Brazil.\nIn 2014 Beckers published an autobiography, La course ou la vie: Itinéraire d'une femme rapide (Race or Life: Itinerary of a Fast Woman).\n\n\nRecord\n\n\nTitles\nFive times Belgian Women's Drivers' Champion, in 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1974;\n\n\nNotable victories and rankings\nWinner of the 1974 Rallye Paris – Saint-Raphaël Féminin, in a Lancia Stratos HF (last edition of the race, counting towards the European Rally Championship);\nWinner of the 1974 24 Hours of Le Mans 2-litre class, in a Chevron B23 with Yvette Fontaine (17th overall for the Seiko Scato team);\nWinner of the 1979 Paris–Dakar Rally Ladies' Cup in a Toyota Land Cruiser with Dominique Fougerouse (41st overall);\nWinner of the 1980 Paris–Dakar Rally Ladies' Cup in a Range Rover Bastos with Thierry Gérin and Marc Stinghlamber (7th overall);\n2nd in the 1974 Giro d'Italia automobilistico, in a Fiat Abarth 030 with Giorgio Pianta;\n2nd in the 1970 AGACI 300 of Montlhéry, in an Alfa Romeo T33/2, behind Bob Wollek\n3rd in the 1970 6 Hours of Nürburgring, in an Alfa Romeo 2000 GTAm;\n4th in the 1969 12 Hours of Huy, in an Alfa Romeo Spider;\n7th in the 1973 24 Hours of Spa, in an Opel Commodore with Patrick Nève and Huub Vermeulen;\n7th in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans, in a Chevron B21 with Roger Dubos;\n7th in the 1969 3 Hours of Cape Town, in an Alfa Romeo GTV with Basil van Rooyen;\n8th in the 1971 Tour de France Automobile, in a Porsche 911 S with Ennio Bonomelli;\n8th in the 1968 12 Hours of Ypres, in an Alfa Romeo Giulia GT Veloce with Étienne Stapaert;\n9th in the 1970 European Touring Car Championship in an Alfa Romeo GTV and GTAm 2 litres for Alfa Romeo Benelux and Autodelta (4th in the 4 Hours of Monza, 5th in Salzburg, 5th in the GP of Budapest, 4th in the GP of Brno, 3rd at the Nürburgring and 4th in the 4 Hours of Jarama);\n9th in the 1973 1000 km of Spa-Francorchamps, in a Chevron B21 with Roger Dubos;\n10th in the 1970 Tulip Rally, in an Alfa Romeo 1750 SV with Gaby Arend;\n11th in the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans, in an Inaltera LM77 (Gr. 6) with Lella Lombardi.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nChristine Beckers driver statistics at Racing-Reference",

Instant Girl released an LP on Allied Recordings.  Droogas was briefly a member of the group Aus Rotten and then moved to Richmond, Virginia. She also wrote columns for the punk zines Heartattack and Profane Existence. Davison is now an architect and owner of Draw in Kansas City.

Murse World is an online store that resells merchandise directly to consumers via its own website.\n\n\nHistory\nMurse World was founded in December 2011 by Alex Mayzels and Scott Topiol, a Registered Nurse (RN). To date, the company is the only scrubs store that caters exclusively to men in nursing and other healthcare professions.  The company was founded as an alternative to traditional uniform retailers who primarily focused on women's products. Prior to Murse World's launch, men were typically faced with small selections or expected to wear unisex clothing.  The company's founders believe that the scrubs industry has largely ignored the growth of nursing as a men's profession and that the products they sell will help make the job more appealing.\n\n\nPartnership with AAMN\nMurse World announced the formation of a strategic partnership with The American Assembly for Men in Nursing (AAMN) on October 4, 2012. The purpose of this partnership was to help promote nursing as a career option for men and to raise awareness of the needs of men in nursing within the medical uniform industry.\nIn 2013, Murse World launched an annual student nurse scholarship through the AAMN Foundation. This scholarship provides financial support to male undergraduate students seeking licensure as a Registered Nurse.\nIn December 2018, Murse World announced a renewed partnership with AAMN in effort to further assist men in nursing.\n\n\n2013 Rose Parade Nurses' Float\nOn January 1, 2013, the first float honoring nurses appeared in 124th annual Rose Parade. The float was inspired by the election of Registered Nurse Sally Bixby as the parade's president. The float's 10 riders were each chosen to represent diversity in nursing.  Among the riders was Bob Patterson of AAMN.  Patterson was the only male nurse to ride the float and represented nursing as a men's profession. The scrubs and lab coat worn by Patterson during the parade were customized and donated by Murse World in support of the historic event.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Parts of Ukraine's Mykolaiv Oblast came under military occupation by Russian forces as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nBy March 2022, after unsuccessfully attempting to take Voznesensk and capture Mykolaiv, Russian forces were pushed back to the southeastern part of the oblast.\nOn 21 September 2022, it was reported that the Russian-occupied areas of Mykolaiv Oblast would be incorporated into the Russian administration for the Kherson Oblast. Russia annexed the Kherson Oblast nine days later.\nOn 10 November 2022, Ukrainian forces liberated Snihurivka, the only Russian-held city in the oblast, amid a complete Russian withdrawal from areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River. The next day, local Ukrainian officials claimed that the entire Mykolaiv Oblast had been liberated except for the Kinburn Peninsula.\n\n\nOccupation\n\n\nRussian occupation regime\nShortly after invading Ukraine, Russian forces occupied the town of Snihurivka, which is approximately 60 km (37.3 miles) from the regional capital of Mykolaiv. Russian forces also occupied surrounding towns near the border with Kherson Oblast, as well as several villages (Pokrovka, Pokrovske and Vasylivka) in the Biloberezhia Sviatoslava National Park.\nIn late April, Russian forces prepared a referendum to integrate occupied areas into the Republic of Crimea as well as appoint a governor for the areas. Russian passports and rubles were said to be issued and given out by September 1, and had already been issued and given out in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia administrations.\nOn 27 June 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine claimed to have detained a former deputy of the Mykolaiv City Council who was collaborating with Russian forces in Mykolaiv Oblast. He was a supporter of the separation of Mykolaiv Oblast from Ukraine and the creation of a Russian-backed separatist enclave called the \"Mykolaiv People's Republic\". He reportedly leaked information about the Armed Forces of Ukraine in hopes of obtaining an executive position in the occupying administration. The plan was for the separatist enclave to exist until the end of the war in Ukraine, at which point it would be annexed to Russia. The Russians had allegedly also promised the collaborator an executive position in the \"MPR\" administration as a reward for his work if they managed to occupy the region.\nThe administration was officially established on 13 August 2022.\n\nOn 2 September, Russian forces captured the settlement of Pervomaiske. The settlement of Partyzanske remained contested.\nOn 21 September, it was announced that the area surrounding Snihurivka as well as the outer portion of the Kinburn Peninsula, which constituted the parts of Mykolaiv Oblast that were under Russian control at the time, would be incorporated into Russia's administration in Kherson Oblast. These areas would eventually be annexed by Russia on 30 September.\n\n\nRussian annexation\nOn 8 August 2022, Ekaterina Gubareva, deputy head of the Kherson Civilian-Military Administration announced the annexation of occupied territories of Mykolaiv Oblast. She also claimed that in some occupied towns, Russian mobile communications have begun to work. According to her, such a decision was made in order to provide the population with social payments in the \"liberated\" territories, as well as to establish mobile communications and television broadcasting.\nOn 13 August 2022, an article published by Tass, claimed that Yuriy Barbashov, governor of occupied territories claimed that a referendum in Snihurivka would take place to join Russia. The referendum would be aligned as the one in the Kherson Oblast.\nOn 11 September, following a major Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast, it was announced that the proposed annexation referendums would be \"indefinitely\" postponed.\nOn 30 September, Russia officially annexed the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts. The occupied areas of the Mykolaiv Oblast including Snihurivka and Oleksandrivka were streamlined into the Kherson Oblast claimed by Russia. The United Nations General Assembly subsequently passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an \"attempted illegal annexation\" and demanded that Russia \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw\".\n\n\nUkrainian counteroffensive\n\nAmid the Russian withdrawal across the Dnieper River, it was reported that Russian troops were leaving Snihurivka and evacuating the population into Crimea and the occupied Kherson Oblast. During this time, Ukrainian forces recaptured Ternovi Pody and Liubomyrivka, west of occupied Tsentralne, after conducting several raids.\nOn 9 November, the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced the withdrawal of Russian forces from the right bank of the Dnieper River. The next day, Ukrainian forces re-entered the town of Snihurivka and raised the Ukrainian flag. A few other small settlements remained under Russian control. By 11 November Ukrainian forces had regained control of almost all of the oblast with only the outer portion of the Kinburn Peninsula remaining under Russian occupation.\n\n\nImpact\nThe village of Maksymivka was completely destroyed.\nA mass grave was found in Snihurivka with 27 dead civilians. At the same time, it was emphasized that no mass burial sites were found in the city, as in the massacre in Bucha, Kyiv oblast. All the bodies were buried in individual  graves. Much of the city was damaged and destroyed.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=5019041",
    "text": "In international law, document legalization is the process of authenticating or certifying a document so it can be accepted in another country.\n\n\nRationale and procedure\nDue to the lack of familiarity with foreign documents or the entities that issue them, many countries require that foreign documents be legalized to be accepted there. This legalization procedure generally consists of a chain of certifications, by one or more authorities of the country of origin of the document and of the destination country. The first authority certifies the issuer of the document, and each subsequent authority certifies the previous one, until the final certification is made by an authority of the destination country that can be recognized by the final user there.\nPublic documents must be authenticated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or equivalent of the country of origin and then legalized by an embassy or consulate of the destination country located in the country of origin. For example, an Egyptian document to be used in the Netherlands must be authenticated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Egypt and then legalized by the Embassy of the Netherlands in Egypt.\nSome cases may require more certifications. For example, to be accepted in Thailand, a document from the U.S. state of Maryland not issued by a government official must be certified by a notary public, who must then be certified by the clerk of the circuit court in the notary's county, who must then be certified by the Maryland Secretary of State, which must then be certified by the U.S. Department of State, which must finally be certified by the Embassy of Thailand in the United States. In some countries, an additional certification by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the destination country is also required.\nNot all countries require legalization of foreign documents. For example, Canada, Japan, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States generally accept documents from any country without any certification.\n\n\nAgreements\nSome countries have agreements eliminating the legalization requirement for certain documents issued by each other, such as between Argentina and Italy, between Brazil and France, between parties of the Convention on the Issue of Multilingual Extracts from Civil Status Records, and between parties of the Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The European Union also has a regulation eliminating the legalization requirement for certain documents of its member states to be accepted by each other.\n\n\nApostille Convention\nThe Apostille Convention is intended to simplify the legalization procedure by replacing it with a certification called an apostille, issued by an authority designated by the country of origin. If the convention applies between two countries, the apostille is sufficient for the document to be accepted in the destination country.\nIdeally the apostille would be the only certification needed, but in some cases additional certifications in the country of origin may be required before the apostille is issued. For example, documents not issued by a government official may need to be certified by a notary; in some U.S. states, documents certified by a notary or city official must then be certified by the respective county or court; finally the apostille may be issued, certifying the previous official. In any case, after the apostille, no certification by the destination country is required.\nThe Apostille Convention requires that countries part of the convention direct their embassies and consulates to no longer perform legalizations of documents where the convention applies. The removal of this service is intended to prevent excessive certifications potentially required by overzealous institutions, but in cases where a consular certification alone would otherwise be sufficient to legalize a document and the apostille procedure requires more steps or higher fees, the convention may actually result in a more complex or more costly procedure to certify the document.\n\n\nReferences",

Many famous Cypriots have graduated from Famagusta Namık Kemal High School.\n\n\nHistory\nAs the first Turkish Cypriot secondary education institution in Famagusta, the school was initially founded as the Famagusta Middle School (Turkish: Mağusa Ortaokulu) in 1944. It was initially a single room appended to the Gazi Primary School building. On opening, the school had 60 students. Once it reached 72 students in 1945, it moved to its own separate building; in 1949, it moved to the Kutup Osman Tekke building. The British colonial government of the time provided the monetary resources required to expand middle schools with a further three year groups, thus establishing high schools in the process. With the instigation of Niyazi Manyera, the Famagusta Middle School was expanded in 1953 and renamed after Namık Kemal, the Turkish nationalist poet who had been imprisoned in Famagusta. By 1959, the school had 2,000 students.\nIn December 1961, the students of the school undertook strike action and refused to attend school in protest of the Turkish Cypriot Communal Assembly and its educational policies. After the incident made national news, the parents wrote a letter to Rauf Denktaş, the head of the Assembly, apologising, and stating they would ensure their children returned to school.\nOwing to its historical status, the high school has one of the largest libraries in Famagusta, but keeps this library closed to the public.\n\n\nNotable alumni\nDerviş Eroğlu, third president of Northern Cyprus\nDerviş Zaim, award-winning film director\nOktay Kayalp, former mayor of Famagusta\nOz Karahan, current president of the Union of Cypriots\nBeran Bertuğ, former governor of Famagusta\nTurgay Avcı, former deputy prime minister of Northern Cyprus\nİsmet Kotak, former Cabinet minister of Northern Cyprus\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Consumers were the first American punk rock band from Phoenix, Arizona, United States, but their members quickly relocated to Los Angeles, and became involved with the then-burgeoning L.A. punk scene.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Consumers formed in Phoenix in 1977, with David Wiley on vocals, Paul Cutler and Greg Jones on guitar, Mikey Borens on bass, and Jim Allen on drums (the latter was soon replaced by Johnny Precious, formerly of another early Phoenix punk band, The Liars). Cutler and Borens were already accomplished musicians, heavily influenced by avant-garde music and art, which they then merged with punk's rage. A hostile reception by the Phoenix club scene often resulted in a violent aftermath after the band's live performances, and after approximately a year of frustration, the group relocated to Los Angeles early in 1978.\nArriving in L.A., the band hit it off with the \"Pasadena Mafia\" (an informal moniker for Pasadena groups the Los Angeles Free Music Society and Bpeople), but were only coolly received by the Los Angeles punk rock crowd. During a performance at The Whisky, Cutler got into a scuffle with Kim Fowley and his entourage. The band responded the following night by performing, as their entire set, a psychedelic interpretation of \"Alley Oop\", a song that Fowley had produced in the 1960s. The Consumers came to an end when Jones decided to move back to Phoenix in late 1978.\nOnly one recording of the band exists, from 1977. An entire album's worth of tracks were recorded in eight hours with the assistance of Cutler's friend Joey Dears, using studio time that Dears had accumulated working at a Phoenix studio. It was released posthumously in 1995 as All My Friends Are Dead.\nCutler went on to form Vox Pop, and then 45 Grave, the latter of which incorporated many Consumers songs into their set list.\nIn 1982, Cutler engineered and produced the debut EP by The Dream Syndicate, and later joined the band on guitar for their final two albums, Out of the Grey (1986) and Ghost Stories (1988), before their 1989 demise.\nBorens went on to work with Cutler in 45 Grave, as well as with The Romans, Chris Cacavas and Cathedral of Tears.  He died in 2016.\nWiley started working with other musicians from the Pasadena Mafia and LAFMS circles, and formed Human Hands, a group at the core of L.A.'s art punk and \"Associated Skull Bands\" scenes. Wiley died in 1986.\nAllen went on to play and record with a short-lived but locally popular Phoenix power pop band, Blue Shoes.\nVivier went on to play with The Feederz, Vox Pop and Killer Pussy.

    "text": "Lake Düden, also known as Lake Kulu, (Turkish: Düden Gölü or Kulu Gölü), is a brackish water lake in Konya Province, Turkey.\nLake Düden is located northwest of Lake Tuz and 5 km (3.1 mi) east of Kulu town in Konya Province at an elevation of 950 m (3,120 ft). It is a shallow brackish water lake covering 860 ha (2,100 acres) area. The lake is fed mainly by Kulu Creek, aka Değirmenözü Creek, in the west. It has no outlet. Spring waters around lake contribute also to the lake's feeding. There are nine islets inside the lake. In the south of the lake, there is a fresh water lake named \"Little Lake\" (Turkish: Küçük Göl) surrounded by dense reeds.  While the ducks generally brooding at the Little Lake in the south, the gulls and common terns prefer the islets in colonies. Lake Düden, Lake Little and their surrounding area of wetlands and steppes are declared protected area in 1992.\n\n\nEcosystem\nFlora\nMost of the nine islets are covered by grass in the spring season. The lake is surrounded by wheat fields of dryland farming and naked steppe. In the north, there are water-meadows at some places used for cattle grazing.\n\nFauna\nLake Düden is a habitat for around 40,000 waders of more than 170 species during both breeding and migration periods. The area houses summer breeds like marbled duck, ferruginous duck, white-headed duck, avocet, greater sand plover, Mediterranean gull and gull-billed tern. Before and after breeding periods, a great number of waders are observed, including black-necked grebe, ruddy shelduck, white-headed duck, black-winged stilt, avocet and snowy plover. In the winter time, the lake freezes. However, greater white-fronted goose can be observed in great numbers. Other breeding species are Eurasian spoonbill, pratincole, slender-billed gull and black-headed gull. Lake Düden is an important breeding habitat in Turkey for the world-wide endangered species white-headed duck. Lately, flamingo colonies came to the lake.\nIt is a popular site for birdwatchers from Ankara.\n\n\nEnvironmental threat\nThe sinking of water level in the lake is the most important threat. The excessive consumption of groundwater and surface water in the Konya Closed Basin started to affect the lake. Despite the intensive snowfall in 2006, the lake has almost completely dried out. As a result of the sinking of water level, the islets were connected with each other, and the breeding of birds stopped. The untreated waste water of the Kulu district was dumped in the past into Kulu Creek, which feeds the lake. The plan of Kulu municipality to build roads to and around the lake, and to afforest the lake's surrounding would be a threat for the breeding birds. Another important issue is the poaching.\nIn 2010, the district administration undertook measures to save the lake by building a waste water treatment facility and preventing unlawful water usage from the creek.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Television Centre (TVC), also known as BBC Studioworks' Television Centre, is a building complex in White City, West London, which was the headquarters of BBC Television from 1960 to 2013, when BBC Television moved to Broadcasting House. After a refurbishment, the complex reopened in 2017, providing a mix of residential apartments, retail outlets, office space, and three studios operated by BBC Studioworks for TV production. The first BBC staff moved into the Scenery Block in 1953, and the centre was officially opened on 29 June 1960. It is one of the most readily recognisable facilities of its type, having appeared as the backdrop for many BBC programmes. Parts of the building are Grade II listed, including the central ring and Studio 1.\nMost of the BBC's national television and radio news output came from Television Centre, and in later years most recorded television was output from the nearby Broadcast Centre at 201 Wood Lane, care of Red Bee Media. Live television events from studios and routing of national and international sporting events took place within Television Centre before being passed to the Broadcast Centre for transmission.\nThe building is 4 miles (6 kilometres) west of central London, in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The nearest Underground stations are White City on the Central Line and Wood Lane on the Circle and Hammersmith & City Lines.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOn Friday 1 April 1949, Norman Collins, the Controller of the BBC Television Service, announced at the Television Society's annual dinner at The Waldorf Hilton, London that a new TV center would be built in Shepherd's Bush. London broadcasts at the time came from Alexandra Palace and Lime Grove Studios (from 1949). It was to be the largest television centre in the world.\nIt was planned to be 6 acres (2.4 hectares), but turned out to be twice the size. The building was commissioned in 1949 with work starting in 1950. However government restrictions on building, through its loan sanction and licensing of materials, ensured that building work was halted until 1953. Intended as stopgaps, the BBC remodelled the former Gaumont Studios at Lime Grove, the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith and the Shepherd's Bush Empire for television production spaces and studio use; many of these facilities were still being used by the corporation decades later.\nWork resumed in 1953 on the TVC scenery block (Stage 1) and work began in 1954 on the canteen block (Stage 2), which doubled as a rehearsal space. Work on Stage 3, the central circular office block and studios, began in March 1955 on studios TC4, 5 and 2. The shells of studios TC1, TC6 and TC7 were constructed around the same time but they were not fitted out until a few years later. BBC Television Centre officially opened with TC3 operational on 29 June 1960. When it opened in June 1960, the Director of BBC television was Gerald Beadle, and the first programme broadcast was First Night with David Nixon in Studio Three.\nIn 1997, the BBC News Centre was opened, in a new complex at the front of the building. The decision to move radio news to this building was attributed to Director General John Birt, a move that was resisted by the managing director of BBC Radio, Liz Forgan, who resigned after failing to dissuade the governors. Birt's decision caused problems; for example some politicians accustomed to travelling to interviews at Broadcasting House in Central London were reluctant to make the journey to White City, despite being only 4+1⁄2 mi (7.2 km) west.\n\n\nRedevelopment\n\nIt was announced on 18 October 2007 that in order to meet a £2 billion shortfall in funding, the BBC intended to \"reduce the size of the property portfolio in west London by selling BBC Television Centre by the end of the financial year 2012/13\", with the then Director General, Mark Thompson, saying the plan would deliver \"a smaller, but fitter, BBC\" in the digital age. A BBC spokesman has added that \"this is a full scale disposal of BBC Television Centre and we won't be leasing it back\". The corporation officially put Television Centre on the property market in June 2011.\nBBC Sport and BBC Children's moved to dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford Quays in 2012, with Children's Learning, Radio 5 Live and part of BBC Future Media & Technology. The move saw up to 1,500 posts at TV Centre and 700 posts at New Broadcasting House relocate to Salford Quays. BBC Breakfast, part of BBC News, moved to Salford in April 2012.\nOn 16 July 2012, the BBC agreed to sell the site to Stanhope for £200 million. The building closed on 31 March 2013 and was redeveloped to include flats, office space, a cinema and hotels. Studios 1, 2 and 3 along with part of the basement and offices have been refurbished and leased back to the BBC on a 15-year lease. The original schedule would have seen Studios 1, 2, & 3 back in production by Autumn of 2014 however on 17 July 2014 the BBC announced that due to the extensive building work, programme production would not recommence at Television Centre until 2017 when much of the demolition and groundwork has been completed. The BBC's commercial business, BBC Studios, will lease back Stage 6 as office space which is the part formerly occupied by BBC News.\n\nAll BBC News, national radio and BBC World Service broadcasts were relocated to Broadcasting House between July 2012 and March 2013, which is said to include one of the largest live newsrooms in the world. The final news broadcasts from Television Centre took place on 18 March 2013, when the BBC News channel and remaining news output completed the move to Broadcasting House. This was one of the final live broadcasts from the building.\nA 90-minute documentary titled Tales of Television Centre was broadcast on BBC Four in 2012 ahead of the move out. On 22 March 2013, BBC Four devoted its evening schedule to programmes commemorating Television Centre. At the heart of the evening was Goodbye Television Centre, a two-hour history presented by former BBC1 controller and BBC chairman Michael Grade. The last live programme broadcast was Madness Live: Goodbye Television Centre, shown that day on BBC Four.\nIn March 2013, the BBC and Stanhope formed a joint venture, Television Centre Developments, to manage the redevelopment of the 14-acre site. Only three of the eight production studios were earmarked for continued use by the BBC, with the rest being demolished for flats, and it was argued that this would leave insufficient facilities in the capital for independent television production, and a Save Television Centre Studios website and petition was set up.\nIn December 2013, Stanhope was granted planning permission from the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham.\nIn October 2014, UK magazine Private Eye reported that having spent £60 million to remove broadcasting equipment from the building, the BBC planned to spend £12 million a year to lease back parts of the building. This decision was in direct contradiction of the BBC's promise in 2007 that the sale of TVC was a \"full-scale disposal\" and that it would not be leasing back any part of the building.\nDemolition work began in February 2015.\nAs of April 2016, only Studios TC1, TC2 and TC3 remained – the other studios TC4, TC5, TC6, TC7 and TC8 had all been demolished. The statue of Helios, the Greek God of Sun, had been removed for renovation before it returned later in 2016; developer Stanhope and construction manager Mace had carefully removed the gilded bronze figure with heritage experts PAYE Conservation for repair and renovation. The Helios has stood in the rotunda at Television Centre since the former BBC headquarters opened in 1960.\n\n\nReopening\nBBC Studioworks, the commercial subsidiary of the BBC operate and maintain Studios 1, 2 and 3 and the  production facilities at Television Centre. The newly refurbished facilities officially opened on 1 September 2017. As of April 2017, bookings for the renovated studios were being taken.\nThe first programme to transmit live from the newly refurbished studios was Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two on BBC Two on Monday 25 September 2017. It was hosted by Zoe Ball.\nIn April 2018, ITV's daytime programmes Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning,  Loose Women and political discussion programme Peston moved to Television Centre, due to the closure and redevelopment of The London Studios. However, in October 2018, it was announced that ITV would not be returning to the South Bank.\nOn 29 June 2020, Television Centre turned 60 years old and the Royal Television Society released a commemorative programme to celebrate.\nOn 20 May 2025, it was announced that all four ITV Studios Daytime shows would leave Television Centre as part of a schedule change that would take effect in January 2026, with Good Morning Britain moving to the headquarters of ITN, and the other three (Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women) also leaving. Although unconfirmed, Peston would also be leaving Television Centre and moving to a new as-yet unknown location. It was later announced that Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women would all move to The Hospital Club in Covent Garden. This means Studio TC2 and TC3 will now be available to other television productions, especially Studio TC3 which had been block booked for Good Morning Britain and This Morning, who had permanent sets built into the studio. From January 2026, Studios TC2 and TC3 will be available for the first time since 2018 to other television programmes.\n\n\nThe building\n\n\nDesign\nThe overall design from the air appears to resemble a question mark in shape. The architect, Graham Dawbarn, (Norman & Dawbarn), drew a question mark on an envelope (now held by the BBC Written Archives Centre) while thinking about the design of the building, and realised that it would be an ideal shape for the site. An article in The BBC Quarterly, July 1946, proposed a circular design, several years before Dawbarn drew up his plans. The building features a central circular ring (officially known as the Main Block, but often referred to by BBC staff as the \"doughnut\"), which comprises a central courtyard around which were studios, offices, engineering areas and the News Centre.\nThe building as opened in 1960 was extended a number of times, notably along the 'spur' towards Wood Lane in line with the original masterplan although the actual implementation was completed over a number of decades and by different architects. Despite a number of extensions, the BBC had to seek accommodation elsewhere, such as the nearby BBC White City complex comprising White City One, a 25,000 square metre office building, and the adjacent Broadcast and Media Centres.\n\n\nHelios statue\nIn the central courtyard of the doughnut, raised on a central column, is a gilded statue designed by T. B. Huxley-Jones of Helios, the Greek god of the sun, symbolising the radiation of the light of television around the world. At the foot of the statue are two reclining figures, symbolising sound and vision, the components of television. It was originally a fountain, but owing to the building's unique shape it was too noisy for the staff in the overlooking offices, and there were problems with water leakage into the videotape area which for a long time was directly beneath.\n\n\nAtomic Dots\n\nAffectionately known as the Atomic Dots, the 26 white circular disks attached to the exterior façade of Studio 1 are among the building's most recognisable architectural details, becoming a defining visual element of the BBC and appearing on countless television broadcasts. They form a geometric grid of three rows, which run the span of the large and otherwise unadorned rectangular red brick facade. Conceived as a functional as well as an aesthetic feature, each disk is backlit and clearly illuminated at night. Their colloquial nickname arose due to the mid-century modern design cues that are evocative of the atomic age. Designer Arthur Hayes developed the pattern by experimenting with a scale foam model, using drawing pins to explore their placement. Hayes also designed the original lettering positioned above the facade, a typography that was then incorporated across the complex.\n\n\nJohn Piper mosaic\n\nIn the main entrance lobby is a large mosaic mural designed by John Piper that was installed ahead of the opening of the building in 1960. Piper worked with Dennis M. Williams on its manufacture and installation. Measuring 7.6 metres by 4.2 metres, it extends over the full width of the west wall. Thousands of glost-fired ceramic tesserae combine to create a multicoloured abstract design that mirrors the mid-century modern design aesthetic seen elsewhere around the building.\n\n\nListed status\nThe development of the Westfield shopping centre nearby led to a sharp rise in property prices and placed the Television Centre under threat. In February 2008, with an amendment in November, English Heritage requested listed status for the scenery workshop, the canteen block adjoining the Blue Peter Garden, and the central building. Previously, under a longstanding deal between the BBC and English Heritage the building was not listed to allow the BBC to make changes necessary in a broadcasting centre. In return, the BBC agreed that if it left, the fabric of the building would be restored to its mid-1960s state, and English Heritage would list notable features.\nOn 17 June 2009 the Central Ring of the building and Studio 1, noting in particular the John Piper mosaic, central drum with its mosaic tiles, the Huxley-Jones gilded statue of Helios, full-height glazing of the stair and original clock in the Central Ring, received Grade II listed status from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The 'atomic dots' and name of Studio 1, and the cantilevered porch on its exterior were noted as important architectural features of that building. The department did not consider the other buildings, including all other studios, scenery block and canteen of sufficient special interest to warrant listing. Making the protection announcement, the architecture minister Barbara Follett noted that it was where Doctor Who, Fawlty Towers and Blue Peter were made: \"It has been a torture chamber for politicians, and an endless source of first-class entertainment for the nation—sometimes both at the same time.\"\n\n\nCurrent studios\nCurrently, and in the later years of the BBC's occupation of the centre, the studio facilities were run by the wholly owned commercial subsidiary BBC Studioworks. The studios vary in size and all studios were usually abbreviated to initials, such as TC1 (Television Centre 1) for Studio 1.\nThe studios have hosted a wide variety of television programmes covering a diverse range of genres for a range of broadcasters. Notable productions hosted at the centre prior to 2013 include Strictly Come Dancing, Harry Hill's TV Burp, Match of the Day, Later... with Jools Holland, Miranda, The Alan Titchmarsh Show, The Armstrong & Miller Show, 8 Out of 10 Cats as well as big complex live productions such as Children in Need and Comic Relief. Classic BBC productions hosted at the site include some of Britain's best known television programmes including Fawlty Towers, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Blue Peter, Absolutely Fabulous, the original Doctor Who series and most of the best known BBC drama series.\nFrom the 1980s the use of the complex for such productions declined with the last major drama series to be shot there being The House of Eliott, which ended in 1994, and the last single drama recorded was Henry IV, Part 1, in 1995. The reason for the decline was because drama productions (except for soap operas) shifted almost entirely onto film or single-camera video, and Television Centre was a video-based, multi-camera production environment.\n\nStudio 1 – 10,250 sq ft (952 m2) – Opened on 15 April 1964, it was the fourth-largest television studio in Britain, and was one of the four studios to be equipped for HDTV production (along with TC4, TC6 and TC8). In May 2020, Loose Women temporarily moved from TC2 into TC1 to allow for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in London. In mid-July, Loose Women returned to TC2.\nProgrammes recorded or transmitted included:\n\nStudio 2 – 2,400 sq ft (220 m2) Opened in late 1960, the studio was home to many comedy programmes, among those being That Was the Week That Was. Initially, it was not converted for colour production, and closed in 1969, with the studio space being used for storage until it reopened in 1981. It was used by BBC News until they moved in 1997, and has played host to the Sports and Children's department. It was the main studio used for Blue Peter for the 2007 and 2008 series. It was vacated following the move of both departments to dock10. Studio 2 is currently the home of the ITV programmes Lorraine, Loose Women and Peston, in addition to Channel 4's Sunday Brunch.\nStudio 3 – 6,390 sq ft (594 m2) – Opened on 29 June 1960, it was designed as a drama studio and had customised panels and fittings. The walls were slightly thicker to insulate it from noise from the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines (then still part of the Metropolitan line) of the London Underground. It was the first studio to be completed and was upgraded to colour in 1969. Studio 3 currently broadcasts ITV programmes Good Morning Britain and This Morning. It was one of two studios that hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1963; the other being Studio 4.\n\n\nFormer studios\nStudio 0 – 1,260 sq ft (117 m2) – Opened in 1989 as a music studio, it would later become a control room as Studio 12. Productions for UK Play and, later on, virtual reality programmes, were produced here. It was home to Liquid News between 2000 and 2002 and CBeebies in vision continuity between 2002 and 2008, with the studio subsequently used by BBC R&D.\nStudio 4 – 6,300 sq ft (590 m2) – Opened in January 1961, TC4 had a similar layout to TC3, and was designed as a light entertainment studio. It was upgraded for colour production in 1970 and to HDTV and surround sound production in 2008. Programmes such as Z-Cars, Top of the Pops, Strictly Come Dancing, and Room 101 were recorded in TC4.\nStudio 5 – 2,400 sq ft (220 m2) – Opened in August 1961, it was initially used to broadcast programmes from BBC Schools, with an adjacent area used for such programming that was linked to the studio. It was converted for colour production in 1973, and was closed in the mid-1980s. Following a two-year refurbishment in 1987, sports programmes such as Match of the Day, Football Focus, and Grandstand were recorded in TC5 until November 2011, when the Sports department moved to MediaCityUK in Salford.\nStudio 6 – 6,440 sq ft (598 m2) – Coinciding with BBC Two's switch to colour, TC6 opened in July 1967. It was the first such studio to be equipped for colour production. The initial plan was to build a split studio with a large, removable wall in the middle, but this idea was abandoned. Children's programmes such as Live & Kicking and Dick & Dom in da Bungalow, and Pointless were recorded in TC6. Later, the control room of the studio was moved in 1993 and was used as the control room for the Red Button service. It was converted for HDTV production in July 2010, and later became the first 3D-capable studio in Britain.\nStudio 7 – 2,400 sq ft (220 m2) – Opened in 1962, children's programmes such as Going Live! and Play School were initially recorded in TC7. Following BBC News' move to the studio in 1997, news programmes such as BBC Breakfast and BBC News at Six were broadcast, with other news programmes transmitted from various studios in the News Centre. BBC Breakfast ended its broadcast in TC7 on 5 April 2012, with production moving to MediaCityUK, and BBC News at Six ended its broadcast on 15 March 2013, with news programming subsequently moving to Broadcasting House in central London.\nStudio 8 – 6,480 sq ft (602 m2) – Opened in 1967, it was considered, by television producers, the best studio for use, owing to its size. It primarily broadcast comedy programmes, sitcoms and quiz shows such as Miranda, Tipping Point and Five Minutes to a Fortune. It was the first studio to be converted for HDTV production, having done so in January 2007.\nStudio 9 – 900 sq ft (84 m2) – Built in 1955 as a foyer of the restaurant block, it was later converted to a store. It was converted to a studio in 1996 for CBBC, and was cited for its convenience and its roominess. CBBC left the studios in 2004, and all in-vision continuity was moved 2 years later to TC12. Programmes such as Sam & Mark's TMi Friday and SMart were recorded from TC9.\n\n\nStudio 10\n111 square metres (1,200 ft2)\nOpened as N1 in September 1969, it was used for the BBC1 daytime news bulletins, and the home of BBC World (previously BBC World Service News) from 1993. Closed in spring 1999 when news bulletins moved to the News Centre section of Television Centre, and renamed as TC10. Used for some programmes by channel UK Play until the station's closure. Between 2004 and 2006 it was used for in-vision continuity for CBBC on BBC One and BBC Two, before being used by some programming for CBBC such as Level Up. From 2010 to 2011 it was the home of CBeebies.\n\n\nStudio 11\n186 square metres (2,000 ft2)\nOpened as N2 in September 1969, and the same size as N1, it was used for the BBC2 daytime news bulletins. Extended in 1985 to include props store and adjacent lobby, it became home to the Six O'Clock and Nine O'Clock News. In spring 1999, following the completion of the News Centre spur of Television Centre, the news moved out and it was renamed TC11. In 2002 it became home to Liquid News and later to the other BBC Three news programmes 60 Seconds and The 7 O'Clock News. It briefly played host to the domestic BBC News bulletins while their studios were refurbished in 2006, before becoming general purpose. It was home to Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two until 15 December 2011, after which the studio was closed.\n\n\nStudio 12\n56 square metres (600 ft2)\nOriginally built as a control room for the music studio originally located in Studio 0. Studio 12 was converted into an ad-hoc studio in 2004 for CBBC programmes. It was also used for Sportsround for some years, but was eventually converted into a presentation studio in 2006. It was used for in-vision continuity for CBBC and changed into an in-vision continuity studio in summer 2007. The set was transferred to a mini studio in the East Tower. It was used by BBC Research.\n\n\nPres A\n65 square metres (704 ft2)\nOpened in 1960, designed for in-vision continuity for BBC 1, but was used as such for only three years. Became weather studio prior to the move to the BBC Weather Centre in 1990 (also in Television Centre), following which it was used by Children's BBC to supplement presentation from the 'Broom Cupboard', and was used for slots such as birthdays and public holidays. It became full-time home of Children's BBC in 1994 following the vacation of the 'Broom Cupboard'. It closed following CBBC's move to TC9 and was converted into additional presentation control rooms.  The substantially thick wall between Pres A and B was removed and a mezzanine floor constructed to house a larger presentation control area for interactive and children's channels CBBC and CBeebies.\n\n\nPres B\n65 square metres (704 ft2)\nOpened in 1964, Pres B was designed for in-vision continuity for BBC 2, but that channel did not use in-vision continuity for more than a few months after launch. Became a general purpose studio housing small productions such as Points of View, the Film series with Barry Norman and The Old Grey Whistle Test. It closed in 1996 and initially remained disused until it was converted (along with Pres A) into additional presentation control rooms.  The substantially thick wall between Pres A and B was removed and a mezzanine floor constructed to house a larger presentation control area for interactive and children's channels CBBC and CBeebies.\n\n\nNews studios\nIn addition to these studios, BBC News used a number of studios for the frequent news bulletins. These studios have a different naming system owing to their permanent usage and were not included on most studio lists, as they were unavailable for hire.\n\nN1 – Previously BBC One daytime bulletins. Became TC10\nN2 – Previously BBC Two daytime bulletins. Became TC11\nN3 – Small studio off main newsroom, before being made part of newsroom, separated by glass panels.\nN4 – Studio, became part of the BBC Club bar\nN5 – Originally studio for BBC Arabic Television service, which closed in 1996. It was a storeroom until 2001 when it was used for the BBCi service, then from 2007 as a home for Click prior to its move to Broadcasting House in 2012.\nN6 – Formerly home to BBC News at One, BBC News at Ten and the BBC News channel.\nN8 – Home to BBC World News prior to its move to Broadcasting House in 2013, and by the BBC News channel from 1999 to 2008. BBC News channel still used the studio to allow the BBC News at Ten to rehearse in N6 until 2013\nN9 – Home to BBC World News until 2008 and BBC News 24 from 1997 to 1999, used as a contingency when N6/N8 unavailable due to technical work and for election coverage\nN10 – Formerly used by BBC Three to produce 60 Seconds\nThese studios were located in Stage 5 & Stage 6, commonly known as the BBC News Centre.  BBC News moved out of Stage 6 in 2013 to the new BBC News Centre at New Broadcasting House in Central London.  After redevelopment, Stage 6 became the new home to the commercial arm of the BBC, BBC Studios.\nThere was no N7, to avoid confusion with TC7, which housed 'big' news programmes such as BBC Breakfast, Working Lunch, and Newsnight.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn February 1996, the electricity and heating were transferred to a European Gas Turbines (EGT) 4.9MWe Typhoon gas turbine combined heating, power and cooling unit. It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m HVAC system reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, without a second chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine's chimneys caught fire, bringing TV output to a halt. After the fire the turbines were no longer used regularly.\n\n\nRecent productions\n\n\nBBC productions\n\n\nITV productions\n\n\nOther productions\n\n\nMajor events\n\n\nTerrorist target\n\nOn 4 March 2001, a bomb placed outside the news centre exploded, with no fatalities. It was attributed to the Real IRA and the culprits were eventually caught. The front of the building suffered moderate damage, but was soon repaired.\n\n\nPower failures\nTelevision Centre has suffered from power cuts that affected normal broadcasting, but these were not seen as a systemic problem. One such power cut caused the launch night of BBC2, on 20 April 1964, to be cancelled; programmes began the next day.\nA major power failure occurred on 20 June 2000 at approximately 5 p.m., affecting the entire Television Centre resulting in services such as BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Radio 4 coming off air and/or altering their schedules. BBC News 24 went off air twice before being relocated to the BBC's Westminster studios and simulcasting with BBC World (marking a rare occurrence where BBC World was broadcast to UK viewers). The Six O'Clock News suffered severe lighting problems and had to be cancelled halfway through, and the BBC's backup generator caught fire. Troubles were experienced in the South East region, as Newsroom South East started later than planned. The fire alarms went off at Television Centre later that day, leaving only a skeleton crew. Eventually many programmes returned, from different locations: Newsnight was presented from the main news studio with intermittent technical problems. The issues were attributed to a failing substation in Shepherd's Bush. Normal services resumed the following day.\nJust before 8 a.m. on 28 November 2003 an electrical fault caused some equipment to overheat, which set off fire alarms. Although there was no fire, the fault caused widespread power cuts and prevented backup generators from providing alternative power. All output was affected with services transferred across London to alternative studios. The One O'Clock News and BBC News 24 broadcast for much of the day from the BBC's Millbank Studios, and the Today programme and Five Live's Breakfast morning radio shows fell off air for 15 minutes. The Millbank Studios are a fall-back for news operations in the event of TVC failure, and are continually recording the last hour of the BBC News Channel output (without in-vision clock) for this purpose. This power cut came on the week prior to the relaunch of News 24 as well as BBC World, which was postponed for another week to ensure that all problems had been remedied.\n\n\nProtests\n\nProgrammes have been interrupted by protesters gaining access to Television Centre. In 1988, a group of lesbian protestors campaigning against Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 gained access to the studio of the Six O'Clock News during a live broadcast. Newsreader Sue Lawley continued with the broadcast, while co-presenter Nicholas Witchell tackled the intruders off-camera.\nOn 20 May 2006, during the live broadcast of National Lottery: Jet Set the studio was invaded by members of the Fathers 4 Justice campaign group, causing the show to go briefly off air while the protesters were removed. This was also a problem as that night's lottery broadcast ran straight into the Eurovision Song Contest 2006.\nFor Question Time on 22 October 2009, the BBC invited the leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin, onto the programme for the first time, causing heated public debate and strong protests outside the studios. Television Centre had its security breached with around 30 anti-fascist protesters storming the reception area and several hundred protesters gathering outside. Police and security staff were forced to close gates leading into the centre and form barriers to prevent any further breaches of security.\nOn 9 August 2021, a number of anti-vaccine protestors upset with BBC News for \"promoting Covid-19 vaccines\" attempted to gain access to Television Centre. The BBC's news operations were not on site as they had left the facility in 2013. Police were deployed to prevent the protestors entering BBC Studioworks, and some of the protesters later marched to Broadcasting House where BBC News is based.\n\n\n2025 fire\nOn 6 September 2025, a \"complex fire\" broke out in one of the complex's restaurants. Firefighters from the London Fire Brigade spent twelve hours bringing the conflagration under control, and residents in several neighbouring buildings were evacuated.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBBC Studioworks – operate the remaining studios on site\nTelevision Centre – official website for the redevelopment\nTV Studio History Unofficial History of BBC Television Centre\nGES046 – BBC TV Centre (Trip 1) Guerrilla Exploring, Unofficial Insider Tour – a look around the building and behind the scenes in 2011",
    "summary": "Television Centre (TVC), also known as BBC Studioworks' Television Centre, is a building complex in White City, West London, which was the headquarters of BBC Television from 1960 to 2013, when BBC Television moved to Broadcasting House. After a refurbishment, the complex reopened in 2017, providing a mix of residential apartments, retail outlets, office space, and three studios operated by BBC Studioworks for TV production. The first BBC staff moved into the Scenery Block in 1953, and the centre was officially opened on 29 June 1960. It is one of the most readily recognisable facilities of its type, having appeared as the backdrop for many BBC programmes. Parts of the building are Grade II listed, including the central ring and Studio 1.\nMost of the BBC's national television and radio news output came from Television Centre, and in later years most recorded television was output from the nearby Broadcast Centre at 201 Wood Lane, care of Red Bee Media. Live television events from studios and routing of national and international sporting events took place within Television Centre before being passed to the Broadcast Centre for transmission.\nThe building is 4 miles (6 kilometres) west of central London, in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The nearest Underground stations are White City on the Central Line and Wood Lane on the Circle and Hammersmith & City Lines.",

    "text": "709 Naval Air Squadron (709 NAS), sometimes called 709 Squadron, was a Fleet Air Arm (FAA) naval air squadron of the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy (RN) which last disbanded during January 1946. It formed in September 1944 within the School of Naval Air Warfare as the Ground Attack School using both the British Supermarine Seafire and the American Grumman Hellcat fighter aircraft for training. The squadron spent its whole sixteen month existence based at HMS Vulture, Royal Naval Air Station St. Merryn.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nGround Attack School (1944–1946)\n709 Naval Air Squadron formed at RNAS St Merryn (HMS Vulture) on 15 September 1944, as part of the School of Naval Air Warfare. It was tasked as the Ground Attack School. The squadron was initially equipped with Supermarine Seafire L Mk III. These were a navalised version of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft, adapted for operation from an aircraft carrier. The Supermarine Seafire aircraft had previously belonged to both 808 and 885 Naval Air Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm’s 3rd Naval Fighter Wing, which was in the process of converting to Grumman Hellcat fighter aircraft.\nAt its inception, the squadron consisted solely of three instructor pilots. The training programs offered focused on the methodologies of strafing and dive bombing, complemented by live firing exercises conducted at HMS Vulture II, the RN Emergency Landing Ground and Trelliga Ranges, located 11 miles (18 km) northeast of the airfield. By early January 1945, the number of pilots in the squadron had expanded to six, ultimately peaking in October 1945 with a total of twenty naval pilots.\nAdditionally, an Army liaison section was integrated into the squadron to provide instruction on Army Co-operation Flying techniques. This collaboration aimed to enhance the operational effectiveness of the pilots by ensuring they were well-versed in joint tactics and coordination with ground forces.\nThe School also operated Grumman Hellcat, an American carrier-based fighter aircraft. These aircraft were used in training to apply lessons learned by the 3rd Naval Fighter Wing during the Normandy invasion. 709 Naval Air Squadron disbanded at RNAS St Merryn (HMS Vulture) during January 1946.\n\n\nBuccaneer S.1 (1965)\nIn March 1965, there were intentions to establish a Blackburn Buccaneer S.1, a carrier-capable attack aircraft, Operational Flying School, designated as 709 Naval Air Squadron, through the renumbering of 809 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Lossiemouth (HMS Fulmar). However, this initiative ultimately resulted in the formation of 736 Naval Air Squadron instead.\n\n\nAircraft operated\n\n709 Naval Air Squadron operated a couple of different aircraft types and variants:\n\nGrumman Hellcat F. Mk. I fighter aircraft (September 1944 - January 1946)\nGrumman Hellcat F. Mk.

Its name was taken from Buffalo Bill.\n\n\nBackground\nBills were gangs of teenagers that dressed in cowboy outfits and went against the prevailing political views of the time. They wore cowboy hats that were brown and had cowboy boots. From 1957 to 1959, half a dozen movie theaters opened in the \"African\" neighborhoods in Léopoldville (the city was segregated into African and European areas). The majority of Léopoldville's population was under 20, and most of these youths were educated to only primary level, since the colonial government reserved most of the secondary school places for Europeans. Poor education resulted in large scale unemployment, and, with little else to do, the youths began to make the theaters their meeting points. They were particularly drawn to Western movies, and \"Billism\" began to incorporate many of the motifs into their lives. The portrayal of Buffalo Bill in the movies was especially appealing partly because of the similarity to hunter heroes of Congolese culture. The character of Buffalo Bill had already appeared in over 20 films by that time, but the most influential movie is thought to be Pony Express, where Charlton Heston played Bill.\n\n\nWay of life\nThe Bills dressed in cowboy outfits (kerchiefs, jeans and shirts) sold in Kinshasa. The names of the 'territories' for each gang echoed those of the Western United States (Texas, Santa Fe), and the gangs themselves were usually named after their territories (such as the \"Texas Bills\"), but occasionally strayed outside the Western United States pantheon (such as \"Godzilla\"). Some commentators have suggested they provided a street-level counterpart to the more refined and overtly political anti-colonial struggle that was then being fought by some of the évolués (the middle class educated elite).\n\n\nHindoubill\nThe Bills developed their own argot called Hindoubill (or Hindubill). The origins of this name are obscure, but may relate to either the Hindi films occasionally shown in Kinshasa, or to the Bills conflating the Native American \"Indians\" of \"Cowboys and Indians\" with the Indians of India (à la Columbus' mistake).\n\n\nReferences\n\nDe Boeck, Filip & Plissart, Marie-Françoise.

    "text": "Margie Gibson (March 29, 1916 – December 9, 1990) was an American jazz composer and arranger of South Asian descent. Gibson broke the color line by having her music played and recorded by some of the leading white bands of the time. She was not primarily an instrumentalist and stayed largely behind the scenes.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nMargie Gibson was born in Baltimore, Maryland on March 29, 1916. She was the only child of Nathaniel and Mavis Gibson, a Hindu couple who had emigrated from Calcutta to America. Gibson's family moved to Asbury Park, New Jersey when she was quite young. She studied piano with Madeline Harris, who emphasized theory and harmony. In order to obtain a knowledge of instruments, Gibson bought an alto horn to facilitate her interest in orchestration. At the age of 18, she met her mentor, arranger/composer Bill Grey, with whom she remained remain closely associated for the rest of her short career.\n\n\nCareer\nIn the mid-1930s, Gibson moved to New York to continue up her studies with Grey and supported herself by modeling for various organizations, including the New York Art League.\nHer first major success as an arranger came in 1940, when she wrote two different big band versions of \"It’s A Wonderful World\", one for Coleman Hawkins and one for Harry James. Although never recorded commercially, broadcast recordings of both exist.\nGibson rose from obscurity to great fame based on her work in 1941. Her arrangements of pop songs and occasionally her own original pieces were recorded by four of the most popular names in the music business at the time. In January alone, these recordings of Gibson's work were made:\n\nWith Harry James\n\"Music Makers\"\n\"Answer Man\"\nWith Benny Goodman\n\"Let the Doorknob Hitcha\"\nWith Count Basie\n\"Beau Brummel\"\nMore recordings were to follow through early 1942, including her original compositions \"Take It\" (recorded by Benny Goodman) and \"Deuces Wild\" (recorded by Artie Shaw). She also worked with Paul Whiteman, Ella Fitzgerald, and Jimmie Lunceford.\nGibson's music had a spare quality, akin to that of one of her inspirations, Jimmy Mundy.\n\n\nWar years and move to Chicago\nGrey and Gibson moved to Chicago in late 1941, where they opened a record store, just one of the many anomalies in Gibson's career, given her great success in New York. They offered to supply arrangements to Army bands that had an interest in jazz to support the war effort.\nGibson spent a lot of time creating new music for the Bobby Byrne, Fletcher Henderson, and Boyd Raeburn bands throughout 1942.\n\n\nLater years, disappearance, and death\nBy 1945, Gibson was in Los Angeles, playing second piano and arranging for a band led by the obscure singer Bob Parrish. Very little is known about Gibson after 1945. After initial success with some of the best bands of the day playing and recording her music, Gibson disappeared from the major leagues of show business and has remained obscure, with the exception of a few mentions in jazz histories and liner notes. She is absent from The Grove Dictionary of Jazz, the music's main reference source, even though she wrote for Benny Goodman, Harry James, Artie Shaw, Coleman Hawkins, Jimmie Lunceford, Fletcher and Horace Henderson, and Boyd Raeburn.\nShe died on December 9, 1990, in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\n\n\nLegacy\nGunther Schuller's The Swing Era contains a summary of her work.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Irving Crane (November 13, 1913 – November 17, 2001), nicknamed \"the Deacon\", was an American pool player from Livonia, New York, and ranks among the stellar players in the history of the sport. Widely considered one of the greatest pool players of all time, and a member of the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame, he is best known for his mastery in the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous) at which he won numerous championships, including six World Straight Pool Championship titles.\n\n\nEarly life\nCrane's fascination with billiards started at age 11, sparked by play on a toy pool table his brother received as a Christmas gift. When he showed interest and ability, his father Scott Crane, a trial lawyer and sportsman, and his mother, a high school teacher, soon replaced their dining room table with a 4' by 8' pool table. He soon ventured out of the home to practice a couple days each week at Olympic Billiards, a room that was part of a bowling alley in Scottsville, a suburb of Rochester, New York. Crane stated in 1998: \"Other kids, you know they'd play for twenty minutes or half an hour and they'd say, 'let's do something else.' I could play all day and never get enough. I couldn't wait to get home from school to play.\"\nCrane's status as a wunderkind was quickly evident; although he was entirely self-taught, at 14 he ran 89 balls in straight pool at a local pool room, calling each shot in advance, as is mandatory in straight pool. Following this feat, his parents replaced the smaller table with a full size tournament table. Over the next ten years some of the best players of the era, including Willie Hoppe and Andrew Ponzi, came to practice with the promising champion. Despite consistent play throughout his teenage years, Crane did not enter any tournaments until he was 23 years old.\nIn February 1939, at age 26, Crane ran 150 balls and out against his opponent in an exhibition straight pool match on a difficult 5' by 10' table in Layton, Utah. While this was impressive in and of itself, at the crowd's urging, he continued his run, ultimately pocketing 309 consecutive setting an official record at the time.\n\n\nWorld titles\nThis coup was soon followed by his first world title in 1942. Over the following three decades, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Straight Pool Championship in 1942, 1946, 1955, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Pool in 1978. Of these triumphs, his win at the 1966 BCA U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship is one of the most celebrated, him running 150 and out in the finals, never letting his opponent back to the table after an early safety battle; an accomplishment that has never been equalled in the tournament. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes at the World Straight Pool Championship on 13 occasions.\nDespite his mastery and world renown, Crane found it hard to make a living solely playing pool, and in 1957 began working as a Cadillac salesman at Valley Cadillac Inc. 333 East Avenue in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. According to Crane's daughter, at Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit featured a pool table at which Crane would run balls while answering questions. \"Working\" for a living was purely a choice of survival. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, Crane said, \"If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy is when I was at a pool table.\"\nDescribed as a \"tall, lean man with the imperial bearing of the headmaster of Eton,\" Crane earned the appellation \"the Deacon\" because of his gentlemanly ways, his very cautious approach to the game and his impeccable dress, never approaching a pool table except in a conservative suit. Los Angeles Times sports columnist Jim Murray once said Crane \"would make Henry Fonda look furtive.\" Highlighting Crane's both cautious approach and mastery, Mike Sigel, one of pool's most illustrious players, reportedly asked Crane to play one day when Sigel was a young player. Crane assented and after Sigel broke, Crane ran 200 balls and then played a safety.\n\n\nLater life\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Crane's wife of 64 years, Althea, stated, \"A lot of people, if it was a hot day and there was no air conditioning, they'd take off their coat to play. But not Irving Crane.\" Rudolph Wanderone, a/k/a Minnesota Fats, once opined, \"Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva,\" while professional rival Willie Mosconi who had criticized Crane for his cautious style, stated in his 1993 autobiography, Willie's Game, that \"Crane wouldn't take a shot unless his grandmother could make it.\"\nCrane was inducted into the Billiard Congress of America's hall of fame in 1978. In 1999, Crane was ranked as number eight on Billiard Digest's fifty greatest players of the century. In his entry there, he is lauded as having been, along with Mosconi, the \"best in the world, flat out\" between 1941 and 1956.\nIn 1980, Crane retired from professional play. He stopped playing entirely in about 1996. On November 17, 2001, at age 88, four days after entering a nursing home, Crane died of natural causes. He was survived by his wife Althea, son Irving, daughter Sandra, three grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.\n\n\nCareer Titles\n\n\nSee also\n Biography portal\n Cue sports portal\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=4129238",
    "text": "No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF was a Czechoslovak-manned bomber squadron of the Royal Air Force in the Second World War. It was the RAF's only Czechoslovak-manned medium and heavy bomber squadron. It suffered the worst losses of any Czechoslovak formation in the RAF. In the Second World War 511 Czechoslovaks serving in Allied air forces were killed. Of these 273 (53 per cent) died while serving with 311 Squadron.\nAfter the end of the war, 311 Squadron was disbanded as an RAF unit and became the 6 letecká divize (\"6th Air Division\") of the reformed Czechoslovak Air Force.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nBomber Command\n\nThe squadron was formed at RAF Honington in Suffolk on 29 July 1940, RAF records give the official date as 2 August. It was crewed mostly by Czechoslovaks who had escaped from German-occupied Europe. Some were airmen who had trained with the Czechoslovak Air Force, escaped to France, served in the French Air Force in the Battle of France and then been evacuated to Britain. Others were soldiers who had served in Czechoslovak Army units in the Battle of France, been evacuated and then volunteered to transfer to the RAF Volunteer Reserve to serve in 311 Squadron.\nThe squadron was equipped initially with Vickers Wellington Mark I medium bombers, which were soon succeeded by the improved Wellington Marks IA and IC. From 16 September 1940 the squadron was based at RAF East Wretham in Norfolk as part of 3 Group of Bomber Command. The group's commanding officer was Air Vice-Marshal John Baldwin who said that 311 Squadron \"put up a wonderful show\" and had \"the finest navigators in Bomber Command\". On 18 January 1941 HM King George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth visited the squadron at East Wretham.\n\nOn 6 February 1941 six of the squadron's Wellington Mk IC aircraft took part in a raid on Boulogne-sur-Mer in German-occupied France. On the return flight one aircraft, serial L7842, code KX-T, suffered navigation problems. Then it ran low on fuel, its commander Pilot Officer František Cigoš mistakenly judged that they were over England and he landed at Flers in northern France. Both the aircraft and its crew were captured. The Luftwaffe repainted it in German markings and transferred it to its Erprobungsstelle (experimental and test facility) at Rechlin–Lärz Airfield in Mecklenburg.\n\nOn 20 June 1941 the squadron gave a dinner for the President of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, Edvard Beneš. Other guests included Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk and Defence Minister, General Antonín Hasal-Nižborský. The squadron was with Bomber Command for 19 months. In that time it flew 1,029 sorties, attacked 77 targets, dropped 2,492,600 lb (1,130,600 kg) of explosive bombs and 95,438 incendiary bombs. It attacked targets in Germany, Italy, and occupied Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Its most frequent targets were Cologne, Hamburg and Kiel in Germany and Dunkirk, Brest and Boulogne in France. The squadron deployed 318 airmen formed into 53 aircrew. 94 were killed on operations and 34 were captured, a loss rate of more than 40 per cent. Unlike crews drawn from Britain or the Commonwealth nations, there were no Czechoslovak replacement crews arriving to fill the ranks of the lost. To keep the squadron functional, it would have to be put to a different use.\n\n\nCoastal Command\nAt the end of April 1942 the squadron was transferred from Bomber Command to Coastal Command  to undertake maritime patrols. It moved to RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland on 28 April and began maritime patrol training on 1 May. The squadron was made part of No. 19 Group RAF, moved to RAF Talbenny in Wales on 12 June and undertook its first anti-submarine patrol on 30 June. Its Wellingtons lacked air to surface vessel (ASV) radar but despite this between June 1942 and April 1943 the squadron achieved the highest success rate of any Coastal Command squadron.\nThroughout July and August the squadron's Wellingtons remained in night bomber Temperate Land Scheme camouflage, dark green and dark earth above and black below. This was unsuitable for maritime patrols, but not until September 1942 were the aircraft repainted in Coastal Command's Temperate Sea Scheme, dark slate grey and extra dark sea grey above, and white below.\nIn April 1943 the squadron was partly re-equipped with five Wellington Mark X aircraft. This could carry two torpedoes or 3,999 lb (1,814 kg) of bombs but it was primarily a Bomber Command variant, not designed for maritime patrol work. Air Vice-Marshal Karel Janoušek, Inspector-General of the Czechoslovak Air Force, eventually convinced the British Air Ministry to re-equip the squadron with B-24 Liberator 4-engined heavy bombers, as these had radar and a longer range, both of which made them more suitable for maritime patrols. Conversion training began on 25 May and continued until August. On 26 May 1943 the squadron moved to RAF Beaulieu in Hampshire. On 4 August it celebrated its third anniversary. Guests again included President Beneš and Foreign Minister Masaryk. They included also General Sergej Ingr, who had succeeded General Hasal-Nižborský as Defence Minister, and the head of Coastal Command, Air Marshal John Slessor.\n\nOn 21 August 1943 the squadron began maritime patrols with Liberator GR Mk V aircraft and continued anti-submarine work but now over the Bay of Biscay. On 10 November Liberator BZ774/D, led by Flight Sergeant Otto Žanta, attacked U-966 with RP-3 rocket projectiles off the Galician coast. The submarine ran aground and her crew abandoned her. On 27 December 1943 Liberator BZ796/H, led by Pilot Officer Oldřich Doležal, attacked the German blockade runner Alsterufer in the Bay of Biscay. Doležal's crew set the cargo ship on fire with five RPs and a 500 lb (230 kg) bomb and she sank the next day.\n\nIn February 1944 the squadron was re-equipped with nine Liberator C Mk VI aircraft. On 23 February it moved to RAF Predannack in Cornwall. On 24 June Liberator FL961/O led by Flying Officer Jan Vella, along with the Tribal-class destroyers HMS Eskimo and HMCS Haida, attacked and sank U-971 just west of the English Channel.\n\nOn 7 August 1944 the squadron transferred to RAF Tain in Scotland and its area of operations changed from the Bay of Biscay and Western Approaches to the North Sea. In September its rôle was changed from day to night anti-submarine patrols. On 27 October Fleet Air Arm aircraft from HMS Implacable damaged U-1060, forcing her to run aground on the coast of German-occupied Norway. Two days later two 311 Squadron Liberators, FL949/KX-Y led by Flying Officer Josef Pavelka and BZ723/KX-H led by Squadron leader Alois Šedivý, damaged the grounded submarine with salvos of RPs. Later two Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of 502 Squadron finished off U-1060 with depth charges. In February 1945 the squadron was re-equipped, this time with Liberator C Mk VI aircraft that carried anti-submarine Leigh Lights. In March the squadron took part in the \"Chilli-II\" and \"Chilli-III\" raids on German submarine training areas in the Baltic.\nNumber 311 Squadron was with Coastal Command for 38 months, in which time it flew 2,111 sorties. By the end of the war 247 of its men had been killed, either in combat or in accidents. Thirty-three of its members were released from German prisoner-of-war camps. One prisoner, Pilot Officer Arnošt Valenta, was murdered by the Gestapo in March 1944 for taking part in the Great Escape from Stalag Luft III.\n\n\nPeacetime transport\nAfter the End of World War II in Europe, on 26 May 1945 the Czechoslovak government-in-exile formed the Letecká dopravní skupina (\"Air Transport Group\"), and recruited most of its personnel from 311 Squadron. Its initial aircraft were two Avro Anson C XII aircraft bought from the RAF. On 12 June 1945 the unit began flights to Ruzyně Airport, Prague. By October the Letecká dopravní skupina had also acquired a number of Siebel Si 204D aircraft seized from Germany as war reparations.\nOn 25 June 1945 the remainder of 311 Squadron was transferred to 301 Wing, RAF Transport Command. It too flew transport flights to Ruzyně Airport, the first being on 30 July from RAF Manston in Kent, where the squadron was based from 3 August. On 21 August the squadron moved to Ruzynĕ. The squadron first transferred military equipment and personnel from Britain to Czechoslovakia and then repatriated Czechoslovak civilians. Czechoslovak runways were found to be unsuitable for Liberators and in December 1945 all those of 311 squadron were returned to Britain landing at RAF Valley in Wales. The squadron was officially disbanded as an RAF unit at RAF Milltown in Moray, Scotland on 15 February 1946. Most of its personnel had transferred to the Czechoslovak Air Force in August 1945 and in Czechoslovakia the unit was officially disbanded on 15 January 1946 but its personnel were not officially discharged from the RAF until 30 June 1946.\nOn 15 January 1946 311 Squadron became the Czechoslovak 6 letecká divize (\"6th Air Division\") at Havlíčkův Brod in southeastern Bohemia. In May it was divided into Letecký pluk 24 and Letecký pluk 25 (\"24th and 25th Air Regiments\"). Letecký pluk 24 was given the name Biskajsky (\"Biscay\") and initially equipped with de Havilland Mosquito FB Mk VI fighter-bombers. Letecký pluk 25 was given the name Atlantický (\"Atlantic\") and equipped with Petlyakov Pe-2FT aircraft.\n\n\nSquadron codes\nThis squadron displayed the squadron code letters \"KX\" and later \"PP\" on its Wellingtons and \"PP\" on its Liberators.\n\n\nCommanding officers\n\n\nSquadron bases\n\n\nAircraft operated\n\n\nNotable incidents\n\n\n1942 Wellington crash\n\nOn 18 October 1942 Wellington 1C aircraft of 311 Squadron crashed and burst into flames at South Ruislip, Middlesex, on approach to RAF Northolt. The aircraft was en route to a debriefing and was carrying nine passengers as well as its usual crew of six. Everyone aboard was killed, along with four children and two mothers on the ground.\n\n\n1945 Liberator crash\n\nOn 8 October 1945 a Liberator GR.VI aircraft of 311 Squadron suffered an engine fire, crashed and burst into flames in a field at Elvetham, near Hartley Wintney, Hampshire. Five minutes earlier it had taken off from RAF Blackbushe on a flight to Ruzyně Airport, Prague. All 23 people aboard were killed: five crew, 17 passengers and one stowaway. The passengers included nine women and five young children, the latter ranging from 18 months to three years old.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1964, 311 Squadron veteran Richard Husmann, writing as Filip Jánský, published his novel Nebeští jezdci, portraying the lives of Czech and Polish airmen in the wartime RAF. In 1968 a film based on the book was released, having been made the previous year around Klecany military airfield north of Prague. In 1969 Hodder & Stoughton published an English translation of the book as Riders in the Sky.\nIn 1999 the Air Café commemorating No. 311 Squadron RAF opened in Brno, South Moravia. It is in the early 17th-century Dietrichstein Palace, which also houses the Moravian Museum. The café exhibits a small collection of memorabilia connected with the Czechoslovak-manned squadron.\nIn February 2016 the 438th Air Expeditionary Advisory Squadron, 438th Air Expeditionary Advisory Group, USAF, Kabul, Afghanistan, was renamed 311th Air Expeditionary Advisory Squadron, to follow in the traditions of the squadron, under Czech Air Force command. This 311 Squadron was disbanded in February 2019.\n\n\nSee also\nCharles Pickard\nJindřich Svoboda\nArnošt Valenta\nTomáš Lom\nList of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF\".

    "text": "\"La Mer\" (\"The Sea\") is a song by the French composer, lyricist, singer, and showman Charles Trenet. The song was first recorded by the French singer Roland Gerbeau in 1945. When Trenet's version was released in 1946, it became an unexpected hit and has remained a chanson classic and jazz standard ever since.\n\n\nBackground and history\nTrenet said that he had written an initial version of the song's lyrics as a poem at the age of 16, many years before he came up with a tune for it. The tune came to him during a train ride in 1943 between Montpellier and Perpignan as he was gazing out of the window at the Étang de Thau, a lagoon in the south of France. He jotted it down on a piece of paper and in the afternoon he worked out the details with his pianist Léo Chauliac. That evening they performed it in front of an audience without much of an impact.\nThe song was not recorded before the end of World War II. It was first offered to Suzy Solidor who declined it, then to Roland Gerbeau who recorded it with Jo Bouillon's orchestra at the end of 1945. The orchestration and chorus were provided by Albert Lasry. Trenet himself recorded his song for the first time in 1946.\nOver the years the song became popular throughout the world and developed into a chanson classic and jazz standard with a large number of prominent artists recording their own versions. Besides the original in French, the song was also recorded in several other languages, with the English version \"Beyond the Sea\" being particularly popular and becoming the signature song for the American singer Bobby Darin. In 1966 there were already over 100 different recordings of \"La Mer\", and it was considered to be France's best-selling song, together with Édith Piaf's \"La Vie en rose\". By the time of Trenet's death in 2001, there were more than 4,000 different recordings of it, with over 70 million copies sold in total.\nDespite various translations into other languages, the original French version was popular outside France and with non-French musicians as well. Trenet published his recording in the U.S. in 1947, and Bing Crosby recorded \"La Mer\" on his 1953 album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris.\nMatthew Bourne's 1989 ballet suite Infernal Galop, \"a French dance with English subtitles\", is choreographed to Charles Trenet's recording of \"La Mer\", in which a merman seduces three matelots.\nThe song was also recorded by Cliff Richard. In 1976 Julio Iglesias included the song on his live album En el Olympia. The song was included on Dalida's 1999 posthumous album Besame Mucho. Demis Roussos included the song on his 1995 studio album Immortel.\nMore recent versions include those of Kristina & Laura, Miguel Bosé, Manlio Sgalambro, Lisa del Bo, Biréli Lagrène, Patricia Kaas, Lola Dutronic, Mireille Mathieu, Chantal Chamberland, and others. The Avalon Jazz Band, with lead singer Tatiana Eva-Marie, included a contemporary arrangement of \"La Mer\" on their 2021 album April in Paris.\nInstrumental versions were done by Benny Goodman, Ray Conniff His Orchestra and Chorus, Le Grand Orchestre de Paul Mauriat, Richard Clayderman, and Django Reinhardt.\n\n\nOther languages\n\n\n\"Beyond the Sea\"\n\nThe English-language version of \"La mer\" was first recorded by Harry James and His Orchestra in 1947. Its lyrics, telling the story of two lovers separated by the sea, were written by Jack Lawrence. It has since been recorded by many artists, including Bobby Darin,  Stevie Wonder, Mantovani, Roger Williams, and Gisele MacKenzie.\n\n\n\"De zee\"\nIn 1970, Belgian singer Lize Marke released a version of the song with added lyrics by Johnny Steggerda and Jack Bess.\n\n\n\"Das Meer\"\nThe first German version was written in 1948 by Hans Fritz Beckmann and Lale Andersen. The latter recorded it with Michael Jary and his orchestra in the same year. However, Beckmann was unhappy with the first attempt and rewrote it. The new version was first recorded by the German actress and singer Liselotte Malkowsky in 1949 and became rather popular in German-speaking countries. Later recordings\ncomprise the Austrian Schlager singer Lolita, the Austrian soprano Eva Lind, the Italian-German singer and entertainer Caterina Valente, and the German entertainer and band leader Götz Alsmann.\n\n\n\"Волна\" (\"Volna\")\nA Russian version named \"Волна\" (\"Wave\") was adapted by two Soviet Russian poets and translators, Samuil Bolotin and Tatiana Sikorskaya, in the 1950s for Leonid Utesov, a popular Soviet singer. It was included on the album called Ах, Одесса моя (\"Oh, my Odessa\").\n\n\n\"La Mer\" (Caetano Veloso)\nBrazilian musician Caetano Veloso released a 2024 version of the French song, singing it in French. He says he recorded the song at the request of writer Christine Angot, who was in the audience at a Paris performance where Caetano sang \"La Mer\" as a posthumous tribute to his manager Guilherme Araújo, who had always asked him to record the French song.\n\n\nUsage in popular culture\nThe French original is featured prominently in a variety of films, including L.A. Story, in which it is played during the opening montage; French Kiss (1995), in which it is sung by lead actor Kevin Kline; and Mr. Bean's Holiday, which uses a recording of Trenet himself in its final scene. It also is played in the last episode of the American television show White Collar. The song is sung in the French documentary film Blood of the Beasts (1949), and is performed in the film A Life Less Ordinary (1997) by Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz. The Trenet recording is heard over the end credits of an episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Squirt and the Whale\".\nOn British television, the original version of the song was used as the title music for ITV's coverage of UEFA Euro 2016.\nThe Robbie Williams version plays over the closing credits of Finding Nemo and is included on the soundtrack.  \n\"La Mer\" has been used in films such as Bernardo Bertolucci's 2003 The Dreamers, the 2010 German film Animals United, and Natalie Portman's 2015 A Tale of Love and Darkness. A Julio Iglesias version plays in the final scene of the 2011 spy film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\nDjango Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli's recording of \"La Mer\" features in the video games BioShock (2007) and BioShock Infinite (2013). Director Ken Levine wanted Charles Trenet's original rendition but could not secure the rights.\n\"La Mer\" also features in Irish Ferries' TV and radio advert in Ireland as part of their \"Sail In Style\" advertising campaign for their Dublin–France route.\n\"La Mer\" was used in Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones' sci-fi anthology series Black Mirror. It is featured in the third episode of Season 6, \"Beyond The Sea\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nSecond Hand Songs: La Mer page\nDiscogs: La Mer page\nWill Friedwald: Ocean Crossing Archived 2018-01-08 at the Wayback Machine at bobbydarin.com\nLyricstranslate Original lyrics plus crowdsourced translations (not singable) into many languages.

    "text": "Buddhavanam is a tourism project in Nagarjuna Sagar, Telangana created by the  Telangana Tourism Development Corporation. The project was sanctioned by the Government of India viz., Integrated Development of Nagarjunasagar as part of Lower Krishna valley Buddhist circuit with a view to attract large number of domestic and foreign tourists particularly from the South-East Asian countries.\n\n\nAbout\n\nThe areas around the Nagarjuna Sagar a reservoir formed due to the construction of the dam across the river Krishna was known as Nagarjuna Konda or Sriparvata - Vijayapuri, once served as capital city of the Ikshvaku dynasty, which ruled Andhradesa during the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D. Nagarjuna Konda was named after the famous Buddhist scholar and Madhyamika philosopher Acharaya Nagarjuna. Nagarjunakonda was a centre of Mahayana Buddhism, where many of the Buddhist sects had their monasteries, shrines and Stupas built to propagate the Dhamma.\nExcavation conducted at Nagarjunakonda between 1954 and 1960 have revealed the existence of a Maha Stupa, Votive Stupas, Chaityas, Silamandapas and a good number of Buddhist sculptural panels and antiquities. The structures exposed also included a palace complex and a few Brahmanical temples built of bricks. The sculptural panels were depicted with the major events of the life of the Buddha and Jataka stories. As these vestiges were threatened for the submergence in the Nagarjunasagar reservoir, most of the structures were reconstructed on the Nagarjunakonda Island and at Anupu, a ferry point on the right bank of the river Krishna. The antiques including the holy relics of the Buddha recovered are displayed in the island museum for the benefit of the visitors.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nThe Telangana Tourism Development Corporation has acquired an extent of 279 acres of land on the northern bank of the river Krishna at Nagarjuna Sagar for Sriparvatarama (Buddhavanam) a Buddhist Theme Park.\n\n\nEntrance plaza\n\nThe entrance plaza of Sriparvatarama is a square having eight quadrants with four openings. All the quadrants are embellished with panels with relief sculpture depicting Asthamangala (eight auspicious) symbols, Buddha in animals, birds, bodhi tree and Mithunas (amorous couples); the central themes include Buddhapada, pillar of, carrying the crown (hair) of Siddhartha, Naga Muchlinda. Worship of holy relic and Siddhartha carrying a mighty bow.\nAt the centre of the plaza stands on octagonal basement an octagonal column carrying the Dharma Chakra whose 24 spokes depict different virtues. Dharmachakra is Ashoka's contribution to the Buddhist art. At the base of the pillar on all the four sides are half-lotus medallions are carved.\n\n\nBuddhacharita vanam (Life of the Buddha )\n\nMajor events from the life of the Buddha are displayed in Buddhacharita Vanam - the birth of the Siddhartha in Lumbini, Maha parinirvana or the Great Departure of Siddhartha, Sambodhi or Enlightenment, Dharmachakra pravartana or the turning of the wheel of the Dharma or preaching the first sermon and The Great Extinction or Mahaparinirvana. Buddhapada with asthamangala symbols carved in green limestone is also displayed at the entrance of the park. All the five major events are represented in free-standing bronzes.\nThe legend surrounding the birth of Siddhartha depicts Mayadevi under the sal tree and the just born Siddhartha taking seven steps and declaring that this is his last birth! Mahabhinishkramana (Great Departure) depicts Siddhartha leaving the palace on the back of his horse, Kantaka. The sculpture of Samyak Sambodhi depicts the enlightenment of Siddhartha and his transformation into a Buddha. The Buddha is seated in dhyana mudra under the Bodhi (Pipal) tree at Buddhadhgaya. The Sculpture Dharmachakra Parvartana depicts Buddha seated in the deer park preaching the first sermon to the Pancha Vargiya Bhikkhus, the five seekers who were earlier associated with Sidhhartha in spiritual pursuit. The Sculpture of Mahaparinirvana depicts the Great Extinction of the Buddha. Buddha is seen in a reclining posture keeping his head on the right hand. The pedestal is depicted with the scenes of Subaddha (Last Disciple), the coffin, monks and the common folk of Kusinara where the event took place.\n\n\nMaha Stupa\n\n(Recreation of Amaravati Stupa)\n\nAt the core of Sriparvata Arama project, is a stupa built according to the dimensions and architecture of the original Amararama Stupa which was the biggest stupa in Dakshinapatha or South India.\nThe stupa has a Vedika (drum), Dome and a Harmika on its top. Ayaka Platforms are built on four cardinal sides of the stupa on which stand the five Ayaka pillars corresponding to the five important events in the life of the Buddha. The ornate wall of the Mahastupa vedika is intricately carved with the scenes from Buddha's life and ministry and important kings of the period. The upper level dome portion is encased with sculptural panels depicting the Theravada Buddhist symbols like the Stupa, the throne, Bodhi tree, pillar of fire and Jataka stories ; the events from the life of the Buddha are sculpted in a chronological order. On the ground floor of the stupa are a museum of Buddhist Heritage with Buddhist antiquities and 100 year old, copies of Ajanta frescoes, an amphitheatre and interpretation centre.\nArtmorf is entrusted to sculpt the various relief panels in its original scale recreating its full glory. Sandstone reliefs will be individually crafted and veneered on the stupa exterior. On its completion the sculpture project will surpass most religious structures in the number of human figures carved in sandstone onto a single project.\n\n\nJataka park\n\nAccording to Buddhist belief, Bodhisattva goes through several lives practicing ten paramis or perfections before he is finally born as Siddhartha, attains enlightenment and becomes a Buddha. These stories about the previous births of Bodhisattva are illustrated in 547 jatakas. The Buddha himself referred to the jatakas while giving sermons at Shravasti, Vaishali, Rajagriha and other places of his ministry. The practice of ten perfections (dasaparamita) required for the Buddhahood are exalted in the jataka stories. The perfections are Generosity (Dana), Virtue (Sila), Patience (kshanti), Courage (Virya) Concentration (Dhyana), Wisdom (Prajna), Renunciation (tyaga), Truth (satya), Loving kindness (karuna) and Equanimity (samata). Also described in the well known Maha Hamsa Jataka Story is the principle of right governance or dasa rajadharma. The jataka stories exemplified by the lives of the Bodhisattva provide guidance to practicing Buddhists in everyday living.\nJataka stories have been an integral part of Buddhist Culture. It is customary for practicing Buddhists to listen to the monks narrating the Jataka stories on full-moon days. They are very popular in India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Nepal and Cambodia and other Buddhist countries.\n40 Selected Jataka stories have been carved in high relief onto warm sandstone by artmorf sculptors. The relief sculptures narrate stories of the previous births of the Buddha. In India, Jataka tales are portrayed in Gandhara, Mathura and Amaravati schools of Art. The 40 Jataka stories are selected from various Buddhist sites such as Amaravati, Sriparvata (Nagarjuni konda), Goli, Phanigiri and other sites.\nThe Jatakas illustrated in the park, include Dipankara, Kattahari, Matakabatta, Nalapana, Vanarindha, Rsya Sringa, Sasa, Ahigundika, Dighitkosala, Kalinga, Ghata Panditha, Kunala, Kakati, Mahapaduma, Maha Hamsa, Sibi, Matanga, Sankhapala, Mahasuttasoma, Vidurapanditha, Nigrodhamiga, Chaddanta, Kurma Avadana, Mandhata, Mahakapi, Champeya, Syama, Maha Ummagga, Ashwamukhi, Dasaratha, Kavikumara, Suvarna Prabhasa (Mora), Losaka, Matsya, Kurungamirga, Mahisa, Timingala, Hasti, Simhalavadana and Vessantara.\n\n\nStupa vanam (miniature Stupa park)\n\nThe segment called Stupa vanam displays miniature stupas (replicas) from the Buddhist sites of India and South-East Asian countries. The stupas evolved from the style of the old funeral mounds of India and influenced the architecture of the domes of West Asia, particularly Persia. While the Indian Stupas are budbudha or bubble-shaped, they evolved in different architectural styles in other Buddhist countries.\nAn attempt is made to present the replicas of the stupas of different parts of India - Sanchi, Sarnath, Ajanta, Karle and Manikyala and other countries. Replicas of the stupas from Top Darra (North western Frontier), Mirpur-Khas (Pakistan), Anuradhapura (Sri Lanka), Phra Pathom Chedi (Thailand), Chorten (Tibet), Boudhanath (Nepal), Shwedagon (Myanmar) and Pagoda (China) are built in their styles of architecture for the benefit of the visitors. This park is still developing and it is yet to create replicas of great monuments like the Borobodur of Indonesia, Japan etc.\n\n\nAvukana Buddha statue\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Culture and Buddha Sasana has donated a replica of the original granite Buddha statue located in Avukana village near Kekirawa in North central Sri Lanka carved in the 5th century A.D when king Dhatusena was ruling. The statue is cast in ferro-cement(?). Sri Lanka monks have built and installed the statue here at Sriparvatarama. It is a standing Buddha statue in Abhaya mudra and the closely worn robe is elaborately shown. The buddha's body is straight and the left hand holds the robe at the left shoulder. The right hand is raised above the right shoulder, with the palm facing left. Avukana Buddha Statue is perhaps the best example of a standing Buddha statues which are mostly found in South India.\n\n\nSee also\nNagarjunakonda\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nwww.buddhavanam.org\nwww.buddhavanam.co",

    "text": "The Toxteth riots of July 1981 were a civil disturbance in Toxteth, inner-city Liverpool, which arose in part from long-standing tensions between the local police and the black community. They followed the Brixton riot earlier that year and were one of the many riots which took place across Britain during the spring and summer of 1981.\n\n\nBackground\nThe Merseyside police force had, at the time, a poor reputation within the black community for stopping and searching young black men in the area, under the \"sus\" laws, and the heavy-handed arrest of Leroy Alphonse Cooper on Friday 3 July near Granby Street, watched by an angry crowd, led to a disturbance in which three policemen were injured. The existing tensions between police and people had already been noticed by local magistrate, Councillor and Chair of the Merseyside Police Committee, Margaret Simey, who was frequently critical of the hardline tactics used by the then Chief Constable Kenneth Oxford. She said of the rioters \"they would be apathetic fools ... if they didn't protest\", although she was unprepared for the personal criticism that followed.\nWith the economy in recession, unemployment in Britain was at a 50-year high in 1981, with Merseyside being one of the worst hit regions for unemployment, and Toxteth in turn being one of the worst hit districts of the city of Liverpool.\n\n\nEvents\nOver the weekend that followed, disturbance erupted into full-scale rioting, with pitched battles between police and youths in which petrol bombs and paving stones were thrown. During the violence, milk floats were set on fire and directed at police lines. Rioters were also observed using scaffolding tubes to charge police lines. The Merseyside Police had issued its officers with long protective shields but these proved inadequate in protecting officers from missile attacks and in particular the effects of petrol bombs. The overwhelming majority of officers were not trained either in using the shields or in public order tactics. The sole offensive tactic available to officers, the baton charge, proved increasingly ineffective in driving back the attacking crowds of rioters.\nAt 02:15 hours on Monday 6 July 1981 Merseyside police officers fired 25–30 CS gas grenades, the first occasion on which these had been used in the UK other than in Northern Ireland. The gas successfully dispersed the crowds. The rioting lasted nine days, during which Merseyside Police said 468 police officers were injured, 500 people were arrested, and at least 70 buildings were damaged so severely by fire that they had to be demolished. Around 100 cars were damaged or destroyed, and there was extensive looting of shops. Later estimates suggested the numbers of injured police officers and destroyed buildings were at least double those of the official figures.\nSuch was the scale of the rioting in Toxteth that police reinforcements were drafted in from forces across England, including Greater Manchester Police, Lancashire, Cumbria, Birmingham and even as far afield as Devon (well over 200 miles away) to try to control the unrest.\nA second wave of rioting began on 27 July 1981 and continued into the early hours of 28 July, with police once again being attacked with missiles and a number of cars being set alight. Twenty-six officers were injured.\nHowever, on this occasion the Merseyside Police responded by driving vans and Land Rovers at high speed into the crowds quickly dispersing them. This tactic had been developed as a riot control technique in Northern Ireland by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and had been employed with success in quelling the Moss Side riots by the Greater Manchester Police earlier that year. A 23-year-old local man, David Moore, died after being struck by a police vehicle trying to clear crowds. Two police officers were charged with his manslaughter but cleared in April 1982.\nDozens of senior citizens were evacuated from the Princes Park Hospital during the riots.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nThe subsequent Scarman Report (although primarily directed at the Brixton Riot of 1981) recognised that the riots did represent the result of social problems, such as poverty and deprivation.\nThe Government responded by sending Michael Heseltine, as \"Minister for Merseyside\", to set up the Merseyside Task Force and launch a series of initiatives, including the Liverpool international garden festival and the Mersey Basin Campaign.\n\n\nFurther reading\nFrost, Diane and Richard Phillips, eds.

The French geologist Claude Thibault, in collaboration with the Iranian geologist Ali Ariai, conducted surveys in the Kashfrud basin east of Mashhad in 1974–75, during which 80 stone artifacts were collected from seven open areas.\n\n\nCollections\nThe largest of these collections were found near the village of Abravan and other large collections in Chahak and Baghbaghu. The survey identified three major alluvial units that are roughly attributed to the Lower, Middle, and upper Pleistocene. Many of the findings are attributed to the Lower Pleistocene gravel layer that lies on a thick layer of sand. In an article, Thibaut published the results of a preliminary study of stone artifacts and their geological context in 1977.\nThe discovered collection was sent to the National Museum of Iran after the examination. The collection was transferred to the Paleolithic Department of the Museum in the early 2000s and was re-examined by Fereidoun Biglari. His re-analysis of the collection revealed that some of the specimens are naturally broken quartz fragments. But most specimens are man-made and include core-chopper, simple flakes, and tools such as scrapers, notches, and borers.\nOn the basis of their geological contexts, this collection is more than 800,000 years old.

See.\nThere are some collections of simple core and flake stone artifacts collected by C. Thibault in 1974–75. The tools are Olduwan-like and mainly made of quartz.

Although many scholars in Georgia still propose an 11th-century dating for the first redaction of the corpus, the increasing number of modern experts has accepted Professor Cyril Toumanoff's hypothesis that the earliest texts of Kartlis Tskhovreba were composed c. 800. The latest texts were added in the 14th century. A \"canonized\" version was edited by a special commission appointed and chaired by King Vakhtang VI of Kartli early in the 18th century.\nDuring the 11th century, the first three works – the \"History of the Kings and Patriarchs of the Georgians\", the \"History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali\", and the \"Martyrdom of Saint Archil\" – already made up a first corpus which covered the Georgian history from the earliest times through the reign of Vakhtang I Gorgasali (r. 452–502/22) down to the death of Vakhtang's descendant Archil (786). In the middle of the 12th century, two texts were added: the \"Chronicle of Kartli\" – which records the Georgian history from the late 8th century through the reign of the first all-Georgian king Bagrat III (r. 1008-1014) to the early regnal years of George II (r. 1072-1089) – and the \"History of the King of Kings David\" – which continues the story and focuses on the reign of David IV (r. 1089-1125).\n\n\nManuscripts\nThe extant Georgian manuscripts of Kartlis Tskhovreba are relatively late, with the earliest, the so-called Anaseuli or \"Queen Anna\" codex, dating from the period of 1479-1495. Another major variant, Mariamiseuli or \"Queen Mariam\" codex, was copied in the years 1633-1645/1646. However, the surviving Georgian manuscripts are predated by the Chronicles' abridged Armenian adaptation known as \"The History of Georgians\" (Patmut'iwn Vrats'), most probably made in the 12th century, with its earliest extant manuscript being copied in the period of 1279-1311.\nA number of translations are available in French, Russian, English and German, but each one covers only a selected number of these texts.\n\n\nAuthenticity\nSome modern scholars, such as Ivane Javakhishvili, have questioned the authenticity of the early components of \"The Georgian Chronicles\" and have called for extreme caution when working with them. Indeed, strict historical facts are frequently intermingled with mythical ones, making it sometimes difficult to discern true historiography and mythology. However, critical analyses against other sources, including the Classical authors, and a series of recent archaeological studies have proved the trustworthiness of many of the Chronicles' accounts. These texts relate evidence not only for the history of Georgia, but also Armenia and the Caucasus in general, Iran, Syria, Anatolia, the Roman Empire, the Khazars, and the Turks.\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nSee also\nConversion of Kartli (chronicle)\nDivan of the Abkhazian Kings\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nBibliography of The Georgian Chronicles″.\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Corpus of Georgian Chronicle (in Georgian)\nThe Georgian Chronicle (in Georgian)\nThe Georgian Chronicle (in English)\nThe Georgian Chronicle (in English - mirror if main site unavailable)\nKartlis Cxovreba / Historia Iberorum / The Georgian Chronicle (in Georgian)\nKartlis Cxovreba (in English)\nThe Georgian Chronicle (in Georgian)",

    "text": "Johan Bruyneel (born 23 August 1964) is a  Belgian former professional road bicycle racer and a former directeur sportif for UCI ProTour team RadioShack–Nissan, and U.S. Postal Service (later known as Discovery Channel), a US-based UCI ProTour cycling team. On 25 October 2018, the World Anti Doping Agency imposed a lifetime ban on Bruyneel for his role in a doping scandal that also saw Lance Armstrong stripped of his seven Tour de France titles.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nProfessional cyclist\nBorn in Izegem, Belgium, Bruyneel was a successful professional cyclist.  Early wins included the 1990 Tour de l'Avenir, the 1991 Rund um den Henninger Turm, the 1992 Grand Prix des Nations and Coppa Placci, and stage 6 (Évreux > Amiens) and finishing 7th at the 1993 Tour de France. His stage win set the record for fastest stage at 49.417 km/h, since then only broken by two cyclists.\nHis greatest successes as a pro cyclist came in 1995.  At the 1995 Tour de France, he won stage 7, which began in Charleroi and ended in Liège, Belgium, and took the yellow jersey in his home country.  Bruyneel launched an escape and was joined by eventual winner Miguel Indurain.  The Spaniard took the lead and rode the stage as a time-trial to gain time on his main rivals, with Bruyneel latched onto his wheel, barely able to follow the tempo.  He then beat Indurain in the end sprint to win the stage.  Bruyneel admitted he felt somewhat uneasy about how he had won.  However, the win into Liège afforded him a chance meeting with the King of Belgium during the prize presentations.  That same year, Bruyneel achieved his only podium finish in a Grand Tour when he finished 3rd at the 1995 Vuelta a España and won the Aalst criterium.\nIn the 1996 Tour de France, he missed a curve when descending a hill in stage 7 (Chambéry > Les Arcs), and disappeared into a ravine. The moment was captured by a camera team that was driving right behind the group of descenders. After some time, Bruyneel could be seen climbing out of the ravine and getting back onto his bike to continue the stage, apparently unscathed.\n\n\nTeam director\n\nFollowing his retirement from cycling in 1998 at age 34, Bruyneel accepted the position of managing director of the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, whose star, Lance Armstrong, had finished fourth in the 1998 Vuelta a España, but whose team, in Armstrong's words, was the Bad News Bears, a mismatch of bikes, cars, clothing, equipment,\" with a total budget of only $3 million. Bruyneel's team promptly won eight of the next nine editions of the Tour de France, with Armstrong winning seven straight prior to his retirement in 2005 and then Alberto Contador winning in 2007 with Levi Leipheimer finishing third. However, Discovery Channel, which had taken over as the sponsor of the team in 2005, decided to withdraw in 2007 in the wake of the sport's extensive doping scandals, and the team disbanded. At that point, Bruyneel's teams had won ten Grand Tour championships in nine years (8 Tours de France, 1 Giro d'Italia (Savoldelli, 2005) and 1 Vuelta a España (Heras, 2003). Seven of these victories have since been nullified with the disqualification of Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2005 from the Tour de France by USADA with ratification from the UCI.\nAt the time, Bruyneel announced his retirement and his plans to write a book. Bruyneel's book, We Might As Well Win, was published by Houghton Mifflin on 4 June 2008. Also, on 29 May 2008, Bruyneel joined the Board of Directors of World Bicycle Relief. But his retirement did not materialize.\nIn October 2007, after negotiations with the Kazakh government, Bruyneel was signed to take over control of the embattled Astana team, which had been kicked out of the 2007 Tour de France for doping violations and was in shambles over its doping connections. He brought Discovery's Contador and Leipheimer with him for the 2008 season.  Although the team was banned from the Tour de France for its past doping history, Contador won both the 2008 Giro d'Italia and the 2008 Vuelta a España, making Contador the youngest rider to win all three Grand Tour championships.  Additionally, Leipheimer finished second at the Vuelta.\nContador's victory in the Tour de France meant that Bruyneel had won four of the last six Grand Tours that his teams entered, and thirteen Grand Tour championships in eleven years (seven of these victories have since been nullified with the disqualification of Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2005 from the Tour de France by USADA with ratification from the UCI). In 2010, Team RadioShack was formed with sponsorship from Radio Shack and Trek Bicycle Corporation. Bruyneel confirmed his departure from Astana at the end of the 2009 season to join Team RadioShack.\n\n\nConviction for doping\nAs of May 2010, he was under investigation by the Belgian cycling federation, after being accused by Floyd Landis of involvement in systematic doping while director sportif of Lance Armstrong's US Postal team.\nOn 28 June 2012, Bruyneel was accused by USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency), although he is not an American citizen. Allegations include the assumption that Bruyneel was part of a long-running doping conspiracy, including the use of banned methods to augment the performance of the cycling teams that he directed. As a result of the allegations, Bruyneel declined to appear at the 2012 Tour de France, where he had been expected to direct the RadioShack-Nissan team.\nWhile some accused in this case, such as Lance Armstrong and Michele Ferrari, did not seek to formally contest the charges via arbitration, Bruyneel asked for an arbitration hearing.\nIn October 2012, while still waiting for his hearing, Bruyneel left his position as managing director of RadioShack–Nissan, shortly after documents from the USADA case were released to the public. The termination was by mutual agreement with owners of Leopard SA. The day after Armstrong's acknowledgment that he doped during all of his Tours, Bruyneel announced that he would be in Brussels as soon as possible to speak to the Belgian national cycling organization and cooperate with its investigation.\nIn November 2013, Armstrong settled a lawsuit with Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC).  AIC had sought to recover $3 million it had paid Armstrong as bonuses for winning the Tour de France from 1999 to 2001.  The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum the day before Armstrong was scheduled to give an oral deposition under oath.  In a written deposition for the lawsuit, Armstrong stated under oath that, \"Johan Bruyneel participated in or assisted with Armstrong's use of PEDs, and knew of that use through their conversations and acts.\"\nIn April 2014, Bruyneel was given a ten-year ban by USADA, who noted that \"the evidence establishes conclusively that Mr. Bruyneel was at the apex of a conspiracy to commit widespread doping on the USPS and Discovery Channel teams spanning many years and many riders.\" Said Bruyneel about the ban, \"I do not dispute that there are certain elements of my career that I wish had been different.  However, a very small minority of us has been used as scapegoats for an entire generation.\"\nIn October 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency successfully increased his ten-year ban to a lifetime ban.\n\n\nMajor results\nSources:\n\n\nAs rider\n\n\nGrand Tour general classification results timeline\n\n\nAs director\nGiro d'Italia (2): Winner of the general classification with Paolo Savoldelli in 2005, and with Alberto Contador in 2008.\nTours de France (2): Winner of the general classification with Alberto Contador in 2007 and 2009.\nLance Armstrong was disqualified from seven Tour de France victories directed by Bruyneel.\nVuelta a España (2): Winner of the general classification with Roberto Heras in 2003 and with Alberto Contador in 2008.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJohan Bruyneel is married to his wife, Eva Maria Bruyneel.

The parish church is located at 39th Avenue and Maryland between the historic Maryvale and Alhambra districts.\n\n\nHistory\nSt. Mary's church was founded by Episcopalians seeking to establish an Anglo-Catholic community in the Diocese of Arizona. The first Mass was celebrated on the Feast of Christ the King, October 28, 1956, in a Phoenix storefront. Several supply priests served the growing mission parish until the first vicar, the Reverend Rodney Cobb, arrived in December 1957. By 1958, the church had reached 150 parishioners and had purchased farmland property to provide ecclesiastical, office, and school facilities.\nIn 1959, the Reverend Lewis H. Long arrived from Abilene, Kansas. Under his leadership, the mission entered a period of growth and became a full parish in 1961. A five-acre site was purchased at 39th Avenue and Maryland. In June 1964, ground was broken for the new St. Mary's church building. The first Mass was said in December 1964, with a dedication in Spring 1965.\nThe Close and Memorial Garden were created in 1980. St. Mary's Manor, an adjacent retirement facility, opened in April 1993 and accommodates forty people in individual apartments.\nAfter Fr. Long's retirement in 1993, the Reverend Derrick Wedderburn was served as Interim Rector until January 1995, when the Reverend Robert Nagy was named Vicar. The Reverend William C. Rhodes became the second rector of St. Mary's in July 1999, renovating the building and retiring in 2003. The Reverend Paulette Schiff served as interim rector, until Fr. Rhodes returned as parish priest in 2005. In 2010, the Reverend R. Craig Bustrin became the current vicar of St. Mary's.\nOn August 2, 2014, an accidental structural fire in the Hispanic Ministries office destroyed or damaged many parts of the building and forced the congregation outside. Sunday Mass was said outdoors until the congregation re-entered the building 42 weeks later on June 21, 2015. \n\n\nMusic and arts\n\nThe parish organ is a Thomas W. Whalley Organ, built in Berkeley, California, in 1907. The organ features three divisions, 12 ranks, and 689 pipes. St. Mary's is known for its Anglo-Catholic liturgy, with a Solemn sung Mass celebrated every Sunday. The altar crucifix was hand-carved in Oberammergau, Germany, and the church bell is from El Buen Samaritano, after that mission closed its doors in 1960.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMary's parish website",

The town lies on the Arctic Circle, with the town centre being about 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) south and suburbs stretching to the north of the circle. The population is 47,910 (2021 census).\n\n\nHistory\nThe settlement of Obdorsk (Обдорск) was founded in 1595, in the place of a Khanty settlement called Polnovat-Vozh (Полноват-вож), by Russian settlers after the conquest of Siberia. It was situated on the Ob River, and its name supposedly derives from that. The land around Obdorsk was referred to as Obdorsky krai, or Obdoriya.\nThe town was often used as a place of exile during the Tsarist and Soviet periods. Among notable people who spent time here were the Doukhobor spiritual leader Pyotr Verigin and Leon Trotsky. At the port of Salekhard, approximately 1,500 prisoners were used as slave labor, loading and unloading goods at the dock, or mining metal ore. About 5,000 prisoners in two camps near Salekhard were forced to polish diamonds mined from Mir mine.\nThe nearest railway station is at Labytnangi on the opposite side of the river Ob. From 1949 to 1953, the Salekhard-Igarka Railway project made an unsuccessful attempt to extend the line to Igarka, claiming the lives of thousands of Gulag prisoners. The section of railway from Salekhard to Nadym was completed and remained in use for some time in the Soviet era, although it was later abandoned. It is currently being rebuilt, along with a long-awaited bridge across the Ob between Labytnangi and Salekhard.\nSalekhard was the host city for the 2006 Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in October 2006.\nIn April 2014, Rostelecom, a Russian Internet service provider, completed the final stretch of the Nadym-Salekhard optical Internet line, which stretches for almost 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi).\nIn the Summer of 2016, temperatures as high as 95 °F (35 °C) thawed anthrax-infected corpses that had been frozen since the soviet era near Salekhard, causing anthrax spores to infect reindeer herds and herders.\n\n\nAdministrative and municipal status\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one rural locality, incorporated as the town of okrug significance of Salekhard—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of okrug significance of Salekhard is incorporated as Salekhard Urban Okrug.\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2021, the ethnic composition of Salekhard was:\n\nRussians – 66.3%\nTatars – 7.1%\nKhanty – 3.8%\nUkrainians – 3.7%\nNenets – 3.7%\nKomi – 2.0%\nKyrgyz – 1.4%\nOthers – 12%\n\n\nEconomy\n\nYamal Airlines has its head office in Salekhard. Most of residents are employed in reindeer herding, fishing and the services sector.\nBy 2015, about 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) from the airport, near the Arctic Circle, authorities plan to build a large polar resort \"Center of the Arctic tourism\".\n\n\nTransportation\nSalekhard is located in the Ob river valley and is an important river port of the Russian Far North. The unfinished Salekhard–Igarka Railway was set to provide a rail connection between the Ob river port of Salekhard and the Yenisei river port of Igarka. Currently, the nearest railway is at Labytnangi, 20 kilometres (12 mi) northwest on the opposite side of the river Ob. The project Northern Latitudinal Railway will provide Salekhard access to Russian railway and will further connect Salekhard to the Konosha–Vorkuta railway and other parts of European Russia. The Salekhard Bridge project, a combined railway-road bridge over Ob river, is the main component of Northern Latitudinal Railway that will connect Labytnangi and Salekhard is to be constructed with the cost of 60 billion rubles. Nadym–Salekhard road, a 344 km long road, was inaugurated in December 2020 to the 90th anniversary of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, it will facilitate the construction of a railway between the two cities and connects the eastern and western parts of Yamal Okrug. For 9–10 months each year, the Ob river is frozen and cars and trucks can drive across the river ice. In the summer a ferry operates, however during the floating of ice, generally shortly before the start and shortly after the end of summer, Salekhard is effectively isolated from the outside world, regarding freight. During these periods, only helicopters are able to reach Salekhard in case of emergency. Native people, mainly the Nenets and Khanty people, always build up stocks of food at home, in the shops, and in the markets during this period, but they still suffer from seasonal inflation. The city is also served by the Salekhard Airport, which is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) north of the main city.\n\n\nClimate\nSalekhard has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc) with short, mild summers and severely cold winters. Precipitation is moderate, and is significantly greater in summer than in winter.  The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 7 June to 6 July (30 days).\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nInternational relations\n\n\nTwin Town & Sister City\nSalekhard is twinned with:\n\nAzov, Rostov Oblast, Russia\n\n\nNotable people\nIon-Georgy Kostev (born 1990), professional ice hockey player\n\n\nSee also\n Siberia portal\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\nГосударственная Дума Ямало-Ненецкого автономного округа.
