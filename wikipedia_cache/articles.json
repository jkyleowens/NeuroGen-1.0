It is a Hi-NRG synthpop track and its lyrics reference the aerobics craze of the early 1980s, hence the caption \"It's aerobic time\" on the 12\" single cover. It was Amanda's last single recorded in Munich and released by German division of Ariola Records. The B-side of the single was \"Darkness and Light\", stylistically similar to \"Love Your Body,” written by Lüdemann and Lear.\n\"Love Your Body\"/\"Darkness and Light\" was released as a standalone single between Lear's fifth and sixth studio album. Despite considerable promotion on TV, it met with minor success and only charted in Belgium. Both songs had not appeared on an album until 2006, when the 3 CD box set The Sphinx – Das Beste aus den Jahren 1976–1983 was released in Germany.\nIn the 2017 book Europe's Stars of '80s Dance Pop, the song is mentioned as one of Lear's \"noteworthy tracks\" from the 80s.\n\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for the song was filmed in the chroma key technique.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  The building now houses a substance abuse clinic.\n\n\nDescription and history\nThe former Welch Training School building is located west of downtown New Haven, at the northwest corner of Congress and Vernon Streets in The Hill neighborhood.  It is a 3+1⁄2-story masonry structure, built out of red brick with stone trim, and covered by a slate mansard roof.  Gabled dormers of varying styles and configurations adorn the roof faces, and a four-story gabled entry section projects at the center of the main facade.  Windows are set in rectangular openings with sandstone sills and lintels, and sandstone stringcourses give horizontal emphasis to the design.\nThe school, completed in 1883, was designed by Leoni W. Robinson and is a good local example of Queen Anne architecture.  It was named for Harmonus Welch, the city's first president of the board of education, and later also Mayor of New Haven.  The school was designed to provide a space where new teachers could be trained, in order to address a shortage of qualified teachers in the city's school system.  In its early programs, trainee teachers were paired with other teachers to learn teaching methods, before being sent for further hands-on training to other schools.  The school's function for teacher training was ended in 1893, when the Skinner School opened as a proper normal school, and this one then became a regular elementary school.  It was closed in the mid-1970s.\n\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven, Connecticut\n\n\nReferences",

He served in both houses of the Mississippi Legislature and was the Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi from 1904 to 1908.\n\n\nEarly life\nJohn Prentiss Carter was born February 7, 1840, near Augusta, Perry County, Mississippi. He was the son of Abner Carter, who had served in the Mississippi House of Representatives, and his wife, Isabella (McLeod) Carter. His maternal grandfather, John McLeod, was a member of the first Mississippi Constitutional Convention in 1817. Abner died in 1847. Carter attended the Salem high school, which was located in Greene County, Mississippi, from 1849 to 1857. In 1857, Carter enrolled in Centenary College as a sophomore, and graduated with second honors in 1860, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\n\nCivil War\nIn 1861, after the American Civil War began, Carter enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private in Company G of Mississippi's 27th Infantry. He was soon afterwards promoted to the rank of sergeant major. In 1862, he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, and became a first lieutenant in 1863. In the war, Carter fought in the battles of Stones River, Chickamauga, and Lookout Mountain. During the battle of Lookout Mountain, Carter was captured and imprisoned in Johnson's Island until the end of the war.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter the war ended, Carter returned to Mississippi, where he read law and was admitted to the bar in 1866 or 1867. He practiced law in Hattiesburg until 1896. In 1865, Carter was Perry County's delegate to the Mississippi State Constitutional Convention. Carter was also elected to represent Perry County as a Democrat in the Mississippi House of Representatives for the 1865-1867 sessions. From 1867 to 1869, Carter served as Perry County's County Attorney. In 1873, Carter was elected to represent the First District in the Mississippi State Senate for a four-year term, and served in the sessions of 1874, 1875, 1876, and 1877. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1877, and served in the 1878 and 1880 sessions. Carter refused to run for re-election in 1881. In 1887, Carter was once again elected to the State House, and served in the 1888 session. In 1890, Carter was a delegate to Mississippi's 1890 Constitutional Convention. On November 3, 1903, Carter was elected to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi, and served from January 18, 1904, to January 20, 1908.\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nCarter was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was a member of the United Confederate Veterans, the Masonic Order, the Knights Templar, the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, and the Mystical Seven. He married Margaret C. McCallum in 1868. They had six children, named John McCallum, Prentiss Abner, George Henry, Annie Isabella, Charles Galloway, and Martha Ruth.\nCarter died shortly after 6 AM on July 24, 1925, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\n\n\nReferences",

It is a shrub or tree, usually with many stems, erect, linear to thread-like phyllodes, oblong to cylindrical spike of golden-yellow flowers and firmly papery pods appearing like a string of beads.\n\n\nDescription\nAcacia burkittii is a shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 1.5–5 m (4 ft 11 in – 16 ft 5 in) and usually has many stems. The bark on the main trunks is fissured and dark brown. Its phyllodes are upright to erect, linear to thread-like, mostly 60–130 mm (2.4–5.1 in) long and 0.7–1.5 mm (0.028–0.059 in) wide, cylindrical to four-sided in cross section. There is a curved, pointed but not sharp, tip on the end of the phyllodes. The flowers are golden yellow and arranged in one or two sessile, oblong to cylindrical spikes in axils, and are 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long. Flowering mainly occurs from July to October, and the pods are firmly papery to thinly leathery and glabrous, 40–80 mm (1.6–3.1 in) long and 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) wide, appearing more or less like a string of beads, containing spherical or oblong seeds 3.5–5 mm (0.14–0.20 in) long and 3–4.5 mm (0.12–0.18 in) wide with a white aril.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nAcacia burkittii  was first formally described in 1864 by George Bentham in his Flora Australiensis from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller of a specimen collected by \"Burkitt\" near Lake Gilles. The specific epithet (burkittii) honours one of at least five people called 'Burkitt' who collected for von Mueller, mainly in South Australia.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nBurkitt's wattle grows in a variety of soils in mallee, eucalypt and mulga, often on sandhills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Central Ranges, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Geraldton Sandplains, Gibson Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Mallee, Murchison, Nullarbor and Yalgoo bioregions of Western Australia, the south of South Australia and the western slopes and plains of New South Wales.

    "text": "Michael Taylor (born 21 September 1944) became notable in England in 1974 as a result of the Ossett murder case and his alleged demonic possession.\n\n\nExorcism\nTaylor lived in Ossett, West Yorkshire, working as a butcher. In 1974, Taylor's wife, Christine, stated to a Christian Fellowship Group to which Taylor belonged, that his relationship with the lay leader of the group, Marie Robinson, was \"carnal\" in nature. Michael Taylor admitted that he felt evil within him and was encouraged by the group to work the issue out with Robinson. The two entered a bedroom alone where Taylor made a pass at Robinson and was rejected. Upon exiting the bedroom, Robinson related Taylor's behavior to the group, which included his wife, and Taylor eventually attacked Robinson verbally, who screamed back at him. During the next meeting, Michael Taylor received an absolution, but nevertheless, his behaviour continued to become more erratic. Robinson approached Taylor and his wife with an offer to perform an exorcism but was rebuffed. As a result, the local vicar, Peter Vincent, known to be an expert in the art of deliverance called in other experienced ministers in preparation to cast out the demons residing within the man.\nThe exorcism, which occurred on 5–6 October 1974 at St. Thomas's Church in Gawber, was headed by Vincent, the Anglican priest of St. Thomas's, and was aided by a Methodist clergyman, the Rev. Raymond Smith. According to Bill Ellis, an authority on folklore and the occult in contemporary culture, the exorcists believed that they had: \"In an all-night ceremony...invoked and cast out at least forty demons, including those of incest, bestiality, blasphemy, and lewdness. At the end, exhausted, they allowed Taylor to go home, although they felt that at least three demons—insanity, murder, and violence—were still left in him.\"\n\n\nMurder\nWhile at home, Taylor brutally murdered his wife, Christine. He attacked her with his bare hands, tearing her eyes and tongue out and almost tearing her face off, then strangling their poodle. He was found by a policeman, naked in the street, covered with blood.\nAt his trial in March, Taylor was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. He was sent to Broadmoor Hospital for two years, then spent another two years in a secure ward in Bradford before being released. The bizarre nature of the case attracted significant publicity.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nTaylor's case makes a prominent appearance in David Peace's novel Nineteen Seventy-Seven, the second of Peace's Red Riding Quartet. Taylor, renamed Michael Williams, is exorcised by Father Martin Laws, the series' main villain, and afterward kills his wife Carol by driving a nail into her skull. Jack Whitehead, one of the two protagonists, witnesses the exorcism of Williams and the murder of Carol Williams, his ex-wife, which as in real life takes place in Ossett.\nTaylor's case is mentioned in the 2021 film The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, which is based on another case in which a killer claimed demonic possession, that of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, who killed his landlord with a pocket knife in a fit of rage in 1981.\nTaylor's case is the subject of Season 2 of the true crime podcast The Devil Within, which examines the events leading up to and following Taylor joining the Gawber Christian Fellowship and meeting lay preacher Marie Robinson, the event which appears to have been the catalyst for what was to come.\n\n\nSee also\nTrial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson\nAnneliese Michel\nClara Germana Cele\nDavid Berkowitz\nExorcism of Roland Doe\nJohann Blumhardt\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nSt. Petersburg Times: Exorcism approval rocks Anglicans",

    "text": "The 37th National Hockey League All-Star Game was held in the Olympic Saddledome in Calgary, home of the Calgary Flames, on February 12, 1985.  The Wales Conference defeated the Campbell Conference 6–4.  The game's most valuable player was Mario Lemieux, who became the first rookie to win All-Star MVP honours, a feat that would not be repeated until 33 years later by Vancouver Canuck Brock Boeser in 2018.\n\n\nHost city\nThe 37th All-Star Game marked the first time the event was held in Calgary.  The game was held in the two-year-old Olympic Saddledome, which had been built following the Flames arrival in Calgary, and in anticipation of the 1988 Winter Olympics.  A sell-out crowd of 16,825 attended the game, and the gala also sold out.  In total, $100,000 was raised by the Flames which was donated to charity. The traditional black-tie nature of the banquet and gala were eschewed for this game as the hosts asked attendees to dress up in western wear.\nCampbell Conference and Edmonton Oilers head coach Glen Sather expressed displeasure that the fans in Calgary did not let go of the Battle of Alberta for the game.  He took issue with the fans booing Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky during the player introductions and the game itself.  \"It's embarrassing when they boo Wayne when he touches the puck.  They booed him once before when he was hurt so...\"  For his part, Gretzky downplayed Sather's concerns:  \"I've certainly got nothing against them booing me.  I kind of get a kick out of it.\"\nTo help raise awareness for 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, the NHL All-Stars participated in the Canadian entertainment's response to the crisis.  The players, along with music producer David Foster, shot a video segment for the Northern Lights' song \"Tears Are Not Enough\".\n\n\nHighlights\nFor the first time, the NHL named honorary captains for each team.  Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Glenn Hall was named the honorary captain of the Campbell Conference, while Guy Lafleur, who had retired only three months previous, represented the Wales Conference.  Lafleur returned to the game four years later, and thus became the only person to play in the NHL after serving as an honorary All-Star captain.  The ceremonial faceoff was performed by Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau and used a puck that he had taken into outer space.\nMario Lemieux entered the game facing criticism from former NHL coach, and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commentator, Don Cherry who stated that Lemieux was a \"floater\" in reference to Lemieux's lack of defensive play during the season.  The 19-year-old rookie dismissed Cherry's arguments, stating that \"the Penguins asked me to play offensively, not to care about my defensive play.\"  Lemieux recorded two goals, including the game winner, and added an assist to earn honours as the game's most valuable player.  Lemieux is the first player in All-Star Game history to win the award in his rookie year (33 years later, Brock Boeser would become the second rookie to be named All-Star Game MVP).\nEdmonton's Mike Krushelnyski and Boston's Ray Bourque were named the second and third stars of the game.  Bourque led all players offensively by recording four assists for the Wales Conference while Krushelnyski led the Campbell Conference with three assists.  Neither of the Flames representatives scored. The game featured an increased European flavour when compared to previous All-Star Games.  Five European players participated.  Swedes Anders Hedberg and Pelle Lindbergh played for the Wales Conference.  Swede Thomas Gradin, Czech Miroslav Frycer and Finn Jari Kurri represented the Campbell Conference.  Hedberg and Frycer each scored a goal for their respective conferences.\n\n\nTeam Lineups\n\n\nGame summary\n\nReferee: Andy Van Hellemond\nLinesmen: Gerard Gauthier, Bob Hodges\nTV: CBC, SRC, USA Network\n\n\nSee also\n1984–85 NHL season\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nPodnieks, Andrew (2000), The NHL All-Star Game: 50 years of the great tradition, Toronto: HarperCollins, ISBN 0-00-200058-X\nRosters: 1985 NHL All-Star Game Rosters, hockey-reference.com, retrieved September 21, 2008\nBox score: Wales 6, Campbell 4, Calgary Herald, February 13, 1985, p.

    "text": "Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal (French: Oratoire Saint-Joseph-du-Mont-Royal) is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and national shrine located at 3800 Queen Mary Road in the Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood  on Mount Royal's Westmount Summit in Montreal, Quebec. It is a National Historic Site of Canada and is Canada's largest church, with one of the largest church domes in the world. Founded in 1904 by Saint André Bessette in honour of his patron saint, Saint Joseph, the Oratory is the product of numerous architects and thousands of workers in a process spanning six decades. With its monumental scale, Renaissance Revival facade and contrasting Art Deco interior, the Oratory is recognizable not just in Montreal but around the world, attracting more than 2 million visitors and pilgrims to its steps each year.\nThe Oratory is the highest building in Montreal, rising more than 30 metres above Mount Royal's summit, allowing it to be seen from many kilometres away. It is the only building that violates the height restriction under the municipal building code of Montreal, which limits the height of any building, including skyscrapers, from surpassing the height of Mount Royal.\nSince 2018, the dome and lantern atop the Oratory have undergone a series of renovations expected to be completed in 2024 by architecture firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49. The C$80 million project will create safe access to the lantern which will allow for an unprecedented 360-degree view over the mountain of the city.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEarly history\n\nSaint André Bessette, C.S.C. (1845–1937), more commonly known as Brother André, was a religious brother and a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross who became internationally renowned as a miracle healer. Due to his reputation, in 1904 he was given funding to construct a small chapel on Mount-Royal across from Notre Dame College  to operate out of. The small, Gothic Revival style chapel expanded four times over the next decade with the growing of Brother André's fame and the Congregation decided to fulfill his request to build a basilica in his patron saint, Saint Joseph's honor. The original chapel, measuring 4.5 meters by 5.5 meters still stands today, though it has since been relocated about a hundred meters away to make room for the massive basilica that stands today.\nThe first phase of the basilica’s construction involved architects Dalbé Viau (1881–1938) and Alphonse Venne (1875–1934) who had previously done work for the Congregation. From 1914 to 1916, Viau and Venne constructed the crypt church, with seating for 1000, which still stands today and forms the base of the basilica where the massive collection of stairs ends. Between 1924 and 1927, the crypt and building up until the roof were completed in the Renaissance Revival style. Viau and Venne had wanted the dome of the Oratory to resemble that of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, and to be smaller than it actually is today; however, they never had the chance to see those plans through as construction was halted with the Great Depression.\n\n\nAfter the Great Depression\n\nIn 1937, Dom Paul Bellot (1876–1944), born in France, was hired to work after the death of Venne; however, he was required to work through Canadian Lucien Parent (1893–1956) due to not being a registered architect in Quebec. He redesigned Viau and Venne's roof and dome entirely, making the dome significantly larger and modelling it to resemble the dome of Florence Cathedral. The construction of his large Oratory dome lasted four years and was completed in 1941 after involving thousands of workers.\nFrom 1949 to 1951, architect Gilbert Moreau carried out alterations and improvements to the interior of Saint Joseph's Oratory, as well as to the adjacent monastery, and rearranged the sacristy in the basilica.\nComposer Émilien Allard was the church's carillonneur from 1955 to 1975. For RCA Victor he released the LP album Carols at the Carillon of Saint Joseph's Oratory for which he wrote the arrangements.\n\n\n21st century\n\nOn October 19, 2004, the Oratory held its centennial. All the bells of all the churches on the island of Montreal were supposed to ring at 9:00 a.m., though not all churches participated. At 9:05 a.m., the basilica rang its bell in response and celebration. \nOn April 2, again to commemorate the Oratory's centennial, Canada Post issued 'Saint Joseph's Oratory, Quebec' in the 2004 Tourist Attractions series. The stamp was designed by Catharine Bradbury & William Stewart based on a photograph by Bernard Brault. The 49¢ stamps are perforated kiss cut and were printed by Lowe-Martin Company Inc. That same year, the Oratory was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.\nOn October 30, 2007, Father Charles Corso, a priest at the Oratory, was faced with a disorganized and depressed man who threatened to kill himself with a handgun. The priest talked with the man and managed to calm him down before police arrived on scene. The man was brought to hospital to undergo psychiatric evaluation.\nOn March 22, 2019, a 26-year-old man wearing a dark winter coat and light-coloured baseball cap entered the Oratory during the Friday morning mass, rapidly walked up to the centre, and stabbed the celebrating priest, Father Claude Grou. Of the fifty people attending mass, several intervened to neutralize the assailant, before security guards responded. Police officers from the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal quickly arrived on scene and arrested the assailant who was already detained by security personnel. The assaulted priest suffered only minor injuries, a single stab wound to the chest. That same evening, upon being wheeled out of the Montreal General Hospital, he said, \"My health is fine. I’ll take a little rest and I will be back to work when my rest is taken. And the Oratory will remain a place where people can be welcomed. A place of prayers, and a place of calm, and a place of peace – even if there are some moments like that.\"\nIn 2018, the architectural firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49 won a competition organized by Saint Joseph's Oratory to renovate the inside of its dome and its observatory. The project is estimated to cost around $80 million CAD and will also include a complete renovation of the building's museum and the construction of a new welcome centre on Queen Mary road. The lantern will have space for up to 17 visitors at a time and will offer the only 360-degree view over the mountain in the city. As of early 2024, renovations are underway.\nToday, the basilica enshrines a venerated statue of Saint Joseph, currently located within the oil-burning chapel that was authorized a Canonical coronation by Pope Pius X on 19 March 1910 via Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli. This statue was previously enshrined at the Côte-des-Neiges Chapel and has been moved to the new modern basilica. The same image was ceremonially  crowned for the second time on 9 August 1955 by Pope Pius XII via Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger.\n\n\nArchitecture and structure\nWhen the basilica's construction began in 1914, many architects were challenging the conventional Beaux-Arts style and neoclassicism. This period was also around the time where expressionist architecture, constructivist architecture, Bauhaus ideas and many other facets of modern architecture began to take off, with pioneers like Le Corbusier in Europe and Frank Lloyd Wright in the United States refusing to be categorized by traditional architectural styles. It was certainly atypical for monumental classical church buildings to be constructed in cities around this time, yet Saint Joseph's Oratory was one of the largest buildings in Montreal when it was constructed, and was designed in Renaissance Revival exterior with an Art Deco interior. The basilica, as it stands today, comprises many parts, including the Crypt Church, located underneath the basilica, the Votive Chapel, between the Crypt and the rock of Mount-Royal, the Shrine, which encompasses the nave, apse and transept, and the dome, which is the largest church dome in Canada and the third largest in the world.\nDuring the summer solstice, the setting sun is perfectly aligned with the center line of the main steps that lead up to (and into) the basilica. Every year around that time, people sit on the steps to watch the sunset. The main aisle inside the basilica, and even the cross on the altar, are also in perfect alignment with the setting sun on the longest day of the year. Sunlight enters the basilica through some windows and doors.\nOn the day of the total solar eclipse, Monday April 8, 2024, the steps and surrounding areas were filled to capacity with people there to experience the eclipse. Totality occurred at 3:26pm for about 85 seconds. The temperature was about 15C. Although the eastern part of the sky was clear, the southwestern part, where the sun was, had cirrus clouds that muted some of the effects of the eclipse. However, the diamond ring effects, corona with prominences, and planets Venus and Jupiter were all visible to the unaided eye. The spectators cheered and applauded as totality started. After totality some people sang \"You Are My Sunshine\". A sun rainbow halo formed in the cirrus clouds, and a jet flying across the halo left a contrail with a contrail shadow.  Most of the snow from the snowstorm 5 days earlier had melted.\n\n\nCrypt Church\n\nThe Crypt Church, originally designed by Viau and Venne, measures 63.39 by 36.5 by 13.1 m (208.0 by 119.8 by 43.0 ft), has a seating capacity of 1000 people and is designed in a neoclassical style. The ceiling is supported using the barrel vaulting of steel-reinforced concrete arches. The church is called a \"crypt\" due to its flattened arches as well as its position embedded into the mountain underneath the basilica. There is a statue of Joseph made out of Carrara marble behind the main altar of the Crypt Church, added in 1917 by the Italian artist A. Giacomini. Eight stained glass windows depicting the stages in Saint Joseph's life were installed in the crypt in 1919 by the Montreal firm Perdriau et O'Shea.\n\n\nVotive Chapel\n\nAdded between 1946 and 1949 between the Crypt Church and the rock of Mount Royal, the Votive Chapel is designed in Art Deco style from the plans of Lucien Parent, and relies on heavy use of geometric forms (square columns, square paneling on ceiling). The Chapel measures 31.69 by 15.2 by 27.43 m (104.0 by 49.9 by 90.0 ft) and contains approximately 10,000 candles, with the central lampstand in front of the statue of Saint Joseph holding approximately 3500 votive candles. The chapel, also referred to as \"the Chapel of Ex-votos,\" has nearly 1000 ex-votos (canes, crutches, etc.) suspended within it, left behind by pilgrims during the life of Brother André. The chapel also contains eight bas-reliefs designed by Canadian sculptor, Joseph Guardo in 1948, which illustrate eight of the attributes which Christianity has accorded to Saint Joseph. The tomb of Saint André, sculpted in black marble, rests in an alcove in the middle of the Votive Chapel.\n\n\nShrine\n\nThe interior of the basilica, known as the Shrine, was designed using concepts by Dom Bellot as well as Canadian architect Gérard Notebaert, and uses a Latin cross layout with a dome at the crossing. The interior has an overall length of 105 m (344 ft). The nave, which contains pews to seat 2028 people (with a maximum capacity of 10,000 people), measures 37 m (121 ft) in width, while the transept measures 65 metres (213 ft) and connects to the shrine of Brother André. The apse, as well as the rest of the interior, is designed in Art Deco style, which was very popular in Montreal during the 1930s, and contains sculptures, bas-reliefs, mosaics and stained glass of religious imagery. The roof of the basilica is held up using reinforced concrete multi-angle arches iconic of Dom Bellot’s style.\nThe exterior of the Oratory is constructed using large blocks of granite from Lac Mégantic quarries in Quebec. The colonnade at the front façade of the building consists of four 18 m (59 ft)-tall, 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in)-thick Corinthian columns which provide the structural support for the entablature of the front portico. It is also corniced and ornamented. The staircase which leads from the street to the base of the basilica contain two parallel flights of 283 concrete steps separated by a central flight of 99 wooden steps reserved for pilgrims who wish to climb on their knees.\n\n\nDome\n\nThe dome of Saint Joseph’s Oratory is the largest church dome in Canada and among the largest and the tallest domes in the world, and this is a result of Dom Bellot’s very inspired and ambitious designs. His plans for the dome are very similar to those of Florence Cathedral, being of a \"double shell\" design, meaning it consists of two domes, one on the interior and one on the exterior with empty space in between. Like the cathedral in Florence, the outer dome of the Oratory consists of eight pointed arches laying atop an octagonal drum, with a lantern and cross. The outer dome of the Oratory measures only 17.78 cm (7.00 in) in thickness and the inner dome measures only about 12.7 cm (5.0 in) in thickness, which is approximately 18 times thinner than the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The concrete shell of the Oratory's dome is so thin in fact that when related to its overall size, it is akin to an eggshell.\nThe two domes vary immensely in span and height, with the outer dome measuring 39 m (128 ft) in diameter and rising 97 m (318 ft) from the nave floor, and the inner dome measuring 26 m (85 ft) in diameter and rising 60 m (200 ft) from the nave floor. There are 16 steel buttresses along the inner walls of the drums that provide the structural support for the dome. They serve to brace the inner dome against the outer dome, thus making the supporting walls for both domes more rigid.\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe 1989 film Jesus of Montreal uses the Oratory as its principal backdrop. A photograph of the Oratory is used for the picture representing Montreal in the Monopoly: Here and Now: The World Edition game.\n\n\nSee also\nList of basilicas in Canada\nList of carillons in Canada\nList of tallest domes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nSaint Joseph's Oratory – Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops Archived 2013-10-04 at the Wayback Machine\nCBC Digital Archives – The Miracle on Mount Royal: 100 Years of St. Joseph's Oratory\nSaint Joseph's Oratory: Photo Gallery by The Catholic Photographer\n[1] Les Merveilles de L'Oratoire: L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal, 1904–2004 By Denise Robillard\nSaint Joseph's Oratory in Canadian Encyclopedia",

He was awarded a second class degree in the Classical tripos.\n\n\nCareer\nHe was elected a Fellow of Trinity College when he graduated, but he did not undertake major research work. Instead, he was a lecturer in mathematics, Theology and Hebrew in the days before teaching was expected to be specialised. He was Dean of Trinity College, 1884–91 and Tutor, 1885–94.\nHe was ordained a priest in 1878 and Appleton went to become warden of Trinity College Mission and vicar of St George's Church, Camberwell, 1894–1903. He was then vicar of St Mary's Church, Ware, Hertfordshire and Rural Dean, 1904–7.\nAppleton had limited previous connection with Selwyn College when he was chosen as its Master, but he became an influential master of the college through various construction projects he oversaw. The college had been founded around 1880 to counter some of the effects of the \"Revolution of the Dons\" that occurred in the 1860s. The university was opened up to people of any religion and none, so the college was to be a haven for Anglicans. Every Master of Selwyn College was a clergyman up until 1983. As a clergyman and Master of Selwyn, Appleton was something of a throwback to the old pattern of Cambridge academic life prior to the \"Revolution of the Dons\".\n\n\nLegacy\nAfter serving as Master for just two years, he died at the College from influenza in 1909. His body is buried in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge. A memorial brass is in the ante-chapel of Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge.\nAppleton left a permanent memorial of his mastership in having raised the funds to build the southern range of buildings in the Old Court, including the College Hall, and Combination room. His initials and rebus of an apple and a tun, are carved on the front of the Hall stairway.\n\n\nExternal links\nRichard Appleton at Find a Grave\n\n\nReferences\n\nAPPLETON, Rev.

    "text": "The Danata Formation (or Danatinskaya, Danatinsk, Russian: Danata Svita) is an earliest Eocene to Middle Eocene sedimentary succession located in Turkmenistan. It is mostly famous for its fish-bearing horizons (Ichthyofauna).\nThe formation for example crops out in the Kopet Dag mountain range in the border region of Turkmenistan and Iran. It was deposited in a far northeastern arm of the Tethys Sea.\nPreviously, it was thought that the earliest horizons of this formation dated to the latest Paleocene (Thanetian). However, more recent studies have found the formation's sapropel to originate from a global anoxic event caused by the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, indicating that it formed just after the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, during the earliest Ypresian.\n\n\nPaleoenvironment\nThe Danata Formation is famous for its ichthyofauna. The fish are found in a 9 metres (30 ft) thick clay horizon in the middle of the succession, that has been dated as earliest Ypresian, around 56 million years ago. This includes fossils of the family Turkmenidae. Luvarus necopinatus was first described in this formation. Other fossils of fish include the genera Eospinus, Danatinia, Exellia, Turkmene and Avitoluvarus. The snake species Archaeophis turkmenicus has also been described. A similar fauna occurs in the Moler Formation in Denmark. The majority of these taxa were named by prominent Russian ichthyologist Pavel Daniltshenko.\nThe fauna is largely dominated by three species: Primisardinella genetrix, Chanos torosus, and Mene triangulum. The formation appears to have been deposited in an open-water environment as the vast majority of genera had a pelagic lifestyle, with only two very rare benthic genera (Eolamprogrammus and Asanoa) known. Despite some of the similarities in the taxonomic affiliation of the Danata ichthyofauna with modern-day marine ichthyofauna, only five to six genera represented in the formation (Chanos, Seriola, Luvarus, Mene, Scomberomorus, and possibly Caesio) also have modern representatives. Uniquely, a high diversity of luvarid fishes is known from the formation, despite this family being represented by a single, very rare species (the louvar) in the modern day.\n\n\nPaleobiota\nThe following taxa are known:\n\n\nBony fish\n\n\nReptiles\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nHead, Jason J.; Holroyd, Patricia A.; Hutchison, J.

    "text": "Bruno Contrada (born September 2, 1931 in Naples, Italy) is the former police chief of Palermo and deputy director of the civil intelligence service SISDE who was arrested based on revelations of former Sicilian Mafiosi turned pentiti, Gaspare Mutolo and Giuseppe Marchese.\n\n\nBiography\nBruno Contrada was born in Naples. He joined the Italian police in 1958 and, in 1973, was appointed head of the judiciary police in Palermo.\nIn 1982, he transferred to SISDE, where he was responsible for the agency’s operations in Sicily and Sardinia. In 1986, he was promoted to the Operational Division of the SISDE headquarters in Rome. In 1992, under the direction of then-Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, Contrada and the head of the Italian police, Arturo Parisi, held a secret meeting with anti-Mafia judge Paolo Borsellino. According to reports, Borsellino was deeply disturbed by the meeting, and was assassinated two days later in Palermo. Contrada later claimed to have been a friend of Borsellino, but the judge’s family strongly denied this. Another prominent anti-Mafia judge, Giovanni Falcone—who had been killed two months earlier—had also stated that he did not trust Contrada.\nContrada was arrested on 24 December 1992. He was accused of having informed the Mafia about upcoming police operations and obstructing the early capture of fugitive Corleonesi boss Totò Riina.\nSuspicion had first arisen in 1984, when Mafia informant (pentito) Tommaso Buscetta warned anti-Mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone that Contrada was allegedly protecting certain Mafia bosses and tipping them off about planned police raids. Falcone also suspected that Contrada had alerted the Mafia to his intention to meet with visiting Swiss prosecutors at his summer house in Addaura on June 19, 1989—when an assassination attempt was made on his life. During investigations into Mafia-linked money laundering in Switzerland, Contrada was again implicated for allegedly warning a suspect about an imminent arrest, allowing the individual to flee.\nHis first trial began on April 12, 1994. After twenty-two hearings, the proceedings concluded on April 5, 1996, with Contrada being sentenced to ten years in prison for collusion with the Mafia. On May 4, 2001, the Court of Appeal acquitted him, but on December 12, 2002, the Court of Cassation annulled the acquittal and ordered a retrial before a different section of the Court of Appeal of Palermo. On February 26, 2006, following 31 hours of deliberation, the appellate court confirmed the original verdict and sentenced Contrada again to ten years in prison, along with payment of court costs. On May 10, 2007, the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction.\nIn 2015, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Contrada had been convicted for actions that, at the time, were not classified as crimes, thus violating the principle of non-retroactivity of criminal law (nulla poena sine lege). In 2017, 25 years after his arrest, the Supreme Court of Cassation definitively annulled his conviction.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nStille, Alexander (1995). Excellent Cadavers.

He served with distinction in the Army of the Potomac in the battles of Fredericksburg and Gettysburg and was a \"special aide-de-camp\" to General Andrew A. Humphreys. After the war, Fernández Cavada was appointed as consul in Cienfuegos, Cuba. He joined his brother, who had been in Trinidad, in the Cuban insurrection against Spanish rule and succeeded him as Commander-in-Chief of the Cinco Villas. He was killed in action.\n\n\nEarly years\nFernández Cavada was one of three sons born in Cienfuegos, Cuba to Isidoro Fernández Cavada and Emily Howard Gatier, an American citizen and native of Philadelphia. After his father's death in 1838, he moved with his mother and siblings to Philadelphia. Fernández Cavada's mother met and married Samuel Dutton and the family resided at 222 Spruce Street, Philadelphia. Fernández Cavada received his primary and secondary education at Philadelphia's Central High School.\n\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nUpon the outbreak of the American Civil War, both Adolfo and his brother Federico joined the Philadelphia 23rd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, a regiment of the Union Forces. The regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac. Federico was transferred to 114th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, while Adolfo remained with the regiment as an aide to General Andrew A. Humphreys. Adolfo participated in various battles including the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Gettysburg.\nHe was wounded during the Battle of Gettysburg when his horse was shot and killed from under him. Fernández Cavada kept a diary during the war which is considered to be one of the most vivid and articulate accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg. His eyewitness account of the famous conflict provided an expressively descriptive account of the battle. During one day of the July battle, he recorded how \"The air was soon full of flying shot, shell and canister--and a groan here and there attested their affect. ...the roar of musketry and the crashing, pounding noise of guns and bursting shells was deafening...\"\n\n\nCuba’s Ten Years War\nAfter the war, Fernández Cavada was appointed as United States consul at Cienfuegos, Cuba. Fernández Cavada resigned his position upon the Cuban insurrection against Spanish rule, which became known as Cuba's Ten Years' War (1868–1878). Together with his brother Federico, who had also resigned from his appointment as consul to Trinidad, he joined the Cuban insurgents in their quest for Cuba's independence.\nIn February 1869, Fernández Cavada attacked the town of Palmira. He led his men in the battles of Altos de Potrerillo and Saltadero de Siguanea and in the attack against the Arimao armory. On November 5, 1869, the men under Fernández Cavada's command took the town of Cienfuegos and a month later Arroyo Blanco. On April 4, 1870, Fernández Cavada was named Commander-in-Chief of the Cinco Villas with the rank of Mayor General, succeeding his brother Federico, who was named Commander-in-Chief of all the Cuban forces.\n\n\nDeath\nAdolfo's brother Federico was captured by the Spanish authorities and sentenced to die by firing squad in July 1871. On December 18, 1871, Fernández Cavada was killed in battle at the coffee estate, La Adelaida, near Santiago de Cuba.\n\n\nAwards and decorations\nFernández Cavada's awards and decorations include the following: \n\n\nSee also\n\nHispanics in the American Civil War\nFederico Fernández Cavada\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

Sirbu in 1986 as a private, for profit, post-secondary school specializing in office practices. In 1988 and 1989, Graphic Design and Computer Graphics programs were added to Platt’s offerings. To further expand its appeal, Platt sought and was approved for Associate Degrees in both Graphics and Business programs. By the year 2000, Platt had been approved for Baccalaureate degrees in Graphics, Business, plus its new program, Information Technology. The Business offerings were dropped soon after an increasing drop in enrollments to those programs.\nIn 2005, management made the decision to formally drop the struggling Information Technology program and to pursue a transformation into nursing education while training out the remaining students in the graphics programs. The program was conceived of by Patricia Simpson, former Director of Education. Simpson was instrumental in forming a team to write and present a curriculum for approval by the Colorado Board of Nursing who approved Platt for a Bachelorette in Science, Nursing. The program was subsequently approved for national accreditation by The Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN).\nIn October 2024, it was announced that Platt College would become a part of Concordia University, St. Paul in Minnesota.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial site",

Approximately 264 km (164 mi) of passageways have been mapped within. As a result, it is the longest cave in Europe and the seventh-longest cave in the world, after Mammoth Cave, Sistema Sac Actun, Jewel Cave, Shuanghedong and Sistema Ox Bel Ha. It is also the longest gypsum cave in the world.\n\n\nHistory\nThe cave complex was discovered by members of the Lviv speleological club \"Cyclope\" in 1966. It was entirely unknown before then. There have been more than 50 expeditions since its discovery, but exploration has slowed significantly in recent years, and very little surveying is currently being done. The cave is located very close to the Priest's Grotto or Ozerna Cave, the eleventh-longest cave in the world at 130.4 km (81.0 mi), but the two caves have not yet been found to be connected.\nIn 2008, the cave was recognized as a Natural Wonder of Ukraine.\n\n\nGeology\n\nThe entire cave lies under a 2 km square area in a layer of Neogene period gypsum that is less than 30 metres (98 ft) thick. The passages tend to be fairly small, no more than 3 metres (10 ft) wide and 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall for most, although at intersections they can be up to 10 metres (33 ft) tall. They are often choked with mud. They comprise a dense network on several levels, making Optymistychna known as a \"maze cave\".\nOptymistychna's gypsum bed is topped with a limestone layer, which has seeped through into the cave via erosion and formed into calcite speleothems. At other places, the gypsum has formed crystals, often tinted a multitude of colors by mineral salts. In some areas, large gypsum rosettes have formed, colored black by manganese oxide.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\nList of longest caves\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nChapter II.9, Gypsum Karst in the Western Ukraine by Alexander Klimchouk article appearing in: International Journal of Speleology, vol. 25, #3-4, 1996, p. 263-278.",

    "text": "Dinocerata, from Ancient Greek δεινός (deinós), \"terrible\", and κέρας (kéras), \"horn\", or Uintatheria, is an extinct order of large herbivorous hoofed mammals with horns and protuberant canine teeth, known from the Paleocene and Eocene of Asia and North America. With body masses ranging up to 4,500 kilograms (9,900 lb) they represent some of the earliest known large mammals.\n\n\nDescription\n\nUintatheriids are suggested to have been browsers. Over the course of their evolution, dinoceratans underwent a great increase in body size, from a weight of 175 kilograms (386 lb) in the earliest species to a weight of up to 4,500 kilograms (9,900 lb) in the largest species, co-inciding with the development of fully graviportal limbs with a digitigrade posture. Later members of the order are noted for their distinctive pairs of horns that develop from the maxillary and parietal bones of the skull, along with the development of elongated upper canines. The upper incisors were also lost, and the bilophodont nature of the molar teeth was enhanced.\n\n\nEvolution\nThe oldest and most primitive members of the group, such as Prodinoceras, appeared virtually simultaneously during the late Paleocene in North America and Asia, indicating connection between the two landmasses (probably via Beringia), with uintatheres continuing to exchange between the landmasses during the Eocene, as suggested by the presence of Uintatherium in both North America and China. Uintatheres became extinct towards the end of the Middle Eocene, for unknown reasons.\n\n\nClassification\nThe affinities of the group within Placentalia have historically been contentious. A 2015 phylogenetic study recovered Dinocerata as part of Laurasiatheria, closely related to ungulates and \"condylarths\", with Dinocerata placed as the sister group to the South American native ungulate group Xenungulata. A close relationship with Xenungulata was first proposed in 1985, with the proposed clade containing both groups named Uintatheriamorpha, though other authors have suggested that these similarities are likely to be due to convergence.\n\n\nTaxonomy and phylogeny\n\nDinocerata is generally divided into two families, \"Prodinoceratidae\", containing the most primitive genus Prodinoceras, with some authors also choosing to include the genus Probathyopsis, and Uintatheriidae, containing all other genera. Members of Prodinoceratidae are likely ancestral to Uintatheriidae. The Asian uintatheriid genus Gobiatherium is often placed into its own separate subfamily Gobiatheriinae, with all other uintatheriids belonging to the subfamily Uintatheriinae.\n\nOrder Dinocerata\nFamily Prodinoceratidae\nProdinoceras\n?Probathyopsis\nFamily Uintatheriidae\nGobiatherium\nProbathyopsis\nBathyopsis\nUintatherium\nEobasileus\nTetheopsis\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Hatsutaka (初鷹, First Hawk) was the lead vessel in the Hatsutaka class of medium-sized minelayers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which was in service during World War II. She was designed as an improved version of Shirataka anti-submarine netlayer. However, during the Pacific War, due to the critical shortage of escort patrol ships, she was fitted with depth charge racks, her minelaying rails were removed, and she was used primarily for convoy escort duties.\nShe was sunk in action by USS Hawkbill, losing 70 men.\n\n\nBackground\nUnder the Maru-3 Supplemental Naval Amaments Budget of 1937, the Imperial Japanese Navy authorized a two vessels of a new class of minelayer (Project number H12) primarily for coastal duties. The new vessel was designed to carry either 100 Type 5 naval mines, or to function as a netlayer based on design features developed through operational experience with Shirataka.\nHatsutaka was launched by the Harima Shipyard near Kobe on 28 April 1939, and was commissioned into service on 31 October 1939.\n\n\nOperational history\nAfter commissioning, Hatsutaka was assigned to the IJN 1st Fleet’s Second Base Force, but was reassigned to the IJN 3rd Fleet in April 1941, and to the Southwest Area Fleet's First Southern Expeditionary Fleet's Ninth Base Force based at Camranh Bay, French Indochina in October 1941.\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Hatsutaka was assigned to ”Operation T”, (the invasion of Sumatra), escorting 11 transports with the IJA 229th Infantry Regiment from French Indochina to Bangka and Palembang on 11 February, and the Imperial Guards Division from Singapore to northern Sumatra on 10 March. This mission was followed by ”Operation D” (the invasion of the Andaman Islands at the end of March, with Hatsutaka escorting a convoy from Singapore to Port Blair and Rangoon in Burma. Hatsutaka spent the remainder of 1942 and first half of 1943 based at Ambon in the Netherlands East Indies, operating between Ambon and Makassar.\nOn 15 July 1943 Hatsutaka rendezvoused with the German submarine U-511, carrying Vice Admiral Nomura Naokuni, Japan's representative to the Axis Tripartite Commission in Berlin since 1941, and Major Sugita Tamotsu of the IJA Medical Service, Dr. Ernst Wörmann, ambassador to Wang Jingwei's pro-Japanese Reorganized National Government of China and Martin Spahn, leader-designee of the NSDAP (Nazi) party in Japan and three engineers from U-boat builder AG Weser at Bremen Hatsutaka escorted the German submarine to Penang.  For the remainder of 1943 and first half of 1944, Hatsutaka operated along the Sumatra coast between Padang, Medan, and Sabang.\nOn 19 April 1944 Hatsutaka was at Sabang when raided as part of Operation Cockpit, the first combined operation between the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, French Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, and United States Navy. Forty-six bombers (17 British, 29 American) and 37 fighters (13 British, 24 American) from HMS Illustrious and USS Saratoga raided Sabang, lightly damaging Hatsutaka, killing three crewmen and wounding five others. Hatsutaka was repaired at Singapore, and subsequently performed escort patrol duties between Singapore and Port Blair. On 3 August 1944, Hatsutaka struck a mine laid by HMS Truculent and was damaged.\nLieutenant Commander Ozaki Sakan assumed command of Hatsutaka in October 1944.  On 13 January 1945 Hatsutaka participated in a 14-hour attack on HMS Strongbow with three other ships that rendered HMS Strongbow unfit for further service.\nOn 2 May 1945 Hatsutaka was escorting a tanker when attacked by USS Baya and USS Lagarto.  At 2249, Hatsutaka detected Baya with her Type 22 radar and began closing. 2305, Baya fired two torpedoes at Hatsutaka, with both missing.  At 2307, Hatsutaka opened fire on Baya with \"20mm, 40mm, and 2 or 3 4.7 inch guns at a range of 1100 yards.\"   and noted at 2308 that \"Jap gunnery poor but plenty of it. Tracers passing down both sides of the periscope shears and overhead. 4.7 inch appeared to be both common and fused, as it was ricochetting [sic] alongside and over the stern as well as bursting overhead which was thought at first to be starshells.\"  At 2309, Baya fired another three torpedoes, with Hatsutaka combing the tracks. When Hatsutaka turned on the searchlight at 2320, Baya submerged and fired another torpedo at her, missing again. At 2325, when Baya surfaced, she secured the searchlight and again commenced firing on Baya and dropped six depth charges at 2329, shaking Baya violently.  At 2333, the range opened and Baya informed Lagarto that she had been driven off by the escort's gunfire. Baya noted that \"It is nothing short of a miracle that we came through so much gunfire without a single hit.  His deflection was as consistently on as his range was off.\"\nLagarto made contact with the convoy in a submerged attack at 1400 on 3 May.  Japanese records indicate that Hatsutaka depth charged and sank Lagarto on 3 May.  On 3 May at 2215 Baya again attempted to attack the convoy, but her own 10 cm radar was detected, alerting the convoy, which commenced evasive maneuvers.  At 0011 on 4 May Baya fired six torpedoes, with no hits. At 0013, the convoy turned away, with Hatsutaka chasing Baya as she tried to get in another position to attack.\nOn 14 May Hatsutaka was escorting Tottori Maru. At 0737, USS Cobia fired five torpedoes at a ship misidentified as \"Yaeyama\", but missed. At 0745, Hatsutaka dropped six depth charges, followed by four more at 0755.  At 1147, Hatsutaka sighted the periscope of Cobia, and launched nine depth charge runs, causing severe damage.\" At 1430, USS Hammerhead attacked Tottori Maru, but she evaded three torpedoes, and later that night at 2300, when Hammerhead was trying to get another shot in on Tottori Maru, Hatsutaka was always in the way. At 0021 on 15 May Hatsutaka opened fire on Hammerhead, scoring several near misses.  Hatsutaka then returned to Singapore.\nAt 0523 on 16 May in rainy weather, USS Hawkbill fired six torpedoes at Hatsutaka, two of which hit, flooding her engine room. At 1044, Hawkbill fired three more torpedoes. Hatsutaka opened fire, but one torpedo struck amidships, causing an explosion, which broke her in half.  Hatsutaka sank at 04°49′N 103°31′E at 11:15, with 70 crewmen killed in action.\nHatsutaka was removed from the navy list on 10 August 1945.\n\n\nWreckage\nOn 28 March 2008 northwest of Pulau Tenggol, Malaysia a team of divers located Hatsutaka about  one kilometer (0.62 mi) off shore.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBooks\nBrown, David (1990).

The region of the galaxies outside their nuclei experienced a period of increased star formation roughly around the time they began to interact. Two dwarf objects are located in the vicinity of this merging pair, and one of them, designated UGC 957, is located in the northern tidal tail – it may be the result of the interaction.\nWhen viewed in the X-ray band, the interacting galaxies appear around half as luminous as expected given their merger state. Analysis of the gas and molecular features suggests the secondary merger component is gas poor. Most of the star formation, therefore, took place in the gas-rich main component to the southeast. 15 X-ray sources are detected within the merger, with many of them displaying long-term variability.

He was commissioned to design a fountain for the new Waterfront Park, but died in 1973 before work was finalized. The project had been funded by a $75,000 donation from Helen Martha Schiff. Following his death in 1973, his widow Margaret Tomkins lead the effort to complete the fountain's design. It was completed alongside the park and adjacent to the aquarium in October 1974.\nIn 2019, construction began on a revamp of a portion of Seattle's waterfront. On September 13, 2020, the central portion of Pier 58 collapsed during early demolition work following the discovery of extensive structural issues. The structural integrity of the pier had been compromised by a combination of the environment and the supports for the fountain failing. The fountain, weighing 4 tons, fell into the water along with two contractors who were working on the demolition. Divers retrieved the fountain from the sea during the cleanup process.\nA rebuilt Pier 58 with a restored Waterfront Fountain opened to the public on July 25, 2025.

    "title": "History of the bikini",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=21434966",
    "text": "Evidence of bikini-style women's clothing has been found as early as 5600 BC, and the history of the bikini can be traced back to that era. Illustrations of women wearing bikini-like garments during competitive athletic events in the Roman era have been found in several locations, the most famous of which is at Villa Romana del Casale.\nAlthough two-piece bathing suits were being used by women as early as the 1930s, the modern bikini is dated to July 5, 1946, when, partly due to material rationing after World War II, French engineer Louis Réard introduced the modern bikini, modeled by Micheline Bernardini. Réard named his design after the Bikini Atoll, where the first post-war tests of the atomic bomb were taking place.\nFrench women welcomed the design but the Catholic Church, some media, and a majority of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant wore them in 1951, but the bikini was then banned from the competition. Actress Brigitte Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses, including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, also received press attention when they wore bikinis. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated, credited with giving it additional legitimacy. Ursula Andress made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962). The deer skin bikini worn by Raquel Welch in the film One Million Years B.C. (1966) turned her into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s.\nThe bikini gradually grew to gain wide acceptance in the Western world. According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, the bikini is perhaps the most popular type of female beachwear around the globe because of \"the power of women, and not the power of fashion\". As he explains, \"The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women.\" By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and sun tanning.\n\n\nIn antiquity\n\n\nPre-Roman\n\nIn the Chalcolithic era of around 5600 BC, the mother-goddess of Çatalhöyük, a large ancient settlement in southern Anatolia, was depicted astride two leopards while wearing a bikini-like costume. Two-piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes are depicted on Greek urns and paintings dating back to 1400 BC. Active women of ancient Greece wore a breastband called a mastodeton or an apodesmos, which continued to be used as an undergarment in the Middle Ages. While men in ancient Greece abandoned the perizoma, partly high-cut briefs and partly loincloth, women performers and acrobats continued to wear it.\n\n\nRoman\n\nArtwork dating back to the Diocletian period (286–305 AD) in Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily, excavated by Gino Vinicio Gentili in 1950–60, depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in mosaics on the floor. The images of ten women, dubbed the \"Bikini Girls\", exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today, are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site. In the artwork \"Coronation of the Winner\" done in floor mosaic in the Chamber of the Ten Maidens (Sala delle Dieci Ragazze in Italian) the bikini girls are depicted weight-lifting, discus throwing, and running. Some activities depicted have been described as dancing, as their bodies resemble dancers rather than athletes. Coronation in the title of the mosaic comes from a woman in a toga with a crown in her hand and one of the maidens holding a palm frond.\nSome academics maintain that the nearby image of Eros, the primordial god of lust, love, and intercourse, was added later, demonstrating the owner's predilections and strengthening the association of the bikini with the erotic. Similar mosaics have been discovered in Tellaro in northern Italy and Patti, another part of Sicily.\nProstitution, skimpy clothes and athletic bodies were related in ancient Rome, as images were found of female sex workers exercising with dumbbells/clappers and other equipment wearing costumes similar to the Bikini Girls.\nCharles Seltman, a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, curator of the Archaeology Museum there and an editor of The Cambridge Ancient History, illustrated a chapter titled \"The new woman\" in his book Women in Antiquity with a 1950s model wearing an identical bikini against the 4th-century mosaics from Piazza Armerina as part of a sisterhood between the bikini-clad female athletes of ancient Greco-Romans and modern woman. A photograph of the mosaic was used by Sarah Pomeroy, Professor of Classics at Hunter College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, in the 1994 British edition of her book Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves to emphasize a similar identification. According to archeologist George M.A. Hanfmann the bikini girls made the learned observers realize \"how modern the ancients were\".\n\nIn ancient Rome, the bikini-style bottom, a wrapped loincloth of cloth or leather, was called a subligar or subligaculum (\"little binding underneath\"), while a band of cloth or leather to support the breasts was called strophium or mamillare. The exercising bikini girls from Piazza Armerina wear subligaria, scanty briefs made as a dainty version of a man's perizoma, and a strophium band about the breasts, often referred to in literature as just fascia, which can mean any kind of bandage. Observation of artifacts and experiments shows bands had to be wrapped several times around the breasts, largely to flatten them in a style popular with flappers in the 1920s. These Greco-Roman breastbands may have flattened big breasts and padded small breasts to look bigger. Evidence suggests regular use.\nThe \"bikini girls\" from Piazza Armerina, some of whom sport a braless look, do not depict any propensity of such popularity in style. A number of bottoms, made of leather, have been excavated in London and Mainz. There has been no evidence that these bikinis were for swimming or sun-bathing.\nFinds especially in Pompeii show the Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini. A statue of the Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the front hall. A statue of the Venus was recovered from the tablinum of the house of Julia Felix, and another from an atrium in the garden at Via Dell'Abbondanza. Naples National Archaeological Museum, which opened its limited viewing gallery of more explicit exhibits in 2000, also exhibits a \"Venus in Bikini\". However, the Naples National Archaeological Museum is keen to stress that this statue actually depicts her Greek counterpart Aphrodite as she is about to untie her sandal, a common theme among other works depicting Aphrodite. The Naples National Archaeological Museum's exhibits include female statues wearing see-through gold lamé brassiere, basque and knickers.\nThe Kings of Naples discovered these Pompeii artifacts, including the one meter tall, almost unclothed statue of Venus painted in gold leaf with something like a modern bikini. They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to \"mature persons of secure morals\". Even after the doors were opened, only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time, and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents' or a teacher's permission.\nThere are references to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, is a good place to hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.\nThere is evidence of ancient Roman women playing expulsim ludere, an early version of handball, wearing costumes that have been identified as bikinis.\n\n\nInterval\nBetween the classical bikinis and the modern bikini there has been a long interval. Swimming or outdoor bathing were discouraged in the Christian West and there was little need for a bathing or swimming costume until the 18th century. The bathing gown in the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel, so that modesty or decency was not threatened. In the first half of the 19th century the top became knee-length while an ankle-length drawer was added as a bottom. By the second half of the 19th century, in France, the sleeves started to vanish, the bottom became shorter to reach only the knees and the top became hip-length and both became more form fitting. In the 1900s women wore wool dresses on the beach that were made of up to 9 yards (8.2 m) of fabric. That standard of swimwear evolved into the modern bikini in the first of half of the 20th century.\n\n\nBreakthrough\n\nIn 1907, Australian swimmer and performer Annette Kellerman was arrested on a Boston beach for wearing a form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. Even in 1943, pictures of the Kellerman swimsuit were produced as evidence of indecency in Esquire v. Walker, Postmaster General. But, Harper's Bazaar wrote in June 1920 (vol. 55, no. 6, p. 138) – \"Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always remains refined.\" The following year, in June 1921 (vol. 54, no. 2504, p. 101) it wrote that these bathing suits were \"famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite, plastic beauty of line.\"\nFemale swimming was introduced at the 1912 Summer Olympics. In 1913, inspired by that breakthrough, the designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear, a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top. Silent films such as The Water Nymph (1912) saw Mabel Normand in revealing attire, and this was followed by the daringly dressed Sennett Bathing Beauties (1915–1929). The word \"swimsuit\" was coined in 1915 by Jantzen Knitting Mills, a sweater manufacturer who launched the Red Diving Girl swimwear brand. The first annual bathing suit day at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1916 was a landmark. The swimsuit apron, a design for early swimwear, disappeared by 1918, leaving a tunic covering the shorts.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from \"taking in the water\" to \"taking in the sun\" at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. Rayon was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits, but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic, with jersey and silk also sometimes being used. Burlesque and vaudeville performers wore two-piece outfits in the 1920s. The 1929 film Man with a Movie Camera shows Russian women wearing early two-piece swimsuits which expose their midriff, and a few who are topless. Films of holidaymakers in Germany in the 1930s show women wearing two-piece suits. Actress Dolores del Río was the first major star to wear a two-piece women's bathing suit onscreen in Flying Down to Rio (1933).\n\n\nNecklines and midriff\n\nBy the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away and tightened. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.\nThe 1934 film Fashions of 1934 featured chorus girls wearing two-piece outfits which look identical to modern bikinis. In 1934, a National Recreation Association study on the use of leisure time found that swimming, encouraged by the freedom of movement the new swimwear designs provided, was second only to movies in popularity as free time activity out of a list of 94 activities. In 1935 American designer Claire McCardell cut out the side panels of a maillot-style bathing suit, the bikini's forerunner. The 1938 invention of the Telescopic Watersuit in shirred elastic cotton ushered into the end the era of wool. Cotton sun-tops, printed with palm trees, and silk or rayon pyjamas, usually with a blouse top, became popular by 1939.\nWartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942 the United States  War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with bare midriffs. In the summer of 1941 Rita Hayworth was on the cover of Life sitting on the beach in a white Halterneck two-piece with a bared midriff although her navel remained covered.\n\n\nPostwar\n\nFabric shortage continued for some time after the end of the war. Two-piece swimsuits without the usual skirt panel and other excess material started appearing in the US when the government ordered a 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing. By that time, two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. The July 9, 1945, Life shows women in Paris wearing similar items. Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear. Pin ups of Hayworth and Esther Williams in the costume were widely distributed. The most provocative swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy, a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces. What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large cork buckle attached to the bottoms, which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around au naturel while keeping both parts of the suit afloat. Life magazine had a photo essay on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote, \"The name of the suit, of course, suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable.\"\nAmerican designer Adele Simpson, a Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards winner (1947) and a notable alumna of the New York art school Pratt Institute, who believed clothes must be comfortable and practical, designed a large part of her swimwear line with one-piece suits that were considered fashionable even in the early 1980s. This was when Cole of California started marketing revealing prohibition suits and Catalina Swimwear introduced almost bare-back designs. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public. Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as Neptune's Daughter (1949) in which Esther Williams wore provocatively named costumes such as \"Double Entendre\" and \"Honey Child\". Williams, who also was an Amateur Athletic Union champion in the 100 meter freestyle (1939) and an Olympics swimming finalist (1940), also portrayed Kellerman in the 1952 film Million Dollar Mermaid (titled as The One Piece Bathing Suit in UK).\nSwimwear of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s followed the silhouette mostly from the early 1930s. Keeping in line with the ultra-feminine look dominated by Dior, it evolved into a dress with cinched waists and constructed bustlines, accessorized with earrings, bracelets, hats, scarves, sunglasses, hand bags and cover-ups. Many of these pre-bikinis had fancy names like Double Entendre, Honey Child (to maximize small bosoms), Shipshape (to minimize large bosoms), Diamond Lil (trimmed with rhinestones and lace), Swimming In Mink (trimmed with fur across the bodice) and Spearfisherman (heavy poplin with a rope belt for carrying a knife), Beau Catcher, Leading Lady, Pretty Foxy, Side Issue, Forecast, and Fabulous Fit. According to Vogue the swimwear had become more of \"state of dress, not undress\" by the mid-1950s.\n\n\nThe modern bikini\n\nFrench fashion designer Jacques Heim, who owned a beach shop in the French Riviera resort town of Cannes, introduced a minimalist two-piece design in May 1946 which he named the \"Atome\", after the smallest known particle of matter. The bottom of his design was just large enough to cover the wearer's navel.\nAt the same time, Louis Réard, a French automotive and mechanical engineer, was running his mother's lingerie business near the Folies Bergère in Paris. He noticed women on St. Tropez beaches rolling up the edges of their swimsuits to get a better tan  and was inspired to produce a more minimal design. He trimmed additional fabric off the bottom of the swimsuit, exposing the wearer's navel for the first time. Réard's string bikini consisted of four triangles made from 30 square inches (194 cm2) of fabric printed with a newspaper pattern.\nWhen Réard sought a model to wear his design at his press conference, none of the usual models would wear the suit, so he hired 19 year old nude dancer Micheline Bernardini from the Casino de Paris.  He introduced his design to the media and public on July 5, 1946, in Paris at Piscine Molitor, a public pool in Paris. Réard held the press conference five days after the first test of a nuclear device (nicknamed Able) over the Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads. His swimsuit design shocked the press and public because it was the first to reveal the wearer's navel.\nTo promote his new design, Heim hired skywriters to fly above the Mediterranean resort advertising the Atome as \"the world's smallest bathing suit.\" Not to be outdone by Heim, Réard hired his own skywriters three weeks later to fly over the French Riviera advertising his design as \"smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world.\"\nHeim's design was the first to be worn on the beach, but the name given by Réard stuck with the public. Despite significant social resistance, Réard received more than 50,000 letters from fans. He also initiated a bold ad campaign that told the public a two-piece swimsuit was not a genuine bikini \"unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring.\" According to Kevin Jones, curator and fashion historian at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, \"Réard was ahead of his time by about 15 to 20 years. Only women in the vanguard, mostly upper-class European women embraced it.\"\nAfter actress Brigitte Bardot gained international attention in 1953 as the bikini girl of the French Riviera, Paparazzi popularized revealing accidents or staged events with women's swimwear throughout the decade. For one of many instances, a cheesecake photo of rising starlet Daliah Lavi adjusting her bikini after it broke while at a Rio de Janeiro swimming pool was widely circulated by Associated Press in 1959.\n\n\nSocial resistance\n\nBikini sales did not pick up around the world as women stuck to traditional two-piece swimsuits. Réard went back to designing conventional knickers to sell in his mother's shop. According to Kevin Jones, curator and fashion historian at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, \"Réard was ahead of his time by about 15 to 20 years. Only women in the vanguard, mostly upper-class European women embraced it, just like the upper-class European women who first cast off their corsets after World War I.\" It was banned in the French Atlantic coastline, Spain, Belgium and Italy, three countries neighboring France, as well as Portugal and Australia, and it was prohibited in some US states, and discouraged in others.\nIn 1951, the first Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was organized by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains the first and last Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.\nIn 1950, Time magazine interviewed American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of Cole of California, and reported that he had \"little but scorn for France's famed Bikinis,\" because they were designed for \"diminutive Gallic women\". \"French girls have short legs,\" he explained. \"Swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer.\" Réard himself described it as a two-piece bathing suit which \"reveals everything about a girl except for her mother's maiden name.\" Even Esther Williams commented, \"A bikini is a thoughtless act.\" But, popularity of the charms of Pin-up queen and Hollywood star Williams were to vanish along with pre-bikinis with fancy names over the next few decades. Australian designer Paula Straford introduced the bikini to the Gold Coast in 1952, where it was banned until 1959. In 1957, Das moderne Mädchen (The Modern Girl) wrote, \"It is unthinkable that a decent girl with tact would ever wear such a thing.\" Eight years later a Munich student was punished with six days cleaning work at an old people's home because she had strolled across the central Viktualienmarkt square, Munich in a bikini.\n\n\nThe Cannes connection\nDespite the controversy, some in France admired \"naughty girls who decorate our sun-drenched beaches\". Brigitte Bardot, photographed wearing similar garments on beaches during the Cannes Film Festival (1953) helped popularize the bikini in Europe in the 1950s and created a market in the US. Photographs of Bardot in a bikini, according to The Guardian, turned Saint-Tropez into the bikini capital of the world. Cannes played a crucial role in the career of Brigitte Bardot, who in turn played a crucial role in promoting the Festival, largely by starting the trend of being photographed in a bikini at her first appearance at the festival, with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty. In 1952, she wore a bikini in Manina, the Girl in the Bikini (1952) (released in France as Manina, la fille sans voiles), a film which drew considerable attention due to her scanty swimsuit. During the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, she worked with her husband and agent Roger Vadim, and garnered a lot of attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.\nLike Esther Williams did a decade earlier, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot all used revealing swimwears as career props to enhance their sex appeal, and it became more accepted in parts of Europe when worn by fifties \"love goddess\" actresses such as Bardot, Anita Ekberg and Sophia Loren. British actress Diana Dors had a mink bikini made for her during the 1955 Venice Film Festival and wore it riding in a gondola down Venice's Grand Canal past St. Mark's Square.\nIn Spain, Benidorm played a similar role as Cannes. Shortly after the bikini was banned in Spain, Pedro Zaragoza, the mayor of Benidorm convinced dictator Francisco Franco that his town needed to legalize the bikini to draw tourists. In 1959, General Franco agreed and the town became a popular tourist destination. In less than four years since Franco's death in 1979, Spanish beaches and women had gone topless.\n\n\nLegal and moral resistance\n\nThe swimsuit was banned in Spain, Portugal and Italy, three countries neighboring France, as well as Belgium and Australia, and it remained prohibited in many US states. As late as in 1959, Anne Cole, a US swimsuit designer and daughter of Fred Cole, said about a Bardot bikini, \"It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency.\" In July that year the New York Post searched for bikinis around New York City and found only a couple. Writer Meredith Hall wrote in her memoir that until 1965 one could get a citation for wearing a bikini in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire.\nIn 1951, the first Miss World contest, originally the Festival Bikini Contest, was organized by Eric Morley as a mid-century advertisement for swimwear at the Festival of Britain. The press welcomed the spectacle and referred to it as Miss World, and Morley registered the name as a trademark. When, the winner Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. The bikinis were outlawed and evening gowns introduced instead. Håkansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini, a crowning that was condemned by the Pope. Bikini was banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. Catholic-majority countries like  Belgium, Italy, Spain and Australia also banned the swimsuit that same year.\nThe National Legion of Decency pressured Hollywood to keep bikinis from being featured in Hollywood movies. The Hays production code for US movies, introduced in 1930 but not strictly enforced until 1934, allowed two-piece gowns but prohibited navels on screen. But between the introduction and enforcement of the code two Tarzan movies, Tarzan, the Ape Man (1932) and Tarzan and His Mate (1934), were released in which actress Maureen O'Sullivan wore skimpy bikini-like leather outfits. Film historian Bruce Goldstein described her clothes in the first film as \"It's a loincloth open up the side. You can see loin.\" All at Sea (a.k.a. Barnacle Bill) was allowed in the US in 1957 after all bikini-type clothes were removed from the film. The Girl in the Bikini was allowed in Kansas after all the bikini close ups were removed from the film in 1959.\nIn reaction to the introduction of the bikini in Paris, American swimwear manufacturers compromised cautiously by producing their own similar design that included a halter and a midriff-bottom variation. Though size makes all the difference in a bikini, early bikinis often covered the navel. When the navel showed in pictures, it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen. Navel-less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts. By the end of the decade a vogue for strapless styles developed, wired or bound for firmness and fit, along with a taste for bare-shouldered two-pieces called Little Sinners but it was the halterneck bikini that caused the most moral controversy because of its degree of exposure. So much so as bikini designs called \"Huba Huba\" and \"Revealation\" were withdrawn from fashion parades in Sydney as immodest.\n\n\nRise to popularity\n\nThe appearance of bikinis kept increasing both on screen and off. The sex appeal prompted film and television productions, including Dr. Strangelove. They include the surf movies of the early 1960s. In 1960, Brian Hyland's song \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\" inspired a bikini-buying spree. By 1963, the movie Beach Party, starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, followed by Muscle Beach Party (1964), Bikini Beach (1964),  and Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) that depicted teenage girls wearing bikinis, frolicking in the sand with boys, and having a great time.\nThe beach films led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol. In the sexual revolution in 1960s America, bikinis became quickly popular. Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida, and Jane Russell helped further the growing popularity of bikinis. Pin-up posters of Monroe, Mansfield, Hayworth, Bardot and Raquel Welch also contributed significantly to its increasing popularity. In 1962, Playboy featured a bikini on its cover for the first time. Two years later, Sports Illustrated featured Berlin-born fashion model Babette March on the cover wearing a white bikini. The issue was the first Swimsuit Issue. It has been credited with giving the bikini legitimacy, and it became an annual publication and an American pop-culture staple, and sells millions of copies each year. In 1965, a woman told Time it was \"almost square\" not to wear one. In 1967 the magazine wrote that 65% of \"the young set\" were wearing bikinis.\nWhen Jayne Mansfield and her husband Miklós Hargitay toured for stage shows, newspapers wrote that Mansfield convinced the rural population that she owned more bikinis than anyone. She showed a fair amount of her 40-inch (1,000 mm) bust, as well as her midriff and legs, in the leopard-spot bikini she wore for her stage shows.  Kathryn Wexler of The Miami Herald wrote, \"In the beginning as we know it, there was Jayne Mansfield. Here she preens in leopard-print or striped bikinis, sucking in air to showcase her well noted physical assets.\" Her leopard-skin bikini remains one of the earlier specimens of the fashion.\n\nIn 1962, Bond Girl Ursula Andress emerged from the sea wearing a white bikini in Dr. No. The  scene has been named one of the most memorable of the series. Channel 4 declared it the top bikini moment in film history, Virgin Media puts it ninth in its top ten, and top in the Bond girls. The Herald (Glasgow) put the scene as best ever on the basis of a poll. It also helped shape the career of Ursula Andress, and the look of the quintessential Bond movie. Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini, remarking, \"This bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in Dr. No as the first Bond girl, I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent.\" In 2001, the Dr. No bikini worn by Andress in the film sold at auction for US$61,500. That white bikini has been described as a \"defining moment in the sixties liberalization of screen eroticism\".  Because of the shocking effect from how revealing it was at the time, she got referred to by the joke nickname \"Ursula Undress\". According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, \"So iconic was the look that it was repeated 40 years later by Halle Berry in the Bond movie Die Another Day.\"\nRaquel Welch's fur bikini in One Million Years B.C. (1966) gave the world the most iconic bikini shot of all time and the poster image became an iconic moment in cinema history. The poster image of the deer skin bikini in One Million Years B.C. made her an instant pin-up girl. Welch was featured in the studio's advertising as \"wearing mankind's first bikini\" and the bikini was later  described as a \"definitive look of the 1960s\". Her role wearing the leather bikini raised Welch to a fashion icon and the photo of her in the bikini became a best-selling pinup poster. One author said, \"although she had only three lines in the film, her luscious figure in a fur bikini made her a star and the dream girl of millions of young moviegoers\".  In 2011, Time listed Welch's B.C.  bikini in the \"Top Ten Bikinis in Pop Culture\".\nIn the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, Star Wars' Princess Leia Organa was captured by Jabba the Hutt and forced to wear a metal bikini complete with shackles. The costume was made of brass and was so uncomfortable that actress Carrie Fisher described it as \"what supermodels will eventually wear in the seventh ring of hell.\" The \"slave Leia\" look is often imitated by female fans at Star Wars  conventions. In 1997, 51 years after the bikini's debut, and 77 years after the Miss America Pageant was founded, contestants were allowed wear two-piece swimsuits, not just the swimsuits (nicknamed \"bulletproof vests\") traditionally issued by the pageant. Two of the 17 swimsuit finalists wore two-piece swimsuits, and Erika Kauffman,  representing Hawaii, wore the briefest bikini of all and won the swimsuit competition. In 2010, the International Federation of Bodybuilders recognized Bikini as a new competitive category.\n\n\nIn India\nBollywood actress Sharmila Tagore appeared in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through a reversal of the state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini but, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.\n\n\nAcceptance\n\nIn France, Réard's company folded in 1988, four years after his death.\nBy that year the bikini made up nearly 20% of swimsuit sales, more than any other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe \"-kini family\" (as dubbed by author William Safire), including the \"-ini sisters\" (as dubbed by designer Anne Cole) has grown to include a large number of subsequent variations, often with a hilarious lexicon — string bikini, monokini or numokini (top part missing), seekini (transparent bikini), tankini (tank top, bikini bottom), camikini (camisole top and bikini bottom), hikini, thong, slingshot, minimini, teardrop, and micro. In just one major fashion show in 1985, there  were two-piece suits with cropped tank tops instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that are bikinis in front and one-piece behind, suspender straps, ruffles, and daring, navel-baring cutouts. To meet the fast changing tastes, some of the manufacturers have made a business out of making made-to-order bikinis in around seven minutes. The world's most expensive bikini, made up of over 150 carats (30 g) of flawless diamonds and worth a massive £20 million, was designed in February 2006 by Susan Rosen.\nActresses in action films like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and Blue Crush (2002) have made the two-piece \"the millennial equivalent of the power suit\", according to Gina Bellafonte of The New York Times, On September 9, 1997, Miss Maryland Jamie Fox was the first contestant in 50 years to compete in a two-piece swimsuit to compete in the Preliminary Swimsuit Competition at the Miss America Pageant. PETA used celebrities like Pamela Anderson, Traci Bingham and Alicia Mayer wearing a bikini made of iceberg-lettuce for an advertisement campaign to promote vegetarianism. A protester from Columbia University used a bikini as a message board against a New York City visit by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nBy the end of the century, the bikini went on to become the most popular beachwear around the globe, according to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard due to \"the power of women, and not the power of fashion\". As he explains, \"The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women\", though one survey tells 85% of all bikinis never touch the water. According to Beth Dincuff Charleston, research associate at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, \"The bikini represents a social leap involving body consciousness, moral concerns, and sexual attitudes.\" By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, according to the NPD Group, a consumer and retail information company. The bikini has boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries.\n\n\nContinued controversies\nThe bikini remained a popular topic for the news media. In May 2011, a council by-law in Barcelona, Spain made it illegal to wear bikinis in public except in areas near the beaches. Violators faced fines of between 120 and 300 euros. In 2012, two students of St. Theresa's College in Cebu, the Philippines, were barred from attending their graduation ceremony for \"ample body exposure\" because their bikini pictures were posted on Facebook. The students sued the college and won a temporary stay in a regional court.\nIn May 2013, Cambridge University banned the Wyverns Club of Magdalene College from arranging its annual bikini jelly wrestling contest. In June 2013, actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also is interested in fashion, produced a bikini for her clothing line that is designed to be worn by girls 4 to 8 years old. She was criticized for sexualizing young children by Claude Knight of Kidscape, a British foundation that strives to prevent child abuse. He commented, \"We remain very opposed to the sexualisation of children and of childhood ... is a great pity that such trends continue and that they carry celebrity endorsement.\"\nFour women were arrested over the 2013 Memorial Day weekend in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for indecent exposure when they wore thong bikinis that exposed their buttocks. In June 2013, a commercial that included Pamela Anderson dancing in a bikini was banned by the British Advertising Standards Authority for degrading women. Anderson played an office worker who became the subject of a sexual fantasy of one of her male colleagues. In 2002, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch came under criticism for selling child-sized thong bikinis and underwear.\n\n\nSee also\n\nBikini in popular culture\nBikini variants\nHistory of swimwear\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Bikini Timeline\", Los Angeles Times\nBikini Science – A Comprehensive History of the Bikini and Species of Swimwear\nCole of California and history of the bikini",
    "summary": "Evidence of bikini-style women's clothing has been found as early as 5600 BC, and the history of the bikini can be traced back to that era. Illustrations of women wearing bikini-like garments during competitive athletic events in the Roman era have been found in several locations, the most famous of which is at Villa Romana del Casale.\nAlthough two-piece bathing suits were being used by women as early as the 1930s, the modern bikini is dated to July 5, 1946, when, partly due to material rationing after World War II, French engineer Louis Réard introduced the modern bikini, modeled by Micheline Bernardini. Réard named his design after the Bikini Atoll, where the first post-war tests of the atomic bomb were taking place.\nFrench women welcomed the design but the Catholic Church, some media, and a majority of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant wore them in 1951, but the bikini was then banned from the competition. Actress Brigitte Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses, including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, also received press attention when they wore bikinis. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated, credited with giving it additional legitimacy. Ursula Andress made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962). The deer skin bikini worn by Raquel Welch in the film One Million Years B.C. (1966) turned her into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s.\nThe bikini gradually grew to gain wide acceptance in the Western world. According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, the bikini is perhaps the most popular type of female beachwear around the globe because of \"the power of women, and not the power of fashion\". As he explains, \"The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women.\" By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and sun tanning.",

    "text": "Ahmed Cevdet Pasha (22 March 1822 – 25 May 1895) was an Ottoman scholar, intellectual, bureaucrat, administrator, and historian who was a prominent figure in the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire. He was the head of the Mecelle commission that codified Islamic law for the first time in response to the Westernization of law. He is often regarded as a pioneer in the codification of a civil law based on the European legal system. The Mecelle remained intact in several modern Arab states in the early and mid-20th-century. In addition to Turkish, he was proficient in Arabic, Persian, French and Bulgarian. He wrote numerous books on history, law, grammar, linguistics, logic and astronomy.\n\n\nEarly life\nAhmed Cevdet Pasha was born in 1822 in Lofça, Ottoman Bulgaria, to a Turkish family. He came from the notable family of Yularkiranoglu that had served the state and the faith as military, administrative, and religious officials. It was his grandfather's, Hacı Ali Efendi, wish that Ahmed pursued a career in the religious, ilmiye, ranks. Ahmed was his original name; the name \"Cevdet\" (Jevdet) was given to him by his tutor Süleyman Fehim Efendi in 1843.\n\n\nEducation\nAhmed Cevdet began his education at a very early age. He started with his study of Arabic grammar from Hafız Ömer Efendi, who was the mufti of Lovech at the time. With his demonstrated rapid progress, Ahmed was soon introduced to the Islamic sciences. In 1836, he started reading with Hacı Esref Efendi, the deputy judge of Lovech who had a son that was Ahmed Cevdet's age. These two boys, who were both named Ahmed, went on to become famous as Ahmet Cevdet Pasha and Ahmed Midhat Pasha. So far, his elementary education had followed the traditional Muslim Ottoman pattern, being acquired through informal study with the local ulema.\nIn 1839, having finished primary school in Lofça, Ahmed's education took a more advanced turn. He moved to Istanbul, studied theology, mathematics, geology, and astronomy. He learned Arabic literature in several medreses, and received a diploma, icazet, which qualified him to serve in an Ilmiye position. Ahmed also studied Persian under Mehmed Murad Efendi (died 1848) and Süleyman Fehim Efendi, studying the divans of Orfi Shirazi and Showkat (died 1695/6). In 1844, Ahmed was granted the permission to teach the Masnavi of Rumi. Following the death of his tutor Süleyman Fehim Efendi in 1845, Ahmed completed a Turkish commentary for the Persian divan of Saib Tabrizi.\nAhmed also studied the mathematical sciences at the Imperial Military Engineering School (Hendesehâne). In addition, he developed an interest in the science of history as a study of the human experience by means of critical evaluation of the sources. He even went on to supplement his interests with studies of Islamic, French, and international law, before the age of 30.\n\n\nCareer beginnings\nAfter graduation, Ahmed made a contact that would fundamentally alter the rest of his career, Mustafa Reşid Pasha, who was about to enter his first term as grand vizier. Mustafa Reşid was seeking a member of the ulema that could teach him enough about Islamic religious law so that he could avoid immediate open conflict when introducing reforms. He also needed someone who was open-minded and willing to discuss problems. Ahmed Cevdet was assigned to Mustafa's house, where he tutored Mustafa and his children and stayed at this position until his patron's death in 1858. Ahmed Cevdet's new association with leaders of the Tanzimat exposed him to novel influences and ideas that drew him into the world of bureaucracy and politics. Even though Ahmed retained his connection with the ulema until 1866, he primarily functioned as a bureaucrat, taking a prominent role in education, language, and provincial reform.\nIn 1850–51, Mustafa Reşid appointed Cevdet as director of a school established to train teachers for the new secular school system. Ahmed also became chief scribe to the Council on Education, which would prepare new laws and regulations for the secular schools. His career as a historian began in 1852 with the Society of Knowledge. He was assigned to compile a history of the Ottoman Empire from the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca to the destruction of the Janissary corps, so from 1774-1826. Ahmed also served as state chronicler from 1855 to 1861. Finally in 1856, he achieved his first Ilmiye position, becoming kadı (judge) of Galata, in addition to his secular duties.\n\n\nTanzimat period\n\n\nMember of the Council of the Tanzimat\nWhen Mustafa Reşid rose to his sixth term as grand vizier, he made Ahmed a member of the Council of the Tanzimat. The Council was established to codify the actions sanctioned by the Tanzimat reforms. Ahmed played a prominent role in preparing laws, virtually writing the new regulations on landownership and cadastral surveys. His role as a member of Council of the Tanzimat also influenced his history projects. He abandoned the old annalistic approach for one emphasizing problems and topics, with an increasingly critical examination of the sources. Additionally, Ahmed was the principal author of the regulation that created the new Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances, of which he became a member, in place of the Council of the Tanzimat in 1861.\nAhmed Cevdet recognized that military and administrative reforms were necessary, but being a conservative, was reluctant to use European law as an example, opting for Islamic law. His proposed answer was two-fold. The first step was to appeal to traditional values of improving education and communication. The second part involved creating conditions which would eliminate corruption and increase efficiency, while preserving the fundamental political and social concepts upon which the Ottoman Empire was based. His attempts at reconciling modernization with Islamic law are most notably present in his drafting of the Mecelle.\n\n\nOther offices\nIn the 1860s, Ahmed Cevdet officially transferred from the Ilmiye to the Scribal Institution.\nIn 1861, he was sent as a special agent to Albania to suppress revolts and develop a new administrative system. It was rumored that Ahmed would become vizier then, but he was denied of this honor due to strong opposition among the ulema. They resented his enlightened and liberal interpretation of religious matters. As a result, Mehmed Fuad Pasha became vizier and Ahmed Cevdet become the inspector general in Bosnia from 1863 to 1864. There, he extended Tanzimat reforms, despite opposition from the Habsburgs and Slavic national groups. This identified him as a leading provincial troubleshooter. Living up to this role, Ahmed attempted to settle the nomadic tribes and establish order in Kozan, located in southeastern Anatolia, in 1865. Finally in 1866, his transfer to the Scribal Institution was official and he was able to accept regular administrative positions. Ahmed became governor of Aleppo Eyalet, which was formed to apply recent Tanzimat provincial reforms introduced by Fuad, the Grand Vizier.\n\n\nNotable contributions\n\n\nSupreme Council of Judicial Ordinances\nIn 1868, the Supreme Council was divided into separate legislative and judicial bodies, and Ahmed was appointed chairman of the judicial branch. He subsequently became the first Minister of Justice and wrote major pieces of legislation, which established the beginnings of a secular Nizamiye court system in the Empire for the first time. In addition to this, Ahmed Cevdet led an opposition group against Mehmed Emin Ali Pasha's desire to introduce an entirely secular, French-inspired civil law for the court system. He convinced the sultan that the new civil code should be based on principles derived from Islamic law, modernized to meet the current situation. Ahmed served as chairman of the commission established to create this new law code, Mecelle.\n\n\nMecelle\nThe Mecelle, Islamic Code, was the new Ottoman civil law code proposed by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha for the newly established secular court system. It was based on traditional Islamic law, but also included many important modifications with the idea of updating the sharia according to the requirements of the time. It was the code that prevailed against Ali Pasha's push for the application of French Civil Law. The Mecelle combined Civil law with Islamic Law of Obligations in a final product consisting of 1,851 articles. This arduous task occupied Ahmed Cevdet until the last volume was published in 1876, for a total of about 16 years. It was the first systematic compilation incorporating both Islamic Law and Civil Law.\nThe Mecelle could not completely curtail the penetration of Western law in Ottoman society, but it was an important compromise to the demand for a standard law and for a fundamental change in the structure of Islamic legal system. Codification and enactment of Islamic law were essential for the proper functioning of a modern bureaucracy. The Mecelle's approach acknowledges the importance of social change and reflects the traditional attitude towards such change. For example, according to ulema, social change was acceptable unless it \"contradicted the general norms.\" This careful consideration for upholding the general norms in order to receive the support from the ulema was seen in the articles. They primarily consisted of provisions on Law of Obligations, but also include provisions on real rights and trail procedure laws. However, the articles did not incorporate law on persons, foundations, family, or inheritance, so the Mecelle is not a true compilation of civil law. Studies were launched in 1914 in order to correct the discrepancies, but could not be completed due to World War I.\n\n\nLater years and death\n\n\nMinisterial positions\nDuring the last two decades of his life, Ahmed Cevdet Pasha mainly served in ministerial positions, such as education and justice. In 1873 and 1874, he became Minister of Pious Foundations and Minister of Education, respectively. He undertook major changes in the secular system of education that had been introduced. This included reforming the elementary and middle schools, establishing a new level of preparatory schools for students wishing to go on to secondary and technical schools, and expanding teacher-training schools. While all of this was happening, efforts were made to depose Abdülaziz to secure a constitution. Ahmed opposed the idea but also opposed the government of Mahmud Nedim. As a result, he was disliked by constitutionalists and sent out of Istanbul. The grand vizier occupied Ahmed by making him inspector general to Rumelia and then governor of Syria for a year. Ahmet Cevdet Pasha's relative conservatism and experience in the ulema left him inimical towards the reformers who deposed Abdülaziz and promulgated the 1876 Ottoman constitution. However, Abdulhamid II succeeded Murad V in 1876 and soon began to dismantle the newborn First Constitutional Era in favor of a return to absolute monarchy with himself holding sole power. He succeeded in this in 1878, suspending the Ottoman parliament and the constitution. Ahmed Cevdet Pasha was close to Abdulhamid, serving as Minister of Justice in 1876, Minister of the Interior in 1877, Minister of Pious Foundations in 1878, Minister of commerce in 1879, and Minister of Justice again from 1880 to 1882.\n\n\nDeath\nAhmed Cevdet retired from public office for a couple of years in order to educate his daughters, Fatma Aliye and Emine Semiye, and to finish his book of Ottoman history, now known as Tarih-i Cevdet (\"History of Cevdet Pasha\"). He also completed two other historical compilations, Tezakir (\"Memoirs\") and Maruzat. In 1886, he returned as Minister of Justice, but resigned four years later due to quarrels with Prime Minister (Grand Vizier) Yusuf Kamil Pasha. From that point on, Ahmed Cevdet Pasha acted as an elder statesman until his death in Constantinople on 25 May 1895. He is buried in the graveyard of the Fatih Mosque.\n\n\nChildren\nAhmed Cevdet had three children, a son, Ali Sedat (1857–1900), and two daughters. His daughters went on to become prominent figures of late Ottoman and early Turkish history. One daughter Fatma Aliye Topuz (1862–1936) is credited as the first female writer in Turkish literature. His other daughter Emine Semiye Önasya (1864–1944) was one of the first Turkish feminists and a political activist for women in the late Empire and early Republic.\n\n\nSee also\nTurks in Bulgaria\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nÖzgüdenli, Osman G.

    "text": "Ottaviano Fregoso (born in Genoa, 1470 - died in Ischia, 1524) was the Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\n\nBiography\nOttaviano Fregoso, was the son of Agostino Fregoso and Gentile di Montefeltro, daughter of the renowned condottiero, patron of humanists, and book collector, Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. Ottaviano was born in Genoa, but, like his brother, the future cardinal, Federigo, spent much of his youth at the court of Urbino, presided over by their uncle, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro. There the brothers received a classical humanistic education and were the companions and close friends of such humanists as Pietro Bembo and Baldassare Castiglione and the painter Raphael. Ottaviano and Federigo Fregoso are participants in the fictional discussion presided over by  Elisabetta Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, in Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, which was supposed to have taken place at the court of Urbino in 1507. In the dialog, both brothers, who themselves (like the other interlocutors in the discussion), are supposed to embody the Italian Renaissance ideal of courtly behavior in an ideal court, are depicted as defending a republican form of government.\nBeginning in 1497, Ottaviano participated in an alliance with King Charles VII of France, in order to expel the Sforza family from Genoa. In the early 1500s, he also defended his uncle's duchy of Urbino against Cesare Borgia, known as Valentino, the son of Pope Alexander VI. In the course of this war, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, was forced to destroy several fortresses rather than cede them to the enemy.\nIn 1506 Guidobaldo conferred on Ottaviano the lordship of Sant'Agata Feltria, which was confirmed in 1513 by Pope Leo X.\nAlso in 1506, Ottaviano was sent to Bologna to recover for the Papal States the cities that had fallen into the hands of Giovanni Bentivoglio.\nSubsequently, Ottaviano returned to Genoa, where he and his cousin, Giano II Campofregoso, attempted to expel their former allies, the French. At that time the Fregoso (Guelph) and the Adorno (Ghibelline) families were engaged in a violent struggle for the supremacy of the city. These clashes culminated in 1510 with the victory of Adornos: the Fregoso faction was forced again into exile and again took refuge in Urbino.\nThree years later, the Fregosos turned the tables and defeated the Adornos, returning to Genoa, where in June 1513 Ottaviano became Doge. During his government he initiated important public works such as the modernization of the port of Genoa and the construction of the tower of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo.\nFor its times, Ottaviano's government displayed notable magnanimity towards its opponents, both those within his family, as with his cousin (and former ally against the French), Giano II Campofregoso, who plotted to take Ottaviano's place as Doge, and toward members of such traditionally hostile families as the Adorno and the Fieschi.\nAfter 1515, Ottaviano Fregoso was forced to acknowledge King Francis I of France, as his overlord; Francis, however, allowed Ottaviano to remain on as ruler of Genoa.\nIn 1520 Pope Leo X conferred on him the title of Count.\nWhen Spanish troops under Emperor Charles V sacked and occupied Genoa in 1522, Ottaviano was captured and imprisoned, first at Naples, then at Aversa, and then in the fortress of Ischia, where he died in 1524, according to some authors, by poisoning. After his death, the fief of S. Agatha was ruled, first by his brother, Cardinal Federigo Fregoso and then by his son Aurelio.\nTo this day, descendants of Ottaviano Fregoso are noted to reside in the United States, with the majority of them residing in the states of; CA, VA, NY, NV, and FL, with the majority of them residing in CA, VA and NY. Descendants noted; Immediate; Antonasio Fregoso, Robert Fregoso, Deborah Fregoso, Cynthia Fregoso, Bobby Fregoso, Charlotte Fregoso, Sean Fregoso, Elizabeth Fregoso, Skylar Fregoso, Jordan Fregoso, and Garrett Fregoso.\n\n\nAssessments\nContemporary historians and intellectuals remembered Ottaviano as a liberal and magnanimous prince, holding him up as a quintessential Renaissance gentleman and a pattern for rulers, as did Baldassare Castiglione who made him one of the interlocutors in The Book of the Courtier (1528). Francesco Guicciardini, in his History of Italy (1561) records him as \"certainly a prince of most excellent virtue, notable for his justice and other noble qualities, and as beloved in Genoa as any ruler could be in that city of factions, where the memory of their ancient liberties was not entirely extinguished in the minds of the citizenry.\"\n\n\nReferences\nGirolamo Serra, The history of ancient Liguria and Genoa, 1835.\nBaldassare Castiglione, The Book of the Courtier, 1528.\nFrancesco Guicciardini,  The History of Italy, 1561.\n\n\nNotes",

    "text": "Polymyxins are antibiotics. Polymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections.  They work mostly by breaking up the bacterial cell membrane.  They are part of a broader class of molecules called nonribosomal peptides.\nThey are produced in nature by Gram-positive bacteria such as Paenibacillus polymyxa.\n\n\nMedical use\nPolymyxin antibiotics are relatively neurotoxic and nephrotoxic, so are usually used only as a last resort if modern antibiotics are ineffective or are contraindicated. Typical uses are for infections caused by strains of multiple drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.  Polymyxins have less effect on Gram-positive organisms, and are sometimes combined with other agents (as with trimethoprim/polymyxin) to broaden the effective spectrum.\nPolymyxins B are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, so they are only administered orally if the goal is to disinfect the GI tract.  Another route of administration is chosen for systemic treatment, e.g., parenteral (often intravenously) or by inhalation.  They are also used externally as a cream or drops to treat otitis externa  (swimmers ear), and as a component of triple antibiotic ointment to treat and prevent skin infections.\n\n\nMechanism of action\nAfter binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, polymyxins disrupt both the outer and inner membranes. The hydrophobic tail is important in causing membrane damage, suggesting a detergent-like mode of action.\nRemoval of the hydrophobic tail of polymyxin B yields polymyxin nonapeptide, which still binds to LPS, but no longer kills the bacterial cell. However, it still detectably increases the permeability of the bacterial cell wall to other antibiotics, indicating that it still causes some degree of membrane disorganization.\nGram-negative bacteria can develop resistance to polymyxins through various modifications of the LPS structure that inhibit the binding of polymyxins to LPS.\nAntibiotic resistance to this drug has been increasing, especially in southern China.  Recently the gene mcr-1, which confers the antibiotic resistance, has been isolated from bacterial plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n\nChemistry\n\nPolymyxins are a group of cyclic non-ribosomal polypeptide (NRPs) which are biosynthesized by bacteria belonging to the genus Paenibacillus. Polymyxins consist of 10 amino acid residues, six of which are L-α,γ-diaminobutyric acid (L-DAB). The DAB residues cause polymyxins to have multiple positively charged groups at physiological pH. Seven amino acid residues form the main cyclic component, while the other three extend from one of the cyclic residues as a linear chain terminating in either 6-methyloctanoic acid or 6-methylheptanoic acid at the N-terminus. During cyclization, residue 10 is bound to the bridging residue 4. The amino acid residues and DAB monomers are generally in the L (levo) configuration, however certain strains such as P. polymyxa PKB1 have been observed to incorporate DAB with the D (dextro) configuration at position 3 producing variations of polymyxin B.\nPolymyxin M is also known as \"mattacin\".\n\n\nBiosynthesis\n\nThe polymyxins are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems in Gram-positive bacteria such as Paenibacillus polymyxa.  Like other NRPs, polymyxins are assembled by synthetases with multiple modules, each containing a set of enzyme domains that sequentially operate on the growing chain by adding the next residue and extending the chain through peptide-bond formation and condensation reactions. The final steps involve a thioesterase domain at the C-terminal of the last module to cyclize the molecule and liberate the chain from the enzyme.\n\n\nResearch\nPolymyxins are used to neutralize or absorb LPS contaminants in samples, for example in immunological experiments. Minimization of LPS contamination can be important because LPS can evoke strong reactions from immune cells, distorting experimental results.\nBy increasing permeability of the bacterial membrane system, polymyxin is also used in clinical work to increase the release of secreted toxins, such as Shiga toxin, from Escherichia coli.\nThe global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in their use.\n\n\nCompound mixtures in Polymyxin B drug\nIn formulations for the commercial pharmaceutical Polymyxin drug, the principal Polymyxins are B1 and B2, amounting to 75% and 15% of the final mixture, respectively. Polymyxin B1, in turn, comprises several isomers, like isoleucine-polymyxin B1 and B1-1. The major impediment in the purification and isolation of one isomer is due to the minimal structural differences between Polymyxin B1 and B2, differing only in one carbon at the 6th position of the fatty acyl side chain linked to the D-Phenylalanine of the structure. Polymyxin B1 contains 6-methyl octanoic acid, while Polymyxin B2 contains 6-methyl heptanoic acid. Similarly, Polymyxins B3 and B4 also differ at this position, with B3 containing octanoic acid and B4 featuring heptanoic acid.\n\n\nSee also\nPolysporin\nNeosporin\nLysis\n\n\nReferences",

Mauser in Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment and Police Academy 3: Back in Training.\n\n\nCareer\n\nMetrano's film debut was as a truck driver in the 1961 Cold War thriller Rocket Attack U.S.A..  Among Metrano's TV appearances were a 1968 episode of Ironside, a 1970 episode of Bewitched, a 1976 episode of The Practice, and  The Streets of San Francisco.  In 1977, he was a regular in the cast of the short-lived CBS situation comedy Loves Me, Loves Me Not.\nHe also frequently appeared on talk and variety shows in the early 1970s, especially The Tonight Show, as The Great Metrano, a \"magician\" who performed absurd tricks, such as making his fingers \"jump\" from one hand to another, while constantly humming an inane theme song – \"Fine and Dandy\", an early 1930s composition by Kay Swift. \nHis best-known role came in 1985 as Lt./Capt./Cmdt. Mauser in Police Academy 2.  He reprised the role in its sequel Police Academy 3 a year later.\nAfter injuring his spine in 1989, Metrano's on-screen appearances became limited during his rehabilitation.  He did, however, return to television a year later and continued making guest appearances and small roles until retiring from acting in 2001.  Between 1993 and 2001, Metrano infrequently toured a one-man show titled \"Jews Don't Belong on Ladders...An Accidental Comedy\", which has raised more than $75,000 for Project Support for Spinal Cord Injury, to help buy crutches, wheelchairs, and supplies for disabled people.  After a final limited set of shows in 2008, Metrano retired.\nIn December 2007, Metrano sued Seth MacFarlane, the producers and studio behind the television show Family Guy, asserting copyright infringement, and asking for damages of over two million dollars. The suit pertained to a \"cutaway\" segment from the 2005 episode Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, where Stewie alludes to the miracles of Jesus Christ being \"exaggerated a bit.\"  The cutaway shows Jesus performing to a group of awed onlookers while doing Metrano's act: making his fingers jump between hands while humming \"Fine and Dandy\". The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.\n\n\nPersonal life\nOriginally from Brooklyn, New York City, Metrano lived in Aventura, Florida, with his second wife Jamie Golder. He had four children. He was born to a Turkish Jewish father and a Greek Jewish mother. Following his retirement from acting, Metrano owned a yogurt shop.\nOn September 17, 1989, Metrano broke his neck and seriously injured his spinal cord after falling off a ladder while working on his house. Initially a quadriplegic, he later regained the use of his arms and legs, and was able to walk short distances with the help of crutches, although he regularly used a motorized wheelchair.\n\n\nDeath\nMetrano died of natural causes on September 8, 2021, at his home in Aventura, Florida at the age of 84.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\nPfefferman, Naomi.\"Shining Solo Turns: Theater Roundup: Metrano, Connor Tell Their Stories\".

In 2010, his album Jungle Gym was nominated in the \"Best Musical Album for Children\" category for the 53rd Grammy Awards, Recess was nominated in the same Grammy category in 2013, for the 56th Grammy Awards, and \"Lemonade\" was nominated in 2017 for the 60th Grammy Awards.\nJustin Roberts released a Greatest Hits album in August 2016, and his new album of acoustic original songs, featuring guest Robbie Fulks, was released in October 2016.\n\n\nHistory\nRoberts was born in Des Moines, Iowa. As a child, he sang in choruses and had an early love of music. Roberts attended Kenyon College at Gambier, Ohio, where he was a member of the Kokosingers, the college's male a cappella group. He formed the indie-folk band Pimentos For Gus with Mike Merz and Tracy Spuehler at Kenyon when he was a freshman in 1988. In 1992, the three members graduated from Kenyon and moved to Minneapolis, where they gained moderate popularity in the Minneapolis indie music scene of the 1990s. Roberts began a second job as a Montessori preschool teacher, and it was here where he learned his love of children's music. He wrote and performed his first children's songs for the preschool students. When Pimentos For Gus broke up in 1996, he moved to Chicago to attend graduate school, where he was a religious studies major. In December 1996, Roberts sent Liam Davis a tape of original children's songs as a Christmas present. He didn't think much of them, but Davis wanted to record them. In 1997, Roberts quit graduate school to instead focus on children's music and record his first album, Great Big Sun.\nHe graduated in 1992. He began his music career in the Minneapolis-based indie-rock band Pimentos for Gus, of which he was a founding member. Pimentos for Gus released three separate albums in the 1990s. Roberts decided to moonlight (during the day) as a Montessori preschool teacher. It wasn't long before Roberts began writing and singing songs for a new generation of fans: his students. The kids immediately responded and inspired Roberts to record some of his new songs and send them out to a few friends for Christmas. One of the gift recipients was Liam Davis, a college pal and music producer, who suggested that they record the songs professionally.\nIn 1997, Roberts released his first CD, Great Big Sun, and the critics took note. Roberts' music was soon being compared to everyone from Elvis Costello and Fountains of Wayne to Paul Simon, Electric Light Orchestra and Nick Lowe. By 2001, Roberts was playing music full-time to appreciative crowds. Word spread and shows started selling out. He has played at such renowned venues and festivals as NYC's Symphony Space, DC's National Geographic Live, Los Angeles' Getty Museum, Seattle's Moore Theatre, Lollapalooza and Chicago's Ravinia Festival.\n\n\nDiscography\nWith Pimentos For Gus\n\nMusica Psycoustica (1993)\nThe 17-Minute Workout EP (1995)\nEast of Sweden (1996)\nAs solo artist\n\nBright Becomes Blue (1999)\nChildren's albums\n\nGreat Big Sun (1997)\nYellow Bus (2001)\nNot Naptime (2003)\nWay Out (2004)\nWhy Not Sea Monsters?

Internationally Riazantsev played for the Russian national team at the 2005 World Championship, winning a bronze medal.\n\n\nPlaying career\nOriginally drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in 1998, Riazantsev spent parts of five seasons playing for the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League before returning to Russia in 2003, where he played until his retirement.\nIn January 2012, Riazantsev took a shot in a skills competition that measured a speed of 114.1 miles per hour. It is considered by KHL officials to be the hardest shot ever recorded. The National Hockey League does not recognize this feat, as the puck travels a shorter distance to the goal net in KHL competitions than in those of the NHL.\nOn May 5, 2012, Riazantsev joined his seventh club in just five seasons, signing a two-year contract as a free agent with the Severstal Cherepovets starting from the 2012–13 season. During the season, Riazantsev scored 9 goals from the Blueline and contributed with 20 points.\nOn June 11, 2013, Riazantsev was traded by Severstal to return to his original club, Spartak Moscow, in exchange for Nicholas Bushuev.\nOn October 4, 2014, Riazantsev continued his journeyman career when he was traded after only 8 games in the 2014–15 season with HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk to Amur Khabarovsk.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Eurohockey.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

    "text": "Belgium–Congo relations refers to relations between the Kingdom of Belgium and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The relationship started with the exploration of the Congo River by Henry Morton Stanley.\nBelgium has an embassy in Kinshasa and a consulate-general in Lubumbashi. The DR Congo has an embassy in Brussels and a consulate-general in Antwerp. Both nations are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the United Nations.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing Stanley's expedition to the Congo, King Leopold II initially ruled Congo as his personal property following the Berlin Conference. On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted to annex the Congo Free State; on 15 November 1908, Leopold formally relinquished personal control over the state to Belgium, forming the Belgian Congo. During the Free State period, Congo was reputed to have been brutalised by a harsh economic policy that entailed rubber production quotas to be met by forced labour. Other crops were also farmed in the Congo.\n\n\nPolitical ties\nShortly after the Congo's independence in 1960, relations between Belgium and the Congo deteriorated and the Congolese government severed relations and ordered the expulsion of Ambassador Jean van den Bosch. France assumed responsibility for representing Belgian interests in the Congo.\nAfter fifty years of Congo's independence, a visit by the Belgian King Albert II was met with controversy as the king's brother, Baudouin, was said to have been connected to the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, and Lumumba's family sought to bring a case against 12 Belgians claiming Lumumba's torture and murder constituted war crimes.\nAmidst other controversies, Congo's Minister of Communication, Lambert Mende Omalanga, described an \"unacceptable attitude of the Belgian political class to consider the Congolese problems as internal affairs of their country,\" following such allegations as the \"very bizarre case of a purely imaginary invitation of Belgian soldiers to participate in the military parade in Kinshasa,\" amongst others. He then said \"coloniser to colonised relations is over.\" The Belgian Minister for Development Cooperation, Charles Michel, then expressed surprise at the remarks and demanded respect for Belgium.\nDuring a visit by a Belgian cabinet delegation in 2008 to the Congo, President Joseph Kabila said he did not appreciate a message brought by the team in regards to human rights issues. Kabila said: \"Belgium must make a choice on the type of relationship it wants to have with the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has a choice between having good relations as partners in a mature relationship with a sovereign and independent state or a master-slave relationship. I will note that every time a Belgian delegation is led by the minister of foreign affairs; it is with a lot of arrogance, as if our visitors are coming here to lecture us. This is unacceptable. The Congo will never accept this, definitely not me.\"\nIn December 2016, when President Kabila announced the postponement of elections and that he would not be stepping down despite the end of his constitutional mandate, the Belgian government announced that it would \"re-examine\" its relations with the DRC. The Belgian government also advised its citizens to not visit the DRC due to the political unrest. In April 2017, it was announced that the Congolese government informed the Belgian military attaché in Kinshasa that DR Congo would suspend military cooperation with Belgium, after foreign minister Didier Reynders criticized President Kabila's choice of the new Prime Minister, Bruno Tshibala.\nOn 30 June 2020, King Philippe of Belgium expressed his \"deep regrets\", but not apologies, for the atrocities in the Congo Free State in a letter to the Congolese president. In June 2022, King Philippe of Belgium, returned a mask, called Kakungu, which was used during healing ceremonies by the Suku people, and previously exhibited at the Royal Museum for Central Africa, during a week-long visit to DR Congo at the invitation of President Félix Tshisekedi. In addition, in a speech on the grounds of the Congolese parliament in Kinshasa, he formally condemned the atrocities that occurred when DR Congo was a Belgian colony, saying the colonial government \"was one of unequal relations, unjustifiable in itself, marked by paternalism, discrimination and racism\".\n\n\nSee also\nList of ambassadors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Belgium\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nMova Sakanyi, Henri; Tambwe, Eddie, eds.

    "text": "In algebraic geometry, a Deligne–Mumford stack is a stack that behaves, in many respects, like an algebraic variety or an orbifold, while still allowing mild stacky phenomena such as finite stabilizer groups. More precisely, a stack \\(F\\) over schemes is Deligne–Mumford if its diagonal is sufficiently well behaved and if it admits an étale surjective cover by a scheme (an atlas).\nPierre Deligne and David Mumford introduced this notion in their 1969 paper on the irreducibility of the moduli space of algebraic curves, where they showed that the moduli stack of stable curves of fixed arithmetic genus is a proper smooth Deligne–Mumford stack over \\(\\operatorname{Spec}\\mathbb{Z}\\). Since then, Deligne–Mumford stacks have become a basic tool in moduli theory and in modern intersection theory, for instance in Gromov–Witten theory.\n\n\nDefinition\nLet \\(S\\) be a base scheme, and let F be a stack on \\((\\operatorname{Sch}/S)_{\\text{ét}}\\). The stack F is called a Deligne–Mumford stack if the following conditions hold:\n\nThe diagonal morphism\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Δ\n          \n            F\n          \n        \n        :\n        F\n        →\n        F\n        \n          ×\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{F}\\colon F\\to F\\times _{S}F}\n  \n\nis representable, quasi-compact and separated.\nThere exists a scheme U and a representable, surjective, étale morphism\n\n  \n    \n      \n        U\n        →\n        F\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U\\to F,}\n  \n\ncalled an atlas (or cover) of F.\nMany authors formulate the definition in the context of algebraic stacks by additionally requiring that F be an algebraic stack (in the sense of Michael Artin). In such formulations, a Deligne–Mumford stack is an algebraic stack whose diagonal is unramified and which admits an étale surjective atlas by a scheme.\n\n\nRelation with other notions\n\n\nAlgebraic stacks and Artin stacks\nIf, in the definition above, the word “étale” is weakened to “smooth”, one obtains the notion of an algebraic stack (often called an Artin stack after Michael Artin). Thus every Deligne–Mumford stack is an algebraic (Artin) stack, but not conversely.\nThe condition that the atlas is étale forces stabilizer groups to be finite and unramified over the base. In contrast, general Artin stacks may have positive-dimensional stabilizers, such as copies of \\(\\mathbb{G}_m\\) or abelian varieties.\n\n\nAlgebraic spaces\nAn algebraic space can be regarded as a special case of a Deligne–Mumford stack, namely a Deligne–Mumford stack whose diagonal is an immersion and whose stabilizer groups are trivial. In this sense, algebraic spaces are “non-stacky” Deligne–Mumford stacks.\n\n\nOrbifolds\nOver the complex numbers, separated Deligne–Mumford stacks of finite type with finite stabilizers are often viewed as algebro-geometric analogues of orbifolds. More precisely, a smooth Deligne–Mumford stack over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) with finite stabilizers determines, and is determined by, a complex orbifold together with additional algebro-geometric structure.\n\n\nProperties\nLet F be a Deligne–Mumford stack that is quasi-compact and quasi-separated.\n\nFinite stabilizers and automorphisms. For any quasi-compact scheme B and any object \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        ∈\n        F\n        (\n        B\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X\\in F(B)}\n  \n, the automorphism group of X over B is finite. Equivalently, the inertia stack of F is finite over F$.\nCoarse moduli spaces. If the inertia stack of F is finite (for example, if F is a separated Deligne–Mumford stack locally of finite type over a Noetherian base), then F admits a coarse moduli space in the sense of Deligne–Mumford, which is an algebraic space representing isomorphism classes of objects up to finite stabilizers.\nPresentation by groupoids. Every Deligne–Mumford stack F admits a presentation by a groupoid in schemes. Concretely, if U → F is an étale surjective atlas, then the fiber product \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        =\n        U\n        \n          ×\n          \n            F\n          \n        \n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R=U\\times _{F}U}\n  \n defines a groupoid scheme \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        ⇉\n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R\\rightrightarrows U}\n  \n whose associated quotient stack is equivalent to F. See groupoid scheme for details.\nLocal quotient structure. Étale-locally on the base, a Deligne–Mumford stack is a quotient of a scheme by a finite group action: for every point of F there is an étale neighborhood over which F is equivalent to a quotient stack \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        X\n        \n          /\n        \n        G\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [X/G]}\n  \n with G finite (often referred to as an orbifold chart).\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nQuotient by a finite group (affine stacks)\nA basic way to construct Deligne–Mumford stacks is to take the stack quotient of a scheme or algebraic space by a finite group action with finite stabilizers.

For instance, the weighted projective line \\(\\mathbb{P}(2,3)\\) can be described as the quotient stack\n\n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        \n          \n            C\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ∖\n        {\n        0\n        }\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          \n            C\n          \n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [\\mathbb {C} ^{2}\\setminus \\{0\\}/\\mathbb {C} ^{*}]}\n  \n\nwhere \\(\\mathbb{C}^*\\) acts by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        ⋅\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        \n          λ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        x\n        ,\n        \n        \n          λ\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        y\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda \\cdot (x,y)=(\\lambda ^{2}x,\\;\\lambda ^{3}y).}\n  \n\nA point \\((x,y)\\) has a non-trivial stabilizer precisely when either \\(x = 0\\) or \\(y = 0\\), in which case the stabilizer is a finite group of roots of unity (of order 2 or 3 respectively). Hence all stabilizers are finite and the quotient stack is Deligne–Mumford. Such stacks are sometimes referred to as weighted projective stacks or stacky projective lines.\n\n\nModuli stacks of curves\nThe prototypical examples of Deligne–Mumford stacks arise in the moduli theory of curves. For an integer \\(g \\geq 2\\), the moduli stack \\(\\mathcal{M}_g\\) of smooth, proper, connected curves of genus g over schemes is an algebraic stack; its Deligne–Mumford compactification \\(\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_g\\), obtained by allowing stable nodal curves, is a proper smooth Deligne–Mumford stack over \\(\\operatorname{Spec}\\mathbb{Z}\\).\nMore generally, the moduli stacks \\(\\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\\) and \\(\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}\\) of curves of genus g with n marked points are Deligne–Mumford stacks, and their geometry plays a central role in modern enumerative geometry and intersection theory.\n\n\nStacky curves\n\nA stacky curve is, roughly speaking, a connected, one-dimensional, separated Deligne–Mumford stack of finite type over an algebraically closed field, with generically trivial stabilizer. Such objects generalize smooth projective curves by allowing finitely many stacky points with non-trivial finite stabilizer groups. Weighted projective lines and certain orbifold curves arising in representation theory and arithmetic geometry provide basic examples.\n\n\nNon-example\nA simple example of an algebraic stack that is not Deligne–Mumford is the classifying stack of the multiplicative group:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        B\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        ]\n        =\n        [\n        Spec\n        ⁡\n        k\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        ]\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [B\\mathbb {G} _{m}]=[\\operatorname {Spec} k/\\mathbb {G} _{m}].}\n  \n\nHere the stabilizer group at every point is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{G}_m\\), which is infinite and has positive dimension. Thus the diagonal is not unramified and the stack fails to be Deligne–Mumford, although it is an Artin stack.\n\n\nSee also\nAlgebraic stack\nAlgebraic space\nArtin stack\nOrbifold\nModuli space of algebraic curves\nQuotient stack\nStacky curve\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "In algebraic geometry, a Deligne–Mumford stack is a stack that behaves, in many respects, like an algebraic variety or an orbifold, while still allowing mild stacky phenomena such as finite stabilizer groups. More precisely, a stack \\(F\\) over schemes is Deligne–Mumford if its diagonal is sufficiently well behaved and if it admits an étale surjective cover by a scheme (an atlas).\nPierre Deligne and David Mumford introduced this notion in their 1969 paper on the irreducibility of the moduli space of algebraic curves, where they showed that the moduli stack of stable curves of fixed arithmetic genus is a proper smooth Deligne–Mumford stack over \\(\\operatorname{Spec}\\mathbb{Z}\\). Since then, Deligne–Mumford stacks have become a basic tool in moduli theory and in modern intersection theory, for instance in Gromov–Witten theory.",

    "title": "The Entity",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=690918",
    "text": "The Entity is a 1982 American supernatural horror film directed by Sidney J. Furie, and starring Barbara Hershey, Ron Silver, David Labiosa, Maggie Blye, Jacqueline Brookes, and Alex Rocco. The film follows a single mother in Los Angeles who is raped and tormented by an invisible poltergeist-like entity in her home. It was adapted for the screen by Frank De Felitta from his 1978 novel of the same name, which was based on the 1974 case of Doris Bither, a woman who claimed to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted by an invisible assailant, and who underwent observation by doctoral students at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nPrincipal photography of The Entity took place over a ten week-period in Los Angeles and El Segundo, California, in the spring of 1981. Despite being completed and planned for a release later that year, the film went unreleased until the fall of 1982, when it was acquired by 20th Century Fox and given a theatrical release in the United Kingdom. The studio subsequently released it in the United States on February 4, 1983. It grossed over $13 million at the box office against a $9 million budget. The film received moderately favorable critical reviews and acclaim for Hershey's performance, and has received further praise from contemporary film critics.\nIn addition to its paranormal elements, the film deals with themes of female sexual victimhood, sexual repression, and the family dynamics of single-parent households. It was met with some controversy from women's rights and feminist organizations during its original release due to its graphic depictions of female sexual assault.\n\n\nPlot\nOne night, single mother Carla Moran is violently raped in her Los Angeles bungalow by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her best friend Cindy Nash. They return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes they are self-inflicted despite being in places impossible for her to reach.\nSneiderman drives Carla home and meets her children. She explains to him that she suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual molestation, teenage pregnancy, and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma but agrees to keep an open mind at her request. Shortly after Sneiderman leaves, Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene, but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken.\nCarla attends a staff meeting chaired by Sneiderman's colleague, Dr. Weber. As soon as she leaves, Weber shares his belief that the experiences of the Moran household are the output of a mass delusion arising from Carla's damaged psyche, sexual frustration and propensity to masturbate. That night, Carla is tricked by the entity into having an orgasm while she sleeps by appearing to rub & suck her nipples. The next day, Sneiderman urges Carla to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses and becomes angry when Sneiderman goes so far as to suggest she has incestuous feelings for her son.\nAfter Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home under the supervision of their team leader, Dr. Cooley. During their study, Sneiderman arrives and tries to convince Carla that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him. Reassured that her case is taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend, Jerry Anderson, visits one night and witnesses Carla being held down on the bed by the entity while being raped and noticeably fondled by invisible fingers. Confused and horrified, he attempts to fight off the entity. Hearing the commotion, Carla's son enters the room and believes that Jerry is harming her, prompting him to attack Jerry. Later at the hospital, Jerry is so troubled by the experience that he ends their relationship.\nDesperate for a solution, Carla agrees to participate in an elaborate experiment carried out by Cooley's team. A full mock-up of her home is created to lure the entity into a trap and freeze it with liquid helium. Before the experiment begins, Sneiderman tries to convince Carla to leave, confirming an unorthodox personal interest in her predicament. The entity arrives but unexpectedly takes control of the helium jets, using them against Carla. She defiantly stands up to it, stating that it may kill her, but it will never have her. At this precise point, the tanks explode and flood the premises with liquid helium. Sneiderman rushes in just in time to save her. As they look back, they realize that the entity has been trapped in a huge mass of ice. It breaks free and vanishes almost immediately, but Sneiderman realizes that Carla has been telling the truth.\nDr. Cooley believes that, despite the destruction of the ice block, she has a valuable witness in Dr. Weber. Much to her chagrin, however, Weber decides to take refuge in the belief that he did not witness anything. Carla returns to her house the next day. The front door slams by itself and she is greeted menacingly by a disembodied demonic voice which says, \"Welcome home, cunt.\" She calmly opens the door, exits the house, gets in a car with her family and leaves. A closing intertitle verifies that Carla and her family have moved to Texas. Carla still experiences attacks from the entity, although they have lessened in frequency and severity.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nThemes\nFilm scholar Daniel Kremer interprets The Entity as a parable for female sexual victimhood, citing the lead character of Carla Moran as a woman who \"goes head-to-head with a gaggle of men (including the \"entity\" itself). If the men of the film do not undermine her credibility or sanity, they objectify her, exploit her victimhood, belittle her ability to take control of her unfortunate circumstances, and ultimately give her the dignity of a glorified lab rat.\"\nBrad Stevens of the British Film Institute notes that the film deals with themes of sexual assault as well as a \"fantasy\" figure that serves as a surrogate for the absent father in the household, a theme he compares to the extraterrestrial in Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, released the same year. Despite some of the film's contemporary elements, Stevens also notes that it follows a classically Gothic narrative structure. Michael Doyle, writing for Rue Morgue magazine, describes the entity in the film as akin to an incubus, a demon that sexually assaults sleeping women.\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nScreenplay\nScreenwriter Frank De Felitta adapted the screenplay from his novel, which was based on the case of Doris Bither, a woman who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by an invisible supernatural entity on numerous occasions. The screenplay, like the novel, introduces several elements that were not investigated as part of the Bither case (including the allegations of spectral rape and the capture of an entity).\nIn a rare interview with Rue Morgue magazine in July 2012, director Sidney J. Furie told journalist Michael Doyle that he did not consider The Entity to be a horror film in spite of its extreme imagery, unsettling atmosphere and horrific plot. Instead, Furie said he considers The Entity to be more of a \"supernatural suspense movie.\" Furie also confessed that he intentionally avoided researching the case upon which The Entity is based as he \"did not want to judge the characters and story in any way.\" Neither he nor actress Barbara Hershey met with Doris Bither, the woman on whom the character of Carla Moran was based.\n\n\nCasting\n\nSeveral actresses were considered for the role of Carla Moran, including Jill Clayburgh, Sally Field, Jane Fonda, and Bette Midler, but all four declined the offer. Barbara Hershey was cast in the role only ten days before production was scheduled to begin. Hershey had hesitations about the part due to the nudity in the screenplay, but agreed to it after director Sidney J. Furie assured her the nude sequences would be accomplished via body doubles and mannequins. Recalling her casting, Hershey said: \"I was frightened. I didn't know how it would be edited or marketed. But I knew that Sid saw potential in the film to approach the subject from a humanistic and psychiatric viewpoint, from a mother's viewpoint...  and I felt it was a worthwhile risk.\" Neither Hershey nor Furie met the real Doris Bither in preparation for the film.\nRon Silver was cast as Dr. Sniderman, the psychologist who questions the supernatural nature of Carla's attacks, while Alex Rocco was given the part of Jerry, her absent boyfriend. Furie had originally sought Craig T. Nelson for the role of Jerry, but producer Harold Schneider refused to cast Nelson. David Labiosa, a New York-based actor, was cast as Carla's teenage son Billy, based on his performance in the television film Death Penalty (1980) opposite Colleen Dewhurst.\n\n\nFilming\nThe Entity was an independent production made under a tax shelter by the newly established production company American Cinema International Productions, and had originally been optioned to Roman Polanski. The film was financed as part of a package deal along with I, the Jury (1982) and Tough Enough (1983).\nPrincipal photography of The Entity began in Los Angeles on March 30, 1981. The shoot lasted a period of ten weeks, and was completed in late June 1981. Furie was pleased with the small production, later commenting: \"There were no extras waiting in buses, no six camera crews, no bullshit. And at every point, we knew the film was working pretty well.\" The exteriors of the Moran home were shot at a house in El Segundo, while a set was constructed in Los Angeles for the home's interiors. Stylistically, Furie and his cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, employed frequent use of close-ups and Dutch angles. The shoot was temporarily halted when Labiosa accidentally broke his wrist while filming a scene in which he is thrown backward by the entity. Labiosa's injury resulted in him being written out of several scenes.\nDuring filming, Furie excised a subplot involving overt incestuous feelings between Carla and her son, Billy. A dream sequence in the original screenplay featured Carla fantasizing about taking her son's virginity. Labiosa recalled: \"I think it was awkward for everyone to do, because of what the whole thing implied. I often wonder what the film would have been like had they kept it in.\" According to Labiosa, a scene was filmed in which Carla observes Billy shirtless outside, which hinted at this subplot, but this scene was cut from the film.\nThe majority of the special effects in the film were achieved with practical methods, and were supervised by Stan Winston. For example, the scene in which Carla's nude body is groped by the entity was shot featuring a latex dummy body with suction cups built inside, which allowed crew members to manipulate it to appear as though fingers were making impressions on her flesh; Hershey's body, aside from her head, was hidden beneath the bed during this scene. The construction of the dummy body cost the production $65,000 to create.\nThe film would be among the final productions made by American Cinema Productions before it filed for bankruptcy in December 1981.\n\n\nRelease\nUniversal Pictures initially expressed interest in distributing The Entity, as the studio felt it might have \"some commercial value,\" but it was ultimately acquired by 20th Century Fox. The film opened first in the United Kingdom on September 30, 1982, where it was given an X rating. It opened in the United States on February 4, 1983, with little pre-publicity.\n\n\nHome media\nCBS/Fox Video released The Entity on VHS in 1983. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2005, and later issued a standalone Blu-ray disc on July 3, 2012.\nIn December 2016, Eureka Entertainment released a dual format DVD and Blu-ray set in the United Kingdom in exclusive steelbook packaging, sold exclusively through Zavvi. On June 11, 2019, Scream Factory released a collector's edition Blu-ray disc of the film featuring new interviews and other newly commissioned bonus material.\n\n\nReception and legacy\n\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed $3.7 million during its opening weekend in the U.S., and went on to gross a total of $13.3 million.\n\n\nControversy\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom, the film was met by protests from women's rights groups who deemed it offensive due to its graphic depictions of sexual assault. In response to the protests against the film, star Barbara Hershey publicly responded, telling a reporter: \"I resent being put in the position of defending the film. We worked really hard not to make it exploitative. Rape is one of the ugliest if not the ugliest thing that can happen to someone. It's murder of a sort. I have no answer for those people who are offended.\"\n\n\nCritical response\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 62% approval rating based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 35 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.\nRichard F. Shepard, in a New York Times review, praised Hershey's performance but went on to say \"The Entity offers thrills in short staccato bursts and dull science in long bursts.\" Critic Roger Ebert, who also put the film in an 1987 episode of At the Movies about cinematic guilty pleasures, praised the film for Hershey's performance, deeming it her \"comeback\" and describing her portrayal of a struggling single mother as \"touching.\" Bill Kaufman of Newsday praised the film's \"straightforward\" approach to its material, and praised both Hershey and Silver's performances. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times championed the film, praising De Felitta's \"painstaking adaptation\" of the source novel, and summarized the film as an \"intense and engrossing entertainment that unexpectedly involves a crackling battle between psychiatry and parapsychology, with poor Hershey caught in the middle...  Never has so much been demanded of Hershey, and she's never been better.\"\nContemporary criticism of the film has been favorable: Andrew Dowler of the Toronto publication Now praised the lead performances, writing: \"Hershey gives Carla a believable mix of hopelessness and grit, and Ron Silver strikes the right note as an over-assertive psychologist who may have more than a professional interest in the case. Director Sidney J. Furie keeps them in the foreground, but uses slightly off-kilter angles to make his very ordinary settings creepy and cramped.\" American film theorist Michael Atkinson lauded the film, writing: \"There may not be, outside of David Cronenberg's wonder cabinet, a more nitro-powered horror-movie metaphor hell than that fueling this post-Exorcist remnant...  It's like the movie is writing its own library of fiery feminist theory. It remains unnerving and savage, arguably the most eloquent movie ever made in Hollywood about the struggle of the sexual underclass.\"\nTV Guide gave the film a middling review, noting that \"a great performance by Barbara Hershey fails to save this poorly directed tale of the supernatural...  ever-inept director Sidney J. Furie is ham-handed as usual, with the camera swooping all over the place between dull bouts of psychological and parapsychological mumbo-jumbo.\"\nDirector Martin Scorsese has also remarked his appreciation for the film, and ranked it the fourth-scariest horror film of all time, above Psycho and The Shining.\n\n\nIn other media\nAvant-garde filmmaker Peter Tscherkassky used a print of this film for his 1999 short Outer Space.\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nRemake\nIn April 2015, it was announced that James Wan and Roy Lee were producing a remake for 20th Century Fox through their Atomic Monster and Vertigo Entertainment banners, respectively. The film would be written by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes. In a 2020 interview, Carey Hayes commented that the screenplay had been completed, but that the project's future was undetermined following The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of 20th Century Fox.\n\n\nSee also\nList of ghost films\nSpectrophilia\nPoltergeist, the 1982 Tobe Hooper film similar in content\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Entity at IMDb\nThe Entity at Box Office Mojo\nThe Entity at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Entity at Metacritic\nGhostTheory.com interview with one of Doris Bither's sons.",

It was adapted for the screen by Frank De Felitta from his 1978 novel of the same name, which was based on the 1974 case of Doris Bither, a woman who claimed to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted by an invisible assailant, and who underwent observation by doctoral students at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nPrincipal photography of The Entity took place over a ten week-period in Los Angeles and El Segundo, California, in the spring of 1981. Despite being completed and planned for a release later that year, the film went unreleased until the fall of 1982, when it was acquired by 20th Century Fox and given a theatrical release in the United Kingdom. The studio subsequently released it in the United States on February 4, 1983. It grossed over $13 million at the box office against a $9 million budget. The film received moderately favorable critical reviews and acclaim for Hershey's performance, and has received further praise from contemporary film critics.\nIn addition to its paranormal elements, the film deals with themes of female sexual victimhood, sexual repression, and the family dynamics of single-parent households. It was met with some controversy from women's rights and feminist organizations during its original release due to its graphic depictions of female sexual assault.",

    "title": "2001 Biggin Hill Airshow disasters",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=79948438",
    "text": "The Biggin Hill Airshow disasters occurred on June 2–3, 2001, during the annually held Biggin Hill Airshow,  at London Biggin Hill Airport in Bromley, England. An aircraft landing incident and two separate fatal aircraft crashes occurred during the weekend show. A de Havilland Venom suffered minor damage to its fuselage when it landed with its landing gear retracted. Six hours later, a de Havilland DH-115 Vampire was attempting a wingover, when the aircraft lost control and dove into the ground, destroying the Vampire and killing pilots Air Marshal Sir Kenneth Hayr and Jonathan Kerr. A Bell P-63 Kingcobra crashed the following day after attempting a maneuver with insufficient speed, destroying the aircraft and killing pilot Guy Bancroft-Wilson.\nAfter the conclusion of the airshow, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch opened three investigations into the events of July 2–3 for the Venom, Vampire and Kingcobra respectively. Their findings on how wake turbulence affects aircraft during air displays and how communication issues could be improved between performing aircraft and ATC were published in their individual reports. The residents of Biggin Hill agreed that the weekend had been a terrible tragedy and were divided over whether the airshow should continue. Despite the concern, the airshow continued to run annually until 2011, at which time it was replaced by an open house air day.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nBiggin Hill Airshow\nThe Biggin Hill Airshow, then known simply as the Air Fair, was first held in 1963 by WWII Royal Air Force pilot Jock Maitland. These displays took place at Biggin Hill Airport annually for the public to view, with the 25th anniversary held in 1987, by which time the air show had become renowned for having high standards for entertainment and well regarded commentators Roger Hoefling and John Blake. Early Air Fairs included air displays with the T-28D Trojan in 1978 and the English Electric Lightning in 1980.\n\n\nde Havilland DH-115 Vampire\n\n\nAircraft\nThe DH115 Vampire T11 used in the June 2 display was originally built in 1955 by de Havilland Aircraft Company Ltd and entered the Royal Air Force in 1956 under the registration of XH308. It remained in service until 1962, after which the aircraft was put into storage, sold to the Swiss Air Force and was then upgraded to Mk 55. The Vampire operated as U-1234 through 1991, finally being returned to the United Kingdom in 1995.\n\n\nCrew\nPiloting the Vampire was Sir Kenneth Hayr (66), a former New Zealand born fighter pilot and Cadet Warrant Officer of the No 3 (City of Auckland) Squadron, Air Training Corps. He eventually went on to join the Royal Air Force in the 1950s, becoming an Air Commodore and later the Inspector of RAF Flight Safety in 1976. Hayr was responsible for overseeing the RAF's role in the re-capture of the Falkland Islands. On the day of the display Hayr, with a total of 4,398 flying hours (185 of those with the Vampire), would be pilot-in-command, sitting in the left seat of the Vampire. Accompanying him was Jonathan Kerr (33), a safety pilot who had been allocated to the Vampire by the Civil Aviation Authority due to the circumstances following the incident with the Venom that morning.\n\n\nBell P-63 Kingcobra\n\n\nAircraft\nThe Bell P-63 Kingcobra used in the display of June 3 was assembled in 1944, at the end of the Second World War. The aircraft was stationed with the United States Air Force under serial number 42-69097. It was built to conventional standard as a single seat aircraft. After completing its service in the US Air Force, the Kingcobra was sold under new civil registration N52113 in 1947, beginning its career as an air racer craft. It remained as a racer for the next four decades, changing hands multiple times but keeping the same registration (N52113), before finally being sold to Patina Ltd in Jersey with civil registration G-BTWR in 1991. At this time the Kingcobra was completely rebuilt, with a new zero-timed 1,325 horsepower liquid-cooled Allison V1710-117 piston engine located behind the pilot, gearbox and propeller.\n\n\nCrew\nRed Arrows pilot and British Airways captain Guy Bancroft-Wilson (43) was flying the Kingcobra on the day of its display, having began flight training whilst serving. Bancroft-Wilson finished a three year tour as part of the Red Arrows, flying Hawk aircraft, continuing to fly professionally thereafter. Despite only having 13 hours of flying experience with the Kingcobra, Bancroft-Wilson had accumulated 7730 hours of flying time overall. He also held a display authorisation for a Cat C aircraft (the Kingcobra being of this category). This requires the pilot perform a minimum of three display sequence practices in an aircraft of the same category, not preceding 90 days before the day of the public display. Bancroft-Wilson had flown 30 minutes of dual instruction in a Texan Harvard, 25 minutes of display exercise in the Kingcobra two days before the airshow display and the display itself on June 2. These were not recorded in his pilot logbook however, instead being recorded as completed by Patina Ltd.\n\n\nJune 2: Venom incident and Vampire crash\n\n\nVenom incident\n\n\nAircraft problems and belly landing\nOn the morning of 2 June 2001, a de Havilland Sea Vixen, de Havilland Vampire and a de Havilland Venom were scheduled to fly in formation from Bournemouth to partake in an airshow at Biggin Hill Airport. The Venom, being a single-seater aircraft, was flown by company chief pilot Clive Rustin. Rustin had over 200 hours of flying experience with the Venom, however this was only his second flight in eight years and with the aircraft to date. On the previous day, Rustin had noted that there was an issue with the landing gear indicator. The Vampire and Sea Vixen landed without issue at Biggin Hill. However, the Venom had issues with its landing gear indicator showing the flap as being over the one-third setting, despite being set to one-third during the pre-landing checks. Rustin corrected the flap setting. Entering final approach, he lowered the flap to full and maintained an even spacing between the Vampire and Sea Vixen, avoiding their slipstreams, as the gap had decreased to an unsafe amount. Certain the landing gear was all the way down and calling 'finals three greens' to the tower, despite the questionable indicator, Rustin landed the Venom in what he believed was a normal landing. The Venom had in fact completed a smooth touchdown on its belly, with Air Traffic Control reporting the landing gear had not been down. This was further proven by the nose vibration experienced in the latter stages of the landing run. Whilst Rustin was uninjured, the aircraft experienced crushed drop tanks and a scratched fuselage on its underside. This damage resulted in it being unable to perform any displays at the airshow.\n\n\nSubsequent observations and aftermath\nClive Rustin later pinpointed three contributing factors to his failure to lower the landing gear. These included the width between the landing gear and the flaps being close together and of a similar design, leading him to believe he had lowered the flap and not the landing gear, despite the reverse being true. This led to him failing to associate the excess flap with an unlowered landing gear. This was not helped by the landing gear indicator not reporting correctly. Secondly, the location of the indicator in the cockpit and the intensity of the lights made the position of the landing gear difficult to discern. Finally, Rustin reckoned he was distracted by the concentration required to perform a landing in close proximity to the other aircraft.\nAfter the incident with the Venom, runway 03 at Biggin Hill was closed for approximately three hours in preparation for the air displays taking place later that day. The Vampire's pilot-in-command Sir Kenneth Hayr assisted with the aftermath of the incident with the Venom and was in attendance at the airshow briefing. Due to the Venom being unable to partake in any displays after the damage it had taken from the landing, the Vampire and Sea Vixen would pair up for a short sequence display followed by shorter solo displays later that day. The airshow instead opened with a helicopter display from the Blue Eagles which could perform without needing the full runway. This performance included the UK's first female military display pilot Sergeant Julie Wiles. This performance was followed by many other displays and flybys, including the Red Arrows which flew in from another airport. The Civil Aviation Authority assigned safety pilot Jonathan Kerr to the Vampire due to the events of the morning and potential visibility issues involving the aircraft's cockpit.\n\n\nVampire crash\n\n\nVampire and Sea Vixen air display plan\nPilots Hayr and Kerr discussed plans for the display that would now take place without the Venom. The Vampire and Sea Vixen would take off separately several minutes before the planned display time, joining up as a formation pair behind the crowd. They would then run-in along runway 03, in front of the crowd, with the Vampire following in right echelon formation. During a level turn to the left, the Vampire would switch to the line astern position. They would proceed outbound from the crowd with a 345° heading. Upon reaching the end of the display line, the Sea Vixen would perform a wingover to the right, reversing direction and returning along the display axis. The Vampire would then mimic this but with a delayed initiation, with the aim to set 1 km of spacing from the Sea Vixen, allowing the latter to exit behind the crowd and leave the airspace clear for itself to begin performing solo. The Vampire would then depart for RAF Lyneham, where it would perform a final display.\nThe planned display maneuvers went ahead; however, the Vampire took off thirty seconds after the Sea Vixen due to a transient issue involving its landing gear. The weather at their departure time gave a northerly surface wind reading of 14 knots, visibility to 20 km with cloud scattered at 3000 feet, a temp of 13c with an air pressure of 1016 mb. Both Hayr and Kerr had flown in a similar air display sequence one week prior at Duxford; however, that display included the Venom.\n\n\nVampire crash and immediate aftermath\nThe Vampire and Sea Vixen joined as a pair as planned, flying past the crowd and carrying out their 405° level turn. The Sea Vixen subsequently performed its wingover to the right at a speed of 220 knots at the apex, subsequently increasing thrust and pulling 2.5g into the turn. The Vampire then flew to the left astern position, flying a wider radius followed by a right wingover to achieve the planned 1 km of spacing between both aircraft. As the Vampire reached 80° to enter its wingover, it continued to roll to the right, suddenly becoming inverted with the nose dropping down into a steepening descent. The Vampire almost simultaneously rolled upright, raised its nose and increased its angle of attack. Still rolling to the right, the Vampire crashed into woods by the end of runway 21, with a cloud of fire rising into the sky seconds after. These events were reportedly witnessed by 35,000 people in the airshow's crowd. Neither Sir Kenneth Hayr nor Jonathan Kerr survived.\nThe Sea Vixen cut its display short and dumped its remaining fuel before landing back on runway 03 without issue. Several recordings of the display were taken by camera from members of the crowd. Most of these however, focused solely on the Sea Vixen rather than the Vampire at the time of the latters right wingover. Footage from the last moments of the accident were only available on one recording. This recording would be further analysed in the subsequent investigation.\n\n\nJune 3: Kingcobra crash\n\n\nKingcobra crash\n\n\nWarbird trio and initial loss of control\nIn the mid afternoon on the second day of the Biggin Hill Airshow, three WWII warbirds including a Bell P-63 Kingcobra being piloted by Guy Bancroft-Wilson were set to perform in a joint display. They would fly together whilst performing maneuvers. The Kingcobra being the third aircraft would then break away, the first two warbirds would then carry out a pre-planned air display as a pair. The Kingcobra would fill in between the two other aircraft with its own non pre-planned sequence.\nThe three warbirds took off from runway 03, holding for three minutes to the western side of Biggin Hill Airport before beginning their air display. They then flew in as a trio to a crowd of 50,000 people, each performing a loop maneuver followed by a half cuban eight, after which the Kingcobra split off as planned. A minute later, following a flypast beside the display line at a speed of 220 knots, passing the other two warbirds, the Kingcobra pulled up into a climbing maneuver. During the peak, the Kingcobra was partially inverted and temporarily lost control, entering an incipient spin, however the pilot quickly recovered, though with much altitude lost. Nonetheless, the air display proceeded.\n\n\nKingcobra crash and aftermath\nNext, Bancroft-Wilson piloted the Kingcobra past the crowd left to right, performed a wingover to the left, returning past the crowd the other way at 190 knots. The warbird then went out of sight for twenty seconds before it was directed to make a right-hand turn to bearing 220°. It then flew in the direction of the crowd and then pulled up into a loop maneuver, topping out inverted, full nose-up elevator was maintained with right rudder application. The aircraft moved to the right and fell into another incipient spin. The nose turned toward the ground with the rudder returning to neutral, full nose-up elevator staying the same. Unable to recover the dive, the Kingcobra crashed into the ground nearby with a nose down attitude at a speed of 160 knots. The ensuing fire destroyed the aircraft, this was quickly put out by the airports fire service. Pilot Guy Bancroft-Wilson did not survive. Similarly to the Vampire crash on the day prior, video recordings and photographs were made available to the subsequent investigation.\n\n\nInvestigations\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the UK Government Department for Transport opened two investigations following the events of July 2–3, 2001 for both the Vampire and Kingcobra accidents respectively. The incident involving the Venom FB.50 was described in its own short report and in further detail within the Vampire report.\n\n\nVampire wreckage\nThere were no indicators of pilot ejection upon examining of the wreckage, the same was true for mechanical failures of which all were within flying control. The Vampire impacted a field of tall grass beyond Biggin Hill Airport's perimeter, approximately 850 metres to the north of the end of runway 03/21. Having been completely destroyed from the impact, some sections of the aircraft were farther than 130 metres from the impact location. Ground scars and wreckage distribution showed the Vampire had been travelling at an angle of 130°M, 45° nose down, banked steeply to the right. Other parts of the Vampire wreckage that were investigated also demonstrated that the point of failure was likely not from pilot error or mechanical failure but instead from other less obvious factors.\n\n\nWake turbulence investigations\nHaving been in a paired display, it was clear that the size difference between the Vampire and the Sea Vixen could have been a catalyst in the loss of control the Vampire experienced in the seconds before its crash. The operating weights of both aircraft were measured through a modelling system, with the Sea Vixen having a mass of 14,784 kg and the Vampire having a far lesser mass of 4,400 kg (aircraft velocity and placement were also modelled). Both aircraft were also separated in a non-standard way during their air display. This meant the trailing wingtip vortices (the main component of wake turbulence) generated from the Sea Vixen amid flight were at full intensity two to four wing lengths behind, exactly where the Vampire was flying.\nIn light of this information, the AAIB authorised an aerodynamic study, drawing data from an older study completed in 1954 by the Armament Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The 1954 study performed tests to determine the effect on a smaller tracking aircraft of generated vortices from a larger target aircraft. These tests were originally completed with a Gloster Meteor Mk 4, a slightly heavier aircraft than the Vampire at 6,900 kg. Three components from the 1954 study included the jet efflux, the rest of the wake and the trailing wing vortices. The AAIB's modelling showed that the vortex created by the Sea Vixen as being quadruple the strength than those of the Vampire. The equivalent roll acceleration of the Sea Vixen was greater than the roll authority the Vampire could handle at the speed being flown. A rapid roll to the right with a 90° angle, as was witnessed being executed by the Vampire, was determined to be the likely result of wake turbulence produced by the Sea Vixen in this interaction.\n\n\nKingcobra wreckage\nSimilarly to the wreckage of the Vampire, no mechanical failures of the Kingcobra were observed upon initial inspection. The crash site was confined to an area west of the runway angled at 70°, the right wing of the aircraft had struck the ground first with little to no ground slide. The nose of the Kingcobra was buried at a depth of approximately one metre, with the outer of the left wing including fuel tanks detached and strewn thirteen metres away. Impact fire around the tanks were put out by the fire service at the airport. Fuel from the tanks had spilled to nearby vegetation, with a ring of fire marks around the rear of the engine, but not on the main wreckage.\n\n\nAir display communication issues\nWhilst relevant to the Biggin Hill Airshow in general, specific issues with communication were highlighted in the AAIB investigation of the Kingcobra disaster. Guidance surrounding CAP 403 published by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom recommends that a Flying Display Committee (now known as a Flying Control Committee or FCC) should be utilised. One member of this committee should be stationed at the crowd line, maintaining direct communication with the Flying Display Director. The report clarifies that the airshow at Biggin Hill did establish an FCC to oversee display standards and to make sure safety regulations were followed. A display could be stopped via a system that was in place through contact between ATC which was located on the other side of the runway and a member of the FCC by telephone or radio. Cause of concern was highlighted during the Kingcobra air display upon the loss of control at the apex of the first rolling climbing maneuver. The committee member in question did attempt to establish contact with ATC five times by radio and the director twice by telephone, however no answer was received.\n\n\nConclusions\n\n\nVampire crash conclusions\nWith the lack of evidence for pre-impact failure within the aircraft's structure and controls, and no determinable evidence of pilot incapacitation, coupled with its improbability, it was deemed probable that the Vampire was affected by wake turbulence created by the Sea Vixen. The given reason for the Vampire's crash was that the Sea Vixen's trailing vortices exceeded that of the Vampire's aileron roll authority during the air display. This is backed by tests conducted using a Gloster Meteor as the tracking aircraft with a Vampire as the target aircraft, though at much higher altitudes. The total time from loss of control to impact was calculated, using video footage, to be less than five seconds.\n\n\nKingcobra crash conclusions\nThe cause for the loss of control experienced by the Kingcobra was put down to insufficient aircraft speed whilst attempting a loop maneuver. This was likely caused by a continuing loss of energy which had increased throughout the air display. This was in part a cause for the displays earlier failed maneuver as well. The pilot, Guy Bancroft-Wilson, being an experienced warbird flyer should have stopped the display once an issue with the Kingcobra was apparent, however this did not happen. Lacking a pre-planned sequence likely contributed to Bancroft-Wilson's decision making on the day of the display and during the flight.\nNo recovery actions were seen to be attempted with the flight control inputs or rudder after the loss of aircraft control, the rudder and ailerons moved during the foregoing attempted loop maneuver, however the elevator remained up. This would have either been caused by positive back pressure applied to the control stick or a control system jam. The latter was assumed to be the case as no evidence for Bancroft-Wilson having an issue with flight controls could be found. The spin which the aircraft entered into could have been deliberately manipulated into happening by the setup of the rudder and control inputs. If this was the case, it would mean an unknown factor played a part in affecting Bancroft-Wilson's mental and physical performance for the duration of the display.\n\n\nOther conclusions\nBiggin Hill Airport installed a telephone line between the FCC and the ATC tower in response to the communication issues that contributed to the airshows disasters.\n\n\nReactions\nIn the weeks after the crash, residents of Biggin Hill were reported as being divided in their opinions on whether the Biggin Hill Airshow should continue, however they unanimously agreed that the weekend had been a terrible tragedy. Two inquest coroner's juries were held at South London Coroner's Court to return verdicts of accidental death. Sir Kenneth Hayr's son Julian was in attendance. Deputy Coroner John Sampson adjourned both hearings until the crashes had been examined. There was wider public shock, with many questioning the safety of these types of airshows. Despite the accidents, a spokesperson for the airshow maintained that \"the show has had a very good reputation for safety\" and that \"safety is of paramount importance to us as owners and operators of Biggin Hill\". Vampire co-pilot Jonathan Kerr's family made a statement describing him as a person who lived for his passion and died living it. They also acknowledged his personal ambition to reassemble and fly his own Vampire.\nDespite the two fatal accidents and minor incidents, the Biggin Hill Airshow was held the following year in 2002 and continued to be held annually by Air Displays International, who had run the airshow since 1982. After this, they handed over responsibility of running the show to the airport itself. It continued to be hosted until 2011, where it was then replaced by an open house air day.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

Kalpana is fascinated by Mookaiyan's prowess; her mother disapproves of Kalpana's emotional reaction while her father is happy. Bama settles a young man of Madurai to marry Kalpana. Moved by the pleas of Chockalingam, Mookaiyan goes to the bridegroom's house and brings back Kalpana, saying that he has the right by birth to marry her.\nMarried life starts well for Mookaiyan and Kalpana, but before long differences arise because of their different backgrounds. At Kalpana's birthday party, Mookaiyan objects to drinking and dancing by her hippie friends. He beats Kalpana, and she leaves him to join her mother. A lawyer's notice for divorce is received. Mookaiyan futilely tries to make Bama understand the situation. The mother and daughter are adamant and Mookaiyan returns home determined to teach them a lesson.\nKalpana, having been impregnated by Mookaiyan some time earlier, gives birth to a child. In her anxiety to save Kalpana from further involvements, Bama leaves the child in an orphanage. Kalpana is shocked by this act of her mother. By the time she goes to recover the child, Mookaiyan has already taken it away. Kalpana beseeches her father to get the child from Mookaiyan. Unexpectedly, Mookaiyan comes there to deliver an invitation card for his marriage with his cousin Rakkamma. Kalpana and her parents are now repentant.\nKalpana goes alone to Mookaiyan's house and asks her husband to leap over their child and then tie the thali to another girl. To her surprise, Kalpana discovers that the marriage being celebrated is that of a different man named Mookaiyan, while her husband did no injustice to her; she falls at her husband's feet and the family reunites.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\nPattikada Pattanama was produced and directed by P. Madhavan, and based on the William Shakespeare comedy The Taming of the Shrew. The film's title was derived from a song from Mattukkara Velan (1970). Malayalam actress Sukumari appeared as the mother of Jayalalithaa in the film, despite being older than Jayalalithaa by only a few years. Manorama, in portraying her character, spoke in Madurai dialect. The film marked the acting debut of Shubha in Tamil. Cinematography was handled by P. N. Sundaram and the editing by R. Devarajan. The film's final length was 4,395 metres (14,419 ft).\n\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack was composed by M. S. Viswanathan, and lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The song \"Ennadi Rakkamma\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Shanmukhapriya. It was well received and remains a cult classic. The song was later remixed by D. Imman in Vaadaa (2010). D. Karthikeyan of The Hindu writing about T. M. Soundararajan mentioned that his \"folksy number Ennadi Rakkamma Pallakku from Pattikada Pattanama still makes people go crazy with its rustic beats and beautiful rendition and the song is a must in cultural festivals in Madurai\". The song \"Kettukodi\" was remixed by Kavi Periyathambi in Pandi Oliperukki Nilayam (2012).\n\n\nRelease and reception\nPattikada Pattanama was released on 6 May 1972, and distributed by Sivaji Films. The film became a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres, thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. Politician K. Kamaraj praised the film, saying it demonstrated the need to practice one's culture and the traditions of \"one wife for one husband\". The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan in a review dated 28 June 1972, praised Ganesan's energetic performance and the outdoor cinematography, but called the film a usual old wine in new bottle story. The film won two Filmfare Awards South: Best Film – Tamil and Best Actress – Tamil (Jayalalithaa), and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nDhananjayan, G.

    "text": "The 2015 myAFibRisk.com 400 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held on September 20, 2015, at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois. Contested over 267 laps on the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) intermediate speedway, it was the 27th race of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, first race of the Chase and first race of the Challenger Round. Denny Hamlin won the race, his second of the season. Carl Edwards finished second. Kurt Busch, Ryan Newman and Matt Kenseth rounded out the top–five.\nDue to qualifying being rained-out, Kevin Harvick was given the first starting spot of the race. He led 10 laps before wrecking out halfway through the race and finished 42nd. Kyle Busch led a race high of 121 laps on his way to a ninth–place finish. There were 17 lead changes among 10 different drivers, as well as six caution flag periods for 28 laps.\nThis was Denny Hamlin's 26th career win, second of the season, first at Chicagoland Speedway and fifth at the track for Joe Gibbs Racing. The win moved Hamlin up to second in the points trailing teammate Matt Kenseth by two. Despite being the winning manufacturer, Toyota left Chicagoland trailing Chevrolet by 49–points in the manufacturer standings.\nThe myAFibRisk.com 400 was carried by NBC Sports on the cable/satellite NBCSN network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the Motor Racing Network and Sirius XM NASCAR Radio.\n\n\nReport\n\n\nBackground\n\nChicagoland Speedway is a 1.5 miles (2.4 km) tri-oval speedway in Joliet, Illinois, southwest of Chicago. The speedway opened in 2001 and currently hosts NASCAR racing including the opening event in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. Until 2011, the speedway also hosted the IndyCar Series, recording numerous close finishes including the closest finish in IndyCar history. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation and located adjacent to Route 66 Raceway.\nJimmie Johnson entered Chicagoland tied with Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth for the points lead at 2,012–points. Joey Logano entered three–points back. Kevin Harvick, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kurt Busch and Carl Edwards entered tied for fifth six–points back. Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr. and Denny Hamlin entered tied for ninth nine–points back. Jamie McMurray, Jeff Gordon, Ryan Newman, Paul Menard and Clint Bowyer entered tied for 12th 12–points back.\n\n\nChange to restart officiating\nFollowing complaints of Matt Kenseth jumping the final restart at Richmond, NASCAR decided to add a camera feed and official with the sole purpose of monitoring the restart zone.\n\n\nNASCAR record\nWhen the green flag flies on Sunday, Jeff Gordon – who made his first career Sprint Cup Series start in the 1992 Hooters 500 at what was then Atlanta International Raceway (now Atlanta Motor Speedway) – tied Ricky Rudd's record for most consecutive starts at 788. The 23–year veteran of the sport will break the tie next weekend at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. “I’ve got to get through this weekend first,” he said. “That’s one of those things where I feel a little strange talking about it because I do appreciate and respect the safety of this sport. (That) side can be taken away from you at any time. I want to break that record. I think it’s a huge accomplishment because it’s not easy to do. It’s easier today because the sport is safer. I look at Ricky Rudd and what he went through to make it. That is pretty extraordinary. I can’t quite compare that.”\n\n\nEntry list\nThe entry list for the myAFibRisk.com 400 was released on Sunday, September 13 at 11:49 a.m. Eastern time. Forty-six cars were entered for the race. All but Ryan Blaney in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford were entered for the previous week's race at Richmond. The two driver changes for this weekend's race were Travis Kvapil returning to the No. 30 Chevrolet for The Motorsports Group and Josh Wise returning to the No. 32 Go FAS Racing Ford.\n\n\nFirst practice\nKevin Harvick was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 28.675 and a speed of 188.317 mph (303.067 km/h).\n\n\nQualifying\n\nThree rounds of knockout qualifying took place at 6:45 p.m., but heavy rain forced the session to be cancelled and the starting lineup was set by first practice times according to the NASCAR rulebook. As a result, Kevin Harvick was awarded the first starting spot for the race. He was joined on the front row by Joey Logano. \"We haven’t been in race trim yet,\" Logano said. \"We stayed in qualifying trim all day today and I felt like it was qualifying during practice. We were really trying to top the charts. We really felt like that was where we would be starting at the end of practice. Obviously this storm is huge and we didn’t have a shot in hell of making qualifying happen.” “It is a lot better than last year when we started 25th,\" Brad Keselowski – who started third – said. \"We will take that and move on. The car has been pretty good so far so I feel good about that.\" Ryan Blaney, Travis Kvapil and Michael McDowell failed to qualify for the race.\n\n\nQualifying results\n\n\nPractice (post-qualifying)\n\n\nSecond practice\nMartin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 29.458 and a speed of 183.312 mph (295.012 km/h).\n\n\nFinal practice\nMartin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 29.213 and a speed of 184.849 mph (297.486 km/h).\n\n\nRace\n\n\nFirst half\n\n\nStart\nUnder clear blue Illinois skies, Kevin Harvick led the field to the green flag at 3:18 p.m. He edged out Joey Logano to lead the first lap. The first caution of the race flew on the second lap when A. J. Allmendinger came down across the nose of Denny Hamlin and went spinning in turn 3. Trying to avoid ramming the No. 47 car, Hamlin got loose on the high-side, spun out and slid down the race track. He didn't suffer any damage and he continued on racing.\nThe race restarted on lap 7. Martin Truex Jr. forced Harvick up the track to take the lead the next lap. By lap 15, Austin Dillon was pressuring him for the top spot, but got loose in turn 3 and lost the second position to Harvick. By lap 23, Harvick pulled up next to Truex and edged out front but the No. 78 car beat him back to the line. By lap 36, Kyle Busch, now in second place, began to pressure Truex for the lead. Finally, Busch slid up in front of him to take the lead on lap 47. A number of cars began hitting pit road on lap 52 and Busch hit pit road from the lead on lap 54. In a rare circumstance, the lead didn't change at all through the cycle. Alex Bowman and Carl Edwards were both tagged for speeding on pit road and they had to serve drive-through penalties.\n\n\nSecond quarter\nWhen the pit cycle was over, Busch began driving away from the field. 20 laps later, Harvick began to run him down. However, lapped traffic prevented him from getting close to the leader. On lap 87, Kurt Busch, running fifth at the time, made an unscheduled stop after slamming the wall in turn 3. Despite this, the race continued under green. Another round of green flag pit stops began on lap 100 and Ky. Busch surrendered the lead to make his stop on lap 106 and handed it to Dale Earnhardt Jr. He pitted the next lap to give the lead back to Busch. Debris on the backstretch brought out the second caution of the race on lap 123.\nThe race restarted on lap 129. Harvick edged out Busch on the backstretch and took the lead. The third caution of the race flew on lap 130 when Dillon blew his right-front tire out and slammed the wall in turn 2. He would go on to finish 43rd 69–laps down.\n\n\nSecond half\n\n\nHalfway\nThe race restarted on lap 135. Harvick spun the tires on the restart and lost the lead to Kyle Busch. Joey Logano hit the rear of Jimmie Johnson's car and forced him onto the apron. Johnson then made contact with Harvick and damaged his left-rear fender. His left-rear tire blew out and sent his car backwards into the turn 3 wall, bringing out the fourth caution on lap 137. “I got a pretty good restart and obviously (Joey Logano) and (Johnson) got a run. I just held my line and (Johnson) just slammed into the side of my door,” Harvick explained. \"That was pretty much it.” “He didn’t leave me any space,” Johnson explained after the race. “He was pinning me down, and I had to get back up on the track. I wouldn’t say that what he did was any different than other situations I’ve been in like that. When you are in his position, you want to get the inside car in a bad angle so they have to lift. I was fine with lifting, but I had to get back on the race track, so I worked my way back up on the track.”\nThe race restarted on lap 145. Busch spun the tires on the start and lost the lead to Jeff Gordon. It was the first restart that prompted a review by NASCAR and they found that it was a clean restart. He was the first to hit pit road on lap 184 and handed the lead to Kurt Busch. Kurt pitted the next lap and give the lead to brother Kyle Busch. Kyle pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Kyle Larson. Larson pitted two laps later and handed the lead to Carl Edwards. Debris in turn 4 brought out the fifth caution of the race on lap 191. Kyle Busch opted not to pit and assumed the lead.\n\n\nFourth quarter\n\nThe race restarted with 71 laps to go. After drag racing through the front stretch, Kurt Busch passed his brother for the lead with 46 laps to go. Edwards began the final cycle of pit stops with 29 laps to go. Kurt Busch pitted with 28 laps to go and handed the lead to Hamlin. Hamlin pitted with 24 laps to go and handed the lead to teammate Matt Kenseth. Kenseth hit pit road with 23 laps to go and the lead cycled back to Kurt Busch. Allmendinger was tagged for speeding on pit road and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty. Debris in turn 2 brought out the sixth caution of the race with 10 laps to go. The debris were pieces of a brake rotor that came from the No. 83 car of Matt DiBenedetto. \"Did the yellow even need to come out? I don't even know,\" Kurt Busch said after the race. He, Gordon and Hamlin opted to stay out while the rest of the lead lap cars opted to pit.\nThe race restarted with five laps to go. Gordon got a good start on Kurt, but he was passed underneath by Hamlin, forced up the track and ultimately finished 14th. Denny drove on to score his 26th career victory.\n\n\nPost-race\n\n\nDriver comments\n“This team doesn’t give up, that’s a perfect example today,” Hamlin said. “Fast race cars are what we have and that was why we were able to come back and win today from that early trouble.”\n\"I'll tell you what, my guys just do a great job on pit road, they really do,\" Edwards said. \"Darian never loses his cool ever. He played the game perfectly with pit strategy. Then at the end, truly, once we got into Turn 1 on the final restart, I was like, I got this thing. I got better tires than all these guys. Kurt (Busch) was unbelievable on old tires. Then I thought, Denny is mine, he's a sitting duck. He drove the wheels off of that thing. He really hung on with those tires that he had.\"\n“...overall, I’m really proud of this team and everybody at Haas Automation and Stewart Haas Racing,” Kurt Busch said. “This Chevy was fast. It was fast enough to win. When the caution came out there at the end, I thought we had the right strategy, but we didn’t. But this is a point’s day. This is a long journey through these next 10 weeks. We weren’t given a hall pass now, through Loudon and through Dover. We’ve just got to work hard as a team and saddle-up. This isn’t just a win and take a couple of weeks off, but we had a winning car today. It’s kind of a shame. We had a good run at Fontana earlier this year and it kind of ended up the same way.”\n“We had a really good car. We were good most of the race and then that one caution came out after we pitted we went a lap down,” Ryan Newman said after a fourth-place finish. “The next restart we had a bad restart and it looked like we were done and that was it.”\n“I didn’t choose the right direction to go,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said after a 12th-place finish. “I thought we would all jump to the top and go around those guys, and we’d be good. But Jeff slid up in front of us and we all had to stop and everybody was going by us on the bottom. Those late restarts with those guys up there on used tires are just going to be bad. You just have to get lucky and we didn’t get lucky. Not anything there about skill, it is all luck. … We had a good day going and … cautions throw all that work out the window.”\n\"I knew we were going to have a tough time not spinning the tires,\" Gordon said about the final restart after a 14th-place finish in his record-tying 788th consecutive career start. \"Especially when you're on the front row. So, I was just trying to hold pace with Kurt. I knew that Denny was behind me on older tires as well, so I was somewhat encouraged by that.\"\n\"I'm just really proud of everybody on our...team for not giving up and doing all the things they had to do to get the car back on the track,\" Harvick said after a disappointing 42nd-place finish. \"...we've just got to go win one of these [next two] races.\"\n\n\nConfrontation\n\nFollowing the race, Jimmie Johnson went to Kevin Harvick's motorhome in the driver's lot to talk the incident over with the driver of the No. 4 Chevrolet. But when he got to Harvick's motorhome, he was greeted with a punch to the chest. The situation had to be diffused by Harvick's business manager Josh Jones and wife DeLana. They escorted him to a waiting white SUV and drove off from the race track.\nAfterwards, Johnson said that he \"assume[d] he would try to find it [as] my fault. I just simply needed the lane to get back on the racetrack. By no means was I trying to do anything different. I've seen him on the flat working his way back up looking for a racing lane. That is what I was doing. I was on the bottom trying to get back up on the racing surface, and he was trying to pin me down and I had to get back up or else it would have been a hell of a mess.\"\nJoey Logano, who appeared to make contact with No. 48 Chevrolet, said that he never touched him or forced him down onto the apron going into turn 1. \"I don't know. I was a little behind it,\" said Logano, who finished sixth in the Chase opener. \"I just saw the 48 go three-wide bottom, and I was just trying to protect my position and figure out what lane I wanted to go in from there.\"\nIn his weekly appearance on the Sirius XM NASCAR Radio program The Morning Drive, NASCAR Executive Vice–President and Chief Racing Development Officer Steve O'Donnell told Mike Bagley and Pete Pistone that “there won’t be any penalties ” issued for the confrontation and explained the sanctioning body's reason behind the decision.\n\n\nPenalties\nOn the Wednesday following the race, NASCAR issued penalties to the No. 10 Stewart-Haas Racing team and No. 15 Michael Waltrip Racing team.\n\nThe No. 10 team was penalized for an infraction that occurred during pre-qualifying inspection on September 18. This is a P2 level penalty (Sections 12.1 and 20.4b and 20.4.2a of the NASCAR rule book). The right side quarter panel behind the rear wheel/tire was modified during pre-qualifying inspection. Crew chief Daniel Knost was placed on NASCAR probation through December 31, 2015. Car chief Pete White was placed on NASCAR probation through December 31.\nThe No. 15 team was penalized for an infraction that occurred on opening day inspection September 18. This is a P4 level penalty (Section 12.1, 20. 14.c, 20.14.2.1.k, 12.5.3.4.d, 12.5.3.4.1.d & f, 12.5.3.4.2 of the NASCAR rule book). Crew chief Billy Scott was fined 75–thousand dollars, suspended for the next three NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Championship events and placed on NASCAR probation for six months following the issue of suspension. Driver Clint Bowyer has been penalized 25–points. Car owner Rob Kauffman has been penalized 25 owner points.\nMichael Waltrip Racing released a statement saying that it \"respectfully disagrees\" with the penalties and would immediately appeal. \"MWR has made mistakes in the past, but we feel we are correct in this instance,\" the team said. \"We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the appeals committee and have no further public comment until the process is completed.\"\nNASCAR requested to the Appeals Administrator of the National Motorsports Appeals Panel that the appeals process described in the rule book be expedited.\nOn Wednesday, September 30, the National Motorsports Appeal Panel upheld the penalty levied against the team. The team decided not to make a final appeal and released a statement that said they were \"disappointed with the outcome of today’s ruling and still feel our interpretation is within the guidelines. Rather than continue the appeals process, MWR is ready to focus 100 percent of our company’s resources on winning at Dover and trying to advance to the Contender Round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.\"\n\n\nRace results\n\n\nRace statistics\n17 lead changes among 10 different drivers\n6 cautions for 28 laps\nTime of race: 2 hours, 51 minute, 30 seconds\nAverage speed: 140.117 mph (225.496 km/h)\nDenny Hamlin took home $306,315 in winnings\n\n\nRace awards\nCoors Light Pole Award: No winner\n3M Lap Leader: Kyle Busch (121 laps)\nAmerican Ethanol Green Flag Restart Award: Kyle Busch\nDuralast Brakes \"Bake In The Race\" Award: Kevin Harvick\nFreescale \"Wide Open\": Kurt Busch\nIngersoll Rand Power Move: Ryan Newman (5 positions)\nMAHLE Clevite Engine Builder of the Race: Toyota Racing Development, #11\nMobil 1 Driver of the Race: Kyle Busch (130.6 driver rating)\nMoog Steering and Suspension Problem Solver of The Race: Kurt Busch (crew chief Tony Gibson (0.519 seconds))\nNASCAR Sprint Cup Leader Bonus: No winner: rolls over to $240,000 at next event\nSherwin-Williams Fastest Lap: Kyle Busch (Lap 136, 29.572, 182.605 mph (293.874 km/h))\nSunoco Rookie of The Race: Brett Moffitt\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nTelevision\nNBCSN covered the race on the television side.

There were 17 lead changes among 10 different drivers, as well as six caution flag periods for 28 laps.\nThis was Denny Hamlin's 26th career win, second of the season, first at Chicagoland Speedway and fifth at the track for Joe Gibbs Racing. The win moved Hamlin up to second in the points trailing teammate Matt Kenseth by two. Despite being the winning manufacturer, Toyota left Chicagoland trailing Chevrolet by 49–points in the manufacturer standings.\nThe myAFibRisk.com 400 was carried by NBC Sports on the cable/satellite NBCSN network for the American television audience.

    "text": "Emanuele Belardi (born 9 October 1977) is a retired Italian footballer who was a goalkeeper.\n\n\nClub career\n\n\nReggina\nBelardi started his career as a youth member at Reggina Calcio, before he was promoted to the club's first team in 1995. After two seasons with both first team and reserve, Belardi was loaned out to Turris for the 1997–98 Serie C1 season. With Turris, the keeper managed to make 18 appearances, before returning to Calabria in the summer of 1998, following the expiration of his loan deal. He would remain at Reggina, for the next 6 seasons, totalling 103 league appearances for the club, before being loaned out to another Serie C1 club Napoli Soccer, in 2004. He made 16 starts for the club that season. In January 2005 he moved to Modena F.C. of Serie B to play as a backup keeper. Following his return to Reggio Calabria on 1 July 2005, he was again loaned out. This time, Belardi moved to Serie B club, F.C. Catanzaro. He was the starting keeper for the club, and made 36 appearances during the season.\n\n\nJuventus\nBelardi was jointed newly relegated Juventus FC in summer 2006 on free transfer (relegated due to 2006 Italian football scandal), to serve as a third choice goalkeeper behind Gianluigi Buffon, and Antonio Mirante. He signed a contract until 30 June 2009. Despite failing to make a single appearance during the entire 2006–07 Serie B season, Belardi became the second choice keeper to Italian International, Buffon, after Mirante was loaned out to U.C. Sampdoria. He made 5 league appearances, along with a select number of Coppa Italia matches for Juve during an injury spell to Buffon between December 2007 and January 2008.\nHowever, during the 2008/2009 Summer Transfer Market, it was realized that Juventus were in search of a new back-up goalkeeper, as the club felt that Belardi was shaky in goal when given the opportunity, while both Jess Vanstrattan and Cristiano Novembre were deemed too inexperienced. Veteran keeper Antonio Chimenti was brought back to the Turin-based club, on loan from Udinese Calcio in July 2008. In return, Belardi was sent to Udinese, in exchange, also on a loan deal. On 5 August 2008, Juventus purchased Alexander Manninger, who will replace Belardi as Buffon's back-up, while Chimenti will become third choice, replacing Vanstrattan, who was sent back to Hellas Verona F.C. and eventually sold to Gold Coast United of the Australian League. Novembre also was released as a free agent. Therefore, 3 of 4 goalkeepers were replaced at Juventus following the 2007–08 Serie A season, only excluding Buffon.\n\n\nUdinese\nIn January 2009 the swap deal of Belardi to Udinese and Antonio Chimenti to Juventus became permanent. After his transfer to Udinese, Belardi had served as a back-up goalkeeper to Samir Handanovic, and had made select appearances for the northern club. Uniquely for a goalkeeper he wore the number 6 for his squad number. On 26 November 2011, his contract was terminated and he became a free agent.\n\n\nReggina, Cesena, Grosseto\nAgain, in 2012, he returns to Reggio Calabria to play with Reggina that challenges in Serie B. In July 2012 he moved to newly relegated Serie B team A.C. Cesena in 1-year deal. On 28 December 2012 he terminated his contract with Cesena and on 31 January 2013 signed by U.S. Grosseto F.C..\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nProfile at La Gazzetta (2007–08 (in Italian)\nReggina profile(in Italian)\nSerie B profile (in Italian)\nFootball.it profile (in Italian)",

    "text": "Baynard Hardwick Kendrick (April 8, 1894 – March 22, 1977) was an American mystery novelist. He wrote whodunit novels about Duncan Maclain, a blind private investigator who worked with his two German shepherds and his household of assistants to solve murder mysteries. The novels were the basis for two films starring Edward Arnold, Eyes in the Night (1942) and The Hidden Eye (1945). Kendrick was credited by Stirling Silliphant for being the source of the Longstreet character about a blind insurance investigator. He also wrote using the pseudonym Richard Hayward.\n\n\nBiography\nKendrick was born in Philadelphia and traveled to Canada as the first American citizen to enlist in the Canadian Army during World War I. He served in England, France, and Salonika. During his service, a fellow Philadelphian serving with the Canadians was blinded. When Kendrick visited him at St Dunstan's he met a blind English soldier who had a remarkable ability to tell him things about himself that a sighted person may not have noticed. The Tommy fingered Kendrick's buttons, uniform and insignia and accurately and rapidly stated Kendrick's war service record.\nFollowing the war, Kendrick sold his first story to Field and Stream magazine while earning his living at Bin and Big's Hotels in New York. In 1931 he was let go from the company a week before Christmas and, vowing never again to work for an employer, began supporting himself by writing. After three books Kendrick started writing for pulp magazines, which paid well.\nKendrick's writing reflected two personal interests that he had developed: an interest in blind people and their coping skills and an interest in the history of Florida.\nDuring World War II, Kendrick served as an instructor for blinded veterans giving him the material for his books \n\"Bright Victory\" and Lights Out. \"Bright Victory\" was turned into an excellent movie in 1951, starring Arthur Kennedy.\nHis novel Out of Control was adapted to an episode of the radio thriller series Suspense in 1946, featuring Brian Donlevy as Duncan Maclain.\nThe true story behind Kendrick's 1959 Hot Red Money was the basis for John Barron's Operation SOLO: The FBI's Man in the Kremlin.\nKendrick was one of the founders of the Mystery Writers of America, held its first membership card, and was its first president.\nHe died in 1977.\n\n\nDuncan Maclain novels\nNovels in the Duncan Maclain series:\n\nThe Last Express (1937).

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=142716",
    "text": "The kazoo is a musical instrument that adds a buzzing timbral quality to a player's voice when the player vocalizes into it. It is a type of mirliton (itself a membranophone), one of a class of instruments that modify the player's voice by way of a vibrating membrane of goldbeater's skin or material with similar characteristics. There is a smaller version of the kazoo, known as a humazoo.\n\n\nPlaying\nA kazoo player hums, rather than blows, into the wider and flattened side of the instrument. The oscillating air pressure of the hum makes the kazoo's membrane vibrate. The resulting sound varies in pitch and loudness with the player's humming. Players can produce different sounds by singing specific syllables such as doo, too, who, or vrrrr into the kazoo.\n\n\nHistory\n\n Simple membrane instruments played by vocalizing, such as the onion flute, have existed since at least the 16th century. It is claimed that Alabama Vest, an African-American in Macon, Georgia, invented the kazoo around 1840, although there is no documentation to support that claim.  The story originated with the Kaminsky International Kazoo Quartet, a group of satirical kazoo players,  which may cast doubt on the veracity of the story, as does the name \"Alabama Vest\" itself.\nIn 1879, Simon Seller received a patent for a \"Toy Trumpet\" that worked on the same principle as a kazoo: \"By blowing through the tube A, and at the same time humming a sort of a head sound, a musical vibration is given to the paper covering c over the aperture b, and a sound produced pleasing to the ear.\"  Seller's \"toy trumpet\" was basically a hollow sheet-metal tube, with a rectangular aperture cut out along the length of the tube, with paper covering the aperture, and a funnel at the end, like the bell of a trumpet.  The first documented appearance of a kazoo was that created by an American inventor, Warren Herbert Frost, who named his new musical instrument kazoo in his patent #270,543 issued on January 9, 1883. The patent states, \"This instrument or toy, to which I propose to give the name 'kazoo' \"...\" Frost's kazoo did not have the streamlined, submarine shape of modern kazoos, but it was similar in that the aperture was circular and elevated above the length of the tube. In 1897, Milan Agrawal patented a wooden instrument similar to a kazoo, though it remained obscure and saw little use. The modern kazoo—also the first one made of metal—was patented by George D. Smith of Buffalo, New York,  May 27, 1902.\nIn 1916, the Original American Kazoo Company in Eden, New York started manufacturing kazoos for the masses in a two-room shop and factory, utilizing a couple of dozen jack presses for cutting, bending and crimping metal sheets. These machines were used for many decades. By 1994, the company produced 1.5 million kazoos per year and was the only manufacturer of metal kazoos in North America. The factory, in nearly its original configuration, is now called The Kazoo Factory and Museum. It is still operating, and it is open to the public for tours.\nIn 2010, The Kazoo Museum opened in Beaufort, South Carolina with exhibits on kazoo history.\n\n\nProfessional usage\n\nThe kazoo is played professionally in jug bands and comedy music, and by amateurs everywhere. It is among the acoustic instruments developed in the United States, and one of the easiest melodic instruments to play, requiring only the ability to vocalize in tune. In North East England and South Wales, kazoos play an important role in juvenile jazz bands. During Carnival, players use kazoos in the Carnival of Cádiz in Spain and in the corsos on the murgas in Uruguay.\n\nIn the Original Dixieland Jass Band 1921 recording of Crazy Blues, what the casual listener might mistake for a trombone solo is actually a kazoo solo by drummer Tony Sbarbaro.\nRed McKenzie played kazoo in a Mound City Blue Blowers 1929 film short.  The Mound City Blue Blowers had a number of hit kazoo records in the early 1920s featuring Dick Slevin on metal kazoo and Red McKenzie on comb and tissue paper (although McKenzie also played metal kazoo). The vocaphone, a kind of kazoo with a trombone-like tone, was occasionally featured in Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. Trombonist-vocalist Jack Fulton played it on Whiteman's recording of Vilia (1931) and Frankie Trumbauer's Medley of Isham Jones Dance Hits (1932). The Mills Brothers vocal group originally started in vaudeville as a kazoo quartet, playing four-part harmony on kazoo with one brother accompanying them on guitar.\nThe kazoo is rare in European classical music. It does appear in David Bedford's With 100 Kazoos, where, rather than having professionals play the instrument, kazoos are handed out to the audience, who accompany a professional instrumental ensemble. Leonard Bernstein included a segment for kazoo ensemble in the First Introit (Rondo) of his Mass. The kazoo was used in the 1990 Koch International and 2007 Naxos Records recordings of American classical composer Charles Ives' Yale-Princeton Football Game, where the kazoo chorus represents the football crowd's cheering. The brief passages have the kazoo chorus sliding up and down the scale as the \"cheering\" rises and falls.\nIn Frank Loesser's score for the 1961 Broadway musical comedy How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, several kazoos produce the effect of electric razors used in the executive washroom during a dance reprise of the ballad I Believe in You.\nIn 1961, Del Shannon's \"So Long Baby\" issued on Big Top Records featured a kazoo on the instrumental break. In addition to the single release it featured on the UK London American release of his album Hats Off To Del Shannon. Joanie Sommers' 1962 hit single \"Johnny Get Angry\" featured a kazoo ensemble in its instrumental bridge, as did Dion's hit of the same year, \"Little Diane\", and Ringo Starr's 1973 cover of \"You're Sixteen\".\nJesse Fuller's 1962 recording of his song \"San Francisco Bay Blues\" features a kazoo solo, as does Eric Clapton's 1992 recording of the song on MTV's Unplugged television show and album. On the song \"Alligator\" on the Grateful Dead album Anthem of the Sun, three members of the band play kazoo together. Many Paolo Conte performances include kazoo passages.\nShort kazoo performances appear on many modern recordings, usually for comic effect. For example, in his first album, Freak Out!, Frank Zappa used the kazoo to add comic feel to some songs — including one of his best known, \"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\". In the song \"Crosstown Traffic\" from the album Electric Ladyland, Jimi Hendrix used a comb-and-paper instrument to accompany the guitar and accentuate a blown-out speaker sound. The song \"Lovely Rita\", from the Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, uses combs-and-paper instruments. Kazoo playing parodied the sound of a military brass band in the Pink Floyd song \"Corporal Clegg\".\nIn the McGuinness Flint recording When I'm Dead and Gone, Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle play kazoos in harmony during the instrumental break. The New Seekers' live track (Ever Since You Told Me That You Loved Me) I'm A Nut features a kazoo solo by singer Eve Graham.  British singer-songwriter Ray Dorset, the leader of pop-blues band Mungo Jerry, played the kazoo on many of his band's recordings, as did former member Paul King.\nOne of the best known kazooists of recent times is Barbara Stewart (1941–2011). Stewart, a classically trained singer, wrote a book on the kazoo, formed the \"quartet\" Kazoophony, performed kazoo at Carnegie Hall and on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien television show. \nThe soundtrack of the film Chicken Run, released in 2000 and composed by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams, makes use of kazoos in several pieces.\nThe video game Yoshi's New Island, released in 2014, has synthesized kazoos in several tracks of its soundtrack.\nThe Ukrainian polka band Los Colorados released a cover of Rammstein song \"Du Hast\", which features a kazoo.\nIn November 2010, Sandra Boynton produced and released a full-length 300-kazoo plus orchestra performance of Maurice Ravel's Bolero, titled Boléro Completely Unraveled, performed by the Highly Irritating Orchestra. Boynton played solo kazoo on this recording noting \"I am at the perfect level of musical incompetence for this.\"\n\n\nRecords\nOn March 14, 2011, the audience at BBC Radio 3's Red Nose Show at the Royal Albert Hall, along with a star-studded kazoo band, set a new Guinness World Record for Largest Kazoo Ensemble. The 3,910 kazooists played Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and The Dam Busters March. This surpassed the previous record of 3,861 players, set in Sydney, Australia, in 2009. The current record of 5,190 was set later the same night in a second attempt.\nOn August 9, 2010, the San Francisco Giants hosted a Jerry Garcia tribute night, in which an ensemble of an estimated 9,000 kazooists played \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\"\n\n\nSee also\n\nParty horn\nEunuch flute\nSwazzle\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nRoberto Leydi; Febo Guizzi (2002).

    "text": "Mission Health, based in Asheville, North Carolina, is the state's sixth-largest health system, serving much of western North Carolina. A sale to HCA Healthcare became final on February 1, 2019, in which it was sold as a nonprofit to a for-profit company. The proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, the Dogwood Health Trust, which plans to distribute annual grants focused on healthcare.\n\nMission Health, which traces its roots in the region back to 1885, operates six hospitals, numerous outpatient and surgery centers, home health provider CarePartners, and the region's only dedicated Level II trauma center. Its medical staff consists of more than 1,000 physicians and is certified in more than 50 medical specialties and sub-specialties. Mission Health has seven Centers of Excellence: Cancer, Heart, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, Trauma, Women's Health, and Mission Children's Hospital, the region's only children's hospital.\nMission Hospital, located in Asheville, is the system's flagship hospital and is licensed for 815 beds. It is the regional referral center for tertiary and quaternary care.\nOther Mission Health member hospitals include Angel Medical Center in Franklin, Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine, Highlands-Cashiers Hospital in Highlands, McDowell Hospital in Marion and Transylvania Regional Hospital in Brevard.\n\n\nHistory\nMission Hospital traces its roots to 1885, when a group of women calling themselves \"The Little Flower Mission\" saw a need for a hospital in Asheville that would care for those in need, regardless of their ability to pay. They raised funds by selling flowers on the streets of the city, started their hospital in a rented five-room house on what is now Biltmore Avenue near Hilliard Avenue, and expanded and relocated four times in the next seven years. By 1940, there were five small general hospitals in the city, but medical professionals had begun to see the need for a major medical center for western North Carolina. In 1947, Mission Hospital merged with Biltmore Hospital, a facility that was established in 1896 by the All Soul's Parish. A new hospital was constructed on land donated by George Vanderbilt, a facility that was renamed Memorial Mission Hospital.\nOver time, Memorial Mission Hospital absorbed Victoria Hospital (formerly called Norburn Hospital, founded in 1928) and the Asheville Colored Hospital (founded in 1943).\nMemorial Mission Medical Center and St. Joseph's Hospital established an organizational partnership in 1996 and formally merged in 1998 as Mission-St. Joseph's Health System.\n\n\nSt. Joseph's Hospital\n\nSt. Joseph's Hospital was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1900 as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis. It functioned out of a house on French Broad Avenue and was moved to Starnes Street before the sisters purchased what became its permanent location in 1909, at that time a large house belonging to William Wallace McDowell, a Confederate major who established a militia from Western North Carolina during the Civil War. The hospital expanded its services and facilities over the years and was declared a general hospital in 1939. After numerous expansions, a more modern facility was built in 1974.\n\n\nMemorial Mission Hospital\n\nAfter the consolidation of the smaller hospitals and the merger of Mission and Memorial Hospitals, Memorial Mission Hospital began operations with the hospitals on Reed Street and Woodfin Street in Asheville North Carolina. In 1951, the Biltmore Hospital facility was closed and construction began on a new hospital on Biltmore Avenue, across the street from St. Joseph's, and was dedicated in March 1954. As technology advanced and medical procedures were becoming very complicated and expensive, Memorial Mission began looking towards St. Joseph's in the hopes of combining operations.\n\n\nBecoming Mission Health\nFollowing Memorial Mission's purchase of St. Joseph's from the Sisters of Mercy in 1998,  Memorial Mission acquired McDowell Hospital in Marion and Blue Ridge Community Hospital in Spruce Pine.   Mission Health was the state's sixth-largest health system and the western North Carolina’s only not-for-profit, independent community hospital system governed and managed exclusively in western North Carolina.\n\n\nPurchase by HCA\nThe $1.5 billion sale of Mission Health to the for-profit HCA Healthcare, announced in March 2018, was completed on February 1, 2019.\nSince the purchase was finalized, there has been a stark rise in the number of complaints from patients and staff alike regarding the hospital - including, but not limited to, long wait times in the emergency department, chronic understaffing, broken equipment, unsanitary conditions, patients lying in feces for extended periods of time, medication administration being delayed for hours at a time, nurses taking on twice their normal workload, and doctors leaving due to pay disputes. \n\n\nCurrent operations\nMission Hospital is a general medical and surgical facility and teaching hospital that serves the people of Asheville, Buncombe County, and much of Western North Carolina from three locations: Mission Hospital, Mission Hospital-St. Joseph's campus and Mission Children's Hospital with more than 50 specialties. \nMission Hospital serves 18 counties of western North Carolina with six hospitals, one post-acute care rehab hospital, more than 100 physician practices, and five walk-in urgent care locations.\n\n\nAccolades\nIn 2020, Mission Hospital achieved Magnet recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center. That made it the only Magnet-recognized medical center in western North Carolina. The hospital was re-certified in 2025. As of 2025, Mission is the only hospital in North Carolina to be included on Healthgrades' list of America's Best Hospitals. The medical center has made the list every year since 2016. In 2025, Mission Hospital ranked among the top ten hospitals in the state according to U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Rankings. It was the only hospital in western North Carolina to place on the list.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMission Health",

    "text": "Film is a 1965 short film written by Samuel Beckett, his only screenplay. It was commissioned by Barney Rosset of Grove Press. Writing began on 5 April 1963 with a first draft completed within four days. A second draft was produced by 22 May and a 40-leaf shooting script followed thereafter. It was filmed in New York City in July 1964. Beckett and Alan Schneider originally wanted Charlie Chaplin, Zero Mostel and Jack MacGowran; however, they eventually did not get involved. Beckett then suggested Buster Keaton. James Karen, who was to have a small part in the film, also supported having Keaton. The filmed version differs from Beckett's original script but with his approval since he was on set all the time, this being his only visit to the United States, as stated in the script printed in Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (Faber and Faber, 1984).\nIt was remade by the British Film Institute (1979, 16 mm, 26 minutes) without Beckett's supervision, as Film: a screenplay by Samuel Beckett. David Rayner Clark directed Max Wall.\nIt first appeared in print in Eh Joe and Other Writings (Faber and Faber, 1967).\n\n\nSynopsis\nThroughout the first two parts, almost everything is seen through the eye of the camera (designated in the script as E), although there are occasional moments when O's perception is seen. In the third part, much more of O's perception of the room and its contents is given. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without gauze or filters, keeping the images sharp.\n\n\nThe street\nThe film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour, it is difficult to discern what is being shown, but it is alive. As it moves, it is shown to be an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still. As the camera begins to pan right and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in Lower Manhattan). It is summer, though it is hard to tell. The camera's movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall.\nSuddenly, the camera (E) shifts violently to the left. A man (O) is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall, and E gets a chance to focus on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. (Keaton had asked Beckett what O was wearing underneath. \"I hadn't thought of that,\" the author admitted and then proposed, \"the same coat\", which appealed to both men.) He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises he's been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him.\nNo longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle and stumbling over a railway sleeper—anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the man's hat off. E looks from the man's face to the woman's and back again. The man has a moustache and is wearing a pince-nez. They have been consulting a newspaper, which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened.\nE moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez. and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man \"opens his mouth to vituperate\" but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E as an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can not bear to look at what they have seen and turn their faces away. But what had they seen?\nThe action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.\n\n\nStairs\nThe camera cuts to the vestibule. The viewer is directly behind O. Stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his pulse and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs.\nA frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. \"She carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.\" O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. He glances up briefly to see where she is, then hides his head from view.\nAs the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs, she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.\nE chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied, he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.\n\n\nThe room\nWe find ourselves in a \"small barely furnished room.\" The man—and the camera following him from behind—survey its contents: a dog and a cat share a basket, a caged parrot and a goldfish in its bowl sit atop a small table. The walls are bare, apart from a mirror and an unframed picture pinned to the wall: a Sumerian Tell Asmar figurine with big eyes (described in the screenplay as \"the face of God the Father\"). There is also a couch with a filthy pillow, some blankets and a rug on it, a rocking chair with a \"curiously carved headrest\" and there is a window with a tattered roller blind with full-length net curtains to either side.\n\n\nPreparation of room\nSystematically, O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to 'see' him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (“a shy and uncooperative, little Chihuahua”) are – with some difficulty – ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply, the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious (e.g., as he passes the window, he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door).\nAfter all the above, he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes. He ignores them and sits. O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it, but there are \"two eyelets, well proportioned\"; he turns the folder through 90° but he's disturbed by the parrot's eye and has to get up and cover the cage with his coat. He sits again, repeats the same process with his folder and then has to get up and cover the goldfish bowl, too.\n\"Beckett initially contemplated setting Film in the evening, but had to decide against it for a practical reason: 'to remove all possibility of his putting off light in room.'\"\n\n\nPeriod in rocking chair\nFinally O sits down opposite the denuded wall, opens the folder, and takes out seven photographs of himself, which he examines in sequence:\n\n6 months old – in his mother's arms\n4 years old – kneeling in an attitude of prayer\n15 years old – in his school blazer, teaching a dog to beg\n20 years old – in his graduation gown, receiving his scroll from the Rector\n21 years old – with his arm around his fiancée\n25 years old – a newly enlisted man, with a little girl in his arms\n30 years old – looking over forty, wearing a patch over one eye and looking grim\nHe spends twice as long on pictures 5 and 6. After he looks at the seventh photograph for a few seconds, he rips it up and drops it on the floor. He then works his way through the rest of the photos in reverse order, looking at each one briefly again and then tearing it up. The photograph of him as an infant must be on a tougher mount and he has some difficulty with that one. “[I]n Beckett the distant past is always more tenacious than recent events.” Afterwards he rocks slightly, hands holding the armrests and then checks his pulse once more.\nO is now in a similar situation to the man in A Piece of Monologue, who has also destroyed all his old photographs and now stands facing a similarly blank wall.\n\n\nInvestment proper\n(See the opening two paragraphs of Richard Cave's review of the 1979 version of the film for a discussion of the possible definition of 'investment' here).\nAs O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly, O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was.\nE turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch.\nHe half starts from the chair, then stiffens. Gradually, the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old woman's faces appears on his. He is looking at himself, but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching. The man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of \"acute intentness\" on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes.\nO covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\"The greatest Irish film.\" – Gilles Deleuze\nA \"load of old bosh.\" – Dilys Powell (The Sunday Times)\nThe work is studied by and has been the subject of criticism from both film and theatre scholars, with the former tending to study the film as shot, the latter tending to study the script as written. Critical opinion is mixed, but it is generally held in higher regard by film scholars than it is by theatre or Beckett scholars. The views above represent extremes. A 'middle-ground' review would probably be \"a poor attempt by a genuine writer to move into a medium that he simply hadn't the flair or understanding of to make a success\". Beckett's own opinion was that it was an “interesting failure.”\nThe film opens and closes with close-ups of a sightless eye. This inevitably evokes the notorious opening sequence of Un Chien Andalou in which a human eye is sliced open with a razor blade. In fact, The Eye was an early title for Film, though admittedly, at that time, he had not thought of the need for the opening close-up. As a student of French literature, Beckett would have been familiar with Victor Hugo’s poem La Conscience. ‘Conscience’ in French can mean either ‘conscience’ in the English sense or ‘consciousness’ and the double meaning is important. Hugo's poem concerns a man haunted by an eye that stares at him unceasingly from the sky. He runs away from it, ever further, even to the grave, where, in the tomb, the eye awaits him. The man is Cain. He has been trying to escape consciousness of himself, the self that killed his brother, but his conscience will not let him rest. The eye/I is always present and, when he can run no further, must be faced in the tomb.\nFilm takes its inspiration from the 18th-century Idealist Irish philosopher Berkeley. At the beginning of the work, Beckett uses the famous quotation: \"esse est percipi\" (to be is to be perceived). Notably, Beckett leaves off a portion of Berkeley's edict, which reads in full: “esse est percipi aut percipere” (to be is to be perceived or to perceive). Alan Schneider, the director of Film, was once asked if he could provide an explanation that ‘the man in the street’ could understand:\n\n\"It's a movie about the perceiving eye, about the perceived and the perceiver – two aspects of the same man. The perceiver desires like mad to perceive and the perceived tries desperately to hide. Then, in the end, one wins.\"\nIn between takes on the set near the Brooklyn Bridge, Keaton told a reporter something similar, summarizing the theme as \"a man may keep away from everybody but he can't get away from himself.\"\nIn Beckett's original script, the two main characters, the camera and the man it is pursuing are referred to as E (the Eye) and O (the Object). This simplistic division might lead one to assume that the Eye is only interested in the man it is pursuing. This may be true, but it does not mean it will not have the same effect on anyone who comes in contact with it. “E is both part of O and not part of O; E is also the camera and, through the camera, the eye of the spectator as well. But E is also self, not merely O's self but the self of any person or people, specifically that of the other characters — the elderly couple [sic] and the flower-lady — who respond to its stare with that look of horror.” E is, so to speak, O's blind eye. \"He has the function of making all with whom he comes into contact self-aware.”\nO does everything physically possible to avoid being seen by others, but the only thing he can do to avoid perception by an “all seeing god” is to tear up his picture, a symbolic act, as if saying, “If I don't believe you exist you can't see me.” There is no one there to see him for what he really is other than himself and so, in this godless world, it is only fitting that E, representing O's self-perception, would appear standing where the picture has been torn from the wall. O also destroys the photographs of his past, his 'memories' of who he was. Now all that remains for O is to escape from himself - which he achieves by falling asleep until woken by E's intense gaze. The room is more figurative than literal, like many of Beckett's rooms, “as much psychological as physical, 'rooms of the mind', as one ... actor called them.”\nIf Beckett were Shakespeare he might well have written: \"To be seen or not to be seen, that is the question.\" It is an issue that concerns many of Beckett's characters. At the end of the first act of Waiting for Godot, when the boy wants to know what to tell Mr Godot, Vladimir tells him: “Tell him … (he hesitates) … tell him you saw us. (Pause.) You did see us, didn’t you?” But what happens when you are alone? The narrator of The Unnamable answers: “They depart, one by one, and the voices go on, it’s not theirs, they were never there, there was never anyone but you, talking to you about you…” The old woman in Rockaby appears to be the exact opposite of O but although she actively seeks to be seen by someone while O does everything to avoid perceivedness, the irony is that both characters are alone with only themselves for company.\nBeckett's script has been interpreted in various ways. R. C. Lamont writes that \"Film deals with the apprenticeship to death, the process of detaching oneself from life. Like the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it teaches the gradual dissolution of self. The veiling of the windows and mirrors, the covering of the birdcage – the extinction of light, reflection and light – are so many ritualistic steps to be taken before final immobility, the resignation of the end.” At the end of Film, O is seated in his rocker with his face buried in his hands; at the end of Rockaby, the old woman's head inclines forward as if, finally, she had died. The final scene in Film is also comparable to the moment in the library when the old man in That Time sees his own reflection in the glass covering a painting.\nIt could be tempting to think of O and E as a Beckettian Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde – indeed in notes for the first draft Beckett did toy “with the idea of making ‘E tall’ and ‘O short (and) fat’ which corresponds with the dual physique of Jekyll and Hyde” – but Film is not concerned with representations of good and evil, only with the concept of the second self, of pursuer and pursued.” The special relationship existing between O and E - an atypical case of Doppelgänger - constitutes what has been called \"palindromic identity.\"\nFor Linda Ben-Zvi, “Beckett does not merely reproduce the modernist critique of and anxiety over technology and the reproduction of art; he attaches 'no truth value' to his critique of technology and the reproduction of the gaze. Instead, he creates a dialogue that awakens and revitalises the uncritical perception of his audience... The work not only is predicated on the form but invariably becomes a critique of its form.\" Having written a play titled Play and a song called Song, it comes as no surprise that Beckett would entitle his first foray into cinema as Film. The title supports Ben-Zvi's interpretation in that it is a film about cinematic technology: how the movie camera and photographic images are used in Film are essential to understanding it. When he writes, “No truth value attaches to above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience”, Beckett takes the emphasis away from Berkeley's maxim thus stressing the dramatic structure of the work. The viewers are being asked to consider the work structurally and dramatically rather than emotionally or philosophically.\nFilm critic and film historian Andrew Sarris briefly mentions Film in his book, The American cinema: directors and directions, 1929-1968. Sarris discusses Film in the context of his section on the film career of Buster Keaton, writing that: \"Even Samuel Beckett contributed to the desecration of the Keaton mask by involving the actor of absurdity before its time in a dreary exercise called Film, the most pretentious title in all cinema.\"\n\n\nBeckett and Keaton\nBeckett had never seen Schneider direct any of his plays and yet continued to entrust him with the work. However, for this particular project, Beckett became personally involved. Schneider has speculated that it may simply have been the opportunity to work directly with Keaton. It has even been suggested that one inspiration for Waiting for Godot might have come from a 1949 film called The Lovable Cheat in which Keaton has a small part as a man who is convinced by the main character, who owes him money, to wait endlessly for a man named Godeau, who will pay the debt.\nWhen Schneider managed to hunt up Keaton, he found that genius of the silent screen — old, broke, ill, and alone — some $2 million ahead in a four-handed poker game with an imaginary Louis B. Mayer of MGM and two other invisible Hollywood moguls.\n“Yes, I accept the offer,\" were silent Keaton's unexpected first words to Schneider. Keaton was dying even as they made the film. \"We didn’t know that,\" Rosset told interviewer Patsy Southgate in 1990, \"but looking back at it, the signs were there. Couldn’t speak — he was not so much difficult, he just wasn’t there.\" Keaton would in fact die eighteen months after the shooting of Film.\nFrom this one might think that Keaton jumped at the chance, but this was not the case. James Karen remembers:\n\n“He had to be talked into it by Eleanor [his wife] and I remember calling and saying, ‘You know, it could be your Les Enfants du paradis. It could be that wonderful, wonderful thing.’”\nBeckett had wanted to work with Keaton several years earlier, when he offered him the role of Lucky in the American stage premiere of Waiting for Godot, but Buster turned it down. It's said that Buster didn't understand Godot and had misgivings about this script as well. Presumably this went a long way to make him think twice about this new project.\nDuring a meeting with historian and documentary filmmaker Kevin Brownlow, Beckett was quite forthcoming:\n\n“Buster Keaton was inaccessible. He had a poker mind as well as a poker face. I doubt if he ever read the text - I don't think he approved of it or liked it. But he agreed to do it and he was very competent … Of course, I had seen his silent films and enjoyed them – don't suppose I could remember them now. He had a young woman with him – his wife, who had picked him up from his alcoholism. We met him at a hotel. I tried to engage him in conversation, but it was no good. He was absent. He didn't even offer us a drink. Not because he was being unfriendly, but because it never occurred to him.”\nSchneider's recollection of that awkward first meeting confirms all of this and more: “They simply had nothing to say to each other, no worlds of any kind to share. And all of Sam's good will and my own failing efforts to get something started failed to bring them together on any level. It was a disaster.”\nBut not entirely. Although the role called for Beckett's seemingly ubiquitous bowler hat, Keaton had brought along some of his trademark flattened-down Stetsons and it was quickly agreed that he should wear one of those. On the Monday morning they “traipsed down in Joe Coffey's ancient Morgan to just beneath the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge and began the shooting.” Beckett continues:\n\n“The heat was terrible - while I was staggering in the humidity, Keaton was galloping up and down and doing whatever we asked of him. He had great endurance, he was very tough and, yes, reliable. And when you saw that face at the end - oh!’ He smiled, ‘At last’”\nBoth Beckett and Schneider were novices; Keaton a seasoned veteran. That said, “Keaton's behaviour on the set was … steady and cooperative … He was indefatigable if not exactly loquacious. To all intents and purposes, we were shooting a silent film, and he was in his best form. He encouraged [Schneider] to give him vocal directions during the shot, sometimes starting over again without stopping the camera if he felt he hadn't done something well the first time. (Nor did he believe much in rehearsal, preferring the spontaneity of performance.) Often when [the crew was] stumped over a technical problem with the camera, he came through with suggestions, inevitably prefacing his comments by explaining that he had solved such problems many times at the Keaton Studios back in 1927.”\nBoth Beckett and Schneider pronounced themselves more than pleased with Keaton's performance; the latter called him \"magnificent.\"\nKeaton's negative comments about the film are often reported but this final recollection by Schneider may redress the balance: “[W]hatever he may have subsequently said to interviewers or reporters about not understanding a moment of what he was doing or what the film was about, what I remember best of our final farewell on the set was that he smiled and half-admitted those six pages were worth doing after all.”\nIn February 1965, when on a trip to West Berlin, “in deference to his recent work with Buster Keaton, he went to see Keaton again in his 1927 film The General, finding it, however, disappointing.”\nCanadian playwright Sherry MacDonald wrote a play, The Stone Face, based on the encounter between Beckett, Keaton and Schneider.\n\n\nSee also\nNotfilm, 2015 documentary\nList of American films of 1965\nEraserhead by David Lynch\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFilm (1965) online (170mb) - UbuWeb\nFilm is available for free viewing and download at the Internet Archive\nFilm at IMDb\nBrownlow On Beckett (On Keaton) Archived 2008-03-07 at the Wayback Machine\nOn Directing Samuel Beckett’s Film – Alan Schneider\n‘Film’: a dialogue between Beckett and Berkeley – Sylvie Debevec Henning",
    "summary": "Film is a 1965 short film written by Samuel Beckett, his only screenplay. It was commissioned by Barney Rosset of Grove Press. Writing began on 5 April 1963 with a first draft completed within four days. A second draft was produced by 22 May and a 40-leaf shooting script followed thereafter. It was filmed in New York City in July 1964. Beckett and Alan Schneider originally wanted Charlie Chaplin, Zero Mostel and Jack MacGowran; however, they eventually did not get involved. Beckett then suggested Buster Keaton. James Karen, who was to have a small part in the film, also supported having Keaton. The filmed version differs from Beckett's original script but with his approval since he was on set all the time, this being his only visit to the United States, as stated in the script printed in Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (Faber and Faber, 1984).\nIt was remade by the British Film Institute (1979, 16 mm, 26 minutes) without Beckett's supervision, as Film: a screenplay by Samuel Beckett. David Rayner Clark directed Max Wall.\nIt first appeared in print in Eh Joe and Other Writings (Faber and Faber, 1967).",

    "text": "Claes Kasper Bang (Danish: [ˈkʰlɛˀs ˈpɑŋˀ]; born 28 April 1967) is a Danish actor and musician. He is best known for playing the leading role of Christian in Ruben Östlund's 2017 film The Square, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and for the role of Fjölnir in Robert Eggers's 2022 film The Northman. In 2019, he played the role of Sasha Mann for the final season of The Affair, and he rose to further international recognition by starring as Count Dracula in the BBC/Netflix series Dracula (2020). For his role in The Square, he became the first Dane to win the European Film Award for Best Actor. Bang has also developed a music career under the moniker of This Is Not America.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nClaes Kasper Bang was born in Odense on the Danish island of Funen. After his parents' divorce, he mostly lived with his father and moved home frequently, attending several schools while growing up. \nDuring his third year of high school, Bang participated in the musical Hair, that began his interest in acting, and after he left school he continued to do amateur theatre. At the age of 23, he made an application to the Danish National School of Theatre after discovering that the age limit for applying is 25. He was unsuccessful but applied again the next year and was accepted five days before his 25th birthday. He attended the school in 1992 and graduated with a diploma in 1996.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nActing\n\nBang's first theatre role after graduation was at Børneteatret Skægspire in the play Tudseakvariet, and he received his first breakthrough role in the Danish 1997 television show Taxa. \nFrom 2001 to 2004, he was a permanent member of the cast at Aalborg Teater. In 2002, he asked the theatre director for permission to perform a monologue called Ondskaben, which is based on Jan Guillou's novel Evil. After leaving the theatre in 2004, Bang bought the rights to the work so he could perform the monologue at other theatres. He has performed the monologue almost 400 times, including an English language version in Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Germany, and South Africa.\nBang starred in numerous Danish television series and films early in his career. From 2006 to 2008, he gained wide recognition (particularly in Germany) for his role in the Danish police drama Anna Pihl. He subsequently starred in several German language roles both on television (Küstenwache, SOKO Wismar, Notruf Hafenkante, Sibel & Max, and Cologne P.D.) and in film (Jungle Child, Rettet Raffi!, Alle unter einer Tanne, and Überleben an der Scheidungsfront). \nHe played the leading role of the art museum curator Christian in Ruben Östlund's 2017 film The Square, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. He also won the European Film Award for Best Actor, becoming the first Dane to do so.\nIn November 2018, Bang was cast to play Count Dracula in the BBC mini-series Dracula, created by the film-makers involved in Sherlock. In an interview for The Guardian, it was observed that, while \"sexy\" and \"insatiable\", it is also \"a very witty performance\" from Bang.\nOn 14 April 2020, it was announced that Bang would be working on the pilot of Little Room (previously called The Agoraphobics Detective Society), which was produced by Maggie Montieth and directed/written by his Dracula co-star Dolly Wells, with Suzi Ewing and Heidi Greensmith. Bang and the other cast members filmed themselves from home on Zoom, and were responsible for the props, wardrobe, hair and makeup, and sound. The pilot was released online by Pinpoint Presents on 27 May 2020, and viewers were asked to donate to The Film and Television Charity and the Motion Picture & Television Fund, to help those in the film, TV and cinema industries who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMusic\nThis Is Not America is the name of Bang's musical side project. He describes it as \"a sanctuary and a creative playground where there is no director making the decisions.\" Bang writes and composes the songs himself, and his musical style can be described as a mix of Gangway, Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode. Music videos and album art for This Is Not America are produced with help from his wife Lis Kasper Bang, née Louis-Jensen, who does the filming and photography.\nBang started composing music for fun with a recording studio on his computer in 2002. He records the piano and guitar pieces himself (he learnt these instruments when he was younger) and then programs them with other sounds on his computer. Bang chose the alias This Is Not America to circumvent DR's policy of not broadcasting tracks by actors, and to prevent his acting career from influencing how people perceive his music. The name comes from a song by David Bowie, who is one of Bang's great role models. His first three singles \"Don't Come Crying\", \"Shameless\", and \"Run\" were played on P3 for a year before the station found out that they were made by the actor, however his songs were still played on various DR radio stations for a few more years. These singles were later released on the debut album Dislocated on 7 April 2010.\nTwo of Bang's co-stars have featured on some This Is Not America tracks. In 2015, he released the single \"Still of the Night\", featuring Charlotte Munck, his co-star in the Danish police drama Anna Pihl. While filming The Square, Bang discovered that co-star and musician Marina Schiptjenko shared the same taste in music, so he showed her some of his music and sent her a few demos. Once filming finished, they recorded five songs together in his home studio in Copenhagen. So far, the duo has released \"Who Am I\", \"I Don't Care\" and \"Here We Go\".\n\n\nPersonal life\nBang met stylist and photographer Lis Louis-Jensen in 2006 while they were both working on the play Den grønne elevator at Kanonhalløj. Louis-Jensen proposed to Bang on New Year's Eve 2007, and they got married on 25 September 2010 on a canal boat in Copenhagen. Bang is stepfather to Lis' two children, Sarah and Bella. The pair have lived together in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen since 2008.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\nTheatre credits\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nAlbums\n2010: Dislocated\n\n\nEPs\n2011: EP1\n2014: Keep on Dancin\n2015: Still of the Night\n2020: Here We Go\n2020: Butterflies in December\n2020: You & I (Forever Live or Die)\n2020: No Song Left Unsung\n2020: Your Love Is Wasted on Me\n2020: Take It on the Chin\n2021: Late to the Party\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nMusic videos\n2009: \"Run\"\n2014: \"No One\"\n2015: \"I'm Not Ready Yet\"\n2018: \"Who Am I (feat.

    "text": "Alexandre Bigot (5 November 1862 – 27 April 1927) was a French ceramicist.  He was primarily a ceramics manufacturer, producing the designs of many artists and architects of the French-Belgian Art Nouveau movement, including: Jules Lavirotte, Hector Guimard, Louis Majorelle, Henri Sauvage, Henry van de Velde, Auguste Perret, Andre Arfvidson, Anatole de Baudot and more.\nBigot was a physics and chemistry instructor who became interested in ceramics in 1889 after viewing Chinese porcelain at the Exposition Universelle in Paris.  With his knowledge of chemistry, Bigot was able to create glazes with a large variety of colors and finishes.\nBigot's firm was based at Rue des Petites Ecuries, Paris and he also created a ceramics factory in Mer in 1889 which employed as many as 150 people.  Siegfried Bing, a German art dealer in Paris, displayed works by Bigot, among others, and was responsible for introducing the Art Nouveau style.  Bigot’s Parisian firm closed in 1914 due to a decline in the popularity of Art Nouveau.\n\n\nEarly life and discovery of ceramics\n\nAlexandre Bigot was trained in the sciences before eventually excelling in the arts. He obtained a degree in physics in 1884. He also held a doctorate in chemistry and was interested very early on in creating enamels resembling natural gems. After a brief stint in the studio of Paul Beyer (1873-1945) in Switzerland, and recognizing the limits imposed on setting up a laboratory in Paris, in 1889 Bigot set up his first kiln in Aunay, his hometown (today called Aulnay, now a district within the city limits of Mer. The same year, he became one of a number of artists of his generation who were attracted to the eastern ceramic wares that they saw at the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris. Among Bigot's contemporaries who saw these examples was Jean-Joseph Carriès, who like Bigot had his own studio and was engaged in research on ceramics, knowledge which he began to refine upon meeting Bigot. The two artists began a correspondence on the subject and Bigot became extremely interested in Carriès' work. Bigot's knowledge of chemistry allowed him to become an adviser to Ernest Chaplet for his sculpture and Carriès as well as a collaborator with the chemist Henry Le Chatelier. On the practical side (turning and modeling), he benefitted from the advice of Raphaël Tessier (1860-1937).\n\n\nCareer in ceramics\n\nIn 1894, Bigot presented his pieces for the first time at the Salon of the Société nationale des Beaux-Arts. The ceramics used a simple form ornamented with matte enamel using shades of yellow, green, and brown, often with the effect of crystallization. In 1895, he participated in the inaugural exposition of Siegfried Bing's La Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which gave its name to the style.\nThe year 1897 marked a turning point. Architectural ceramics were reaching the pinnacle of their popularity and Bigot took the opportunity to found his own company, A. Bigot et Cie. This enterprise, which employed up to 150 workers and counted 10 industrial kilns, produced numerous trinkets, vases and vessels which were on display in his shop, which he transferred in Paris from the rue d'Assas to the rue des Petites-Écuries.\nAlong with Emile Muller, Bigot thus became the principal figure in architectural ceramics in France, and from 1898 he worked to integrate ceramics with façades of reinforced concrete. This architectural outlet explains, by implication, the membership of his company in the Union Syndicale des architectes, but also the relaxation of the urban regulations of 1882 which favored the appearance of projecting elements, such as oriel bays, that broke up the uniformity of façades.\nThe collaboration with Hector Guimard at the end of the decade marked the beginning of Bigot's fame with architectural ceramics. Before then his work had been confined essentially to baths and restaurants. But in 1898, Guimard's Castel Beranger emerged as the manifesto of Art Nouveau in architecture and its ceramics were commissioned from Bigot, who decorated the façade with picturesque details and covered the entrance breezeway with highly plastic molded panels designed to evoke the atmosphere of a grotto. The material became thus emblematic of the new style before Art Nouveau's decline about 1910.\nBigot's work was rewarded with a Grand Prix at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris for which he collaborated with Paul Jouve and René Binet on the main entrance gate on the Champs-Elysées. The ensemble of wings enclosing the grand arch of the gate, designed by Binet, was ornamented with two superimposed friezes, executed in multicolored ceramic. The one above represented the triumph of work by the sculptor Emile Muller based on a model by Anatole Guillot; the one below was composed of a suite of animals in an Assyrian style, by Jouve and Bigot.\n\n\nCollaboration with Jules Lavirotte\n\nBeginning in 1900, the commissions multiplied for Bigot when he found an architect with whom he could showcase his talent: Jules Lavirotte. The latter was an Art Nouveau designer who espoused an eclecticisme with a pronounced taste for daring ornament and was, at the time, just as famous as Guimard. Bigot worked first on the building at 12, rue Sédillot for which his participation was still limited (a few ceramic balusters). He next worked on 3, square Rapp, the edifice on which Lavirotte turned him loose with an eclecticism that was much less restrained than the previous one. It was there that he realized these stunning lintels with suspended heads and the decoration of the staircase with the figure of an infant naiad.\n\nThe apartment house at 29 avenue Rapp, built in 1901, was truly the construction which best married the talents of Bigot and Lavirotte. In the age of the development of concrete, they searched for a substitute, comparable material for the ashlar revetment normally employed because the latter was heavy and burdensome. The crown of modernity in England and the United States was to use ceramic as a revetment, but the idea came to France later on. The first to experiment with this in France was François Hennebique (the inventor of the Hennebique system of reinforced concrete), for his own company's headquarters in 1898. In fact, when 29 avenue Rapp was built, the use of ceramic as revetment was still a novelty. This construction was the fruit of the collaboration between Lavirotte, Bigot, and Cottancin, the inventor of the process of construction in reinforced concrete using a very fine skeletal framework. The building was experimental and probably financed by the three men themselves who saw it as a showcase of their respective talents. The objective of Bigot in the building was to show that the ceramic could replace masonry, and he had recourse in this to a framework entirely of reinforced concrete. The trick lay in the weighted hollow pieces of concrete and the reinforcing iron rods in order to guarantee the solidity of the ensemble. then the edifice was covered in plates of ceramic which imitated the traditional manufacture in carved stone. Wishing to show off the talents of the artisan, Bigot produced the head of the woman surmounting the main entrance without creating a mold, firing the original work of Jean-Baptiste Larrivé directly in the kiln. This building served as a manifesto of technique and it was imitated in the coming years, definitively assuring Bigot's reputation.\nThe same trio (Bigot, Lavirotte and Cottancin) reunited in 1903 for the apartment house at 34, avenue de Wagram, also known as the Ceramic Hôtel and also integrally revetted with ceramic. The sculptures were completed by Camille Alaphilippe. It received the grand prize for the Concours des Façade of Paris in 1905. The jury of the contest, however, declared:\n\n\"The principal interest in this house is the use of brick and the enameled faïence which covers the construction from its sub-basement to the summit. The architect displays to the passers-by an ensemble of which the color is harmonious but the framework is less agreeable, seemingly made in order to defy the most free aesthetic. The jury, in declaring the author of the façade as the winner, is stuck on the question of greater freedom. One should not altogether view its decision as an encouragement of the beastly forms of the architecture...the decor in majolica can give material form to the happy effects without which there would be need to resort to the dispositions little in agreement with the genius of our French art, the most beautiful productions of which are characterized by simplicity and logical sanity.\"\n\nIn 1914, Bigot ceded direction of the company Bigot et Cie to Camille Alaphilippe in order to become a technical advisor to the ceramics industry. In the interwar period, the thirty-some employees at the plant produced mostly conduits for the canal and drainage industry.\n\n\nBigot and sculpture\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, sculpture was dominated by an overarching interest in polychromy. Ceramic thus came to play a considerable role in the field, replacing faïence, as notably seen in the Salons of 1896, 1897, and 1899, which featured numerous works made of the material. Artists were enthusiastic about this turn, most notably Alexandre Falguière, who boasted about his work La Sortie de l'École (\"Leaving the School\"): \"It's prodigious, you see, not a crack or a small deformation. That's my own work, as it left my hands, with the cuts made by my thumb and fewer by the cutting tool! And how beautiful is the bronze, more sincere, less sad and of a sweetness. The principal actors in this new development are the studios of Emile Muller and Alexandre Bigot and the greatest names in sculpture preach the technique: Falguière, Mercié, Coutan, Fagel, Marqueste, Boucher, Ringel, Injalbert, Roche, Bourdelle, Rodin...\"\nWe know little about the links between Rodin and Bigot. Rodin was very interested in ceramic and Japanese art, which he had pioneered in displays at Bing's shop and had worked on with the ceramicists such as Ernest Chapelet, Edomond Lachenal, Paul Jeaneney and Jean Carriès. Carriès was a mutual friend of Bigot and Rodin. A single letter signed by Bigot is conserved at the Musée Rodin and it consists simply of a note of congratulations on Bigot's part. It seems nonetheless that Rodin was well known by the Bigot family as eight cards were exchanged between them. While Rodin left no traces of his work with Bigot, however, the same could not be said of his student Antoine Bourdelle. the latter was extremely interested in the new developments in ceramic at the beginning of the century and created casts of his works in porcelain and in ceramic. For the ceramics, Bourdelle called on Bigot and cast his extant works with a series of works entitled Le Baiser (The Kiss), Aphrodite, and Sleeping Infant.\nCamille Alaphilippe, inspired by the possibilities of ceramics during his stay at the Villa Médicis in Rome in 1901, produced La Femme au Singe (Woman with Monkey) in 1908. It is composed of a daring assemblage of elements of gilded bronze (head and hands) and of plates of enameled ceramics, mounted on a wood and iron structure held together by a clay mortar, with the joints fabricated from colored plaster. It is likely that the work was executed in Bigot's studio as the signature is not evident, and moreover, Alaphilippe had already collaborated with Bigot on the Ceramic Hôtel in 1903 and he would assume control of A. Bigot & Cie in 1914.\n\n\nSelected works\n\n\nCastel Béranger, 1894-5\nArchitect: Hector Guimard\n\n\nParis Exhibition of 1900\nBigot fabricated René Binet’s designs for the main gateway to the Paris Exhibition of 1900.  Bigot's work was acquired in its entirety by Jenő Radisics, the director of the Budapest Museum of Applied Arts and remained in store until 2013, when much of it was displayed at the Museum.\n\n\nAvenue Rapp No. 29, 1901\nThe Lavirotte Building, designed by Jules Lavirotte, Avenue Rapp no. 29, Paris was the residence of Alexandre Bigot.\n\nIn 1901, Jules Lavirotte’s design for this won a municipal competition as the year’s best.  Its extraordinary portal is the ultimate in Art Nouveau exuberance.  The carved elements feature a central bust of a woman with flowing hair, balanced by carved naked figures rising above the sides.\n\n\nRue d'Abbeville No. 14, 1901\nArchitects: Alexandre & Edouard Autant\nSource\n\n\nAvenue De Wagram No. 34 (Ceramic Hotel), 1904\n\nThis reinforced concrete building, built by Jules Lavirotte, was nicknamed \"Ceramic Hotel\" for its glazed earthenware façade, created by Alexandre Bigot and sculpted by [Camille Alaphilippe].  Exemplifying the sensual Art Nouveau style of turn-of-the-century Paris, this residence won the city prize for the best façade of 1905.\n\n\nSaint Jean de Montmartre\nArchitect: Anatole de Baudot\n\n\nRue Franklin No. 25, 1904\nArchitect: Auguste Perret\nInfo\n\n\nRue Campagne-Premiere No. 31, 1911\nArchitect: Andre Arfidson\n\n\t\nCeramic detailing gives this industrial façade charm and helped the architect win an award for its frontage in 1911 from the Town of Paris.

    "summary": "Alexandre Bigot (5 November 1862 – 27 April 1927) was a French ceramicist.  He was primarily a ceramics manufacturer, producing the designs of many artists and architects of the French-Belgian Art Nouveau movement, including: Jules Lavirotte, Hector Guimard, Louis Majorelle, Henri Sauvage, Henry van de Velde, Auguste Perret, Andre Arfvidson, Anatole de Baudot and more.\nBigot was a physics and chemistry instructor who became interested in ceramics in 1889 after viewing Chinese porcelain at the Exposition Universelle in Paris.  With his knowledge of chemistry, Bigot was able to create glazes with a large variety of colors and finishes.\nBigot's firm was based at Rue des Petites Ecuries, Paris and he also created a ceramics factory in Mer in 1889 which employed as many as 150 people.  Siegfried Bing, a German art dealer in Paris, displayed works by Bigot, among others, and was responsible for introducing the Art Nouveau style.  Bigot’s Parisian firm closed in 1914 due to a decline in the popularity of Art Nouveau.",

    "text": "Earl Forrest Rose (September 23, 1926 – May 1, 2012) was an American forensic pathologist, professor of medicine, and lecturer of law. Rose was the medical examiner for Dallas County, Texas, at the time of the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy and he performed autopsies on J. D. Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Jack Ruby.  After being shoved by Kennedy's aides, he stepped aside and allowed Kennedy's body to be removed from Parkland Memorial Hospital without performing an autopsy.\n\n\nEarly life\nRose was born in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, on September 23, 1926, to Forest—a cowboy and rodeo rider— and Lena Berghuis Rose. He grew up on a remote ranch 26 miles from Eagle Butte on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Rose was reported to have ridden his horse five miles to get to school. According to his memoirs, he attended \"one room country grade schools\" before going to high school in Eagle Butte.\nIn the spring of 1944, at the end of his junior year, the 17-year-old Rose dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Navy where he served on a submarine, the USS Sea Devil, in the Pacific theater of World War II. According to Rose, at the end of hostilities his boat moored in Shanghai and Qingdao, China, and served as a \"military presence\" patrolling the China Seas. \nHe was discharged from the Navy in 1946, then attended Yankton College from which he graduated with a B.A. 1949. While at Yankton, he met Marilyn Preheim, who was a medical tech student at a nearby hospital. The couple married in the Mennonite Church on July 28, 1951, and eventually had a son and five daughters.\nRose studied medicine for two years at the University of South Dakota, then earned his M.D. from the University of Nebraska in 1953. In the mid-1950s, he interned in Denver, Colorado, worked in private practice in Lemmon, South Dakota, then completed specialty training with residencies at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas (surgical pathology) and DePaul Hospital in St. Louis (clinical pathology). Rose then sub-specialized with a fellowship in forensic pathology at the Medical College of Virginia. He worked as a forensic pathologist in Virginia where he held the title of Deputy Chief Examiner for the Tidewater Region of Virginia.\nIn June 1963, Rose moved to Dallas where he became medical examiner for the city and county of Dallas. According to The New York Times, he was \"hired by the county to establish a scientifically valid medical examiner’s system to replace its existing system of elected lay coroners.\" While working as a medical examiner in Dallas, Rose received a law degree from Southern Methodist University.\n\n\nKennedy assassination\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Rose was in his office at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the corridor from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead. He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy and a priest who had been called in to administer last rites. There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that there was no time for an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport. \nAt the time of the assassination, the murder of a United States President was not a federal crime. Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body. A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides. Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled down the corridor on a gurney. Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin. \nAccording to Robert Caro's The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power, the President's aides \"had literally shoved [Rose] and the policeman aside to get out of the building.\" In an interview with Journal of the American Medical Association, Rose stated that he stepped aside feeling that it was unwise to exacerbate the tension.\nRose received criticism for arguing with federal officials at Parkland. For his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, he was disparaged by William Manchester in his 1967 book The Death of a President. Describing Manchester's portrayal of Rose, Peter Knight wrote: \"If Dallas and Oswald are the overt culprits of the crime, then Earl Rose is the cameo villain of the book.\" According to a 2003 AP report, Rose's son, Forrest, believed that the book \"depicted [Rose] as an unreasonable, petty state bureaucrat with a gripe.\" BMJ wrote that he was \"portrayed almost comically as a small time official trying to act important; a portrayal most now see as unjustified.\"\nIn a 1992 interview published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Rose said, \"The law was broken\" and that \"[a] Texas autopsy would have assured a tight chain of custody on all the evidence.\" In 2003, Rose said he still believed that he and his staff should have been allowed to perform the post-mortem examination of Kennedy and that many conspiracy theories about the assassination would have been quelled had he examined the President.\n\n\nJ. D. Tippit\nRose began his autopsy of Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit at 3:14 pm on November 22. He found bullet entrance wounds on the officer's body: two on the right side of his chest, one in his right temple, and a superficial wound to his left rib. Rose removed the three bullets that had entered Tippit's chest and head, noting that there was massive hemorrhaging as a result of penetration of the lung and liver, as well as a large amount of damage to his brain.\n\n\nLee Harvey Oswald\n\nTwo days after the assassination of Kennedy, Rose was called out of church to tend to Oswald, who had been fatally shot by Jack Ruby. Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Rose said: \"The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male.\" His examination found that Ruby's bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.\nIn 1979, Michael Eddowes—who wrote a book claiming that the man who assassinated Kennedy was a look-alike of Oswald put in place by Soviet secret police—filed suit in Fort Worth, Texas, in order to exhume Oswald's body for verification of its identity. There was reported to have been some controversy regarding Rose's measurement of Oswald's height and that he did not note a mastoidectomy scar which was claimed to exist by others. Rose said he did not object to the exhumation. He was reported to have met Eddowes and to have had \"great respect\" for him.\n\n\nJack Ruby\nOn January 3, 1967, Ruby, the murderer of Oswald, died at Parkland Hospital. Rose began the autopsy on Ruby an hour after his death, and a report released the following month indicated that three doctors from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School assisted him in the post-mortem examination. The cause of death was determined to be a lung obstruction due to a massive blood clot. Rose was quoted as saying that the clot originated in one of Ruby's legs and traveled through his heart to the lungs. \nAfter what was initially thought to be pneumonia, Ruby was diagnosed with cancer at Parkland in December 1966. Rose indicated that the same type of cancer that affected Ruby's lungs was found in his brain, lymph nodes, liver, pancreas, pleura, ribs, and vertebra. He said that eight tumors were found in his brain, with the largest being three-fourths of an inch. \nRose told reporters that he could not definitively answer whether or not the tumors were present in Ruby's brain at the time he shot Oswald, but he indicated metastasis from the lungs to the brain could not have occurred prior to 1964 since X-rays at the county jail that year revealed that his lungs were clear. He added that he found no evidence of epilepsy or other brain abnormalities. Rose stated that his death certificate would note cancer as a contributing cause, but that the clot would likely have killed Ruby even if he had not been weakened by cancer.\n\n\nLater life\nIn 1966, Rose performed autopsies on the crew of American Flyers Flight 280 and testified about his findings in a hearing before the Civil Aeronautics Board.\nFrom 1968 until his retirement in early 1992, Rose taught pathology at the University of Iowa. He was an expert witness in the 1977 trial of Robert Williams, who was indicted for the first-degree murder of 10-year-old Pamela Powers. In 1978, he served on the Forensic Pathology Panel of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations. During their retirement, Rose and his wife worked as small claims court mediators in Johnson County, Iowa.\nSuffering from late-onset dementia and Parkinson's disease, Rose lost his long-term memory and the ability to converse over the last year of his life. He contracted a near-fatal case of pneumonia and was bed-ridden prior to his death. On May 1, 2012, Rose died at the Oaknoll Retirement Residence in Iowa City, Iowa from complications due to Parkinson's disease.\n\n\nViews\nRose rejected the idea that there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and he supported the Warren Commission's conclusion that a single gunman shot the President. The New York Times characterized him as \"an outspoken opponent of capital punishment\". According to The Des Moines Register, Rose described himself as a \"'visitor' to the Mennonite faith\".\n\n\nSee also\nAutopsy of John F. Kennedy\n\n\nReferences",

She is the daughter of former world Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier. In January 2000, at the age of 38, Frazier announced that she would begin participating in the sport of boxing. Frazier-Lyde was inducted into the International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame in 2024.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nFrazier was born in Beaufort, South Carolina on December 2, 1961, the daughter of former heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier. She later relocated to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where she attended Plymouth-Whitemarsh, where she was a student athlete in softball, basketball, lacrosse, and hockey. Frazier received a scholarship to American University in Washington D.C., where she played basketball and majored in criminal justice. Frazier earned her Juris Doctor at Villanova University School of Law in Villanova, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Villanova School of Law, Frazier practiced law and later opened her own firm. In 2008, Frazier was elected as a municipal court judge in Philadelphia.\n\n\nBoxing\nInspired by Laila Ali's participation in the sport and eager to avenge the losses her father suffered at the hands of Ali's father, Muhammad Ali in two of their three fights, Frazier-Lyde began her career on February 6, 2000, knocking out Teela Reese in first round.\nLaila Ali was 9-0 (8 knockouts) and Jacqui Frazier-Lyde was 7-0 (7 knockouts) when they starred on the first Pay Per View boxing card ever to be headlined by women. At 39 years of age, Frazier-Lyde was 16 years older than Ali. The bout was nicknamed Ali-Frazier IV by the media, alluding to their fathers' trilogy of fights in 1971, 1974, and 1975. It was boxed on June 8, 2001 to headline the weekend activities of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame induction ceremonies. Ali won the fight by a majority decision (79–73, 77–75, 76–76).\nOn December 14, 2001, Frazier-Lyde won the WIBA Light Heavyweight Title with a fourth-round TKO win over Suzette Taylor in Philadelphia, with Joe and Jacqui becoming the first father-daughter world champions in boxing. She added the WIBF Intercontinental Super Middleweight title on July 27, 2002, with a third-round TKO win over Heidi Hartmann. Frazier-Lyde successfully defended her WIBF Intercontinental Super Middleweight title on two occasions, defeating Kendra Lenhart and Shirvelle Williams by unanimous decisions, the latter by an 80–72 shut-out on all three judges' scorecards. Lenhart and Williams, along with Frazier-Lyde, are the only three women to have taken Laila Ali (24–0, with 21 knockouts) the distance in boxing fights.\nFrazier-Lyde's last two fights were in the Heavyweight division, with her opponent on August 31, 2004, Carley Pesente, weighing in at 213lbs, thus being the heaviest opponent that Frazier-Lyde had faced during her boxing career. Frazier-Lyde won the fight by a shut-out unanimous decision (40–36, 40–36, 40–36). On September 10, 2004, Frazier-Lyde won the UBA World Heavyweight title by unanimous decision (97–92, 96–92, 95–93) against Mary Ann Almager, despite Frazier-Lyde being knocked down twice by Almager for the only times in her career. This fight was to be Frazier-Lyde's last boxing fight.\nFrazier-Lyde ended her career with a record of 13 wins, 9 by knockout, and 1 loss.\n\n\nProfessional boxing record\n13 Wins (9 knockouts, 4 decisions), 1 Loss (0 knockouts, 1 decision), 0 Draws, 1 No Contest\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nBoxing record for Jacqui Frazier-Lyde from BoxRec (registration required)\nWomen Boxing profile",

    "text": "The Chiou Ho-shun case (Chinese: 邱和順案; pinyin: Qiū Héshùn àn) is one of the most well-known criminal cases in Taiwan. In September 1988, a group of 12 men, led by Chiou Ho-shun (born 1960), was arrested and detained for their murder of saleswoman Ko Hung Yu-lan and the kidnapping of schoolboy Lu Cheng. After 11 trials, in 2011, the Supreme Court reached a verdict that sentenced Chiou to death.  The case has gained notoriety due to the lack of evidence connecting Chiou and the 11 to the murders, as well as the alleged tortures they received in order to force confessions. As of 2025, Chiou is the longest-serving death row inmate in Taiwan.\n\n\nMurders\nOn November 24, 1987, Ko Hung Yu-lan (柯洪玉蘭), an insurance saleswoman from Miaoli, disappeared. Her remains were found in a ditch in Zhunan. It was later revealed that Chiou and his group planned to rob her. They drove her to Chiou's house and demanded NT$500,000 from her. She refused, and Chiou strangled her to death with a rope. Afterwards, they took NT$130,000 from her, and disposed of her remains in a ditch.\nOn December 21, 1987, Lu Cheng (陸正), a schoolchild from Hsinchu City, was kidnapped by Chiou and his accomplices after leaving his cram school, as they believed Lu to be rich. The kidnappers called the child's parents and demanded a ransom of NT$5 million. Lu's parents negotiated and paid a ransom of NT$1 million, but Lu remained missing, and his remains were never found.\n\n\nArrest and trial\nIt wasn't until almost a year after the murders that the police began to make headway with the case. In September 1988, an informant reported to the Taipei police that his nephew's friend was involved in the kidnapping of Lu Cheng. Later, the informant and his nephew stated that more people were involved with the Lu and Ko Hung murders, including Chiou. On September 29, the police arrested Chiou and 11 other people, some of which were underage.\nIn 1989, the Ko Hung murder and the Lu kidnapping were tried together, and the Hsinchu District Court sentenced Chiou to death. He was the only person in the 12-man group to be sentenced to death.\nIn 1994, two prosecutors and 10 police officers were given corrective measures for \"coercion with violence\". Four years later, in 1998, the court ruled that four of the officers were guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.\nHowever, Chiou remained on death row. On May 12, 2011, after the 11th retrial, the Taiwan High Court upheld Chiou's death sentence and deprived him of public rights for life. His appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on July 28.\n\n\nControversies\n\n\nTorture\nDuring questioning, Chiou and his accomplices were reportedly blindfolded, tied up, forced to sit on ice, subjected to electric shocks with an electric baton, and had water mixed with pepper poured into their mouths. Five or six officers beat Chiou to the point of passing out. Some interrogations lasted up to 10 hours. Chiou eventually gave 288 confessions to the murders of Ko Hung and Lu, but he later renounced his confessions, stating that they had been extracted over hours of torture. During his imprisonment, Chiou was also reported having to wear shackles that weighted 3 kilograms, a condition for all death row inmates, until the practice was ended in 2006.\n\n\nDiscrepancies\nThere are a number of discrepancies and a lack of evidence relating to the Chiou Ho-shun case. The defendants' testimonials and key details are inconsistent, and no evidence of a murder weapon has been brought to court. Instead, all evidence is based on the confessions of the defendants. For example, in the Lu Cheng murder, Chiou and others confessed that they targeted Lu because he was seen coming to school in a luxury car, while Lu's family testified that he went to school by bus the day he disappeared. In addition, Chiou was reported to be renting a car in Miaoli at the time of Lu's abduction.\nIn the Ko Hung murder, a plastic bag was found located near Ko Hung's body. Inside the bag contained butcher's knives, rectangular knives, women's leather shoes and men's underwear. The butcher's knife was originally connected to a pig butcher who owned Ko Hung gambling debts. When Ko Hung went missing, he admitted himself to a hospital for stab wounds. He abruptly left before his wounds were healed, and by the time the Zhunan police were close to arresting the man, it was announced that Chiou was the one who committed the murder, and no further action was taken. The rest of the contents in the bag, including the butcher's knife, were confiscated by the police and did not appear during the trial.\n\n\nSee also\nHsichih Trio: similar case in which its defendants were tortured in order to obtain confessions.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "The Chiou Ho-shun case (Chinese: 邱和順案; pinyin: Qiū Héshùn àn) is one of the most well-known criminal cases in Taiwan. In September 1988, a group of 12 men, led by Chiou Ho-shun (born 1960), was arrested and detained for their murder of saleswoman Ko Hung Yu-lan and the kidnapping of schoolboy Lu Cheng. After 11 trials, in 2011, the Supreme Court reached a verdict that sentenced Chiou to death.  The case has gained notoriety due to the lack of evidence connecting Chiou and the 11 to the murders, as well as the alleged tortures they received in order to force confessions. As of 2025, Chiou is the longest-serving death row inmate in Taiwan.",

    "text": "Laura Ferreira (27 September 1965 – 25 February 2020) was a Portuguese physiotherapist. She was the second wife of Pedro Passos Coelho, former prime minister of Portugal.\n\n\nEarly life\nLaura Maria Garcês Ferreira was born in what was then the Portuguese colony of Portuguese Guinea (now the sovereign country of Guinea-Bissau) on 27 September 1965, the daughter of Tomás Ferreira, a civil servant who had a Portuguese father and a mother from Portuguese Cape Verde (now the sovereign country of Cape Verde), and Domitília Garcês, who had a Portuguese father and a mother from Portuguese Guinea. They lived in the town of Canchungo. After the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, a military coup in Lisbon which overthrew Portugal's Estado Novo dictatorship and would grant independence to the Portuguese territories in Africa shortly after, her parents moved to Cape Verde, living in the city of Mindelo for a while, where Ferreira went to school. In 1978 the family moved to Portugal, living first in Coimbra and then in Cacém near the capital, Lisbon. As a college student, she first studied medicine at the University of Lisbon and then switched courses, being ultimately awarded a degree in physiotherapy which led her to follow a professional career as physiotherapist.\n\n\nCareer\nIn the early 2000s, she joined the Education Centre for Disabled Citizens in Mira-Sintra, a non-profit social cooperative, and later acted as coordinator of the Rehabilitation Medicine Centre.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2004 she married Pedro Passos Coelho, who became the prime minister of Portugal between 2011 and 2015 as leader of the liberal-conservative Social Democratic Party (PSD). They had one daughter, Julia. Ferreira also had a daughter, Teresa, from a previous marriage. In 2015 Ferreira was diagnosed as having a bone tumour. She died in hospital on 25 February 2020.\nFollowing her marriage to Coelho she had chosen to remain a very private figure. The Portuguese news magazine, Visão, reported that in 2011 she was the most searched Portuguese person on the internet. Subsequently, she began to become more of a public figure, appearing alongside her husband on several official occasions, contributing to two biographies about him and representing him at social or charity events. However, she refused to be interviewed by newspapers and her friends also did not collaborate with journalists. This secrecy increased following her cancer diagnosis, although in 2015 she was part of the prime minister's visit to the two African countries where she spent her childhood.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Laura Ferreira at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "The Summer Hikaru Died (Japanese: 光が死んだ夏, Hepburn: Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Mokumokuren. It began serialization on Kadokawa Shoten's Young Ace Up website in August 2021. As of July 2025, the series' individual chapters have been collected in seven tankōbon volumes. It follows the story of Yoshiki Tsujinaka, a teenager in rural Japan who discovers that his  friend Hikaru Indo has been possessed by an otherworldly entity, forcing him to navigate their changed relationship amid supernatural dangers.\nMokumokuren first conceived of the series while studying for exams and later began posting drawings on Twitter, which led to the Young Ace Up editorial department approaching Mokumokuren to serialize the manga via the Young Ace Up website. An anime television series adaptation produced by CygamesPictures aired from July to September 2025. A second season has been announced.\nUpon release of the first volume, the series became a critical and commercial success, with the first volume selling 200,000 copies in three months and receiving critical praise for the story, artwork, and characters.\n\n\nPlot\nYoshiki Tsujinaka and Hikaru Indo are two teenage boys and childhood friends living in a small town in rural Japan. Despite having opposite personalities and different hobbies, the two maintain a close friendship. However, on a winter day, Hikaru is fatally injured while hiking in the mountains alone. Before he dies, a mysterious eldritch being comes across him and consumes him, becoming him physically in the process. This \"Hikaru\" has all the feelings and memories of the original, yet remains a separate being, something Yoshiki realizes rather quickly. Yoshiki still wants to stay with \"Hikaru\"; however, his alien nature, along with other eldritch beings and hunters of said beings, may make that impossible.\n\n\nCharacters\nHikaru Indo (忌堂 光, Indō Hikaru)\nVoiced by: Yōtarō Negishi (audio drama, PV1), Hiro Shimono (PV2), KENN  (PV3), Junya Enoki (PV4), Shūichirō Umeda (anime), Yūki Urushiyama (young)\nYoshiki Tsujinaka (辻中 佳紀, Tsujinaka Yoshiki)\nVoiced by: Tomohiro Ono (audio drama, PV1), Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (PV2), Tomoaki Maeno (PV3), Koki Uchiyama (PV4), Chiaki Kobayashi (anime), Natsumi Kawaida (young)\nAsako Yamagishi (山岸朝子, Yamagishi Asako)\nVoiced by: Yumiri Hanamori\nRie Kurebayashi (暮林理恵, Kurebayashi Rie)\nVoiced by: Wakana Kowaka\nTanaka (田中)\nVoiced by: Chikahiro Kobayashi\nYūta Maki (巻ゆうた, Maki Yūta)\nVoiced by: Yoshiki Nakajima\nYuki Tadokoro (田所結希, Tadokoro Yuki)\nVoiced by: Shion Wakayama\n\n\nProduction\nMokumokuren first conceived the series while studying for high school entrance exams. After graduating, Mokumokuren began posting drawings on Twitter in their spare time in January 2021. Mokumokuren was later approached by the Young Ace Up editorial department to serialize the manga in Young Ace Up, which they accepted. Mokumokuren is a fan of action manga from Weekly Shōnen Jump and Weekly Young Jump, particularly Tokyo Ghoul.\nWhile writing the story, Mokumokuren tries to keep the horror to a minimum by trying to appeal to people's emotions rather than just being scary. Mokumokuren also feels the theme of the story adds to the horror based on the suspension bridge effect, which states that it is easier to fall in love when feeling anxious or fearful. For the artwork, Mokumokuren tries to use onomatopoeia that are not often used, while also staying cautious to make sure it works properly in the context of the story.\nMokumokuren initially introduced The Summer Hikaru Died in 2021 as a boys' love story. They later specified that the manga was never serialized as a boys' love story, instead describing the series as a \"coming-of-age horror\" with \"queer\" themes.\n\n\nSetting\nMokumokuren used their grandmother's hometown as model, where the houses were all packed together tightly and normal for the neighbors to come and go without permission. They got the inspiration during their visit to the region. As Mokumokuren wanted the characters to speak in distinctive dialect, they looked up for a dialect that is \"slightly different from Kansai dialect\" and decided the setting on place that is located in \"mountainous area of Tokai region.\" As the result, a fictional rural town located between mountains in Mie Prefecture became the setting of the series, and some characters are speaking in Mie dialect.\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nManga\nWritten and illustrated by Mokumokuren, the series began serialization on Kadokawa Shoten's Young Ace Up website on August 31, 2021. As of July 2025, the series' individual chapters have been collected in seven tankōbon volumes.\nIn September 2022, Yen Press announced that they licensed the series for English publication.\n\n\nVolumes\n\n\nNovel\nA novelization of the manga series, written by Mio Nukaga, was published by Kadokawa Shoten on December 4, 2023. At New York Comic Con 2024, Yen Press announced that they also licensed the novel for English publication.\n\n\nAnime\nAn anime adaptation was announced on May 24, 2024. It was later revealed to be a television series produced by CygamesPictures and directed by Ryōhei Takeshita with him also handling series composition, character designs and chief animation direction handled by Yuichi Takahashi, and \"Dorodoro\" animation handled by Masanobu Hiraoka. It premiered on July 6, 2025, on Nippon TV and its affiliates.  The opening theme song is \"Saikai\" (再会; \"Reunion\") by Vaundy, while the ending theme song is \"Anata wa Kaibutsu\" (あなたはかいぶつ; \"You Are My Monster\") by Tooboe. Netflix is streaming the series globally, while Abema is streaming it inside Japan for free.\nAfter the airing of the final episode of the first season, a second season was announced.\n\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nStage play\nA stage play adaptation of the manga was announced, and is set to run at Kinokuniya Hall in Tokyo from January 9 to 18, 2026, with Sōtarō Fujii directing and script writing the play while Mikihito Sano is composing the music.\n\n\nReception\nIn the 2022 Next Manga Award, The Summer Hikaru Died ranked 11th in the web manga category.

    "text": "Guns in the Hands of Artists is an art exhibit and project conceived by Brian Borrello in the mid 1990s, which was later converted to a book.\n\n\nHistory\nThe \"Guns in the Hands of Artists\" project was conceived by artist Brian Borrello in the mid 1990s, and started in 1996; the exhibit saw artists convert decommissioned guns into artworks as an expression of gun violence in the United States. Borrello acquired decommissioned guns  obtained through a trade-in program, then gave them to New Orleans–based artists, who converted them into artworks in a variety of media, including fashion, photography, and sculpture. The exhibit showcased at Positive Space Gallery, which was operated by Jonathan Ferrara. Borrello relocated to Portland, Oregon, where he executed another iteration of the exhibit. completed other versions of the project in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Washington, D.C.\nIn 2014, Ferrara organized an exhibit at his New Orleans gallery, which is now known as Jonathan Ferrara Gallery. According to Borrello, he and Ferrara worked together on the updated exhibit, though Ferrara disputes this claim. Ferrara worked with local government officials and the police department to secure 186 decommissioned guns acquired by the city's gun buyback program. More than 30 artists participated in the exhibit, and used a variety of media, including glassblowing, painting, photography, and sculpture. Borrello created a sculpture for the show in the form of an \"absurdly long ammunition clip to an automatic pistol, grimly implying that the supply of death was unlimited\".\nThe exhibit was later converted into book form, with contributions by Lupe Fiasco, Gabby Giffords, and Tim Kaine, among others. The book, which includes an essay by Borrello, was produced by Ferrara to document the exhibit. Ferrara also established the Guns in the Hands of Artists Foundation to continue the exhibit's mission.\nBorrello took issue with Ferrara's actions and criticized him for \"taking liberties with the fundamental ideas\" behind the project and creating a foundation with a board of directors.  Furthermore, according to Borrello, the exhibit was never intended to be affiliated with any specific commercial entity, and was meant to serve as an ongoing collaborative project. Borrello has expressed disapproval of Ferrara's application for a trademark on the title \"Guns in the Hands of Artists\". Borrello said, \"I see it as a hostile takeover of my project. I came up with the name. It's clear that it was my love child.\" Contrastingly, the foundation's website infers a partnership and says, \"The Guns in the Hands of Artists Foundation stems from an ongoing arts project begun in 1996 by Gallery Owner Jonathan Ferrara and artist Brian Borrello.\"\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Vasili III Ivanovich (Russian: Василий III Иванович; Christian name: Gavriil; monastic name: Varlaam; 25 March 1479 – 3 December 1533) was Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia from 1505 until his death in 1533.\nHe was the second son of Ivan III by his second wife Sophia Paleologue. Following on the ambitions of his father, Vasili annexed Pskov and Ryazan – the last remaining autonomous Russian territories – and captured the city of Smolensk from Lithuania. He also strengthened Russian influence in Kazan and the Volga region. Several nobles were exiled, sentenced, or executed for criticizing his policies.\n\n\nEarly life\nVasili was the second son of Ivan III of Russia. Following the death of Ivan's eldest son, Ivan Molodoy, the young Ivan's son, Dmitry Ivanovich, became heir presumptive in 1490 and was later made grand prince and co-ruler in 1498 after a conspiracy against Dmitry by Vasili's supporters was uncovered and foiled. However, on 21 March 1499, Vasili was forgiven by his father and he was bestowed the title of grand prince of Novgorod and Pskov. In March 1501, Vasili was given the Beloozero principality, and the following year, Dmitry and his supporters fell out of favor with Ivan. On 11 April 1502, Dmitry and his mother Elena of Moldavia were arrested and placed under house arrest. Three days later, Ivan III named Vasili as his successor:\n\nIn the year 7010 [1502], on April 14, a Thursday, the feast day of our Father among the saints St. Martin, Pope of Rome, Grand Prince Ivan Vasil'evich of All Russia showed favor upon [pozhaloval] his son Vasilii, and blessed him and seated him on the grand princely throne [na velikoe kniazhenie] of Vladimir and Moscow and of all Russia, Autocrat.\nAccording to Sigismund von Herberstein, a diplomat who visited Russia in 1517, some 1,500 noble girls were brought together in the summer of 1505 for a bride-show. Vasili chose Solomonia Saburova and the two were married on 4 September 1505. The custom was introduced by Vasili's mother Sofia Paleologue, who herself was of Byzantine royalty, though she died before the wedding could take place. Vasili himself was a cultured man and proud of his imperial descent; he may have known the Greek language.\n\n\nForeign affairs\n\nVasili III maintained the policies initiated by his father Ivan III, focusing much of his reign on consolidating the territorial gains achieved by Ivan. Vasili annexed the last remaining autonomous provinces in Russia: the republic of Pskov in 1510 and the principality of Ryazan in 1521.\nVasili also took advantage of the difficult position of Sigismund of Poland to capture Smolensk, the great eastern fortress of Lithuania (siege started 1512, ended in 1514), chiefly through the aid of the rebel Lithuanian, Prince Mikhail Glinski, who provided him with artillery and engineers. The loss of Smolensk was an important injury inflicted by Russia on Lithuania in the course of the Russo-Lithuanian Wars and only the exigencies of Sigismund compelled him to acquiesce in its surrender (1522).\nIn 1521, Vasili received an emissary of the neighboring Iranian Safavid Empire, sent by Shah Ismail I whose ambitions were to construct an Irano-Russian alliance against the common enemy, the Ottoman Empire.\nVasili saw some success against the Crimean Khanate. Although in 1519 his armies were defeated along the Oka River and he was obliged to buy off the Crimean khan, Mehmed I Giray, under the very walls of Moscow, towards the end of his reign he established Russian influence on the Volga. In 1531–32 he placed the pretender Cangali khan on the throne of Khanate of Kazan.\nUnlike his son, Ivan IV, Vasili did not officially hold the title of tsar within Russia; however, externally, such as in diplomatic documents produced by and for the Holy Roman Empire, he would alternatively be called tsar, grand prince, or, as by Maximilian I, kayser. In this naming custom, as well as in using the double-headed eagle of the Byzantine Empire, Vasili continued practices begun by his father and predecessor, Ivan III. The seal and the introduction of Byzantine ceremonies and court etiquette seem to have been inspired by Vasili's mother Sophia Paleologue. Like his father, Vasili fought for recognition of the equality of the titles of tsar and emperor by other European monarchs. He achieved some success in 1514, when the Holy Roman Emperor implicitly recognized the Russians' insistence to be treated as an equal, whether this was by accident or by design. The letter by Maximilian I was later used by Peter the Great (r. 1682–1725) when he proclaimed himself as imperator of Russia.\n\n\nFamily\n\nBy 1526 when he was 47 years old, Vasili had been married to Solomonia Saburova for over 20 years with no heir to his throne being produced. Conscious of her husband's disappointment, Solomonia tried to remedy this by consulting sorcerers and going on pilgrimages. When this proved unsuccessful, Vasili consulted the boyars, announcing that he did not trust his two brothers to handle Russia's affairs and forbade them to marry anyone.\nThe boyars suggested that he take a new wife. A divorce due to wife sterility was unlawful, so he falsely accused her of witchcraft, and despite much opposition from the clergy, he divorced his barren wife, exiled her to a monastery, exiled the opposed clergy and soon married Princess Elena Glinskaya, the daughter of a Serbian princess and niece of his friend Michael Glinski. Not many of the boyars approved of his choice, as Elena was of Catholic upbringing. Vasili was so smitten that he defied Russian social norms and trimmed his beard to appear younger. After three days of matrimonial festivity, the couple consummated their marriage, though initially it appeared that Elena was as sterile as Solomonia. The Russian populace began to suspect this was a sign of God's disapproval of the marriage. However, to the great joy of Vasili and the populace, the new tsaritsa gave birth to a son, who would succeed him as Ivan IV. Three years later, a second son, Yuri, was born. According to a story, Solomonia Saburova also bore a son in the convent where she had been confined, just several months after the controversial divorce.\nHe had three brothers: Yuri (born in 1480), Simeon (born in 1487) and Andrei (born in 1490), as well as five sisters: Elena (born and died in 1474), Feodosiya (born and died in 1475), another Elena (born 1476), another Feodosiya (born 1485) and Eudoxia (born 1492).\n\n\nDeath\n\nWhilst out hunting on horseback near Volokolamsk, Vasili felt a great pain in his right hip, the result of an abscess. He was transported to the village of Kolp, where he was visited by two German doctors who were unable to stop the infection with conventional remedies. Believing that his time was short, Vasili requested to be returned to Moscow, where he was kept in the Saint Joseph Cathedral along the way. By  25 November 1533, Vasili reached Moscow and asked to be made a monk before dying. Taking on the name Varlaam, Vasili died at midnight, 3 December 1533.\n\n\nTitle\nAfter 1514, the full title used by Vasili in his foreign correspondence was: By the Grace of God, the Tsar and Sovereign of All Russia and the Grand Prince of Vladimir, Moscow, Novgorod, Pskov, Smolensk, Tver, Yugorsk, Perm, Vyatka and Bulgar, and others, the Sovereign and Grand Prince of Novgorod of the Lower Land, and Chernigov, and Ryazan, Volotsk, Rzhev, Belyov, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Beloozero, Udoria, Obdoria and Kondia.\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nIn popular culture\nVasili was the subject of the opera Neprigozhaya by composer Ella Adayevskaya.\n\n\nSee also\nBibliography of Russian history (1223–1613)\nFamily tree of Russian monarchs\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nBushkovitch, Paul (5 December 2011).

    "text": "Kevin Kelly (born 1952) is the founding executive editor of Wired magazine and a former editor and publisher of the Whole Earth Review. He has also been a writer, photographer, conservationist, and student of Asian and digital culture.\n\n\nLife\nKelly was born in Pennsylvania, United States, in 1952, and graduated from Westfield High School, Westfield, New Jersey, in 1970. Through his father, an executive for Time who used systems analysis in his work, Kelly developed an early interest in cybernetics. He attended the University of Rhode Island for one year, studying geology.\nKelly has traveled extensively, backpacking in Asia. While travelling in the Middle East, he had a conversion experience and became a born-again Christian.  He was raised Catholic.\nHe lives in Pacifica, California, a small coastal town just south of San Francisco. He is married to the biochemist Gia-Miin Fuh and has three children: Kaileen, Ting, and Tywen.\nAmong Kelly's personal involvements is a campaign to make a full inventory of all living species on earth, an effort also known as the Linnaean enterprise. He is also sequencing his genome and co-organizes the Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup Group.\n\n\nCareer\nKelly began contributing freelance articles to CoEvolution Quarterly in 1980, while living in Athens, Georgia. Around this time, he was also editing his own start-up magazine called Walking Journal, and working in an epidemiology laboratory to support himself.\nHe was hired in 1983 by Whole Earth founder Stewart Brand to edit some of the later editions of the Whole Earth Catalog, the Whole Earth Review, and Signal. With Brand, Kelly helped found the WELL, an influential virtual community. As director of the Point Foundation, he co-sponsored the first Hackers Conference in 1984.\nIn 1992, Kelly was hired by Louis Rossetto to serve as executive editor of Wired, which was launched in March 1993. He brought to the magazine the cybernetic social vision of the Whole Earth publications and their networked style of editorial work, while also recruiting writers and editors from the WELL. He stepped down as executive editor in 1999; his current job title at Wired is Senior Maverick. Partially due to his reputation as Wired's editor, he is noted as a participant in and an observer of cyberculture.\nKelly's writing has appeared in many other national and international publications such as The New York Times, The Economist, Time, Harper's Magazine, Science, Veneer Magazine, GQ, and Esquire. His photographs have appeared in Life and other American national magazines.\nAs well as serving as editor on many publications, Kelly has written many novels surrounding his interest in cybernetics and all things tech. He is known for coining the term \"The Technium,\" the accumulation of all technologies and inventions as a working, living system. Much of his work revolves around technology as a \"living organism.\" He even refers to \"The Technium\" as the seventh kingdom of nature, that is self-organizing and autonomous. Kelly's book-length publication, Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World (1992), presents a view on the mechanisms of complex organization. The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organisations, intelligent computers, and to the human brain.\nHe helped found the All Species Foundation. He was a futurist adviser on the Steven Spielberg-directed movie Minority Report.\nKelly has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss's book Tools of Titans.\n\n\nSelect works\n\n\nBooks\nOut of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the Economic World (Basic Books, 1992; Fourth Estate, 1995)\nNew Rules for the New Economy: 10 Radical Strategies for a Connected World (Penguin, 1999)\n\"Photographers section: Kevin Kelly,\" pp. 106–111, in Lloyd Kahn, editor 2004 Home Work  (Shelter Publications, 2004)\nTrue Films (2006)\n\"Forward: 1000 True Fans,\" pp. 3–8, in Be The Media, David Mathison, editor, (2009)\nWhat Technology Wants (2010)\nCool Tools (2013) – Tool reviews collected from his weblog of the same name in large scale format similar to Whole Earth Catalog\nThe Inevitable (2016)\nVanishing Asia: Three Volume Set: West, Central and East.

    "title": "Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=5119948",
    "text": "The Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company was a company chartered in 1895 to operate steamboats on the Lake of Bays, and a series of lakes connecting to Huntsville in the northern section of the Muskoka Lakes District of Ontario, Canada. The wholly owned Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway ran a short line narrow gauge railway to connect steamboats operating on Lake of Bays and Peninsula Lake outside Huntsville, Ontario. Covering a vertical distance of 175 feet (53 m) along the hilly 1.125-mile (1.811 km) route, it was known as the \"smallest commercially operated railway in the world\".\nThe network, which eventually contained eight steamboats, a single locomotive and several hotels and lodges in the area, operated as a unit until 1959. At that time, increasing automobile use led to a rapid decline in laker traffic. The hotels were sold off one by one, but the company remained a legal entity until 1967. The railway was purchased by the town of St. Thomas in southern Ontario, where it was reassembled to become the Pinnifore Park Railway. During the 1980s it was purchased by a group of enthusiasts in Huntsville and returned north, operating today as the Portage Flyer.\n\n\nHistory\nThe lakes and rivers of the Muskoka Lakes region have long been used for transportation by the Algonquian-speaking Anishinaabeg peoples, and they were heavily used by the first Europeans who visited the area. In the latter half of the 19th century, the land north of Barrie was being opened up for colonization via land grants. As roads were in poor condition or non-existent, the only reliable form of transportation was by steamboat. By 1875 a pair of locks and a canal had been built to bypass a series of rapids in the Muskoka River, allowing navigable access between Mary Lake and Huntsville. In 1886 another canal was built to connect from Fairy Lake to Peninsula Lake to the east.\nA broken link in the chain of lakes served by the growing network existed between Lake of Bays and Peninsula Lake, which connected in turn to Fairy Lake and the town of Huntsville. The short distance between the two lakes was too steep to justify building a canal. Within a distance of 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) the elevation change was more than 30 metres (98 ft). A ridge down the middle adds another 20 metres (66 ft). This obstacle was initially overcome by the construction of a gravel road in 1887, but the steep terrain made shipping any heavy loads via buckboard very difficult.\n\n\nPortage railway\n\nGeorge F. Marsh ran steamers on a number of lakes in the area, and in 1895 he bought out his major competitor, Alfred Denton. This left him in control of most of the commercial shipping on Lake of Bays and the lower Fairy, Mary and Peninsula lakes, which he incorporated as the Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company. That year, he received a charter to build an electric railway in the gap between Peninsula Lake and Lake of Bays, which would complete his network.\nBy 1900 no work on the electric railway had been carried out, and he reincorporated as the Huntsville and Lake of Bays Navigation Company with a separate charter for a railway as the Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway. This company was allowed to raise up to $50,000 in shares, and would connect not only Peninsula Lake and Lake of Bays, but extend to the west end of Hollow Lake as well. Seeing a big future for the area, the original company reincorporated once again in 1902 as the Huntsville, Lake of Bays and Lake Simcoe Navigation Company, with a charter for shipping, \"hotels, house boats, boarding houses, cottages and summer resorts\".\nWork had not commenced on the portage railway by this time, although its charter stipulated the undertaking was to be started within three years and completed within seven. Originally planned to use electric power and standard gauge, the plans changed to narrow gauge and steam power when two surplus locomotives and rolling stock became available from E.B. Eddy of Hull, Quebec. These had originally been built by H.K. Porter of Pittsburgh in 1888. Two coaches were built from horse-drawn streetcars of the Toronto Street Railway, modified so the seat backs could flip over so the passengers always sat facing the direction of travel. The crew also built two boxcars and three flatcars.\nConstruction finally began in September 1902, but proved more difficult than expected, and in 1903 the charter was extended another two years to allow time to complete it. In 1904, Marsh failed to get Federal funding to help complete it, but was given $10,000 provincial grant instead. Trains were operating after the close of navigation season in 1904, and the line officially opened as the Portage Railway in 1905. The second section to Hollow Lake was never completed, and the charter was amended to remove it in 1906.\n\n\nExpansion\n\nMarsh died in 1904, while work on the railway was still underway. The company was purchased in 1905 by Charles Orlando Shaw, owner of the Anglo-Canadian Leather Company in Huntsville and Bracebridge, which was the largest tannery in the British Empire. The tannery required huge amounts of wood for heating, and hemlock for tanning, and the Portage Railway became a major link in his supply chain. The company's charter was resigned in 1907, and over the next decade he expanded the shipping fleet considerably, before turning to hotel building.\nShaw began his hotel construction with the relatively small Wawa Hotel, which opened in 1908 on Norway Point on Lake of Bays. This was a success, and he turned his eye towards a much larger and more lavish destination. He purchased the 268 hectares (660 acres) Bigwin Island from Ojibwe Chief Chevodin (Joseph Big Wind) in 1910, and built the 280 room Bigwin Inn in 1920. The Bigwin was a hit, and became well known in Muskoka for its entertainment.\n\n\nDecline\nBy 1939, the effects of the Great Depression and the opening of other routes led to a decline in business. Peaking at eight steamers, the fleet now had only two. Shaw died in 1942 and the company passed to his son-in-law. The Bigwin Inn was sold in 1947 and the company was passed to Shaw's daughter, Pauline Gill. Operations were turned over to Carl McLennan in 1948, and he had moderate success replacing the now old steamships with modern motorboats.\nThe original Porter locomotives reached the end of their lives in 1948, and were sold to a collector, Cameron Peck of Chicago, and finally came to rest at the Harold Warp Pioneer Village in Minden, Nebraska. They were replaced by two much larger engines, one coal and one oil-fired, originally built by Montreal Locomotive Works in 1926. The 21 long tons (21 t) oil-fired engine proved to be too heavy and was put into storage. The coal-fired Engine 1 gave the train its new name, Portage Flier. This second life lasted into the 1950s, when the rise of automobile use cut the lake traffic, and the railway shut down in 1959.\n\n\nMoving away, and back\n\nWith its closure, the railway track and single locomotive were moved to St. Thomas, Ontario, where they were used at the Pinafore Railway Park. In 1984 the locomotive was put up for sale, which coincided with increasing interest in the Huntsville area to revive the railway. The newly chartered Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway Society purchased the entire set, initially planning to recreate the original line. However, cottage construction in the area made it impossible, and after considering a number of sites, they eventually decided to build a new site in partnership with the Muskoka Pioneer Village. The resulting Muskoka Heritage Place opened on 1 July 2000, with a 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) route.\n\n\nRailway route\nThe Portage Railway began at what became known as South Portage Station, running south onto Lake of Bays on a dock with three spurs. The line ran north from this point, passing a water tank and then connecting to a small spur with a maintenance shed. Shortly north of the spur, the line turns almost due west to follow the northern shore of Osbourne's Lake, then turns roughly north again after a short distance.\nThe line continues north to a point just south of Peninsula Lake, where it turns to the west for a distance. This is a spur that forms a switchback; the train travels to the west onto this line, switches, and then travels back eastward into North Portage Station. Here there were two parallel spurs paralleling the south bank of the lake, and a more substantial station.\nSections of the original right-of-way remain visible at Muskoka Road 23, and a sort section of line has been restored at South Portage, along with the addition of historical plaques at both ends.\n\n\nSteamboats\nThrough its existence, the company operated several steamboats (see table). At the time, the area was becoming a popular resort destination. Several large hotels operated on the Lake of Bays and on the lower lakes and the steamboat business grew to service them, connecting with the Grand Trunk Railway, at Huntsville. Steamboats operated on both sides of the portage. The lower lakes run started in Huntsville and ran east through Fairy Lake and into Peninsula Lake. After the trip on the portage railway, passengers boarded another steamboat for a trip on Lake of Bays. All the boats were powered by steam engines except the Iroquois II which used a diesel engine.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\nThe Huntsville and Lake of Bays Railway Company (PDF).

    "text": "A mercury vapour turbine is a form of heat engine that uses mercury as the working fluid of its thermal cycle.  A mercury vapour turbine has been used in conjunction with a steam turbine for generating electricity.  This example of combined cycle generation was not widely adopted because of high capital cost and the toxic hazard of the mercury potentially leaking into the environment.\nThe mercury cycle offers an efficiency increase compared to a steam-only cycle because energy can be injected into the Rankine cycle at higher temperature. Metallurgical developments have allowed steam-only plants to increase in efficiency over time, making the mercury vapour turbine obsolete.  Modern combined cycle power plant generating stations operate at 61% efficiency, and with none of the safety issues inherent to a binary mercury Rankine cycle steam power plant.\n\n\nHistorical example\n\nThe Electrical Year Book, 1937, contained the following description of a mercury vapour turbine operating in commercial use:\n\nThe advantage of operating a mercury-vapour turbine in conjunction with a steam power plant lies in the fact that the complete cycle can be worked over a very wide range of temperature without employing any abnormal pressure.  The exhaust from the mercury turbine is used to raise steam for the steam turbine.  The Hartford Electric Light Co. (U.S.A.) has a 10,000kW turbo-generator driven by mercury vapour, which reaches the turbine at 70 lb. per sq. in. (gauge), 880°F.  The mercury vapour is condensed at 445°F and raises 129,000 lb. steam per hr. at 280 lb. per sq. in. pressure.  The latter is superheated to 735°F and passed to the steam turbines.  During 4 months continuous operation, this plant averaged about 0.715 lb. of coal per kWh of net output, about 43% of the output being from the mercury turbine generator and 57% from the steam plant.  On maintained full-load the heat output averages 9800 BTU per net kWh [34.8% efficiency].  It is believed that maintenance costs will be lower than in ordinary steam plant.  The back-pressure on the mercury turbine is fixed by the steam boiler pressure; only a small vacuum pump is needed, as there is no air or other gas in the mercury system.\n\nPower plants designed by William Le Roy Emmet were constructed by General Electric and operated between 1923 and 1950. Large plants included:\n\nHartford, Connecticut, 1.8 MW, starting in 1922, uprated in stages to 15 MW in 1949\nKearny Generating Station, New Jersey, 20 MW mercury turbine +30 MW steam, started 1933\nSchenectady, New York\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire, 40 MW, 1950\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMercury as a Working Fluid\nTime magazine article 1929, Mercury into power\nTime magazine article 1942 Power with Quicksilver\n\"Mercury Turbine Now A Success drawing page 40\n\"Cheaper Power From Quicksilver\" Popular Science Monthly, September 1929",

He turned professional in 2002 and reached a peak world ranking of 176 in March 2007. 'Bloomers', as he is known to the tennis world, is from the small Norfolk village of Alpington.\n\n\nTennis career\nBloomfield won the 2001 British Junior Tennis Championships, defeating Alex Bogdanovic in the final. He also won the equivalent doubles title with Ken Skupski. He played his first senior tennis that year, losing to future French Open finalist Robin Söderling in the qualifying draw for the Bolton Challenger. He continued to play doubles and singles on the futures and challenger tours. His first full ATP tournament was the 2003 Wimbledon men's singles as a wild card, in which he lost in the first round to Antony Dupuis.\nArguably his most successful season to date came in 2006, when he reached the second round at Wimbledon, beating Carlos Berlocq to record his first ATP level victory. Bloomfield's unexpected victory was investigated by ATP officials concerned about betting patterns, but no evidence was found of any wrongdoing. Bloomfield also won two futures tournaments in 2006, reached the semi-final of Rennes Challenger, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and a further three doubles semi-finals of the Challenger tour. Early 2007 saw him reach his first ever Challenger singles final, losing to Michał Przysiężny in Wrexham in January. It was shortly after this that Bloomfield achieved his highest ranking to date of 176. Bloomfield also reached two further doubles Challenger finals and, partnering Jonathan Marray, made the third round of the men's doubles at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships. In 2008 he recorded his highest doubles ranking, of 172.\nBloomfield's ranking fell over 2008 and 2009, despite qualifying for the 2008 Artois Championships and the 2009 Open 13, his first successful qualifications for ATP tournaments. Despite putting up a good fight in the Open 13, Bloomfield was eventually knocked out in the first round by Simone Bolelli of Italy (7–6, 7–6) A series of back injuries saw Bloomfield's ranking fall further, before he achieved a surprise qualification for the 2010 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, Rhode Island. Here, Bloomfield achieved his first wins on the ATP Tour since Wimbledon in 2006, making his way to the semi-finals. This included a win over world number 56, Santiago Giraldo, before losing to Mardy Fish by a score of 7–6(5), 6–4. His season finished early, however, when he aggravated his back injury during a tournament in France in September 2010.\n\nIn 2011 Bloomfield continued to play in Futures tournaments, as well as qualifying for two tournaments on the Challenger tour. Remarkably, however, Bloomfield qualified once again for the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, defeating Rajeev Ram to make his first ATP tournament since his previous appearance at the 2010 tournament. At the 2011 Championships, however, Bloomfield lost in the first round to Édouard Roger-Vasselin. Subsequently, Bloomfield returned to competing predominantly in the Futures tour. In 2014 he moved to competing on the AEGON British Tour, dropping out of the ATP rankings in 2015 before securing a place in the Wimbledon qualifying draw via the Wild-Card Play-Off competition.\n\n\nTour finals\n\n\nSingles (0–2)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nRichard Bloomfield at the Association of Tennis Professionals \nRichard Bloomfield at the International Tennis Federation \nOfficial website\nLTA Profile",

It is monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers appear on the same plant. The flowers are insignificant, yellow/green in colour, and are followed by small gum-balls that persist on the tree until winter. The wood exudes a sweet-smelling resin when pierced, giving the tree its common name.\nLiquidambar acalycina is cultivated as an attractive ornamental tree for parks and gardens, and is hardy down to −15 °C (5 °F) or less. It requires cultivation in reliably moist, acid to neutral soil in full sun or partial shade. The cultivar 'Burgundy Flush', with leaves opening purple, turning green, then burgundy red in autumn, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nLiquidambar acalycina is a deciduous tree that has a brown to black colored bark with a conical/pyramidal shape. It matures quickly to a medium height at about 10m in height, and 6m in width. The leaves have three lobes, making the tree similar to a maple tree. However, they are more star shaped than maple leaves.\nThe leaves emerge with a burgundy color in spring, but as they grow and mature in summer, they become green, which indicates their increasing ability to photosynthesize. When nearing fall, the leaves return to a red to purple color.\nDuring the months of April to May, monoecious flowers begin to bud with yellow-green colors, but are insignificant for pollination in attracting pollinators. The fruit of this tree is a dark brown color. This tree serves as a shade tree for gardens. Liquidambar acalycina prefers soil that is acidic and clay-based.\n\n\nDistribution\nThis tree is native to East Asia, specifically in Southeast China. Other related species can be found in Southern China.\n\n\nDisease and infestation\nThis tree is generally stable in the specific climates in which it exists. However, some insects can infest the tree, such as webworms, bagworms, caterpillars, leaf miners, and borers. Other issues that some trees experience in this species are canker and bleeding necrosis, which can become extreme. If the plant is growing in alkaline soils, the trees may experience iron chlorosis. Other issues include dark spots on leaves, and wood rot.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Dalle de verre, from French: \"glass slab\", is a glass art technique that uses pieces of coloured glass set in a matrix of epoxy resin or other supporting material.\n\n\nTechnique\nThe technique was developed by Jean Gaudin in Paris in the 1930s. Slabs of coloured glass, 20 centimetres (7.9 in) to 30 centimetres (12 in) square or rectangular and typically up to 3 centimetres (1.2 in) thick, are shaped by breaking with a hammer or cutting with a saw. The edges of the resulting pieces may be chipped or faceted to increase the refraction and reflection effects.\nThe pieces are laid out to a design, similar to traditional stained-glass work. The pieces are laid on a bed of sand, bounded by a wooden casting frame. A matrix material is poured between the glass pieces and allowed to dry, typically requiring 24 hours to harden. The resulting solid panel is quite durable and appropriate for architectural settings or outdoor panels.\nThe use of thicker glass produces deeper colour effects than traditional lead came stained-glass, especially when illuminated by bright natural or artificial light.\nThe technique achieved prominence in the stained glass literature of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nConservation\nOriginally, concrete was used as a matrix, which means that older pieces will be structurally unsound and require renovation.  Today, modern technology has created appropriate solutions: An epoxy resin was created with the same expansion rate as the glass. This resin is now used as a matrix instead of concrete.  This has solved all structural issues.\n\n\nDalle de verre in the UK\nDalle de verre was brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux who joined James Powell and Sons (later Whitefriars Glass Studio) in 1956 and trained Dom Charles Norris in the technique. Norris was a Benedictine monk of Buckfast Abbey who went on to become arguably the most prolific British proponent of dalle de verre. His work is incorporated in several Modernist listed Catholic churches.\n\nOther notable dalle de verre artists who have worked in the UK include Gabriel Loire, John Baker and Henry Haig. The latter designed the narthex windows at Clifton Cathedral.\n\n\nSee also\nList of art techniques\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Jim Cohn is a poet, poetry activist, and spoken word artist in the United States.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nCohn was born in Highland Park, Illinois, in 1953. He received a BA from the University of Colorado at Boulder in English (1976) and a Certificate of Poetics (1980) from the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University where he was a teaching assistant to Allen Ginsberg. He received his M.S. Ed. in English and Deaf Education from the University of Rochester and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) in 1986. For over two decades, he worked in the field of disability services, taking a siddha approach as a model of Disability Services and Studies practice and scholarship. He believed that the social sciences should be redefined thematically within the United States into a form of American Karmic Studies.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1980, Cohn published his first collection of poems, Green Sky. In 1989 Prairie Falcon was published by North Atlantic Books. He has published five more books of poetry and two works of poetics nonfiction.\nHe introduced Allen Ginsberg to Deaf poets at NTID in 1984. In 1986, he published an essay entitled \"The New Deaf Poetics: Visible Poetry\" in Sign Language Studies (52). In 1987, he coordinated the first National Deaf Poetry Conference, in Rochester, NY. His role in the history of American Sign Language (ASL) poetics was documented in a 2009 film by Miriam Nathan Lerner entitled The Heart of the Hydrogen Jukebox.\nIn 1990, he became editor to an annual poetry magazine, Napalm Health Spa. In 2013 the magazine released an anthologic special edition of Napalm Health Spa, \"Long Poem Masterpieces of the Postbeats\". His entry was \"Treasures For Heaven\" \nIn 1995, Cohn began recording with The Abolitionists, a North Bay Area band that featured Mooka Rennick and guitarist Steve Kimock. He began a solo recording artist career beginning with Unspoken Words in 1998. From 2006-2008, he worked on homage, a spoken word and music recording made upon the death of his mother. In 2009, he released Impermanence, a double CD compilation.\nIn 1996, Cohn began planning for an online poetry project that would explore Beat Generation influences on the Postbeat Poets. In 1997, he founded the on-line Museum of American Poetics. In 1999, MAP became the first online poetry site to be mentioned in the New York Times. Cohn published his first collection of prose the same year, exploring the theoretical parallels between ASL and modernist poetries in a book entitled Sign Mind: Studies in American Sign Language Poetics.\nCohn's first video production, the American Poet Greats series, won the Best Multimedia Award from Community Television in Boulder, Colorado three years in a row (2001-2003). In 2003, Cohn produced his first film, a 55 minute profile on the life and poetic contributions of the Jack Kerouac School co-founder Anne Waldman, entitled Anne Waldman: Makeup on Empty Space.\nIn a 2011 review of Cohn's Sutras & Bardos: Essays & Interviews on Allen Ginsberg, the Kerouac School, Anne Waldman, The Postbeat Poets & the New Demotics, Beat Studies scholar Jonah Raskin wrote \"Perhaps no one in the United States today understands and appreciates the poetic durability and the cultural elasticity of the Beats better than Jim Cohn.\"\n\n\nBibliography\nTreasures for Heaven: Collected Poems 1976-2021, 2022, Giant Steps Press\nIf 45 was 16 & 16 was 45, 2020, Museum of American Poetics Publications (Chapbook)\nBirthday News: A Poemoscope, 2018, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nThe Ongoing Saga I Told My Daughter: Expanded Edition, 2016, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nThe Groundless Ground, 2014, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nSutras & Bardos: Essays & Interviews on Allen Ginsberg, The Kerouac School, Anne Waldman, Postbeat Poets & The New Demotics, 2011, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nMantra Winds, 2010, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nThe Ongoing Saga I Told My Daughter (original edition), 2009, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nQuien Sabe Mountain, 2004, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nThe Golden Body: Meditations on the Essence of Disability, 2003, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nSign Mind: Studies in American Sign Language Poetics, 1999, Museum of American Poetics Publications\nThe Dance of Yellow Lightning Over The Ridge, 1998, Writers & Books Publications\nGrasslands, 1994, Writers & Books Publications\nPrairie Falcon, 1989, North Atlantic Books\nGreen Sky, 1980\n\n\nDiscography\nVenerable Madtown Hall 2013, MusEx Records\nCommune 2013, MusEx Records\nImpermanence 2008, MusEx Records\nhomage 2007, MusEx Records\nTrashtalking Country 2006, MusEx Records\nEmergency Juke Joint 2002, MusEx Records\nAntenna 2000, MusEx Records\nUnspoken Words 1998, MusEx Records\nWalking Thru Hell Gazing at Flowers 1996, MusEx Records\nThe Road 1995, MusEx Records\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Site\nJim Cohn Papers Finding Aid (University of Michigan, Special Collections Research Center)\nfarfalla press Archived 2016-03-04 at the Wayback Machine\nLogos Journal Archived 2016-09-27 at the Wayback Machine\nProject MUSE\necho nyc\nWesley Lake\nPoetry Picks: The Best of 2004\nInterview with Rob Geisen, Illiterate Magazine\nAllen Ginsberg discussing his poetry with ASL class on YouTube\n\n\nReferences",

Built in 1868 for a prominent local merchant, it is one of the town's finest examples of Victorian residential architecture.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 12, 1985.\n\n\nDescription and history\nThe Moses-Kent House stands southwest of the town center of Exeter, at the southwest junction of Linden and Pine Streets.  It occupies a large lot, more than 5 acres (2.0 ha) in size, of which about 2 acres (0.81 ha) are landscaped.  The main house is a 2+1⁄2-story wood-frame structure, with a mansard roof, granite foundation, and an exterior finished in wooden siding scored to resemble ashlar stone.  It is predominantly Second Empire in its styling, with strong Italianate influence.  Its most prominent feature is a three-story tower with mansard roof and windows whose molded surrounds match those of the main mansard roof.  The property includes a surviving 1868 carriage house.  The interior of the house is well-preserved, retaining features from its construction, and from a later early 20th-century renovation.\nThe house was built in 1868 by Henry Clay Moses, a local wool merchant, who purchased two lots and demolished the buildings standing on them to make way for it. Moses hired architect Rufus Sargent of Newburyport, Massachusetts to design the house, and landscape architect Robert Morris Copeland was hired to lay out the grounds. Moses was known locally for his philanthropy, and opened portions of the property to the public as a park.  It underwent significant alterations c. 1901-02 after it was purchased by George Kent, owner of the Exeter Manufacturing Company.  The landscaping of its grounds are conjectured without evidence to have been influenced (directly or indirectly) by the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.\n\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Rockingham County, New Hampshire\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Holditch Colliery disaster was a coal mining accident on 2 July 1937, in Chesterton, Staffordshire, England, in which 30 men died and eight were injured. It was caused by a fire and subsequent explosions, and was exacerbated by a decision from management to risk the lives of mine workers to try to save the coal seam.\n\n\nThe colliery\nArchaeologists believe that the area itself was mined as long ago as Roman times.\nHolditch Colliery, also known as Brymbo Colliery, opened in 1912, and was one of a number of coal mines in Staffordshire. It was located around two miles north west of Newcastle-under-Lyme. Formerly the main employer in Chesterton, the colliery employed 1,500 men and mined ironstone in addition to coal. With varying amounts of coal coming out of the colliery per year, in 1947 it hit 400,000 tonnes. In many ways an old-fashioned mine, steam power was in some form used up until 1980. It was believed to have been the most gassy colliery in Britain. The colliery consisted of two 2,000 feet deep shafts, sunk in 1912 and 1916, working Great Row and the Four Feet seams.\nDespite heavy investment in the 1960s and 1970s the colliery closed down in 1990, just three years after the end of the year long miners' strike. Just before its closure it was taking out over 500,000 tonnes of coal a year. Many of the miners transferred to nearby Silverdale Colliery, which itself closed down on Christmas Eve 1998. The current site of Holditch Colliery is now a large business park.\n\n\nDisaster\nAt around 5:45 am on 2 July 1937, two coal cutter men (Herman Payne and William Beardmore) were working when Beardmore noticed a flame. The flame spread quickly across the coalface into a deadly wall of fire. The two men quickly fled and actually survived the disaster which was about to strike.\nOf the 55 men working in the vicinity of the fire, all but two managed to escape (W.Hystead and Arthur Stanton). The two men became lost in the smoke, which eventually overcame them. The remaining 53 men attempted in vain to extinguish the fire, with the timber supports ablaze and threatening roof collapse, the overman ordered the stone dust to be dumped and spread about as near to the fire as possible. These efforts also proved futile and so the men retreated further back and took a roll call – revealing the absence of Hystead and Stanton. By now the fire had taken hold and the two men were feared lost.\nWhilst the men were fighting a losing battle against the fire, day shift officials, who had been informed of the fire, arrived on the scene. One of these men, H.Bentley, ordered a night shift ripper, John Hassell, to meet him at the right hand gate. Here an explosion occurred at around 6:50, leaving Bentley with burns and killing Hassell. Bentley recruited collier E.Beech to help him search for Hassell, but they failed to find him.\n\n\"After my examination in the morning my mind was made up that those three men were dead. I do see they could have possibly have been alive from the atmosphere I saw.\"\nExplosions occurring in the mine, a full evacuation was ordered. By around 7:10 the men met in the main crut. The manager ordered for stoppings to be put on in the cruts, and sand, stone and dust was brought in for this purpose. Ten minutes later the night-shift workers were sent home, as the day-shift workers began work on the stoppings. The management team began inspecting the mine to decide upon a further course of action. Mr. Cocks, the managing director, ordered that the location of the stoppings be changed, despite disagreement from his team. This proved to be a fatal decision, as the new location was in unsettled ground. The original plan by Mr.Davies, was to put two stopping dams in solid ground, and would allow for easy transportation of materials at a distance of less than 500 yards from the pit bottom. The revised plan Mr.Cocks ordered meant erecting three such dams in unstable ground, also providing air to the fire, and requiring a travelling distance of 1,300 yards for essential tools and equipment. The reason taken for this new plan was to save the coal seam.\n\n\"This change in the original plan of the manager was a vital matter, resulting, as it did, in the large death toll.\"\nBy now 9:00, two government inspectors, Mr.Finney and Mr. Bloor, arrived on the scene, joining Davies at the pit bottom. Ten minutes later a sixth explosion occurred, though the 35 men who were in the mine continued in their work, along with the three missing men believed to be lost. Shortly before 10:10 a seventh small explosion occurred, followed by an eighth, and deadly blast. The eighth explosion had sent men working 1,000 yards away to the ground, reversing the ventilation system, and killing thirty men, badly burning the remaining eight.\n\n\nMen who lost their lives\nSource:\n\nAdkins, H.L.

They went down the pit to save their fellows, and Staffordshire will never forget them.\"\nOn 19 October 1937 Scottish Football League champions Rangers travelled to the Victoria Ground to play Stoke City in a benefit match for the victims of the disaster, raising £2,000 for the relief fund.\nToday a memorial stands to the victims at Apedale Heritage Centre.\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe first plan was the safest course of action, however the second plan was adopted to save profits at the risk of lives.\n\n\"It is my considered opinion that at the time the second plan was adopted, very dangerous conditions existed, and were known at the time to exist which made the attempt to follow this plan a matter of imminent peril to the lives of the unnecessarily large number of men required to execute it.\"\nThe original fire was concluded to have originated in the coal cutting machine and was due to frictional heat produced by the picks in the cut. The explosions were caused by firedamp.\n\n\nLater tragedies\nBetween 1949 and 1967 eleven more deaths were recorded. Most of these were due to roof falls.\n\n\nSee also\nList of accidents and disasters by death toll#Coal mine disasters\nList of disasters in Great Britain and Ireland\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDetailed report by The Coal Mining History Resource Centre",

    "title": "1999 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=21743849",
    "text": "The 1999 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game was a one-game extension to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1999 regular season, played between the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds to determine the winner of the National League (NL) wild card. It was played at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, on October 4, 1999. The Mets won the game, 5–0, with starting pitcher Al Leiter pitching a two-hit shutout. As a result, the Mets qualified for the postseason and the Reds did not.\nThe game was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win–loss records of 96–66. Some described the Mets as collapsing late in the season while the race between the Reds and their division rival Houston Astros was close enough to create the possibility of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip late in the season which, by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Mets advanced to National League Division Series (NLDS) where they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 3 games to 1. They then advanced to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) but were defeated by the Atlanta Braves, 4 games to 2.  This game counted as the 163rd regular-season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular-season statistics.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mets spent 34 days of the 1999 season leading the National League East Division, but—following a seven-game losing streak from September 21–28 along with an eight-game winning streak by their division rival Atlanta Braves from September 19–28 — the Braves took a commanding 8-game lead in the division that they did not relinquish. Meanwhile, the Reds and Houston Astros were in a close race for the National League Central Division. The Astros led the division for much of the season, but did not lead by more than three games after August 1 except for one day. Ultimately, the Astros won the division with a 97–65 record, one game ahead of the 96–66 Reds. The Astros won their 97th game on the final day of the season. If Houston had not won that game, the Astros, Reds, and Mets would have instead been in a three-way tie for both the NL Central and the wild card spot. Bob Costas suggested that MLB was lucky to avoid this situation as he believed they had \"no reasonable tiebreaker\" to deal with it. Had this three-way tie arisen, the Mets would have won the wild card while the Astros and Reds would have played a tie-breaker for the Central Division title (as the tiebreaker counts as a regular season game, the Reds/Astros loser would have moved to 96–67, 1⁄2 game worse than the Mets).\nThe Mets' losing streak late in the season led Jayson Stark to label them a \"sinking ship\" in a column on September 30. However, the Mets broke this streak with a win over the Braves and dominant pitcher Greg Maddux and then, following a loss, swept three games from the Pittsburgh Pirates to end the season, tying the Reds' 96–66 record. The New York Daily News described this late-season performance as an \"agonizing roller coaster ride\" for Mets fans. With the Mets and Reds holding the best non-division winning records in the league a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. Bob Costas said at the time he did not like the wild-card system as he believed it \"diminishes the drama and authenticity of a pennant race\", although he approved of the playoff teams in 1999. Tim McCarver disagreed, arguing that the late-season race between the Mets, Astros, and Reds showed the excitement a wild card can add to the season. A coin flip conducted earlier that September set Cincinnati's Cinergy Field as the location for the tie-breaker game.\n\n\nGame summary\n\nThe Mets took a quick 2–0 lead with a single by Rickey Henderson to open the game followed immediately by a home run by Edgardo Alfonzo. They added to this lead in the third as Alfonzo drew a walk and then John Olerud hit a double which advanced Alfonzo to third base. Reds starter Steve Parris intentionally walked Mike Piazza to load the bases and was relieved by Denny Neagle. However, Neagle then walked Robin Ventura to score Alfonzo and extend the lead to 3–0. Neagle remained in the game and yielded a home run to Henderson to lead off the fifth inning for the fourth run. Neagle then loaded the bases with two outs with walks to Piazza and Ventura followed by a Darryl Hamilton single, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Reds pinch hit for Neagle in the bottom of the fifth, and Danny Graves entered for them to pitch the sixth inning. Graves walked Rey Ordóñez to leadoff the inning, Mets starter Al Leiter sacrifice bunted Ordóñez to second, and following an out he scored on a double by Alfonzo. Graves remained in the game until Mark Lewis pinch hit for him in the eighth and Dennys Reyes relieved him in the ninth. Graves and Reyes held the score steady after the sixth but the Reds' offense did not score against Al Leiter and the Mets won the game, and with it the Wild Card, 5–0.\nAl Leiter pitched a complete game shutout, scattering two hits and four walks across the nine inning start. This was Leiter's first complete game of the season. Pokey Reese was the only Reds player to reach scoring position for the entire game, doubling to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning and then advancing to third on a ground out. The Bergen Record labeled Leiter the Mets' \"flag bearer\", coming through in games such as this when the team needed him most. For example, Leiter had also defeated Greg Maddux in his previous start on September 29 to snap the Mets' seven-game losing streak. Leiter's earned run average in the second half of the 1999 season was 1.22 runs lower than in the first. Leiter's start earned an 86 game score, which tied for the 14th best total in the National League that season.\n\n\nAftermath\nNew York's win clinched the team's fifth postseason berth in franchise history, their first since losing in the 1988 National League Championship Series. The playoff berth made the Mets the second team in MLB history to make the playoffs after being two games back of the leader with three games left to play in the season. The Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS, 3 games to 1. This win advanced the Mets to the NLCS where they lost to the Atlanta Braves, 4 games to 2.\nThe Mets performance in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued this was a good sign for the future of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed that baseball needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership.\nAt 96–67, the Reds had the best record of any team that failed to make the postseason in the Wild Card Era that began in 1995.\nIn baseball statistics tie-breakers counted as regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, Mike Piazza grounded into his 27th double play of the season in the ninth inning, adding to his league-leading total. Similarly, Leiter's performance advanced his position on several 1999 statistical leaderboards including shutouts and walks issued. Reese, Ventura, and Ordóñez won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for the season while Piazza and Alfonzo won Silver Sluggers. Robin Ventura also finished sixth in the National League's Most Valuable Player voting, with Chipper Jones taking the award.\nThis game marked the only time the Reds were shut out between April 1999 and May 2001, a span of 349 games.  After this game, the Reds would go the entire 2000 season without getting shut out, becoming only the second team in MLB history to do so (joining the 1932 New York Yankees).  They would extend their streak of scoring a run in every game into the 2001 season for a total of 208 games, the third longest such streak in MLB history at the time (now the fourth-longest).  Had this game not counted as a regular season game, the Reds would have scored a run in 348 straight games, which would have been the longest streak in MLB history.\nThe New York Yankees also made the playoffs in 1999, eventually advancing to the 1999 World Series where they swept the Braves. The 1999 season marked the first time both of the current New York City-based MLB teams, the Mets and Yankees qualified for the playoffs together in the same season. Prior to the Mets' elimination, Mike Lupica noted the possibility of a \"Subway Series\", a term for a World Series played between two New York-based teams. The 1956 World Series between the Yankees and then-Brooklyn Dodgers was the last such Series. Yankees pitcher David Cone told Lupica \"I want a Subway Series, for selfish reasons. I want to play in one.\" Although the Mets failed to make the Series in 1999 the two met the following year in the 2000 World Series where the Yankees won, 4 games to 1. After their 2000 World Series appearance, the Mets did not make the playoffs again until 2006. Meanwhile, the Reds did not place in the top two of their division until 2010. Jack McKeon managed the Reds from 1998 to 2000 and was fired after the 2000 season when the team finished 10 games back of the division leading Cardinals.\n\n\nReferences\nGeneral\n\nSpecific",

    "title": "Motion interpolation",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15522867",
    "text": "Motion interpolation, motion-compensated frame interpolation (MCFI), or frame generation, is a form of video processing in which intermediate film, video or animation frames are synthesized between existing ones by means of interpolation, in an attempt to make animation more fluid, to compensate for display motion blur, and for fake slow motion effects.\n\n\nHardware applications\n\n\nDevices\nMotion interpolation is a common, optional feature of various modern video devices such as HDTVs and AV receivers, aimed at increasing perceived framerate or alleviating display motion blur, a common problem on LCD flat-panel displays.\n\n\nDifference from display framerate\nA display's output refresh rate, input drive signal framerate, and original content framerate, are not always equivalent. In other words, a display capable of or operating at a high framerate does not necessarily mean that it can or must perform motion interpolation. For example, a TV running at 120 Hz and displaying 24 FPS content will simply display each content frame for five of the 120 display frames per second. This has no effect on the picture compared to 60 Hz other than eliminating the need for 3:2 pulldown and thus film judder as a matter of course (since 120 is evenly divisible by 24). Eliminating judder results in motion that is less \"jumpy\" and which matches that of a theater projector. Motion interpolation can be used to eliminate judder, but it is only necessary when targeting a framerate not evenly divisible.\n\n\nRelationship to advertised display framerate\nThe advertised framerate of a specific display may refer to either the maximum number of content frames which may be displayed per second, or the number of times the display is refreshed in some way, irrespective of content. In the latter case, the actual presence or strength of any motion interpolation option may vary. In addition, the ability of a display to show content at a specific framerate does not mean that display is capable of accepting content running at that rate; TVs above 60 Hz do not accept a higher frequency signal from most or any sources, but rather use the extra refresh capability to eliminate judder, reduce ghosting, display stereoscopy, or create interpolated frames.\nAs an example, a TV may be advertised as \"240 Hz\", which would mean one of two things:\n\nThe TV can natively display 240 frames per second, and perform advanced motion interpolation which inserts between 2 and 8 new frames between existing ones (for content running at 60 FPS to 24 FPS, respectively). For active 3D, this framerate would be halved.\nThe TV is natively only capable of displaying 120 frames per second, and basic motion interpolation which inserts between 1 and 4 new frames between existing ones. Typically the only difference from a \"120 Hz\" TV in this case is the addition of a strobing backlight, which flickers on and off at 240 Hz, once after every 120 Hz frame. The intent of a strobing backlight is to increase the apparent response rate and thus reduce blur, which results in clearer motion. However, this technique has little to do with actual framerate. For active 3D, this framerate is halved, and no motion interpolation or pulldown functionality is typically provided. 600 Hz is an oft-advertised figure for plasma TVs, and while technically correct, it only refers to an inter-frame response time of 1.6 milliseconds. This significantly reduces blur and thus improves motion quality, but is unrelated to interpolation and content framerate. There are no consumer films shot at 600 frames per second, nor any realtime video processors capable of generating 576 interpolated frames per second.\n\n\nSoftware applications\n\n\nVideo playback software\nMotion interpolation features are included with several video player applications.\n\nWinDVD uses Philips' TrimensionDNM for frame interpolation.\nPowerDVD uses TrueTheater Motion for interpolation of DVD and video files to up to 72 frame/s.\nSplash PRO uses Mirillis Motion² technology for up to Full HD video interpolation.\nDmitriRender uses GPU-oriented frame rate conversion algorithm with native DXVA support for frame interpolation.\nHopperRender is an optical flow frame interpolator DirectShow filter using OpenCL. \nBluesky Frame Rate Converter is a DirectShow filter that can convert the frame rate using AMD Fluid Motion.\nSVP (SmoothVideo Project) comes integrated by default with MPC-HC; paid version can integrate with more players, including VLC.\n\n\nVideo editing software\nSome video editing software and plugins offer motion interpolation effects to enhance digitally-slowed video. FFmpeg is a free software non-interactive tool with such functionality. Adobe After Effects has this in a feature called \"Pixel Motion\". AI software company Topaz Labs produces Video AI, a video upscaling application with motion interpolation. The effects plugin \"Twixtor\" is available for most major video editing suites, and offers similar functionality.\n\n\nNeural networks\nDepth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation\nChannel Attention Is All You Need\nReal-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation\nIntermediate Feature Refine Network\n\n\nGaming\nIntended for latency intolerant applications, especially games, some use additional metadata from deep inside the graphics pipeline to lessen artifacts or speed performance. Except for Nvidia's, all are hardware-agnostic.\n\nDLSS Frame Generation from Nvidia\nFSR Frame Generation from AMD\nFluid Motion Frames from AMD\nXeSS Frame Generation from Intel\n\n\nSide effects\n\n\nVisual artifacts\n\nEspecially on cheaper TV implementations, visual anomalies in the picture are more pronounced. Described by CNET's David Carnoy as a \"little tear or glitch\" in the picture, appearing for a fraction of a second. He adds that the effect is most noticeable when the technology suddenly kicks in during a fast camera pan. Television and display manufacturers refer to this phenomenon as a type of digital artifact. Due to the improvement of associated technology over time, such artifacts appear less obviously with higher-end and newer consumer TVs, though they will never be eliminated \"the artifacts happens more often when the gap between frames are bigger\".\n\n\nLatency\nInput lag for general purpose motion interpolation itself is usually ~10 ms, though some implementations are more than 80 ms, which for TVs (except on some Samsung sets) is further exacerbated by the need to disable game mode, imposing dozens to hundreds of ms of additional lag. All that is on top of the already poor lag inherent to most TVs even when optimally configured, compared to CRTs or gaming monitors. For dedicated gaming interpolation such as DLSS4 MFG, lag is 6-9 ms depending on multiplier, vastly dwarfed by the added lag of a slower internal render framerate. Prototype techniques, similar to those already deployed in some asynchronous reprojection for virtual reality, could cut overhead well below 1 ms, even when generating thousands of frames.\n\n\nSoap opera effect\n\nSome opposition against motion interpolation has arisen not because of artifacts, but from a dislike of fluidity itself in some or all content, whether synthetic or native. Because cheaper TV programs such as soap operas tended to be shot in 60 Hz, whereas more prestigious works such as theatrical movies tended to be filmed in 24 FPS, high frame rate has a \"soap opera effect\" for critics.\n\n\nSee also\nInbetweening\nMotion compensation\nMotion interpolation (computer graphics)\nFlicker-free\nTelevision standards conversion\n3:2 pulldown\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHigh Frame Rate Motion Compensated Frame Interpolation in High-Definition Video Processing\nA Low Complexity Motion Compensated Frame Interpolation Method",

In the state of Missouri, US 169 enters the state from Kansas overlapped with I-70 / US 24 / US 40 at Kansas City and exits the state into Iowa north of Irena.\n\n\nRoute description\n\nUS 169 enters Missouri from Kansas via the Lewis and Clark Viaduct overlapped with I-70 / US 24 / US 40. The highway leaves the overlap near an interchange with I-35 / Downtown Loop in the downtown area, traveling along Broadway Boulevard and crosses the Missouri River via the Buck O'Neil Bridge, becoming a freeway known as the Arrowhead Trafficway. North of the river, US 169 travels between Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport and the western edge of North Kansas City before running close to the river north of the airport. North of the Route 9 interchange, the freeway runs through a wooded area of the city and passes near Gladstone at the I-29 / US 71 interchange. US 169 passes near Metro North Mall at Barry Road, before becoming a more rural route at Route 152. The Arrowhead Trafficway ends at I-435, with US 169 becoming a four-lane divided expressway to Smithville.\nNorth of Smithville, US 169 becomes a two-lane rural highway, passing through the towns of Trimble and Gower before entering St. Joseph. In St. Joseph, the highway intersects I-29 / US 71 twice and forms part of the Belt Highway in the eastern part of the city. Between I-29 and US 36, US 169 travels through an area that is mostly made up of commercial developments and north of US 36 it travels through areas that feature a mix between commercial and residential. The highway leaves St. Joseph after intersecting I-29 / US 71 a second time. North of St. Joseph, US 169's route is mostly rural. The highway has an overlap with US 136 from Stanberry to near Albany. North of US 136, US 169 travels through Gentry, Grant City, and Irena before exiting the state into Iowa.\n\n\nHistory\nOn May 18, 2018, MoDOT began construction on the Buck O'Neil Bridge, with plans to repair the expansion joints, cable keep replacements and partial scour remediation. The project is expected to last until December at a cost of $7 million. MoDOT eventually plans to completely replace the bridge, with an estimated cost of $150 million; construction would not begin until at least 2022.\n\n\nMajor intersections\nAll exits are unnumbered.\n\n\nSee also\n U.S. Roads portal\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",

    "text": "Polo Grounds Music is a hip hop and R&B record label, distributed by Sony Music's RCA Records. Founded in 2006 by Bryan Leach, Polo Grounds Music is a full-service entertainment company with a focus in publishing, management, marketing and promotions.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nFoundation\nIn 2006, Bryan Leach, a longtime native of Harlem, New York City, had formed a limited liability company called Polo Grounds Music, named after Polo Grounds Towers (the apartment complex where Leach grew up during his adolescence, which was built on the former site of the Polo Grounds stadium).\n\n\nPartnership with J and success\nAfter securing a joint venture partnership with Clive Davis' J Records, the label's first signee was Baton Rouge rapper Hurricane Chris, who in 2007, would give the label its first platinum hit single with \"A Bay Bay\". It was followed up by the release of Chris' debut, 51/50 Ratchet, that November. Leach was also given an offer to become senior vice president of RCA Records, but he declined, choosing to be in charge of his own label fully.\nIn 2009, Polo Grounds signed Pitbull, following the bankruptcy and closure of his previous label, TVT Records; founder Bryan Leach had previously had involvement with TVT as he was the vice president of A&R since 1998 until 2005. Upon signing, he was granted his own imprint, Mr. 305, Inc. That August, Pitbull released Pitbull Starring in Rebelution, which garnered its multi-platinum hit single, \"Hotel Room Service\", helping the album top the Billboard rap album chart. The song's success followed up two years later with the release of Planet Pit, and its singles, \"Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)\" and \"Give Me Everything\".\n\n\nRCA Records merger and continued path\nOn October 7, 2011, J Records' parent company, Sony Music, completed the progress of merging its labels belonging to the RCA Music Group. J was included. With the merger and apparent absorption of J, Arista and Jive Records, Polo Grounds Music and the entirety of its roster (along with other labels and artists that were associated with J, Arista or Jive) were now deferred to release new music for RCA Records.\nFollowing the merger of J into RCA and Polo Grounds being moved to the new brand, the label continued its streak, beginning in January 2012 with the release of Yo Gotti's album, Live from the Kitchen. Unfortunately, the album underperformed after selling 16,000 copies in its first week. After the album's subpar performance, Yo Gotti was dropped from Polo Grounds.\n\n\nASAP Rocky takeover\nAfter previously releasing the music video for \"Purple Swag\", Polo Grounds founder Leach was among other label executives cornering ASAP Rocky with contractual offers, resulting in the two launching a close friendship. That October, Rocky decided to join the Polo Grounds imprint while it was distributed under J Records, a few days before the label was folded into RCA. The deal wasn't made public until October 14. The label acquired majority rights to distribute and reissue Rocky's \"Purple Swag\" single, which they did on October 24 through all digital platforms and radio networks. The single's re-release would be followed by the release of Rocky's mixtape, Live. Love. ASAP, on Halloween. The mixtape had since been reissued for streaming services by Polo Grounds ten years later for its anniversary with slight alterations.\nASAP Rocky's signage with Polo Grounds/RCA and his growing success also granted him and ASAP Mob co-founder ASAP Yams (1988–2015) their own label, ASAP Worldwide, when they agreed to sign affiliate ASAP Ferg to both labels.\nThroughout 2013, Polo Grounds released two albums by both Rocky and Ferg, respectively Long. Live. ASAP and Trap Lord. The former debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, giving Rocky and Polo Grounds both their first mutual number one album in the label's catalogue and the rapper's discography. Meanwhile, the latter debuted at number nine with first week copies of 32,000 sold. However, Trap Lord managed to gain positive critical feedback.\nIn January 2015, Rocky's manager and partner, ASAP Yams died from an acute mixed drug intoxication, succumbing a sleep apnea. The news of his death impacted Rocky and Polo Grounds greatly and affected development for his sophomore album, which was due for release that February, but then delayed after the tragedy. The now-titled At. Long. Last. ASAP was finally released on May 26, once again debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, but sold poorly with 146,000 album-equivalent units. With 2016 beginning, Rocky's colleague, ASAP Ferg, began the label's year rollout with his own sophomore solo album, Always Strive and Prosper, which released on Earth Day. Later in October, the ASAP Mob released Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends and followed up in between 2017 and 2019 with Vol. 2: Too Cozy, Ferg's mixtape, Still Striving, ASAP Twelvyy's solo debut, 12 (all within the summer of 2017), Rocky's third solo album, Testing (May 2018), and Ferg's extended play, Floor Seats (August 2019), all of each released under ASAP Worldwide/Polo Grounds/RCA; Rocky's Testing would end up being his final album to be released by Polo Grounds as he left the label in early 2019.\n\n\nFailed comeback attempts and RCA deal extensions\nIn 2012, the label signed newcomers Lantana, Yung Joc and Overdoz. Lantana released the single, \"All Hustle, No Luck\". However, the single's commercial release was piqued by founder Bryan Leach's first degree gun conviction. Overdoz debuted with the single, \"Lauren London\", which was met with mostly positive critical reviews.\nIn 2014, Polo Grounds renewed a multi-year label deal with RCA.\nPitbull attempted a comeback with the single, \"Timber\" (2013), which ultimately made the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2014. Unfortunately, three of Pitbull's follow-up albums have poor commercial responses; Global Warming (2012) sold 64,000 copies in its first week, while Globalization (2014) only accumulated 49,000 and Climate Change (2017) sold 14,000. This lack of commercial performance caused Pitbull to part ways with Polo Grounds Music after Climate Change's release.\nIn December 2018, Polo Grounds and RCA signed another partnership extension, making the former a temporary subsidiary of RCA Records. With this second renewal came the departure of ASAP Rocky after three albums under the label and him being replaced by Chicago sensation Calboy.\n\n\nRecovery\nCalboy had released the single, \"Envy Me\", previously in September 2018. After Polo Grounds signed the Chicago rapper to the label, they (like ASAP Rocky's \"Purple Swag\") acquired the single and pushed it to streaming services. The single's popularity began to take off and managed to retrieve a gold certification from the RIAA, recovering the label's prosperity. On May 9, 2019, Calboy was succeeded by the release of another label mate, Brooklyn rapper Jay Gwuapo's debut album, From Nothing, Pt. 1. Calboy retrieved with his first EP release, Wildboy, three weeks later. He later followed with two more EPs, 2020's Long Live the Kings and 2022's Black Heart.\nAs recent as February 2022, Calboy publicly disclosed his frustrations with Polo Grounds and RCA Records, believing he was being treated like a \"label slave\".\n\n\nArtists\n\n\nCurrent artists\nAbra\nASAP Ferg\nASAP Rocky\nJay Gwuapo\nOverdoz\n\n\nFormer artists\nASAP Mob\nASAP Twelvyy\nHurricane Chris\nKJ Balla (deceased)\nLantana\nNina Sky\nPitbull\nSammie\nYo Gotti\nYung Joc\nCalboy\n\n\nDiscography\nHurricane Chris - 51/50 Ratchet (2007)\nPitbull - Rebelution (2009)\nHurricane Chris - Unleashed (2009)\nYo Gotti - Live from the Kitchen (2012)\nASAP Rocky - Long.

    "text": "Francesco Redi (18 February 1626 – 1 March 1697) was an Italian physician, naturalist, biologist, and poet. He is referred to as the \"founder of experimental biology\", and as the \"father of modern parasitology\". He was the first person to challenge the theory of spontaneous generation by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies.\nHaving a doctoral degree in both medicine and philosophy from the University of Pisa at the age of 21, he worked in various cities of Italy. A rationalist of his time, he was a critic of verifiable myths, such as spontaneous generation. His most famous experiments are described in his magnum opus Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects), published in 1668. He disproved that vipers drink wine and could break glasses and that their venom was poisonous when ingested. He correctly observed that snake venoms were produced from the fangs, not the gallbladder, as was believed. He was also the first to recognize and correctly describe details of about 180 parasites, including Fasciola hepatica and Ascaris lumbricoides. He also distinguished earthworms from helminths (like tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms). He possibly originated the use of the control, the basis of experimental design in modern biology. A collection of his poems first published in 1685 Bacco in Toscana (Bacchus in Tuscany) is considered among the finest works of 17th-century Italian poetry, and for which the Grand Duke Cosimo III gave him a medal of honour.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThe son of Gregorio Redi and Cecilia de Ghinci, Francesco Redi was born in Arezzo on 18 February 1626. His father was a renowned physician at Florence. After schooling with the Jesuits, Francesco Redi attended the University of Pisa from where he obtained his doctoral degrees in medicine and philosophy in 1647, at the age of 21. He constantly moved, to Rome, Naples, Bologna, Padua, and Venice, and finally settled in Florence in 1648. Here he was registered at the Collegio Medico where he served at the Medici Court as both the head physician and superintendent of the ducal apothecary to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his successor, Cosimo III. It is here that most of his academic works were achieved, which earned him membership in Accademia dei Lincei. He was also a member of the Accademia del Cimento (Academy of Experiment) from 1657 to 1667.\nHe died in his sleep on 1 March 1697 in Pisa and his remains were returned to Arezzo for interment.\nA collection of his letters is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n\nScientific career\n\n\nExperimental toxicology\nIn 1664 Redi wrote his first monumental work Osservazioni intorno alle vipere (Observations on Vipers) to his friend Lorenzo Magalotti, secretary of the Accademia del Cimento. In this he began to break the prevailing scientific myths (which he called \"unmasking of the untruths\") such as vipers drink wine and shatter glasses, their venom is poisonous if swallowed, the head of the dead viper is an antidote, the viper's venom is produced from the gallbladder, and so on. He explained rather how snake venom is unrelated to the snake’s bite, an idea contrary to popular belief. He performed a series of experiments on the effects of snakebites and demonstrated that venom was poisonous only when it enters the bloodstream via a bite, and that the fang contains venom in the form of yellow fluid. He even showed that by applying a tight ligature before the wound, the passage of venom into the heart could be prevented. This work marked the beginning of experimental toxinology/toxicology.\n\n\nEntomology and spontaneous generation\n\nRedi is best known for his series of experiments, published in 1668 as Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects), which is regarded as his masterpiece and a milestone in the history of modern science. The book is one of the first steps in refuting \"spontaneous generation\"—a theory also known as Aristotelian abiogenesis. At the time, the prevailing wisdom was that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.\n\nRedi took six jars and divided them into two groups of three: In one experiment, in the first jar of each group, he put an unknown object; in the second, a dead fish; in the last, a raw chunk of veal. Redi covered the tops of the first group of jars with fine gauze so that only air could get into them. He left the other group open. After several days, he saw maggots appear on the objects in the open jars, on which flies had been able to land, but not in the gauze-covered jars. In the second experiment, meat was kept in three jars. One of the jars was uncovered, and two of the jars were covered, one with cork and the other one with gauze. Flies could only enter the uncovered jar, and in this, maggots appeared. In the jar that was covered with gauze, maggots appeared on the gauze but did not survive.\n\nRedi continued his experiments by capturing the maggots and waiting for them to metamorphose, which they did, becoming flies. Also, when dead flies or maggots were put in sealed jars with dead animals or veal, no maggots appeared, but when the same thing was done with living flies, maggots did. His interpretations were always based on biblical passages, such as his famous adage: omne vivum ex vivo (\"All life comes from life\").\n\n\nParasitology\nRedi was the first to describe ectoparasites in his Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti. His notable illustrations in the book are those relevant to ticks, including deer ticks and tiger ticks; it also contains the first depiction of the larva of Cephenemyiinae, the nasal flies of deer, as well as the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica). His next treatise in 1684 titled Osservazioni intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi (Observations on Living Animals, that are in Living Animals) recorded the descriptions and the illustrations of more than 100 parasites. In it, he also differentiates the earthworm (generally regarded as a helminth) and Ascaris lumbricoides, the human roundworm. An important innovation from the book is his experiments in chemotherapy in which he employed the \"control\"', the basis of experimental design in modern biological research. He described some 180 species of parasites. Perhaps, his most significant observation was that parasites produce eggs and develop from them, which contradicted the prevailing opinion that they are produced spontaneously.\n\n\nLiterary career\nAs a poet, Redi is best known for the dithyramb Bacco in Toscana (Bacchus in Tuscany), which first appeared in 1685. His bacchanalian poem in praise of Tuscan wines is still read in Italy today. He was admitted to two literary societies: the Academy of Arcadia and the Accademia della Crusca. He was an active member of Crusca and supported the preparation of the Tuscan dictionary. He taught the Tuscan language as a lettore pubblico di lingua toscana in Florence in 1666. He also composed many other literary works, including his Letters, and Arianna Inferma.\n\n\nEponyms\nRedi, a crater on Mars was named in his honor.\nThe larval stage of parasitic fluke called \"redia\" is named after Redi by another Italian zoologist, Filippo de Filippi, in 1837.\nThe Redi Award, the most prestigious award in toxinology, is given in his honour by the International Society on Toxinology. The award is made at each World Congress of IST (generally held every three years) since 1967.\nA scientific journal Redia, an Italian journal of zoology, is named in his honour, which was first published in 1903.\nA European viper subspecies, Vipera aspis francisciredi Laurenti, 1768, is named after him.\n\n\nSee also\nParasitology\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAltieri Biagi; Maria Luisa (1968).

    "text": "In United States constitutional law, false statements of fact are assertions, which are ostensibly facts, that are false. Such statements are not always protected by the First Amendment. Often, this is due to laws against defamation, that is making statements that harm the reputation of another. In those cases, freedom of speech comes into conflict with the right to privacy. Because it is almost impossible for someone to be absolutely sure that what they say (in public) is true, a party who makes a false claim isn't always liable. Whether such speech is protected depends on the situation. The standards of such protection have evolved over time from a body of Supreme Court rulings.\nOne of the landmark cases that established such standards was New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). In that case, the court ruled that statements about public officials must be given more protection in order to avoid squelching public debate. Similar protections were later expanded to statements about public figures (not just officials), and matters of \"public concern\" (including those involving private parties). Other examples of false statements of fact that do not receive First Amendment protection include false advertising, as in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. (2014) and POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co. (2014), and commercial speech that includes misleading statements as in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission (1980).\nSection 1001(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code states:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully—\nfalsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;\nmakes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or\nmakes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the matter relates to an offense under chapter 109A, 109B, 110, or 117, or section 1591, then the term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more than 8 years.\nIn upholding a conviction under Section 1001(a) of Title 18 in Bryson v. United States (1969), the Supreme Court stated:\n\nOur legal system provides methods for challenging the Government's right to ask questions—lying is not one of them.\n\n\nOverview of the legal rule\n\n\nTheoretical basis for exception\nThe United States Supreme Court first articulated the basis for excluding false statements of fact from First Amendment protection in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974). In that case, a monthly newspaper was sued by a policeman's attorney. The newspaper \"contained serious inaccuracies\" about the attorney; namely, that he was supporting the police system as a goal to entrench a Communist conspiracy in the United States. They held that a civil jury award against the newspaper was constitutional because \"there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact\". Justice Powell, in writing the decision of the Court reasoned that false statements do not \"advance society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate'\". Even though he conceded that some false statements were inevitable, that did not mean that a system of liability meant to deter such behavior was impermissible. Society had some interest in ensuring that debate covered truthful matters, as a key element of public participation in a democracy.\n\n\nBasic substantive rule\nThe legal rule itself – how to apply this exception – is complicated, as it is often dependent on who said the statement and which actor it was directed towards. The analysis is thus different if the government or a public figure is the target of the false statement (where the speech may get more protection) than a private individual who is being attacked over a matter of their private life. Thus, a key starting point in the analysis will discuss the 'manner' and 'context' in which the statements were made.\nProfessor Eugene Volokh of UCLA Law characterizes this context analysis as divided into five different areas. First, false statements of fact can lead to civil liability if they are \"said with a sufficiently culpable mental state\". This possibly includes conscious lies about military service. The second category is a subset of the first: knowingly false statements (deliberate lies). This includes things like libel and slander. These sorts of statements are specifically punishable because they contain malice. A third category are \"negligently\" false statements, which may \"lead to [some] liability\". A fourth included set includes statements that only have a \"provable false factual connotation\" – that is, implicit statements of fact. The example Volokh uses is the statement that \"Joe deserves to die\" which in the context of a murder could be made to be a factual statement.\nThe fifth category is one that is not as firmly set by precedent: false statements, even deliberate lies, against the government may be protected. While some \"seditious libel\" may be able to be punished, political statements are likely protected.\n\n\nRemedies\nPunitive damages are sometimes available against an individual who made a public false statement of fact. Criminal liability, although uncommon, can be made although they are usually subject to the same limitations imposed on civil suits in terms of elements to be proven.\n\n\nCategories of analysis\n\n\nPublic officials/public concern\nFalse statements that are on matters of public concern and that defame public figures are unprotected if they are made with \"actual malice\", which is defined as \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\". The \"actual malice\" test comes from the Supreme Court's decision New York Times v. Sullivan (1964). That case concerned an allegation of libel by L.B. Sullivan, a supervisor of the Montgomery, Alabama police department. Sullivan argued that a full-page advertisement in the New York Times incorrectly asserted that his police department let civil rights violations against blacks occur. The Court held that even if the advertisement was incorrect, the fact that there was no intent to harm Sullivan by the newspaper (\"actual malice\") meant that the lawsuit could not proceed. This specific standard of mens rea is specifically to be used in cases where such speech comments on a matter of public concern.\nThe basis for this ruling was the Court's fear that \"a rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions\" would lead to \"self-censorship\". This determination altered the theory of the 'false statements' free speech exception. Even if a false statement generally would be harmful for public discourse, the Court quoted John Stuart Mill in arguing a false statement in this context would bring \"the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error\".\n\n\nDefinition of public figures\nThe Supreme Court has struggled to define who exactly is a public figure, but over fifty years of cases, a framework has become defined. The first grouping of public figures are government officials. The test of which government figures was articulated in the Court's ruling in Rosenblatt v. Baer (1966). In Rosenblatt, the Court said that government positions subject to this rule were those in which the \"public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees\". Additionally, a court must question whether the \"employee's position is one which would involve public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it\". Along with government officials, the Supreme Court held in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974) that people who \"have assumed an influential role in ordering society\" are considered public figures. This is the same for people who have \"achieved...pervasive fame or notoriety\" or who have \"voluntarily injected themselves or been drawn into a particular public controversy\". This has even been held to include Jerry Falwell, a major religious figure in the United States.\n\n\nIssues \"of public concern\"\nThe leading case on what an issue \"of public concern\" is Dun & Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders (1985). In Dun & Bradstreet, the Supreme Court considered whether a credit reporting service which distributed fliers to their only five subscribers qualified as an action of \"public concern\". As it was \"hardly and unlikely to be deterred by incidental state regulation\", the Court concluded it did not qualify. This decision did not provide strong guidance on the issue.\nThis vague area of law in regards to false statements of fact can lead to a variety of arguments over what is relevant or has public importance.\n\n\nPrivate individuals/public concern\nIn Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), the Supreme Court considered an article published in a magazine published by the John Birch Society. The article contained inaccuracies about a private individual, in this case the attorney for a policeman. The Court held that because plaintiff Gertz had not \"thrust himself into the vortex of this public issue\", the newspaper could not be freed from liability of their false statements. That standard of being put into the public spotlight was used in Snyder v. Phelps (2010), which permitted false statements about a dead Marine because those comments were in the midst of a public debate about war.\nIn cases which fall into this category, \"actual malice\" is the standard for a plaintiff to gain compensation at a trial.\n\n\nPrivate individuals/private concern\nThe most ambiguous area of analysis for false statements of fact are cases that involve private individuals and speech about a private concern. Most likely, a standard of strict liability would attach to speech under this section. Broadly speaking, this category includes speech that doesn't fit the limits of the \"false statements of fact\" free speech exception, meaning that such speech is not protected.\n\n\nOther cases\nIn Riley v. National Federation of the Blind of North Carolina (1988), the Supreme Court struck down a license requirement and limits on fundraising fees for telemarketers as unconstitutional and not narrowly tailored enough to survive First Amendment scrutiny. But in Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates, Inc. (2003), the Court upheld an Illinois telemarketing anti-fraud law against claims that it was a form of prior restraint, affirming consumer protection against misrepresentation was a valid government interest justifying a free speech exception for false claims made in that context.\nThe 2012 decision United States v. Alvarez struck down part of the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, which prohibited false claims that a person received a military medal.\n\n\nSee also\nAcademic dishonesty\nData dredging\nData fabrication\nErrors and omissions excepted\nErrors and omissions insurance\nFalse advertising\nFalse light\nFraud\nFreedom of speech in the United States\nMaking false statements\nMisrepresentation\nPerjury\nScientific misconduct\nUnited States defamation law\nUnited States free speech exceptions\nVarsity Blues scandal\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nList of notable Free Speech cases before United States Supreme Court\nAnnotated First Amendment from FindLaw",

    "text": "Carnival of Souls (also known as Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls) is a 1998 American psychological horror film directed by Adam Grossman, and starring Bobbie Phillips, Larry Miller, and Shawnee Smith. A loose remake of Herk Harvey's 1962 film of the same name, it follows a woman haunted by a carnival clown who murdered her mother years prior. It was produced by Michael Meltzer, Peter Soby, and Lisa Harrison and executive produced by Wes Craven. \nThe project was originally conceived as a sequel to the original film before being reworked as a reimagining of the source material (Candace Hilligoss, the star of the original film, had written the screenplay for a sequel which went undeveloped). Filming took place in mid-1997, and reshoots were undertaken by executive producer Anthony Hickox following principal photography.\n\n\nPlot\nIn 1977, young Alex Grant witnessed a carnival clown named Louis Seagram—a brutal sadist—rape and murder her mother, Elaine. Twenty years later, Alex lives above the Mermaid Bar, a seaside tavern she inherited from her mother, where she works as a bartender along with her younger sister Sandra, an aspiring singer. Alex remains haunted by the memories of her mother's murder.\nWhen Seagram is released from prison, he finds Alex and attacks her in her car. A gunpoint, Seagram forces Alex to drive to the carnival where he once worked, threatening to brutalize Sandra after he has murdered her. In an act of desperation, Alex drives the car off the pier, crashing into the water below. Alex subsequently awakens in her bathtub, the ordeal with Seagram being an apparent nightmare. \nAlex begins to suffer further waking nightmares and visions involving Seagram and other ghoulish figures, including her first childhood encounter with him at the carnival, where Seagram first took an interest in her mother; following this encounter, Elaine began casually dating Seagram, who became a part of the family's lives and began molesting Alex. To calm her fears about Seagram returning, Alex begins researching his whereabouts, and is shocked to learn that he has recently been murdered following his release. Meanwhile, Sandra and Sid, a manager at the bar, begin to worry about Alex's deteriorating mental state. \nAlex begins to be romantically pursued by Michael, a mysterious new regular patron at the bar, but continues to lose her grip on reality. Alex accompanies Michael on his boat, where the two begin to have sex, only for Michael to transform into a ghoulish creature that shape shifts into Seagram. Alex suddenly awakens on the ferris wheel at the carnival, the encounter with Michael seemingly only a dream. Alex is again pursued by Seagram in a hallucinogenic, carnivalesque landscape before awaking on the pier.\nSome time later, Alex's car is removed from the water near the pier, with her and Seagram's corpses inside—it is revealed that Seagram did in fact attack her, and that the encounter and crash into the water did happen. In the tavern, a distraught Sandra picks up a ringing phone, only to hear the sounds of a carnival on the line.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nDevelopment\nPeter Soby was Director of Development at an independent production company, Shoreline Pictures, when a script came across his desk entitled, Carnival Souls II written by the star of the original film, Candace Hilligoss. A big fan of the original 1962 film, Soby was excited by the prospect of doing a remake, however Hilligoss's script featured the titular character from the original film, Mary Henry, coming back 35 years later as a ghost and engaging in a love story. Peter approached the original filmmakers, Herk Harvey and John Clifford who were still living in Lawrence, Kansas where they shot most of the original film. They explained that they gave Hilligoss permission to write her script, but she had no official rights to the original film whatsoever. Peter then negotiated with Harvey and Clifford the rights to create a \"based on\" film which eventually became known as Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls. \nSoby wanted to ensure that Trimark Pictures could not use the original title because he was partnered with investor Matthew Irvine shortly thereafter negotiating with Harvey and Clifford to purchase the entire original film, negative and all the rights including remake rights. Soby also wanted original star Hilligoss involved as a producer and have a role in the \"based on\" film, but she wanted nothing to do with it if it was not her script, so they had to part ways. Soby's first move was to approach Wes Craven to direct the film and Craven was interested, however he was heavy into development of a script entitled Scary Movie, which later became Scream (1996). Craven agreed to grandfather the project as an executive producer and Trimark Pictures eventually paid him to put his name in the title of the film.\nHilligoss was asked to make a cameo appearance in the film, but declined as she felt betrayed by producer Soby as well as Harvey and Clifford.\nFilming of Carnival of Souls took place in mid-1997. After principal photography wrapped, Trimark Pictures conducted reshoots of the film by director Anthony Hickox, which included the filming of five additional scenes. \n\n\nRelease\nCarnival of Souls was released on August 21, 1998, on a limited theatrical run,\n\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD by Lionsgate on February 23, 1999. It was later released by VCI on January 15, 2001, and by Cinema Club on December 31 that same year.\nOn December 23, 2024, the German company NSM Records issued the film on Blu-ray in a three limited edition media books featuring different cover artwork.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 20% of 5 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.1/10.\nShawn Handling from HorrorNews.net stated that, although the film was \"a decent little fright picture\" and its style made up for its lack of originality, Handling criticized the film's \"run-of the-mill\" performances, writing, predictable story, lack of scares, and choice of music. TV Guide awarded the film 1/5 stars, calling the film \"dismal\", writing, \"Though filled with modern-day horror contrivances, Grossman's film evokes none of the haunting atmosphere that distinguished Herk Harvey's eerily timeless original.\"\nMatty Budrewicz of the horror film website The Schlock Pit praised the film in a 2021 retrospective, describing it as \"a neat psychological frightener deserving of more than the ignominy it’s currently saddled with. A film that deals with the deep-rooted effects of trauma, Grossman’s robust if slightly predictable overhaul might seem a touch passé by modern standards now that the whole ‘facing your demons before you can find peace in the afterlife’ thing has been done to death, but it’s a fine example of how to do such explicitly Jacob’s Ladder–inspired material correctly.\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nMuir, John Kenneth (2011).

    "summary": "Carnival of Souls (also known as Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls) is a 1998 American psychological horror film directed by Adam Grossman, and starring Bobbie Phillips, Larry Miller, and Shawnee Smith. A loose remake of Herk Harvey's 1962 film of the same name, it follows a woman haunted by a carnival clown who murdered her mother years prior. It was produced by Michael Meltzer, Peter Soby, and Lisa Harrison and executive produced by Wes Craven. \nThe project was originally conceived as a sequel to the original film before being reworked as a reimagining of the source material (Candace Hilligoss, the star of the original film, had written the screenplay for a sequel which went undeveloped).

    "text": "Pettstadt is a municipality in the Upper Franconian district of Bamberg with about 1,900 inhabitants.\n\n\nGeography\nThe community lies in the Regierungsbezirk of Oberfranken (Upper Franconia), roughly 8km south of Bamberg where the Rauhe Ebrach empties into the Regnitz.\n\n\nConstituent communities\nPettstadt’s main and namesake centre is by far the biggest of its Gemeindeteile with a population of 1,914. The community furthermore has these outlying centres, each given here with its own population figure:\n\nEichenhof: 25\nNeuhaus: 24\nSchadlos: 17\nThe community also has one of the traditional rural land units known in German as Gemarkungen, named Pettstadt, the same name as the main centre (it is traditional for a Gemarkung to be named after a town or village lying nearby).\n\n\nHistory\nThe community had its first documentary mention in 1070 as Betestat. The placename goes back to a personal name, Petto, which around the year 1000 was quite common in the Frankish-Thuringian area. In 1399 came the establishment of the parish of Pettstadt. In 1754, the Baroque church was built under architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel. The community belonged to the Cathedral Chapter of Bamberg of the High Monastery at Bamberg, and with the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, the community passed to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today’s community came into being under the Gemeindeedikt (“Community Edict”) of 1818. In 2002, the administrative community (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft) with Frensdorf, which had been instituted in the course of later administrative reform, was dissolved.\n\n\nPopulation development\nWithin municipal limits, Pettstadt has registered following number of inhabitants:\n\n1,041 (1970)\n1,411 (1987)\n1,829 (2000)\n1,923 (2007)\n1,900 (2011)\n\n\nPolitics\nThe mayor is Jochen Hack (Freie Wählergemeinschaft), first elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2020.\n\nThe community council is made up of 12 members, listed here by party or voter community affiliation, and also with the number of seats that each holds:\n\nFWG (Freie Wählergemeinschaft) 5\nCSU (Christlich-Soziale Union) 3\nBNL (Bürgernahe Liste) 2\nSPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) 2\nIn 1999, municipal tax revenue, converted to euros, amounted to €708,000 of which business taxes (net) amounted to €127,000.\n\n\nCulture and sightseeing\nPettstadt has something rather remarkable for a place of its size, namely a Baroque church by the famous master builder Michael Küchel, the parish Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary.\n\nOne curiosity in Pettstadt is the Pettstadter Schmied, Upper Franconia’s only reaction ferry, which crosses the Regnitz not far west of the village and is used mainly by cyclists. \nThe original Pettstadter Schmied (German for “Pettstadt smith”) is the main character in a story that is well known throughout the region. It tells of master smith Sebastian Schubert, who died in 1910. About the turn of the 20th century, it is said that, at a very late hour at an inn, he would not comply with a gendarmerie patrol’s order to leave the inn. Instead, he said “Des mach ich, wie ich mooch” (dialectal German for “I do whatever I like”). The incident led to charges. The judge at the Royal Bavarian Amt Court, however, acquitted the accused citing an apparent lack of abusive or rebellious attitude. From this developed a well known Upper Franconian expression: Mach' es wie der Pettstadter Schmied (“Do it like the Pettstadt smith”), which is taken as a demand to decide on one’s own authority.\n\n\nSport and clubs\nFrom the local club life have grown many events such as the Pettstadt Street Festival (Straßenfest) on the third weekend in July, which is attended by citizens from all over the district.\nThe three biggest clubs, the Sportverein Pettstadt (SVP, a sport club), the Freihand Schützenverein Pettstadt (FSV, a shooting club) and the Rauhe Ebrach angling club are successful even beyond the local region.\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website  (in German)\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Aidan A. Kelly (born October 22, 1940) is an American academic, poet and influential figure in the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Having developed his own branch of the faith, the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, during the 1960s, he was also initiated into other traditions, including Gardnerianism and Feri, in subsequent decades. Alongside this, he was also an important figure in the creation of the Covenant of the Goddess, an organisation designed to protect the civil rights of members of the Wiccan community in the United States. He has also published academic work studying the early development of Gardnerian Wiccan liturgy, primarily through his controversial 1991 book Crafting the Art of Magic.\nKelly became an organizer and leader in the Neo-Pagan community while studying for a master's degree in creative writing at San Francisco State University in 1967 and 1968. A friend asked him to write a ritual for a Witch sabbat as part of an art seminar. This project led to the founding in October 1967 of the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn (NROOGD), which evolved into a Wiccan coven in 1969. Although humorously named after the famous Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Kelly's coven was otherwise unrelated to that group.\nThe NROOGD tradition co-founded by Kelly in 1969 continues to operate in California and has covens in other states, Canada and the UK.\nAs one of the co-founders of the Covenant of the Goddess (CoG), Kelly helped write the organization's charter and bylaws in 1975. The organization's charter was filed with the State of California on October 31, 1975, incorporating CoG as a non-profit religious corporation. From CoG's inception in 1975 until 1977, Kelly served on its national board of directors.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAidan Kelly was born on October 22, 1940, in Colon, Panama, the first of four children of Marie Cecile Kelly and John Patrick Kelly. Panama was his father's first assignment as a U.S. Army officer after graduating from West Point. John Patrick Kelly's military career took the family to assignments around the world. In 1955 they settled in Mill Valley, California, where Kelly graduated from Tamalpais High School in 1957. Later Aidan would find out that, from the time of WWII until the 1990s, his father was working as a high-ranking military intelligence officer.\nShortly after moving to Mill Valley, Kelly experienced what he described as a \"spontaneous mystical experience,\" when a vision of the Goddess first appeared to him at the age of 15. Although Kelly was raised as a Roman Catholic, his vision of the Goddess in Mill Valley triggered a lifelong interest in alternative religions.\nAfter graduating from high school, Kelly studied at the University of California, Berkeley, then San Francisco State University (San Francisco State College at that time), where he received his bachelor's degree in 1964.\n\n\nProfessional career\nAfter graduating from San Francisco State in 1964, Kelly worked as an editor for Stanford University Press. He returned to San Francisco State in 1966, where he completed a master's degree in creative writing in 1968. From then, until 1973, Kelly worked for publisher W. H. Freeman and Company. At the end of 1973, he left W. H. Freeman to begin working on a Ph.D. at the Graduate Theological Union (GTU) in Berkeley. He also started his own business as a consulting editor at this time.\nWhile working on his Ph.D. during 1974 and 1975, Kelly was able to study pages from an early Book of Shadows, purportedly typed by Gerald Gardner as well as a manuscript titled “Ye Bok of ye Art Magical” from Gardner's former Museum of Witchcraft, then owned by Ripley's, now owned by the Wiccan Church of Canada. He hoped to use these materials to reconstruct a history of how Gardner founded modern Wicca. The resulting manuscript was used to satisfy his comprehensive examination topic in Sociology of Religion for his doctorate program at GTU. Although Kelly wrote the manuscript under contract to Llewellyn Publications, it was declined by Llewellyn as \"too difficult and scholarly.\" He offered the book to other publishers without success.\nIn 1976, Kelly sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous. He withdrew from participation in the Neo-Pagan community in 1977 and became a practicing Roman Catholic from 1978 until 1987. However, as Kelly explained in a 2006 interview with Lisa Harris of Widdershins, he \"never stopped being a witch; I just stopped practicing for a while.\"\nIn 1978, Kelly self-published the memoir Hippie Commie Beatnik Witches: A History of the Craft in California, 1967-77 about the rise of modern American Paganism. The academic scholar Chas S. Clifton has cited the book as an \"invaluable source\" for the sociological study of the History of Wicca, particularly insofar as it describes the innate differences between \"the more established Anglo-American witches\" who claimed lineage-descent from Gerald Gardner and the West Coast Pagans of the 1960s who were working in \"the American tradition of self-creation.\"\nKelly received a Ph.D. in Theology from GTU in 1980. For the next eight years, he taught at schools in the San Francisco Bay area, including the University of San Francisco and Holy Family College. He was active in scholarly professional societies, and from 1987 to 1990 co-chaired the steering committee for the American Academy of Religion's Group on New Religious Movements.\nLlewellyn published Kelly's previously rejected research as Crafting the Art of Magic in 1991, revised and expanded as Inventing Witchcraft in 2007.\nAfter moving to Seattle, Washington, in 1997, Kelly worked for several companies related to Microsoft. He accepted a teaching position for the Berkeley Learning Center in Lakewood, Washington, in 2001. In 2008, Kelly and his family moved to New Orleans, where he taught for ITT Technical Institute and continued to write.\n\n\nPersonal life\nKelly moved to Tacoma, Washington, in 2011 with his family. He lives there currently and practices Witchcraft with his wife and close friends. His eldest son, Aidan O'Ryan-Kelly, born in 1990, lives in California and is also a professional practitioner of Witchcraft and folk-magic.\n\n\nControversial work\nInventing Witchcraft labels \"the Craft\" as a new religion, founded by Gerald Gardner \"in 1947, give or take a year.\" (p. 33-34) This theory obviously conflicts with Gardner's own claim to have been initiated in 1939 into one of England's last surviving witch covens. Kelly's book identifies the initiation of Gardner as \"the foundational myth\" of Modern Witchcraft. (p. 35)\nIn support of his theory, Kelly explains that \"the paper trail stops in 1946. We have no serious historical evidence for the existence of any Gardnerian coven before then.\" (p. 32)\nAcademic writers on religion have tended to treat Kelly's conclusions as factual and unbiased, but not surprisingly, Inventing Witchcraft and the earlier edition of Kelly's work, Crafting the Art of Magic, became a source of controversy among Wiccans, especially in Gardnerian Wicca covens, who trace the origin of their traditions to Gerald Gardner. To accept Kelly's theory that Gardner \"invented\" a new religion, would mean giving up the belief that Gardnerian Wicca was the revival of an ancient faith previously held in secret by a few survivors. (p. 28)\nKelly's work was criticized for both its overall premise and specific details. Donald H. Frew complained that Crafting the Art of Magic contained errors in quoting source texts to support Kelly's theory. Frew also objected to the accusation of homophobia (Inventing Witchcraft, p. 155) that Kelly felt was exhibited by Gardner's writings.\nThe \"new religion\" concept in Kelly's work was not entirely unwelcome in the Wiccan community. Other Neo-Pagan historians, such as Ronald Hutton, and Jacqueline Simpson, wrote supportive responses to Kelly's work, disputing some of the criticism.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nReferences",

He served in a number of positions, most recently as the deputy prime minister.\n\n\nEarly life\nMyftiu was born in Vlora to a family of Albanian Muslim landowners. In 1939, he graduated from a Classical Lycée in Rome, Italy and while in his hometown, joined a communist cell. From 1940 to 1941 he studied at the Medical Faculty of the University of Turin but did not complete his studies, returning to Vlora where he was obliged to join the Albanian Fascist Youth. While a member of it, he simultaneously remained a member of a communist cell, carrying out clandestine activities against fascism and becoming a member of the Communist Party of Albania (from 1948, the Party of Labour of Albania) after it was founded. During the war he became Commissar of the Fifth Partisan Brigade, commissar of the First Combat Division, and was attached to the Fifth and Eighth Brigades of the First Army Corps.\nDuring the war, he served as a member of the Vlora District Party Committee.\n\n\nPolitical career\nAfter the war, Myftiu was active in the Communist political structure and became a protégé of Mehmet Shehu. From 1947 to 1949, he served as Chair of the People's Assembly of Albania. He then served as Minister without portfolio from 1949 to 1950.\nIn November 1948, he became a member of the central committee of the Party of Labour of Albania. He remained a member of the central committee until it was disbanded when the party transitioned into the Socialist Party of Albania.\nFrom May 1950 to April 1951, he served as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nOn 4 July 1950, Myftiu was appointed President of the Control Commission. He served in this position until 5 March 1951, replaced by Mehmet Shehu.\nOn 5 March 1951, Myftiu was made a vice-premier and replaced Manol Konomi as the Minister of Justice as part of a series of changes to the cabinet. He held this post until 6 September 1951, when he was dismissed and replaced by Bilbil Klosi as part of a cabinet reshuffle.\nOn 11 April 1952, it was announced that Myftiu was dismissed as vice-premier. On 12 July 1954, following a reorganization of the Party of Labour of Albania, Myftiu and Josif Pashko were replaced in their party posts by Gogo Nushi and Liri Belishova. On 20 July 1954, Myftiu became vice-premier once again.\nHe became a candidate member of the Politburo in 1952 and a full member of the Politburo from 1956 to 1990.\nFrom 1956 to 1958, Myftiu served as Minister of Health. From 1958 to 1965, he served as Minister of Education.\nFrom 1966 to 1976, he was First Secretary of the Tirana District Party Committee. From 1976 to 1990, he served as deputy prime minister.\n\n\nLater life\nOn 2 July 1994, Myftiu was sentenced to five years in prison on the charge of abusing his powers during his time in office, but was released on account of his advanced age.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAdditional References\nElsie, Robert.

    "text": "\"The Manchester Rambler\", also known as \"I'm a Rambler\" and \"The Rambler's Song\", is a song written by the British folk singer Ewan MacColl in 1932. It was inspired by his participation in the Kinder trespass, a protest by the urban Young Communist League of Manchester, and was the work that began MacColl's career as a singer-songwriter.\nSince the 1950s, the song has become a standard among folk musicians, as it was for MacColl himself. It has been covered many times, including by The Dubliners and the Houghton Weavers. It has been sung both in clubs and in the open air on a variety of occasions, including at Kinder Downfall in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a National Nature Reserve.\n\n\nContext\n\nThe Kinder mass trespass was a deliberate act of civil disobedience (the law of trespass having already been repealed) by men of the Young Communist League of Manchester, and others from Sheffield. The protest was intended to secure free access to England's mountains and moorlands. The 'ramblers', led by Benny Rothman, walked from  Bowden Bridge Quarry, near Hayfield, to climb the hill called Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak District on 24 April 1932. A young man aged 17 called James Henry Miller, better known later as Ewan MacColl, was a keen rambler and an enthusiastic member of the Young Communist League. He played a major part in organising the publicity for the trespass, duplicating and handing out leaflets, though this role is disputed. He took part in the trespass, and was shocked by the violent reaction of the gamekeepers who met the ramblers on the hill, and the extremely harsh sentences handed down by the magistrates to the five ramblers who were arrested that day. What MacColl did not know was that the protest was to have a powerful long-term effect, leading to improved access to the countryside in the shape of national parks (from 1949), long-distance footpaths starting with the Pennine Way (opened in 1965) and various forms of the desired 'right to roam' (such as with the CRoW Act, 2000).\n\nIn his biographer Ben Harker's view, \"It would be difficult to overstate the extent to which MacColl was shaped by the 1930s.\" MacColl was a keen rambler, travelling out of Manchester by bus into the Peak District, like thousands of other young unemployed people with time on their hands. For MacColl, rambling was integral to his politics; he did not simply find nature beautiful and the urban world ugly: instead, it was an objective of the hoped-for revolution:\n\nto create a world that would harmonize with that other one that you enjoyed so much... If the bourgeoisie had had any sense at all they would never have allowed the working class into that kind of countryside. Because it bred a spirit of revolt.\nGroups of ramblers often sang songs such as \"I'm Happy When I'm Hiking\", as well as bawdy songs, ballads and radical American protest songs at their camps. MacColl published the \"Manchester Youth Song\" in 1933, singing of \"Workers in Cheetham, who slave every day / In waterproof factories at starvation pay\". He also wrote the song \"Mass Trespass 1932\", setting words like \"For the mass trespass is the only way there is / To gain access to the mountains once again\" to the old Scottish tune of \"The Road to the Isles\". His friends used to sing it as they rambled in the hills.\n\n\nFolk song\n\n\"The Manchester Rambler\", written in 1932 not long after the Kinder trespass and inspired by that event, was MacColl's first important song, according to Harker, who argues that it \"marks a departure from the [singer's] leaden-footed and slogan-heavy juvenilia\". It is also the first song that still survives for which he wrote the melody as well as the lyrics. Its swinging, jaunty melody demonstrates MacColl's ability to combine musical forms and popular rhythms to create a song which is at once familiar and unique. Like the melody, the lyrics are witty and playful. They put out a defiant political message with \"I may be a wage slave on Monday / But I am a free man on Sunday\". MacColl plays with and updates traditional English folksong phraseology with \"I once loved a maid, a spot-welder by trade / She was fair as the Rowan in bloom\". The lyrics are suitably comical on the confrontation between the ramblers and the gamekeepers in the style of musical theatre, argues Harker, with lines such as \"He called me a louse and said 'Think of the grouse'\". The song has 5 verses, each of 8 lines, and a 4-line chorus.\nThe song names the following places: Snowdon (North Wales); Crowden (by the Woodhead Pass road in Derbyshire); the Wainstones (on the Bleaklow plateau in Derbyshire); Kinder Scout; Manchester; Grindsbrook and Upper Tor (both Edale, Derbyshire).\n\"The Manchester Rambler\" is published by Green Linnet on MacColl's 1986 CD Black and White: The Definitive Collection, also released by Cooking Vinyl;  the recording lasts 4 minutes 42 seconds, and MacColl is assisted on vocals by his wife, the folk singer Peggy Seeger.\n\n\nReception and influence\nBen Harker said of \"The Manchester Rambler\" that:\n\nMacColl performed the song as a standard all his life. Cover versions were performed and recorded by dozens of folk musicians from the 1950s onwards, including by The Dubliners on Alive Alive-O and 30 Years A-Greying. Kirsty MacColl (daughter of Ewan) covered the song on her 1991 album The One And Only, while Casey Neill covered it on his eponymous album in 1999. The Houghton Weavers covered it on their 1978 album Sit Thi Deawn, and in 2005 Mick Groves of The Spinners performed it on his album Fellow Journeyman. Patterson Jordan Dipper covered it on their album Flat Earth in 2010, and Danny and Mary O'Leary covered it in 2014.\nThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography writes of MacColl that \"One of his first and finest protest songs, ‘The Manchester Rambler’, dealt with the ‘mass trespass’ campaigns of the 1930s, in which hikers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers when they invaded privately owned grouse moors.\" \nThe Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture describes MacColl as \"a crucial figure\" in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, and names \"The Manchester Rambler\" as one of his \"more famous songs\".\nThe comedian and folk singer Mike Harding, in The Guardian, wrote that:\n\nHarding, who was running a Manchester folk club on Sunday nights at that time, said:\n\nThe song was sung at Kinder Downfall (the waterfall on Kinder Scout) in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a National Nature Reserve (NNR); in attendance were establishment figures including three Members of Parliament, the Chief Executive Officers of three National Parks and the leaders of Natural England. The British Mountaineering Council's booklet issued in 2012 to commemorate 80 years of the Kinder mass trespass reproduced the lyrics of \"The Manchester Rambler\" in full.\n\n\nSee also\nList of socialist songs\nThe Happy Wanderer\nWandervogel\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"The Manchester Rambler\" on YouTube\nKinder trespass\nLyrics\nMike Harding leading the crowd to launch the BMC's Kinder 80 Festival",
    "summary": "\"The Manchester Rambler\", also known as \"I'm a Rambler\" and \"The Rambler's Song\", is a song written by the British folk singer Ewan MacColl in 1932. It was inspired by his participation in the Kinder trespass, a protest by the urban Young Communist League of Manchester, and was the work that began MacColl's career as a singer-songwriter.\nSince the 1950s, the song has become a standard among folk musicians, as it was for MacColl himself. It has been covered many times, including by The Dubliners and the Houghton Weavers. It has been sung both in clubs and in the open air on a variety of occasions, including at Kinder Downfall in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a National Nature Reserve.",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=37982241",
    "text": "The 2013 season was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 38th in the National Football League (NFL), and second and final under head coach Greg Schiano. It also marked the 19th and final season under the ownership of Malcolm Glazer, who died on May 28, 2014. The Buccaneers finished with a record of 4–12 and failed to improve their 7–9 record from last season, and were eliminated from postseason contention in Week 13. For the first time since 1996, longtime cornerback Ronde Barber was not on the roster, as he retired in May 2013.\nDespite having a +10 turnover margin (tied for 3rd best in the NFL), and franchise rookie quarterback records from third round draft pick Mike Glennon, the overall offensive production ranked near the bottom of the league in most categories. The team ranked 32nd (last) in total yards, 32nd (last) in passing yards, 30th in total points scored. The team also had the third-most penalties in the league (121 for 1,136 yards), and ranked 31st in third down conversions. Running back Doug Martin went on injured reserve halfway through the season with a shoulder injury. His replacement, Bobby Rainey had a solid performance, scoring his first career touchdown, and setting a franchise record for longest touchdown run (80 yards). On the defensive side, the offseason news was highlighted by the free agent acquisition of Darrelle Revis, and Lavonte David's stellar numbers.\n\n\nSeason\nThe team got off to a dismal start, which created considerable tension inside and outside the locker room, as well as among fans. The fan support of head coach Greg Schiano began to decay, as illustrated by a local radio station erecting a billboard carrying the message \"Fire Schiano.\" The trouble started on opening day, as Tampa Bay had a last-second loss to the Jets, owing primarily to a personal foul late hit penalty, which advanced the Jets into field goal range, and an improbable comeback victory. Late-game losses to New Orleans, Arizona, and Seattle brought the Buccaneers to an 0–8 start. The Buccaneers won four of their next five games, but were ultimately eliminated from playoff contention by December, and they dropped the last three games.\nOne day after the conclusion of the regular season, head coach Greg Schiano and general manager Mark Dominik were fired.\nFor the first time since 2009, all eight regular season home games were announced as a \"sellout,\" and no regular season games were blacked out locally. Due to the new concussion rule, the Bucs did not wear their \"creamsicle\" throwback uniforms at all during this season.\nDarrelle Revis was named the Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year.\n\n\nJosh Freeman benching\nThe season started out on a rocky note, as reports of a rift between head coach Greg Schiano and starting quarterback Josh Freeman were coming from the locker room. Freeman was entering the final season of his contract, and trade rumors were already being tossed around by media and fans. An allegation surfaced that Schiano rigged the voting for team captains, which prevented Freeman from being selected by his teammates. The next day, Freeman missed the annual team photo session, an absence he blamed on \"oversleeping.\" After starting the season 0–3, Freeman was quickly criticized for his poor offensive output, throwing a league-worst 45.3% completion percentage, two interceptions, and only two touchdown passes. It was also leaked that Freeman was a stage one participant in the NFL drug program, a situation related to his treatment of ADHD. On week four, Freeman was benched in favor of rookie Mike Glennon, and on October 3, 2013, Freeman was released from the team as he granted.\n\n\nMRSA outbreak\nDuring training camp, an outbreak of MRSA was reported in the Tampa Bay locker room. Carl Nicks and Lawrence Tynes contracted the infection over the summer. Nicks missed several games, while Tynes was placed on the non-football injured reserve list. After a third player, Johnthan Banks, was diagnosed in early October, the week 6 games against the Eagles was in jeopardy of postponement, due to concerns over transmission. However, it was held as scheduled after medical specialists and NFLPA representatives inspected the facility.\n\n\n2013 draft class\n\n\nTrades\nThe Buccaneers acquired an additional 2013 seventh-round pick (226th overall) that sent defensive tackle Brian Price to the Chicago Bears on July 26, 2012.\nThe Buccaneers later traded that same additional 2013 seventh-round pick (226th overall) that was acquired by the Bears, along with cornerback Aqib Talib, to the New England Patriots in exchange for a 2013 fourth-round pick (126th overall) on November 1, 2012.\nTampa Bay traded Arrelious Benn and a seventh-round pick to Philadelphia in exchange for the Eagles' 2013 sixth-round pick (196th overall) and a conditional draft pick in 2014.\nTampa Bay traded their first-round pick (13th overall) and a conditional fourth-round pick in 2014, to the Jets in exchange for Darrelle Revis.\nTampa Bay traded their fourth-round selection (112th overall) and their sixth-round selection (181st overall) to Oakland in exchange for the Raiders' fourth-round selection (100th overall) in order to draft Akeem Spence on the third day of the 2013 NFL draft.\nTampa Bay traded LeGarrette Blount to New England for Jeff Demps and a seventh-round selection (229th overall).\nTampa Bay traded their sixth-round selection (196th overall) and their seven-round selection (229th overall) to Minnesota for a sixth-round selection (189th overall) in order to draft Mike James on the third day of the 2013 NFL Draft.\nTampa Bay traded their 2014 sixth-round selection to Chicago for Gabe Carimi.\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nFinal roster\n\n\nPreseason\n\n\nRegular season\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nGame summaries\n\n\nWeek 1: at New York Jets\n\nTampa Bay took the lead 17–15 with a Rian Lindell field goal with 34 seconds remaining. However, on the ensuing Jets drive, Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith scrambled for a 10-yard run to the right sideline. A personal foul penalty was called on Lavonte David of the Buccaneers for a late hit out-of-bounds, which advanced the Jets to the Buccaneers 30-yard line. With 2 seconds left in regulation, Nick Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal, and the Jets won the game 18–17.\n\n\nWeek 2: vs. New Orleans Saints\n\nTampa Bay took the lead 14–13 after an 85-yard interception return by Mason Foster with just under 13 minutes remaining. In the closing minutes the Buccaneers drove to the New Orleans 29 yard line, and attempted a field goal with 1:10 left. The kick missed, and the Saints took over with just over one minute left. Drew Brees drove the Saints to the Tampa Bay 9 yard line in three plays, and Garrett Hartley kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n\nWeek 3: at New England Patriots\n\nTom Brady threw for 225 yards and two touchdown passes, as New England soundly defeated Tampa Bay 23–3. Josh Freeman was sacked three times, and threw one interception, while Doug Martin was held to only 88 yards rushing.\n\n\nWeek 4: vs. Arizona Cardinals\n\nQuarterback Josh Freeman was benched during the week, and rookie Mike Glennon was elevated to the starting role. Glennon led the team to a 10–0 lead after three quarters, but miscues saw Tampa Bay fall late. Early in the 4th quarter, Glennon fumbling a hand-off to Doug Martin set up an Arizona field goal. With 3:23 left in the game, Glennon, deep in his own territory, threw a costly interception, which set up an Arizona touchdown, and a brief 10–10 tie. With 1:33 left in regulation, Arizona kicked the game-winning field goal to win 13–10.\n\n\nWeek 6: vs. Philadelphia Eagles\n\nEagles quarterback Nick Foles threw three touchdown passes and ran for another, as Philadelphia defeated Tampa Bay 31–20. The Buccaneers fell to 0–5.\n\n\nWeek 7: at Atlanta Falcons\n\nFalcons quarterback Matt Ryan threw for 273 yards and three touchdowns, as Atlanta defeated Tampa Bay 31–23. The Buccaneers attempted to rally in the fourth quarter, but managed only two field goals. A failed onside kick by Tampa Bay with 1:55 left sealed the win for Atlanta.\n\n\nWeek 8: vs. Carolina Panthers\n\nCam Newton threw for 221 yards and two touchdown passes, and rushed for another touchdown, as Carolina defeated Tampa Bay 31–13. The Buccaneers failed to enter the red zone until the final three minutes of the game. Doug Martin sat out the game with an injured shoulder.\nWith the loss, Tampa Bay fell to 0–7.\n\n\nWeek 9: at Seattle Seahawks\n\nWinless Tampa Bay shocked 7-1 Seattle by jumping out to a 21–0 lead just before halftime. However, the Seahawks came back in the second half to tie the game and force overtime. Tampa Bay won the coin toss in overtime, but went 3-and-out on their first possession. Seattle kicked a field goal on the next possession, completing their greatest comeback (21 points) in franchise history.\nThis loss dropped the Buccaneers to 0–8 on the season, a feat shared with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\nWeek 10: vs. Miami Dolphins\n\nThe Buccaneers defense allowed a franchise low 2 rushing yards for the entire game, besting the previous record set last season during the home opener, when the Buccaneers' rushing defense held Carolina to 10 rushing yards. Darrelle Revis caught the game winning interception off a desperation pass from Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill late in the fourth quarter, and the Buccaneers won their first game of the season.\n\n\nWeek 11: vs. Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Buccaneers managed a comprehensive victory against the Falcons, improving their record to 2–8.\nBobby Rainey rushed for 163 yards and 2 touchdowns. Vincent Jackson caught 10 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown. Gerald McCoy had 3 sacks in the game. Mike Glennon threw for 2 touchdowns. Mason Foster and Dashon Goldson both had an interception, the former of which returned it for a touchdown. Dekoda Watson blocked a punt.\n\n\nWeek 12: at Detroit Lions\n\nLions quarterback Matthew Stafford threw four interceptions, as Tampa Bay upset Detroit 24–21. The Buccaneers became the first team since 1978 to start the season 0–8 and win their next three games. Stafford was leading the Lions on a potential game-winning or game-tying drive in the final minute. At the Tampa Bay 28 yard line with 1:00 left, Stafford threw to Calvin Johnson at the 3 yard line. Johnson appeared to catch the ball, but it was stripped out and fell into the hands of Johnthan Banks for an interception, and sealed the win for Tampa Bay.\n\n\nWeek 13: at Carolina Panthers\n\nPanthers QB Cam Newton threw for 263 yards and two touchdowns while running for another touchdown, as Carolina soundly defeated Tampa Bay 27–6, sweeping the season series.\nWith the loss, the Buccaneers were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.\n\n\nWeek 14: vs. Buffalo Bills\n\nBobby Rainey scored an 80-yard rushing touchdown on the second play of the game and rushed for 127 yards total, setting the tone for the Buccaneers' decisive 27-6 thrashing of the Buffalo Bills.\nOn offense, Mike Glennon threw two touchdown passes, one each to Vincent Jackson and Tim Wright. The Buccaneers defense had seven sacks and four interceptions, out of which Lavonte David made one sack and two interceptions. On special teams, Dashon Goldson recovered a fumble muffed by the punt returner.\n\n\nWeek 15: vs. San Francisco 49ers\n\nVincent Jackson and Tim Wright caught the only two touchdowns for the Buccaneers in the game, which were not enough to stop the 49ers from trouncing the team 33–14. On defense, Gerald McCoy and Adrian Clayborn had the only sacks for the Bucs. Late in the game, Eric Page attempted to hand the ball to Russell Shepard on a tricky play during a kick return; however, Shepard fumbled the ball, allowing the 49ers' Kendall Hunter to recover and return it for a touchdown.\nWith the loss, the Buccaneers' record dropped to 4–10.\n\n\nWeek 16: at St. Louis Rams\n\nOn offense, Bobby Rainey scored the Bucs' only touchdown of the game. On defense, Gerald McCoy had a sack. Also Adrian Clayborn and Dekoda Watson both forced fumbles which Lavonte David and Keith Tandy both successfully recovered for the Buccaneers, though the offense was only able to get a field goal out of the resulting possessions.\n\n\nWeek 17: at New Orleans Saints\n\n\nStandings\n\n\nDivision\n\n\nConference\n\n\nSee also\nList of other NFL teams affected by internal conflict\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Rangiora is the largest town and seat of the Waimakariri District, in Canterbury, New Zealand. It is 29 kilometres (18 mi) north of Christchurch, and is part of the Christchurch metropolitan area. With an estimated population of 19,300 (as of June 2025), Rangiora is the 30th largest urban area in New Zealand, and the fifth-largest in the Canterbury region (behind Christchurch, Timaru, Ashburton and Rolleston).\n\n\nToponymy\nThe name of the town comes from the Māori language. The components of the name are rangi (meaning sky) and ora (meaning wellness). The name can be interpreted as meaning \"good weather\", \"a sick person recovering from an illness\", or \"a day of wellbeing.\" The origin of the name is not clear, but may originate with the Māori name for Brachyglottis repanda, or refer to a peace agreement between Ngāi Tahu and Kāti Māmoe.\nThe town is often nicknamed \"Goon\" by locals. The origin of the nickname is unclear, but one possibility is that it's a contraction of the name Rangoon, which was the romanised name of Myanmar's largest city Yangon during its time as a British colony. The theory is that European locals were familiar with the name Rangoon, and found that easier to pronounce than the Māori language name. Other theories include associations to the word 'goon' (a synonym of henchman), or the colloquial Australasian name for box wine.\n\n\nGeography\nRangiora is 29 kilometres (18 mi) north of Christchurch's Cathedral Square or 20 minutes drive north of the Christchurch International Airport. It is close to the northern end of Canterbury's Inland Scenic Route (formerly State Highway 72), which skirts the inner edge of the Canterbury Plains, running southwest to Timaru via Oxford and Geraldine. The Ashley River / Rakahuri is just to the north of the town.\n\n\nClimate\nRangiora has an oceanic climate, (Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm summers and mild winters. Rangiora has an average annual mean of 11.5 °C (52.7 °F), an average annual high of 17.1 °C (62.8 °F) and an average annual low of 6.0 °C (42.8 °F). January, the warmest month, has a mean of 16.7 °C (62.1 °F) and an average high of 22.1 °C (71.8 °F), while the coolest month, July, has a mean of 6.1 °C (43.0 °F) and an average low of 0.6 °C (33.1 °F).\nRangiora receives 575.1 millimetres (22.64 in) of precipitation annually over 83.0 precipitation days, which is quite dry compared to some other cities in New Zealand. The wettest month is April, which receives 58.0 millimetres (2.28 in) and the most precipitation on average over 7.7 precipitation days is a tie between June and July. The driest month is September, which receives 34.1 millimetres (1.34 in) over 6.0 precipitation days while the least amount of precipitation is February. Rangiora receives 2191.7 hours of sunshine annually, with winter being less sunny compared to summer. November is the sunniest month, receiving 232.0 hours of sunshine on average, while June is the least sunniest month, receiving 125.0 hours of sunshine on average.\nThe highest official temperature ever recorded in New Zealand was 42.4 °C (108.3 °F) at Rangiora on 7 February 1973.\n\n\nPopulation\nRangiora is described by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area and covers 17.70 km2 (6.83 sq mi). It had an estimated population of 19,300 as of June 2025, with a population density of 1,090 people per km2.\n\nBefore the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering 15.25 km2 (5.89 sq mi). Using that boundary, Rangiora had a population of 17,841 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,772 people (18.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 5,676 people (46.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 6,900 households, comprising 8,454 males and 9,399 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.9 males per female, with 3,270 people (18.3%) aged under 15 years, 2,997 (16.8%) aged 15 to 29, 7,179 (40.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 4,392 (24.6%) aged 65 or older.\nEthnicities were 93.2% European/Pākehā, 7.6% Māori, 1.3% Pasifika, 3.4% Asian, and 1.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.\nThe percentage of people born overseas was 17.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.\nAlthough some people chose not to answer the census's question about religious affiliation, 49.6% had no religion, 40.5% were Christian, 0.2% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.2% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.\nOf those at least 15 years old, 1,851 (12.7%) people had a bachelor's or higher degree, and 3,336 (22.9%) people had no formal qualifications. 2,163 people (14.8%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 6,483 (44.5%) people were employed full-time, 2,148 (14.7%) were part-time, and 417 (2.9%) were unemployed.\n\n\nAttractions\nRangiora has become a gateway for local wineries, which have become popular in North Canterbury and, around Rangiora, there are a number to choose from.\nFor more than twenty years the Rangiora Showgrounds has hosted an annual \"petrol-head\" show called Street Machines and Muscle Car Madness which features a large array of vehicles.\nIn 1956, Rangiora hosted New Zealand's first traction engine rally at the Rangiora Showgrounds. Eight traction engines, owned by members of the Southbrook Traction Engine Club, attended. In 2006, this notable milestone was celebrated by the arrival of visiting Burrell showman's engine Quo Vadis and accompanying carousel Gallopers Abreast from England to attend the celebrations.\n\n\nSports\nRangiora Football has undergone strong growth recently. The Mainpower Oval has hosted many national cricket matches and is also used by Canterbury Country cricket as its base. Rangiora High School has produced many excellent sportspeople in rugby, basketball, netball, athletics, and rowing in recent years. Former All Black captain Todd Blackadder and former Silver Fern player and Tall Fern captain Donna Loffhagen both attended Rangiora High School. Since 2023, the Mainland Tactix have used Mainpower Stadium as an occasional venue in the ANZ Premiership.\n\n\nCulture\n\nRangiora boasts two theatre companies: The North Canterbury Musical Society and The Rangiora Players. There are also a number of music, dance and drama schools based in the town, including the Hartley School of Performing Arts. The Regent Cinema, which opened in 1926, was located within the historic Rangiora Town Hall from its opening in 1926 as Everybodys' Cinema until December 2012 when the Town Hall was closed. There were also screenings in the larger auditorium which also hosted live shows and youth events.\nThe studios of radio station Compass FM 104.9 are situated in Rangiora. Compass FM 104.9 is a not-for-profit community station covering the North Canterbury region of New Zealand. From a transmitter atop Mount Grey, the station can be heard over much of North Canterbury, including the Waimakariri District, much of the Hurunui District and Selwyn District, and in greater Christchurch.\n\n\nRangiora Town Hall\nThe Rangiora Town Hall was designed by Henry St. Aubyn Murray on the behalf of the Rangiora Borough Council, and built by F. Williamson of Christchurch at a cost of £10,850 NZP. Construction began in 1925, and the Hall was opened on 27 May 1926 by the Mayoress of the Rangiora Borough, Mrs Robina McIntosh. Seating 600, the main hall was designed to host both moving pictures, and also live performances from around the district. The original Rangiora Public Library was located on the first-floor along the northern (High Street) frontage. Originally the Rangiora Borough Council resolved to spend only £6,500 to build and furnish the hall, was obliged to loan some £8,000 from the Christchurch Tramway Board to finance the construction of the hall, outraging residents at the prospects of having to pay increased rates. The interior furnishings were paid for using the insurance monies from the Institute Hall, which had been burned down in 1926.\nThe building originally housed the Everybodys Theatre, from 1931 the Regent Theatre. The former ticket windows were located on either side of the main doors; these are still extant, though the windows have since been replaced with single panes of glass, and the internal walls of one of the ticket offices has been removed. The Hall also housed the library from 1926 to 1967, when it moved to the former Council Chambers. The Rangiora Borough Council occupied the former library space from 1967 to 1981, when the present Council offices were opened on the (former) Institute Hall property.\nThe building has been altered very few times since it was originally built. In the early 1970s, the building was altered by pushing the rear wall of the auditorium in, which resulted in the loss of 200 seats and reducing the current capacity to the present level of 380. With the introduction of television and video, the former library on the first-floor was converted in 1983 into a smaller second theatre, designed solely as a movie theatre, and which opened with the movie Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. The main theatre was still capable of showing movies as required, and the original projection room was still in place to facilitate hire of the main hall to show movies for special occasions until September 2013. The building has been shut down twice for work to be carried out; in 1999 access was improved to the fly floors and the present lighting gantry installed, and in 2009 the building received an electrical re-wire and the interior was refurbished.\nAt some point in the 1920s-1930s, two properties adjacent to the Town Hall along High Street were demolished, and the site turned into the Town Hall Reserve; this property separates the Town Hall and the Police Station, built in 1999 to replace another station that had become inadequate. There is also a small carpark to the south of the building, behind the stage area. This carpark also has a loading dock that leads directly into the stage right wing, allowing backdrops and other properties to be brought into the building.\nIn September 2010, the Town Hall was damaged by the 4 September earthquake. The last group to use the Town Hall was the Rangiora New Life School, whose Secondary students had performed Exodus - The Musical (written by Christopher Tambling and Michael Forster) over the week of 25–27 August. The building was out of service until mid-2011, when it was reopened for use again. While it had been undergoing repairs at the time of the 22 February earthquake, the building thankfully did not sustain any further damage, which would have prolonged the time required for repairs.\nThe first show to use the restored facility was the North Canterbury Musical Society with their performance of Guys and Dolls in June 2011. While the Hall appeared to be in good condition, it was later found by engineers to be below the 33% structural integrity requirements of the New Building Standards code introduced after the Canterbury earthquakes. In December 2011, Council engineers closed the Hall, necessitating the closure of the Regent Theatre, located in the former library.\nThe Regent Theatre, operated by Patrick Walsh, was relocated to the Waikari Town Hall, a temporary move which was later made permanent by the cancellation of Walsh's concession to operate the movie theatre in mid-2013. After Walsh stripped out his cinema, contractors Naylor Love began work on 16 September 2013 to demolish internal walls as part of a new Performing Arts centre, due to cost $10.9m NZD. Walsh's cinema closed on 31 October 2013 and may not return to the Town Hall.\nThe refurbished Town Hall was officially opened on 7 March 2015 by Waimakariri District mayor David Ayers, with the Rangiora Brass Band providing a short concert afterwards. The refurbished facility consists of the main auditorium seating 361 patrons, a multi-purpose hall seating 150, and two small cinemas. The multi-use hall is also equipped with cinema equipment, permitting three movies to be presented simultaneously. The cinema facility is branded \"Town Hall Cinemas\". In addition, the facility also houses four \"studios\", which are used by the North Canterbury Academy of Music for music teaching purposes for 36 weeks each year. There is also a function room and a green room.\nThe Rangiora Town Hall was registered by the Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place on 6 September 1984. The Rangiora Town Hall is also listed on the council's Landmarks scheme. It received its Landmark status on 27 May 2010.\n\n\nHeritage Precinct\n\nUnofficially the High Street of Rangiora stretching from the Rangiora Town Hall at King Street up to Ashley Street is a 'heritage precinct' due to the presence of many historic buildings. Among them are the former Junction Hotel (1880), the Post Office (1936), the Farmers building (1919) and the Johnston Building (1896). Some of these buildings are listed under the council's Landmarks heritage scheme, along with the Town Hall.\nDue to the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes, several buildings have been fenced off due to safety concerns. This has caused people to go elsewhere for shopping, thus 'killing' High Street. In 2012, it was confirmed that one non-heritage registered building, the Lamberts Building, would be demolished, while the fate of others remains unknown. The building was demolished in August 2012. Several notable items recovered during the work were donated by the contractor to the Rangiora Museum.\nThe fate of the former Junction Hotel (1880) and the neighbouring Pulley's Building (1923) was presently unknown as of September 2012. The lessor of a restaurant operating from the Junction Hotel has indicated an interest in purchasing the two properties and demolishing them to build a more modern structure. The Farmers building (1919), having initially survived the earthquakes, was demolished over July and August 2014. One other non-heritage building, formerly home to Paper Plus and Toyworld, has been demolished because it was earthquake-prone.\nSince then, demolition work has begun on the Pulley's Building which was demolished on Thursday 28 February 2013. The fate of the Junction Hotel is yet undecided, necessitating the fence containing the structure to be left in place for the time being. The Farmers building is currently undergoing a thorough audit due to discrepancies in the owner's report and in the report commissioned by the insurers. It is believed that more buildings may be demolished due to the costs of strengthening the buildings to meet structural requirements, and also to restore them as necessary.\n\n\nMuseums\nRangiora is home to its own museum, located next to the Rangiora Bowling Club at 29 Good Street. This museum constitutes the upper floor of the former BNZ bank building that was located on Rangiora's High Street and shifted on to the current site in 1967. It contains items of historical interest from around the district. Later an extension consisting of a large display area and a collections archives room was added to the building.\nThe Rangiora and Districts Early Records Society, which operates the museum, was formed in 1960. Since its formation, the society has benefited from donations of some 5,000 objects and more than 11,000 photographs, and glass slides. The museum has become a repository for family histories, documents and photographs relating to those who settled in the area. These irreplaceable archives are of great value to those who are researching the history of Rangiora families.\nThe objectives of the Rangiora and Districts Early Records Society are to collect, study, preserve and display records, photographs and other material relating to the history of Rangiora and the surrounding district, to foster a knowledge of the history of Rangiora and the surrounding district among the Society's members and the general public and to provide and operate a museum pertaining to that history.\nThe society hosts monthly meetings at the Rangiora Museum, where there are talks by members and visiting speakers on various topics of local historical and community interest.\nA second museum, the Northbrook Museum, is located to the east of the town, adjacent to the Northbrook Chapel. This museum is a private undertaking, and is open by request with entry by donation. The collection is housed in four buildings, with the third building housing a collection of historic shop interiors from 'heritage' Rangiora include a blacksmiths and the fourth housing a large collection of tractors. The museum grounds are also home to the former Rangiora Post Office clock tower, which was originally part of Rangiora's first post office, which was demolished in 1936 to make way for the current building.\nThe Northbrook Museum has taken delivery of further historic artifacts which have been displaced by the Canterbury earthquakes. In February 2013, the museum took delivery of the former 'Canterbury Draught' sign that had been located on top of the DB Breweries building in Christchurch. Plans have also been noted for a historic township to be constructed as part of the museum's expansion.\nThe Herons' Steam Museum is located to the west of the town, past the Rangiora Racecourse. Although not listed as open to the public, the museum contains (or contained) a collection of industrial displays, working models and steam machinery including several traction engines, which have been restored at the museum and made regular gala appearances in the past. This museum has been owned by the Heron family since its inception in the 1970s, and entrance is by donation.\n\n\nTransport\nRangiora is linked by Metro Route B which links Kaiapoi, Christchurch and Princess Margaret Hospital via Main North Road and Flaxton Road.\n\n\nRail\nThe Main North Line reached Rangiora as part of the Canterbury Provincial Railways' 5' 3\" gauge (1600mm) network that would eventually stretch north to Amberley. Southbrook was reached in July 1872, the extension to Rangiora being delayed by lack of chairs, until 5 November 1872. Rangiora was the terminus until the line was extended over the Ashley River bridge to Balcairn on 3 November 1875\nA memorandum between the Resident Minister and the Superintendent of Canterbury specified that Rangiora and Kaiapoi should have station buildings of 50 by 16 ft (15.2 by 4.9 m), with 7 ft (2.1 m) verandas and including a booking office, ladies room, waiting room and luggage room, with 100 ft (30 m) platforms, urinals, closets, artesian wells and 90 by 30 ft (27.4 by 9.1 m) goods sheds.\nIn 1875, a collision occurred between two trains at the Rangiora Station; although there were no fatalities, both engines were damaged as was some of the rolling stock involved.\nIn 1878, the railway was converted to the narrow gauge 3 ft 6 in (1,070 mm) chosen by Sir Julius Vogel for the New Zealand Railways.\nFrom 1878 until 1959, Rangiora was also the junction for the Oxford Branch, which ran from Rangiora to Oxford West station. A photo taken in about 1900 shows a station building located between the main line and the branch, at right angles to the current station. The branch was constructed to tap the timber and agricultural resources of the Oxford area, connected with the Eyreton Branch at Bennetts Junction and at Oxford West for the short Malvern Branch (as it was then known), which connected the Oxford Branch to Sheffield on the Midland Line. This line, known for its high road-rail bridge across the Waimakariri Gorge, was closed in 1931 after years of spasmodic use. The Eyreton Branch connection at Bennetts was also closed in 1931.\nThe Oxford Branch itself closed in 1959, although the formation, several goods sheds (at Fernside and Springbank) and the former East Oxford Station (demolished in 1999) were left as reminders of the old railway. The original line ran down past the Plough Hotel on High Street; while there are no signs of this, the railway later ran down Blackett Street and so the street is noticeably wider than most streets as it had to accommodate both the railway and the street.\nIn 2002, the Waimakariri District Council re-erected station nameboards along the line as memorials to the railway, including one at Bells, on the intersection of High Street and the Rangiora-Oxford Road. It was also noted in 2006 that the former Bennetts railway station had been acquired from its use as the Cust cricket pavilion for restoration at Oxford.\nSuburban trains ran between Christchurch and Rangiora between 1878 and 30 April 1976, when declining patronage caused New Zealand Railways to discontinue the service. The station has since been converted at various times into a garden centre, and more latterly, The Station Cafè. The building today comprises the former stationmaster's office, waiting rooms, and lobby; originally built in an L-shape, the station has lost the extension which formerly held the women's and men's toilets, and other offices. The railway yard has also been reduced in size with the closure of the Oxford Branch. The yard presently comprises the mainline and two loops, one of which is disused following a derailment which damaged the points at the northern end of the second loop.\nIn 1945, the Main North Line railway from Christchurch to Picton was completed, passing through Rangiora. Since 1945, passenger services have connected Rangiora with Christchurch and Picton; initially, this service was provided by Vulcan railcars up until 1978, when they were replaced by locomotive-hauled trains. The TranzCoastal, later rebranded as the Coastal Pacific, passes through Rangiora heading north in the morning and south again in the afternoon. This has recently been cut back to three trains each way per week in the off-peak season, following a similar format applied to the Overlander between Auckland and Wellington in 2006.\n\n\nEducation\n\nThe town has several primary schools and two secondary schools. They are:\n\nAshgrove School, a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in the north-west of the town with a roll of 423 students (as of July 2025). The school opened in 1967.\nRangiora Borough School, a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in the centre of the town with a roll of 325 students (as of July 2025). The school opened in 1873.\nSt Joseph's School, a state-integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1–8) school in the centre of the town with a roll of 177 students (as of July 2025). The school opened in 1887 as a private school and integrated into the state education system in the early 1980s.\nTe Matauru Primary, a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in the south-west of the town with a roll of 233 students (as of July 2025). The school opened in 2020.\nRangiora High School, a state co-educational secondary school, which serves Rangiora and the surrounding area, with a roll of 1679 students (as of July 2025). The school opened in 1884.\nRangiora New Life School, a state-integrated Christian area school (year 1–13) situated in the Rangiora suburb of Southbrook. The school opened in 1979 as a private school and integrated into the state education system in the early 1990s. It has a roll of 466 students (as of July 2025).\nPopulation growth in the Rangiora area since the mid-2000s, especially following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, saw the town's primary schools start to approach capacity. In response to this, Te Matauru Primary opened in January 2020.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nVisit Waimakariri\nEnterprise North Canterbury\nRangiora High School\nAshgrove School\nRangiora Borough School\nSouthbrook School\nRangiora Players\nRangiora Volunteer Fire Brigade",

Text of the motion was reportedly prepared by Russia's International Agency for Current Policy, channeling money from Russia for European politicians. In April 2016 Kyprianou introduced a motion to recognise the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea as well as demand that the resulting sanctions on Russia be lifted. This was done in co-operation with a request from the International Agency for Current Policy, an organisation run by the Russian Duma that sought to promote legitimisation of the Russian annexation of Crimea through what has been alleged to be bribery. In October 2016 Kyprianou travelled to Crimea, reportedly at the behest of Cypriot-Russian businessman Dmitry Kozlov, where he met with two leading figures promoting investment in the peninsula.\n\n\nReferences",

The organization is thought to have had around 500 active members. Die wahre Religion takes part in Koran distribution campaigns. The declared goal of the campaign under the name Lies! (meaning Read! in German) is to provide a Quran translation to every household in Germany. According to the founder, around 3.5 million copies were distributed by mid-2016. The organization was successfully banned in November 2016 by the German government following its proven recruitment of jihadists to fight in Syria and Iraq for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIS.\n\n\nIbrahim Abou-Nagie\n\nDie wahre Religion's founder is Gaza-born Palestinian Ibrahim Abou-Nagie (Arabic: إبراهيم أبو ناجي), an immigrant Salafist preacher. He  arrived in Germany in 1982 as an 18-year-old and claims to have run successful businesses, although those claims have not been substantiated.  He became a German citizen in 1984. He describes a religious awakening in 2003 after which he became a preacher. Abou-Nagie promoted the idea of distributing Qurans to German passers-by. Abou-Nagie has been known to German security officials since 2005, the year he created a website described by officials as spreading extremist propaganda.\nAbou-Nagie was alleged to have openly preached against democracy and other Western values, in a video proclaiming \"Democracy is against Islam. And it is the opposite of Islam.\" He also opined that \"If someone is married and commits adultery, he must be stoned.\" Abou Nagie has also said that homosexuals must be executed in order to \"protect Muslims,\" and proclaimed that \"disbelievers\" will burn in hell. An attempt to prosecute Abou-Nagie on charges of incitement of religious hatred failed in 2012.\n\n\nQuran distribution campaign\n\nThe group's most well-known activity is a campaign of distributing Qurans published in German in Germany and also in Austria and German-speaking areas in Switzerland. The campaign is known in German as Lies! (German for Read!) and is active in several countries including the United Kingdom, France, Bahrain and Brazil under the general Arabic language name Iqraa! (اقرأ in Arabic). The word is derived from اقرأ باسم ربّك الّذي خلق (pronounced Iqraa' bismi rabbika allathi khalaq, meaning Read in the name of your God that created).\n\n\nNovember 2016 raids and ban\nThe arrest on 8 November 2016 of Abu Walaa, a 32 year old Iraqi-born Hildesheim-based Salafi preacher, heralded a nationwide police crack down in Germany the following week on Islamist organizations including Die Wahre Religion. Beginning on November 15, 2016, German authorities conducted raids on 190 locations across the nation, thought to be linked to extremism. The police raids spanned ten cities and regions, including Die Wahre Religion offices in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia.\nsecuring material used in the promotion of \"violent jihad,\"\nAccording to German government sources, 140 of Die Wahre Religion members are known to have traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight for ISIS. Ibrahim Abou-Nagie, the founder of the organization was out of the country at the time of the raids.\nDWR was banned by German authorities in November 2016. The Koran translation used by the group has been described as a \"particularly hardline interpretation,\" while the group itself, in response to being banned, claimed that this meant the Koran had been banned in Germany. The group continues to be active in the UK and abroad after being banned in Germany.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Audio time stretching and pitch scaling",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=46943",
    "text": "Time stretching is the process of changing the speed or duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. Pitch scaling is the opposite: the process of changing the pitch without affecting the speed. Pitch shift is pitch scaling implemented in an effects unit and intended for live performance. Pitch control is a simpler process which affects pitch and speed simultaneously by slowing down or speeding up a recording.\nThese processes are often used to match the pitches and tempos of two pre-recorded clips for mixing when the clips cannot be reperformed or resampled. Time stretching is often used to adjust radio commercials and the audio of television advertisements to fit exactly into the 30 or 60 seconds available. It can be used to conform longer material to a designated time slot, such as a 1-hour broadcast.\n\n\nResampling\nThe simplest way to change the duration or pitch of an audio recording is to change the playback speed. For a digital audio recording, this can be accomplished through sample rate conversion. When using this method, the frequencies in the recording are always scaled at the same ratio as the speed, transposing its pitch up or down in the process. Slowing down the recording to increase duration also lowers the pitch, while speeding it up for a shorter duration respectively raises the pitch, creating the so-called Chipmunk effect. When resampling audio to a notably lower pitch, it may be preferred that the source audio is of a higher sample rate, as slowing down the playback rate will reproduce an audio signal of a lower resolution, and therefore reduce the perceived clarity of the sound. When resampling audio to a notably higher pitch, it may be preferred to incorporate an interpolation filter, as frequencies that surpass the Nyquist frequency (determined by the sampling rate of the audio reproduction software or device) will create sound distortions due to aliasing.\n\n\nFrequency domain\n\n\nPhase vocoder\n\nOne way of stretching the length of a signal without affecting the pitch is to build a phase vocoder after Flanagan, Golden, and Portnoff.\nBasic steps:\n\ncompute the instantaneous frequency/amplitude relationship of the signal using the STFT, which is the discrete Fourier transform of a short, overlapping and smoothly windowed block of samples;\napply some processing to the Fourier transform magnitudes and phases (like resampling the FFT blocks); and\nperform an inverse STFT by taking the inverse Fourier transform on each chunk and adding the resulting waveform chunks, also called overlap and add (OLA).\nThe phase vocoder handles sinusoid components well, but early implementations introduced considerable smearing on transient (\"beat\") waveforms at all non-integer compression/expansion rates, which renders the results phasey and diffuse. Recent improvements allow better quality results at all compression/expansion ratios but a residual smearing effect still remains.\nThe phase vocoder technique can also be used to perform pitch shifting, chorusing, timbre manipulation, harmonizing, and other unusual modifications, all of which can be changed as a function of time.\n\n\nSinusoidal spectral modeling\n\nAnother method for time stretching relies on a spectral model of the signal.  In this method, peaks are identified in frames using the STFT of the signal, and sinusoidal \"tracks\" are created by connecting peaks in adjacent frames.  The tracks are then re-synthesized at a new time scale.  This method can yield good results on both polyphonic and percussive material, especially when the signal is separated into sub-bands.  However, this method is more computationally demanding than other methods.\n\n\nTime domain\n\n\nSOLA\n\nRabiner and Schafer in 1978 put forth an alternate solution that works in the time domain: attempt to find the period (or equivalently the fundamental frequency) of a given section of the wave using some pitch detection algorithm (commonly the peak of the signal's autocorrelation, or sometimes cepstral processing), and crossfade one period into another.\nThis is called time-domain harmonic scaling or the synchronized overlap-add method (SOLA) and performs somewhat faster than the phase vocoder on slower machines but fails when the autocorrelation mis-estimates the period of a signal with complicated harmonics (such as orchestral pieces).\nAdobe Audition (formerly Cool Edit Pro) seems to solve this by looking for the period closest to a center period that the user specifies, which should be an integer multiple of the tempo, and between 30 Hz and the lowest bass frequency.\nThis is much more limited in scope than the phase vocoder based processing, but can be made much less processor intensive, for real-time applications. It provides the most coherent results for single-pitched sounds like voice or musically monophonic instrument recordings.\nHigh-end commercial audio processing packages either combine the two techniques (for example by separating the signal into sinusoid and transient waveforms), or use other techniques based on the wavelet transform, or artificial neural network processing, producing the highest-quality time stretching.\n\n\nFrame-based approach\n\nIn order to preserve an audio signal's pitch when stretching or compressing its duration, many time-scale modification (TSM) procedures follow a frame-based approach.\nGiven an original discrete-time audio signal, this strategy's first step is to split the signal \ninto short analysis frames of fixed length.\nThe analysis frames are spaced by a fixed number of samples, called the analysis hopsize \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        ∈\n        \n          N\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{a}\\in \\mathbb {N} }\n  \n.\nTo achieve the actual time-scale modification, the analysis frames are then temporally relocated\nto have a synthesis hopsize \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            s\n          \n        \n        ∈\n        \n          N\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{s}\\in \\mathbb {N} }\n  \n.\nThis frame relocation results in a modification of the signal's duration by a stretching factor of\n\n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        =\n        \n          H\n          \n            s\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          H\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha =H_{s}/H_{a}}\n  \n.\nHowever, simply superimposing the unmodified analysis frames typically results in undesired artifacts\nsuch as phase discontinuities or amplitude fluctuations.\nTo prevent these kinds of artifacts, the analysis frames are adapted to form synthesis frames, prior to\nthe reconstruction of the time-scale modified output signal.\nThe strategy of how to derive the synthesis frames from the analysis frames is a key difference among\ndifferent TSM procedures.\n\n\nSpeed hearing and speed talking\nFor the specific case of speech, time stretching can be performed using PSOLA.\nTime-compressed speech is the representation of verbal text in compressed time. While one might expect speeding up to reduce comprehension, Herb Friedman says that \"Experiments have shown that the brain works most efficiently if the information rate through the ears—via speech—is the 'average' reading rate, which is about 200–300 wpm (words per minute), yet the average rate of speech is in the neighborhood of 100–150 wpm.\"\nListening to time-compressed speech is seen as the equivalent of speed reading.\n\n\nPitch scaling\n\nThese techniques can also be used to transpose an audio sample while holding speed or duration constant.  This may be accomplished by time stretching and then resampling back to the original length.  Alternatively, the frequency of the sinusoids in a sinusoidal model may be altered directly, and the signal reconstructed at the appropriate time scale.\nTransposing can be called frequency scaling or pitch shifting, depending on perspective.\nFor example, one could move the pitch of every note up by a perfect fifth, keeping the tempo the same.\nOne can view this transposition as \"pitch shifting\", \"shifting\" each note up 7 keys on a piano keyboard, or adding a fixed amount on the Mel scale, or adding a fixed amount in linear pitch space.\nOne can view the same transposition as \"frequency scaling\", \"scaling\" (multiplying) the frequency of every note by 3/2.\nMusical transposition preserves the ratios of the harmonic frequencies that determine the sound's timbre, unlike the frequency shift performed by amplitude modulation, which adds a fixed frequency offset to the frequency of every note. (In theory one could perform a literal pitch scaling in which the musical pitch space location is scaled [a higher note would be shifted at a greater interval in linear pitch space than a lower note], but that is highly unusual, and not musical.)\nTime domain processing works much better here, as smearing is less noticeable, but scaling vocal samples distorts the formants into a sort of Alvin and the Chipmunks-like effect, which may be desirable or undesirable. A process that preserves the formants and character of a voice involves analyzing the signal with a channel vocoder or LPC vocoder plus any of several pitch detection algorithms and then resynthesizing it at a different fundamental frequency.\nA detailed description of older analog recording techniques for pitch shifting can be found at Alvin and the Chipmunks § Recording technique.\n\n\nDJing\nTime stretching and pitch scaling is used extensively by DJs in addition to beatmixing when playing and creating set. In order to seamlessly blend two tracks together, the tempo of a track can be adjusted to match another track such that the beats line up. Pitch scaling is commonly used to retain the pitch of a track. Pitch scaling is also used by DJs for harmonic mixing, to transform tracks into compatible keys so that they sound pleasing when mixed together. Time stretching and pitch scaling are included in modern DJ hardware (CDJs and DJ controllers) and software (such as VirtualDJ, Mixxx, Serato and Rekordbox).\n\n\nMusic production\nTime stretching and pitch scaling is used in digital audio workstation software for working with music loops, sound clips which can be repeated and transposed to form a song. The pitch and tempo of multiple loops are aligned to create tracks. Notable software includes Acid Pro with its \"Acidized\" loops feature and FL Studio.\n\n\nIn consumer software\nPitch-corrected audio timestretch is found in every modern web browser as part of the HTML standard for media playback. Similar controls are ubiquitous in media applications and frameworks such as GStreamer and Unity.\n\n\nSee also\nBeatmatching\nDynamic tonality — real-time changes of tuning and timbre\nPitch correction\nScrubbing (audio)\nNightcore\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nTime Stretching and Pitch Shifting Overview A comprehensive overview of current time and pitch modification techniques by Stephan Bernsee\nStephan Bernsee's smbPitchShift C source code C source code for doing frequency domain pitch manipulation\npitchshift.js from KievII A JavaScript pitchshifter based on smbPitchShift code, from the open source KievII library\nThe Phase Vocoder: A Tutorial - A good description of the phase vocoder\nNew Phase-Vocoder Techniques for Pitch-Shifting, Harmonizing and Other Exotic Effects\nA new Approach to Transient Processing in the Phase Vocoder\nPICOLA and TDHS\nHow to build a pitch shifter Theory, equations, figures and performances of a real-time guitar pitch shifter running on a DSP chip\nZTX Time Stretching Library Free and commercial versions of a popular 3rd party time stretching library for iOS, Linux, Windows and Mac OS X\nElastique by zplane commercial cross-platform library, mainly used by DJ and DAW manufacturers\nVoice Synth from Qneo - specialized synthesizer for creative voice sculpting\nTSM toolbox Free MATLAB implementations of various Time-Scale Modification procedures\nPaulStretch at the Wayback Machine (archived 2023-02-02), a well-known algorithm for extreme (>10×) time stretching\nBungee open source and commercial libraries for real time audio stretching\nRubber Band — open source library for time stretching and pitch shifting\nSoundTouch — open-source library for changing the tempo, pitch and playback rate",

    "text": "In surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding and aggressive inline skating, frontside and backside are terms that are used to describe how a person approaches an obstacle or performs a certain trick. In aggressive inline skating, frontside and backside are types of grinds.\nFrontside and backside indicate either the front or back of the rider under the following circumstances:  Regardless of which board sport you are referring to, if the rider is not spinning it indicates which side is facing the \"wave\" on approach.  This can be many things, rail, pipe wall, or slope/implied slope. If the rider is spinning it will indicate which side of the rider is first to face in the direction of travel.  The only exception to this rule is fakie as there is an implied 180 degree rotation already completed causing the expression to be reversed.\nThe names frontside and backside originate from surfing where they mean the direction the surfer is facing while surfing a wave. If the surfer is facing the wave, he or she is surfing frontside, otherwise he or she is surfing backside. The terms forehand and backhand are synonyms for frontside and backside but they are only used in surfing.\n\n\nSkateboarding\nFor performing rotational tricks on flat ground, frontside means that for the first 90–180 degrees of the rotation, the rider rotates to face the direction of travel. For a rider traveling in the \"regular\" stance (left foot leading), frontside means to rotate counter clockwise (as seen from above). Conversely, a skater (regular) doing a backside rotation/trick is rotating clockwise. The same applies to horizontal board-rotation tricks, where the skater does not rotate: a regular stance skater performing a frontside shove-it spins the board counter clockwise, as seen from above.\nWhen riding fakie, the term is reversed. For example, a rider in the \"goofy\" stance (right foot leading) does a frontside 180 when they rotate 180 degrees clockwise.\nWhen riding switch, frontside and backside are the same as they would be from regular. When riding nollie, the rotation of tricks is the same as in regular stance, i.e. a nollie backside 180 spins in the same direction as a regular stance backside 180.\n\nWhen applied to slides involving obstacles, backside and frontside take on different meaning: the terms define how the obstacle is being approached. For example, when performing a frontside boardslide, \"frontside\" means that the obstacle (e.g. rail or ledge) is to the front (the toe-side) of the skateboarder. To carry out a frontside boardslide, a regular-stance skater will rotate slightly clockwise before sliding, facing away from the direction of travel. This is the opposite direction of rotation to a frontside ollie.\n\n\nSnowboarding\nIn snowboarding, frontside and backside have the same meanings as in skateboarding. When turning, a  backside turn is analogous to a toeedge turn, and frontside turn is analogous to a heeledge turn.\nIn the air, frontside means that 90 degrees into your first rotation you will be facing forward downhill and backside means that 90 degrees into your first rotation your back will be facing downhill. For example, a left foot forward (or regular) rider would rotate counterclockwise to do a frontside 360 and clockwise to do a backside 360.\n\n\nAggressive inline skating\nIn aggressive inline skating, frontside and backside are used to describe the way the skater's feet are positioned when grinding on an object. For example, if a skater jumps on to grind a ledge with both feet landing on the h-blocks (the grindable area in the middle of the frame), with the toes facing the ledge, the skater is doing a frontside grind. Their whole body will be facing the object.\nA backside is much the same, although when the skater jumps on, they will be landing with their back to the object, and with their heels facing the ledge.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Magic: The Gathering core sets, 1993–2007",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1993973",
    "text": "The collectible card game Magic: The Gathering published nine base sets from 1993–2007, also referred to as core sets.   The base sets were considered descendants of the original Limited Edition, and shaped the default setting and feel of Magic.  These sets consisted entirely of reprinted cards. These cards were generally simpler than cards in expansion sets, omitting multicolored cards, and used only the original abilities and keywords of Magic such as Flying and Trample. This simplicity led to many cards from these sets being considered \"staples\" of deck design. All cards were given a white border to mark them as reprints, with a few exceptions (Tenth Edition, foil cards in Seventh-Ninth Editions).  From Fourth Edition in 1995 onward, a new base set would come out once per two years in the spring or early summer; for tournament play, that set would be legal for two years in the Standard format until the next core set replaced it.\nEarly in the history of Magic, the sets sold out nearly instantaneously, and supplying the game's growing fan base proved tricky. Sales were also concentrated on the West Coast of the United States, where Wizards of the Coast was based. The earliest base sets—Unlimited, Revised, and Fourth Edition—helped provide the first experience with Magic for many players in areas where Magic had never been sold before, enabling them to catch up on the base game with cards that, while technically reprints, had never been available to them before. As the market became saturated, the base sets took on a changed role; they began to be marketed as the entry point for new Magic players, with less interest expected from dedicated Magic players who likely owned many of the cards already. Seventh Edition, released in 2001, was sold both as a \"Basic\" and an \"Advanced\" product, with the expansion sets of the time marked as \"Expert\".  Eighth and Ninth editions were marketed similarly.  However, sales were disappointing, an alarming problem for Wizards, as some entry point for newer players was required to keep Magic alive.  In 2009, Wizards of the Coast changed their policy for base sets, and began making smaller base sets that included new cards, starting with the Magic 2010 set.  According to Wizards of the Coast, the previous base sets had \"been completely marginalized by the enfranchised player base\", and change was required to make the base sets of interest to players of all skill levels once more.\n\n\nUnlimited\n\nUnlimited Edition, occasionally referred to as Second Edition, was the second Magic: The Gathering set and the second base set.  It was released on December 1, 1993; this time the run was 40 million cards. Unlimited Edition contains exactly the same cards as Limited Edition, including the Power Nine cards. Unlimited cards have white borders rather than black, however.  This precedent that white borders implied a reprint was honored until the 2007 release of Tenth Edition, which returned to black borders.\nUnlimited was sold in starter packs of 60 cards and booster packs of 15 cards. It was the first set to be officially titled as something other than just Magic: The Gathering. The \"Unlimited Edition\" label appears on the booster boxes, decks, and booster packs.  While it is possible to distinguish Unlimited cards from Revised cards by just looking at the text (wording and type set) the cards from both sets are more easily distinguished by comparing the borders of the cards. The picture frame of Unlimited cards has a beveled edge which Revised cards have not.\n\n\nRevised Edition\n\nRevised Edition (also simply known as Revised) was the sixth set and third core set released for Magic: The Gathering. Like previous core sets, it had no expansion symbol. Revised Edition cards are white-bordered and generally known for their washed-out look. The set was released in April 1994 and contained 306 cards. It was the first base set to contain cards from black-bordered sets other than Alpha and Beta.\nAn advertisement in the first issue of The Duelist stated that the set would have gray borders and be released with a \"constantly changing card mix\", the first of which would be 30 cards from Arabian Nights.\n\n\nPrinting and distribution\nPrinting of Revised began in early April 1994 and continued until April 1995, when Fourth Edition was announced. It is estimated that about 500 million cards of the set were produced, which fully eliminated the distribution problems of earlier sets. The cards of Revised were still widely available even well into 1996.\nThe cards of Revised like the cards of the preceding Unlimited Edition all had white borders, no expansion symbol, and the artist credit at the bottom left. However, the cards were far paler than their Unlimited counterparts, and the three-dimensional beveling of the cards was cropped out. The omission of the bevel in the card frame was an error. This gave the cards an appearance that was widely criticized as \"washed out\" and even unprofessional. The beveling was returned in 4th Edition, and the colors were much more vibrant in that set. The large print run meant that Revised basic lands were so numerous and common that it was uncommon to find any other lands in decks until several years later.\nThe collation of the cards made it possible for a basic land card to appear in the common and uncommon slots of a pack.  This was intentional;  the land cards were printed on the common and uncommon print sheets.  Basic lands would get their own full print sheets in 4th Edition, making Revised the last tournament-legal set until Seventh Edition in which basic lands could be found in booster packs. Basic lands returned as a card slot in the Shards of Alara block of 2008.\nRevised was the first base edition of the game to be sold in multiple languages. Black bordered, limited editions were produced in French, German, and Italian. Unlimited, white bordered editions in the same languages were produced after the limited editions had sold out.\n\n\nMisprints\nOne card-printing error of note appeared on the card Serendib Efreet. This blue creature card was misprinted with a green border and a picture of another card, Ifh-Bíff Efreet. The name, mana cost and rules text were all correct, though. The Revised version is now the most common due to the limited print run of the original, intended versions.\nThe card Disintegrate was missing the clause \"and cannot be regenerated\".\nThe card Onulet incorrectly listed the artist as Kerstin Kaman instead of Anson Maddocks.\n\n\nRule changes\nThe printing of Revised cleared up a number of problems with the Limited Edition and Unlimited Edition rules. Two changes had a large effect on game play. First, the rule that \"multiple effects resolve simultaneously unless a conflict arises\" was changed to \"effects always resolve last-in-first-out\". The concept was later refined and then referred to as the \"stack\", an idea taken from computer programing's stack. Second, the rule for Protection from was changed from \"the creature is unaffected by X\" to the more precise \"the creature cannot be blocked by X creatures, be the target of X spells or abilities, or be enchanted by X enchantments; and all damage dealt to this creature by X sources is reduced to zero\".\nThe most visually obvious of Revised's changes was the elimination of the Mono/Poly/Continuous qualifiers to artifacts. With the advent of the game's first tap symbol (a \"T\" turned forty-five degrees clockwise in a light gray circle), the qualifiers used to differentiate when and how often an artifact could be used were no longer needed. Artifacts that were previously classified as Mono artifacts were given the new tap symbol, while Poly and Continuous artifacts were simply re-templated without the tap symbol.\n\n\nSummer Magic\nThe Summer Magic print run of Revised Edition were printed in the summer of 1994. This print run intended to fix some of the errors with Revised, including the washed-out color, but had problems of its own. The colors were considered too dark and the artist credited for Plateau stayed uncorrected as well as the artist credited for Serendib Efreet, although the Efreet had received its original color and art again. A new misprint occurred with the green card Hurricane; the so-called \"blue Hurricane\" is one of the rarest and most sought-after cards in the entirety of Magic because of its misprint with a blue border. On the secondary market it sells for thousands of dollars. The print run was recalled and destroyed; however, about 40 booster boxes that were shipped to England and Tennessee survived. No more than 11 or 12 of each rare exists.\nThis print run is known primarily for its extremely scarce and valuable cards and packs. Cards are distinguished by dark coloring and a 1994 copyright date displayed at the bottom, along with the artist credit. Booster packs look identical to normal Revised Edition packs, and as such, telling them apart is impossible without opening them. No starter decks were made.\n\n\nNotable cards and card changes\nTwenty Revised cards were originally in the Arabian Nights expansion, and another nineteen were originally in the Antiquities expansion. Thirty-five cards that were in Unlimited were not in Revised, including the Power Nine. A few of the cards that were removed from the base set reappeared in later sets, such as Icy Manipulator, which would be reprinted in Ice Age.  A few others would be reprinted in Eighth Edition to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary.  Cards removed were generally thought to either be confusing, or to have power level issues.\nNotable cards include:\n\nThe Dual Lands: Tundra, Underground Sea, Badlands, Taiga, Savannah, Scrubland, Bayou, Tropical Island, Volcanic Island and Plateau. These lands provide two colors of mana with the benefit of possessing two basic land types, an uncommon trait on non-basic lands. All future dual lands would be printed with restrictions. They are now a defining part of the Legacy and Vintage formats, due in particular to their ability to be searched for by the various Fetchlands released many years later. While many cards were removed from Revised for power reasons, the original dual lands were retained.\nDemonic Tutor – The original and most powerful \"tutor\" card ever printed. This card is restricted in Vintage and banned in Legacy. All future tutors were printed with restrictions or made more expensive like Odyssey's Diabolic Tutor.\nSerendib Efreet - This blue card was printed with the wrong art and a green card frame, making it the most commonly seen misprint.\nSol Ring – While all of the zero-casting cost mana artifacts were removed from Revised, Sol Ring remained with its single casting cost. Its mana acceleration has caused it to be restricted in Vintage and banned in Legacy.\n\n\nFourth Edition\n\nThe Fourth Edition of Magic: The Gathering was the tenth set released for the game, and the fourth base set. The set was released in April 1995 and contained 378 cards. It was the first set to reprint cards from the expansions Legends and The Dark. Fourth Edition cards have white borders. The set has no expansion symbol.\nFourth Edition was the first Magic set to be printed in Asian languages. It was published in English, French, German, Italian, and as a first for a Magic set in Japanese, traditional Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese, which was printed primarily for the Brazilian market. Korean and Chinese Fourth Edition cards have been made with black borders, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish cards exist with white and black borders.\n\n\nPhysical attributes\nFourth Edition included the beveled border missing from the previous core set, Revised. The colors were also much more saturated than in Revised. This set was also the first core set to include a Wizards of the Coast copyright notice at the bottom of the card, in addition to the standard illustration credit.\nBooster packs, for the first time in a core set, came in packs with cropped card art on the packaging. Up to this point, Alpha, Beta, Unlimited, and Revised all had a common-looking booster pack packaging. The cards Brass Man, Hurloon Minotaur, Mana Vault, Mesa Pegasus, and Spirit Link were shown on the booster packs. Starter packs were also improved, with mana symbols replacing the simple colored dots present on the card back. Finally, an overall red-brown theme was given to the packaging, which would persist for Fifth Edition before changing to green in 6th Edition.\nStarter decks in this set included an additional rare, bringing the total to three. However, the starter decks contained fewer uncommons, going down to nine from the previous thirteen. Booster Packs included one rare, three uncommons, and eleven commons. Fourth Edition was the first set to offload its land printings to a dedicated land sheet. This freed up room on the other card sheets to include more spells. As a result, booster packs could now be produced without any lands, which Wizards decided to do. Fourth Edition lands were only available in starter decks. The change was mostly seen as a positive, since by this time lands were ubiquitous and players were unhappy to find a land in place of a \"real\" card.\nFourth Edition introduced the modern turned arrow tapped symbol, replacing the rotated \"T\" that had been introduced in Revised, as a universal tap symbol to include on cards in all language editions of the game. This symbol was first used in an expansion with Ice Age, which was released in the summer. Current cards still use the turned arrow, albeit with a slightly different illustration.\n\n\nCards removed\nLike the previous core set and all core sets since, several cards were removed and new ones were added from Fourth Edition.  Among those cards removed were those that had attracted controversy from those outside the game. Most of the cards whose art depicted nude or near-nude humanoid forms (including Earthbind and Guardian Angel) were excised, as were many that had overtly religious themes (including Resurrection and Demonic Hordes), though one demon, Lord of the Pit, remained. One card, Unholy Strength had its artwork altered to remove a flaming inverted pentagram in the background (as compared to this).  Also removed were the original ten \"dual lands\" (one for each pair of Magic's five colors). With the ability to tap for one mana of either of two colors, they were deemed too powerful. A number of other cards would also be pruned from the set for being too powerful, but some (such as Clone) would appear in future sets.\n\n\nAlternate Fourth Edition\nWizards has used Cartamundi as their card printer since Alpha. For some undocumented reason, during the production of 4th Edition, the company experimented with using other vendors. Some cards were printed by the United States Playing Card Corporation, and had a thicker stock along with a glossy overcoat on the back. While these cards were not intended to be released, some starter packs were leaked out into public circulation. The cards do not glow under blacklight, unlike normal cards, and did not have the normal dot design on the back.\n\n\nNotable cards\nBalance – This card can act as a Wrath of God, Armageddon, and Mind Twist all at once if played at the right time. It was one of the few extremely powerful cards left in the 4th Edition. Even after its restriction, it was still able to warp tournament formats.\nStrip Mine – While most of the cards deemed too powerful were removed from 4th Edition, this one was actually added in. Strip Mine was originally from Antiquities but had not been included in Revised. Tournament play quickly showed that Strip Mine was too powerful and it was eventually restricted to one per deck in Standard and Vintage. Today it is banned in Legacy. Over time, Wizards of the Coast has come to downplay land destruction as an element of the game and Strip Mine has not been reprinted since in a regular set in part due to this policy.\n\n\nFifth Edition\n\nFifth Edition was the seventeenth Magic: The Gathering set, released in March 1997. It contained 449 cards, counting multiple illustrations of the basic lands, making it the largest card set in the game's history. It was the first edition of the core set to reprint cards from Fallen Empires, Ice Age, and Homelands.\nLike its predecessors, Revised and Fourth Editions, Fifth Edition made numerous changes to the game's rules and card mix. The set's designers stated in The Duelist that they wanted to prune from the base set cards that were too powerful or too weak. Many overpowered cards from Limited and Unlimited Editions that had survived the past two rotations were removed from Fifth, but a handful, including Dark Ritual, still survived.  Unlike its predecessors, though, Fifth Edition also removed many cards that Magic's Design and Development team saw as just a little bit too good, but not quite so powerful as to heavily disrupt tournaments, including Lightning Bolt, Swords to Plowshares, and Serra Angel. Many of these cards were brought back in later sets after the designers had re-evaluated their impact on play. A few cards that were in Revised but had been cut from Fourth were brought back as well.\nFifth Edition also set a new precedent by changing the artwork and/or flavor text on many cards, especially the five basic lands, each of which was given four new illustrations to replace its original three. This was done so that WotC would not have to continue to pay for the use of many arts done for earlier sets, as originally artists were paid royalties for their artwork being used, instead of a flat fee as is done today for new Magic art.\nFifth Edition was the first version of the base set to reprint cards from the Fallen Empires and Homelands expansion sets; it also reprinted more cards from those sets than any other version of the base set has. Because those expansion sets were perceived by some players as weak, there was some dissatisfaction with the Fifth Edition card mix. However, many of the reprinted cards were good enough to be used in tournaments, and at least one Ice Age card, Necropotence, was later considered so overpowered as to merit banning from a number of sanctioned tournament formats.\nFifth Edition was the first version of the base set to use the cosmetic changes that were introduced in the Mirage expansion (including a slightly expanded text box and bolder, more visible power/toughness numbers) It was also the last version of the base set to use what are sometimes referred to as the \"old rules\". The rules were drastically changed in Sixth Edition.\n\n\nSixth Edition\n\nSixth Edition, also known as Classic, was released on April 27, 1999.  It contains 350 cards including both reprints of cards from previous core sets as well as new reprints from expansion sets through the Weatherlight expansion.  The name \"Classic\" was prominently featured on cases of packs of the set, and the set was referred to by both titles by both Wizards of the Coast and players.\nSixth Edition was the first base set to have its artist information centered on the card (a printing practice started in Exodus). It was also the first base set to have collectors' numbers (which also originated in Exodus). The rules text on basic lands was also replaced with just a mana symbol, as featured in the Portal starter sets of 1997 and 1998.\nPerhaps the biggest cosmetic change to the base set, however, was the expansion symbol. Sixth Edition was the first core set to have an expansion symbol, which was necessary to show the cards' rarities (another practice that originated in Exodus). The set's expansion symbol was the Roman numeral VI, or 6. (This change had occurred slightly earlier in the Traditional Chinese version of Fifth Edition, which used a Roman Numeral 'V' as the expansion set.  The Traditional Chinese version came out notably later than the English version, by which time Wizards of the Coast had decided the feature was necessary.)\n\n\nRule changes\nThe release of Sixth Edition brought a new version of the rules. Notable changes included:\n\nThe \"batch\" system of spell resolution was replaced with the \"stack\" system in Sixth Edition. Previously, spells resolved in complicated batches, in which a player could only respond to the spells in the batch. Also, once a batch began to resolve, no more spells could be played until the entire batch of spells resolved. This was replaced with the stack system (much like a computer stack), in which spells could be added regardless of what was on it. Also, spells resolve one at a time in the stack, utilizing the \"last in first out\" system.\nThe new stack system removed the \"timing\" aspect of spells. Therefore, the interrupt spell type was removed as being redundant. All spells that were interrupts (generally counterspells) became instants.\nBefore Sixth Edition, spells and abilities that produced mana were known as mana sources and couldn't be countered. In Sixth Edition, mana source spells (such as Dark Ritual) became instants, which could be countered just like other instants. (Mana source abilities, on the other hand, became \"mana abilities\"; these didn't use the stack and still could not be countered.)\nTriggered abilities were clarified. Under the old system, these confused many players who didn't know how (or when) to respond to them. With the \"timing\" aspect removed in Sixth Edition, it became clearer just when a player could play a spell to combat a triggered ability.\nThe \"damage-prevention step\" was removed. Now, when a spell deals damage, it deals it immediately on resolution, rather than waiting for damage prevention. The difference lies in when a player can play damage prevention: Previously, a player would play it after the damage spell resolves. After the rule change, the player had to play it before the damage spell resolves.\nArtifacts also received a rule change. Before the change, an artifact \"shut off\" or stopped working while it was tapped, unless it was an artifact creature. After, an artifact remains active while tapped. This was to bring artifacts more in line with other cards. Some artifacts (like Howling Mine and Static Orb) retained the \"shut off\" aspect, which necessitated explicitly printing that they only worked while untapped.\nCombat was restructured. Each step of combat was clearly demarcated, and each step had opportunities for players to play spells.\nCombat damage from creatures was also put on the stack where spells and abilities would normally go. In this way, combat damage could be responded to before the damage is actually dealt. This allowed (among other things) creatures in combat to be sacrificed for effects and still deal damage as though they were still in play. This change would later be reversed in the rule changes introduced with the Magic 2010 core set.\nOne of the loss conditions was changed. Before the change, a player that lost all of their life didn't lose the game immediately; if they were able to raise their life to at least 1 before the end of the current phase, they lived. Under 6th Edition rules, a player loses the game as soon as a player has priority once their life total is zero or less. This brought that loss condition in line with the other loss condition specified by the rules; a player being forced to draw a card when he or she has an empty library has always been an immediate loss.\nOriginally, spells that summoned creatures were called summon spells; they were not used to represent creatures unless the creature in question had been successfully summoned and was in play. However, a few cards like Raise Dead had been incorrectly referring to summon spells as \"creatures\" or \"creature spells\" for a long time regardless of their location. Rather than correct the wording on these cards, WotC decided to abolish summon spells entirely and replace them with the functionally equivalent \"creature spell\"\nOriginally, if two cards had the same ability, that ability would be expressed the same way on both cards. Starting in 6E, lands would no longer have their abilities written out. Instead, a giant mana symbol appeared in the text box. However, cards that had the exact same ability as a basic land, such as Llanowar Elves, would still have the ability written out.\nBanding was discontinued\n\nSome of these changes were well-received, but the combination of all of the changes proved to be extremely controversial and divisive, and was compared to the Portal set and rules. The state of the game prior to these changes was often referred to as \"real Magic\" by people who hated the changes, a fact that Wizards of the coast eventually acknowledged on the \"Old Fogey\" card from the Unhinged expansion.\n\n\nSeventh Edition\n\nSeventh Edition was a Magic: The Gathering set released on April 2, 2001. It is the only core set since the original Limited Edition to have introduced all-new art for every card.  The set contained 350 cards. The expansion symbol was a stylized 7.\nDespite being an \"Advanced\" level set, Seventh Edition contained a separate basic subset for new players similar to the products that were previously offered as Starter 2000. Cards that appeared in the Seventh Edition Starter special pre-constructed theme decks did not appear in boosters. This would be the last starter level product released by Wizards of the Coast.\nSeventh Edition was the last base set printed in the 'old' frame; Eighth Edition introduced the modern card frame.  Seventh was the first base set to contain foil cards, which were printed with black borders.  It was the last base set to be released prior to the final expansion of the then-current block (Seventh Edition was released before Apocalypse). Starting with Eighth Edition, the base set editions (which, with 8th, would become known as Core Set editions) were released after the last expansion of the then-current block and before the first expansion of the subsequent block.\nUnusually for a core set, Seventh featured a loose storyline that tied together most of the cards in a core set, a practice usually reserved for expansion sets. The story involved a conflict between the North, South, East, and West Paladins.  Magic Origins, 14 years later, would also feature a loose story.\n\n\nEighth Edition\n\nEighth Edition, also known as Core Set, was a Magic: The Gathering set released on July 28, 2003.  Its expansion symbol is the number 8 with 3 cards behind it.  Eighth Edition was released to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the original release of Magic. Every previous expansion had at least one card reprinted in Eighth that had not been reprinted in the base set before, with a series of votes on the Wizards website deciding what got reprinted. Eighth was also the first base set with a promotional card given to players who played in a prerelease tournament. Eighth features many cards from older base sets and expansions. While many of these cards were powerful during their original print run, on the whole they were not perceived as measuring up to the power in Standard at the time, known for \"Affinity\" decks powered by cards from the Mirrodin block.  Thus, few cards in Eighth Edition saw tournament play.\nA new card face was introduced in Eighth Edition. The colored frames around the edges of the card were redesigned and narrowed, boxes were placed around card names and creatures' power and toughness, card names were printed in a new font (Matrix Bold, rather than Goudy Medieval), artifacts switched from a brown background to a silvery-white background, and mana symbols appearing in the text box were no longer colored.  The later two changes themselves were changed shortly thereafter; in Fifth Dawn, the artifact face was darkened to be more distinguishable from white cards.  In Champions of Kamigawa, Wizards restored colored mana symbols in card text boxes.\nSeveral tournament staples which had appeared in 7th Edition, including Opposition, Llanowar Elves, Counterspell, and Duress, were not present in Eighth Edition.  The Circle of Protection series, a perennial core set entity, remained in the set but changed from common to uncommon.  A number of simple cards, such as Vizzerdrix, were reprinted only for products directed at new players and were not present in booster packs.\n\n\nNinth Edition\n\nNinth Edition was a Magic set released on July 29, 2005.  It continued Eighth Edition's terminology change of referring to itself as a core set.  Ninth Edition contained 350 cards available in booster packs, all reprints from earlier Magic sets. Similar to Eight Edition, the Ninth Edition Core Game contained 9 \"starter cards\", labeled with the collector numbers S1 through S10 (there is no card labeled S6, however), which were not available in booster packs. These were simple \"vanilla\" creatures, such as Eager Cadet, which were designed to introduce new players to the game.\nNinth Edition features only mechanics present in previous expansions. However, Ninth Edition does modify the list of mechanics considered suitable for base sets. The trample and protection mechanics were included after being removed from Classic Sixth Edition and later base sets. Equipment, first introduced in the Mirrodin set, is also in Ninth Edition, although it was moved up in rarity. Furthermore, all mechanics now have reminder text; mechanics such as flying and trample did not in earlier sets.  Ninth Edition is also the first set to be printed using the new template for enchantments. Previously, enchantments that were played on other permanents were called \"local enchantments\" and were printed with the type \"Enchant creature\", \"Enchant land\", etc. With the Champions of Kamigawa set, Wizards of the Coast made an effort to simplify the type line, which had contained rules interactions that were not written on the card.  \"Enchant [entity]\" was changed to \"Enchantment - Aura\" and the targeting restriction moved to the text box.  Mark Gottlieb explained the changes in the article \"Aura Hygiene\".  Errata was issued to make all such cards conform to this template, and Ninth Edition became the first set where the cards were actually printed with this changed wording.\nWith Ninth Edition came a redesign of Fat Packs, special products that came with an array of both booster packs and side Magic items such as life counters. The Fat Pack consisted of two boxes wrapped around by a card box wrapper featuring new art. The player's guide was also reduced in size but was now sturdier. Also added were 6 divider pieces with artwork for inside the boxes.\nAs of 2013, Ninth Edition is the last Magic set to be printed with white borders. The set's premium foil cards were printed with black borders. Cards made available in Cyrillic when Ninth Edition was marketed in Russia also were black-bordered; this marked the first time a new language had been printed for the game since Simplified Chinese was added to Fifth Edition.\n\n\nTenth Edition\n\nTenth Edition was a Magic set released on July 13, 2007, replacing Ninth Edition as the core set of cards for standard tournament play.  The symbol for Tenth Edition is the Roman numeral \"X\". As part of their \"Selecting Tenth Edition\" promotion, Wizards of the Coast gave fans the chance to manage a part of the set's brand. The results gave the Roman numeral \"X\" over the number \"10\", along with many other card, art, and flavor text choices.  Tenth Edition was the first core set since Beta to be printed with black-bordered cards, rather than white-bordered ones. Tenth Edition is also the first core set to include legendary creatures (two of each color), bringing back flavorful relics of Magic's past such as Squee, Goblin Nabob, and Kamahl, Pit Fighter.\nAs with Eighth and Ninth Edition, part of the development process for Tenth Edition included allowing fans to select certain cards for inclusion in the set. This process began in mid-June 2006 and continued for 10 weeks.  Tenth Edition starter packs include land cards from Magic's next set, Lorwyn.\nFoil cards in Tenth Edition do not have reminder text. Many use the extra space to add flavor text that does not appear on the nonfoil versions. Others, such as Time Stop, simply center their existing text in the text box for added impact.\nThe keywords defender, double strike, equip, fear, first strike, flash, flying, haste, landwalk, lifelink, protection, reach, regeneration, shroud, trample, and vigilance are in Tenth Edition. Of these, defender, double strike, flash, lifelink, reach and shroud appeared in core sets for the first time. Tenth Edition also reprinted several cards from previous sets with changed rarity, such as Chromatic Star and Fog Elemental.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nLin, Jim. \"A guide to Magic: The Gathering Fourth Edition\".

    "summary": "The collectible card game Magic: The Gathering published nine base sets from 1993–2007, also referred to as core sets.   The base sets were considered descendants of the original Limited Edition, and shaped the default setting and feel of Magic.  These sets consisted entirely of reprinted cards. These cards were generally simpler than cards in expansion sets, omitting multicolored cards, and used only the original abilities and keywords of Magic such as Flying and Trample. This simplicity led to many cards from these sets being considered \"staples\" of deck design. All cards were given a white border to mark them as reprints, with a few exceptions (Tenth Edition, foil cards in Seventh-Ninth Editions).  From Fourth Edition in 1995 onward, a new base set would come out once per two years in the spring or early summer; for tournament play, that set would be legal for two years in the Standard format until the next core set replaced it.\nEarly in the history of Magic, the sets sold out nearly instantaneously, and supplying the game's growing fan base proved tricky. Sales were also concentrated on the West Coast of the United States, where Wizards of the Coast was based. The earliest base sets—Unlimited, Revised, and Fourth Edition—helped provide the first experience with Magic for many players in areas where Magic had never been sold before, enabling them to catch up on the base game with cards that, while technically reprints, had never been available to them before. As the market became saturated, the base sets took on a changed role; they began to be marketed as the entry point for new Magic players, with less interest expected from dedicated Magic players who likely owned many of the cards already. Seventh Edition, released in 2001, was sold both as a \"Basic\" and an \"Advanced\" product, with the expansion sets of the time marked as \"Expert\".  Eighth and Ninth editions were marketed similarly.  However, sales were disappointing, an alarming problem for Wizards, as some entry point for newer players was required to keep Magic alive.  In 2009, Wizards of the Coast changed their policy for base sets, and began making smaller base sets that included new cards, starting with the Magic 2010 set.  According to Wizards of the Coast, the previous base sets had \"been completely marginalized by the enfranchised player base\", and change was required to make the base sets of interest to players of all skill levels once more.",

    "text": "The Scout movement in Belarus consisted of 1200 members when it joined the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 2010. There are at least five nationwide associations as well as some regional associations. In addition, there were at one time Scouts-in-Exile in metropolitan areas of the United States, and there are presently international Scout units in Belarus.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe initial development of Scouting in Belarus took place within the Russian Scout movement, which was headed by general Oleg Pantyukhov. Belarus was a part of the Russian Empire at that time. The first Scout organisations were not independent. Instead they were totally a part of the Russian Scout movement. They first gathered in Gomel. In 1912 several Boy- and Girl-Scout organisations existed in Gomel. They were Russian, Polish and Jewish. In 1915 there were already 170 little wolves (this nickname was used to call children aged from 7 to 11 years). Russian Scout organisations that were a part of Organization of Russian Young Pathfinders existed in other towns of Belarus. In 1922 after the end of Russian Civil War Scouting had been banned by the Soviet Union, and Scout activities ended. In April 1926 many leaders and members were arrested and imprisoned by Joint State Political Directorate. Most of them were sent to Solovki prison camp. Some of the Scouts and Scout-leaders fled abroad. They later continued their activity in National Organization of Russian Scouts. Russian exiles in France turned cadets into Scouts, but in a more Catholic (local French) manner. Some of them where officers from Belarusian families, who immigrated to France after World War I.\nWest Belarus became a part of the Second Polish Republic according to the Peace of Riga after Polish–Soviet War. Along with the new Polish authorities Polish Scouting and Guiding Association spread in Belarus. A Scout organization was founded in Kletsk, and Scouts appeared in Nyasvizh and other nearby villages. In 1929, American Methodists helped found a Girl Scout organization in Vilnius (which was named Vilna at that time). It lasted until 1929.\n\nIn the period following World War II, ethnic Belarusians gathered in Scout troops in exile and in Scout troops in displaced persons camps throughout Europe, as did Russian Scouts, Ukrainians and Balts. Belarusian Scouts formed the organization Belarusian Scout Association Abroad (Belarusian: Згуртаваньне Беларускіх Скаўтаў на Чужыне, English acronym BSAA, Cyrillic acronym ZBSCh), which existed from 1945 to 1951 in Germany. White Ruthenian Scouts remained active in the United States until at least the 1970s led by Vytaut Kipel, unlike other ethnic organizations under the Boy Scouts of America umbrella. Belarusian scouts participated in the conference of scouts in exile held in New York on July 12, 1952 together with Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians and Yugoslavs.\nUnlike the other organizations, however, the BSAA did not survive to witness the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Whereas Russia, Poland and Ukraine in particular had ready-made Scouting available once allowed in 1990-1991, Belarus had to start essentially from scratch.\nEmergence of democratic principles in the mid-1980s made possible the creation of alternatives to the communist pioneer organizations. Close connections were formed with Guide and Scout organizations of many European countries, when children from areas affected by the Chernobyl accident were invited to summer camps abroad during the Chernobyl Children's Project in 1990. Especially close links were developed with Cyprus, and between Minsk and the Guides of Lincolnshire. In 1992, Cyprus was officially appointed Link country to support the development of Guiding in Belarus, and in June 1993 the first conference of the Association of Belarusian Guides was held in Minsk.\n\n\nNational associations\nBelarusian Republican Scout Association (Белорусcкая Республиканская Скаутская Ассоциация), member of WOSM\nThe Association of Belarusian Guides, member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts since 1996\nBelarusian Scout Association (Аб`яднанне Беларускiх Скаўтаў), founded in 1991, liquidated in 2005 by the Supreme Court of Belarus\nYMCA Scouting in Belarus\nNote: There may have been a link between one of the non-NSAB Belarusian Scout organizations and the Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d'Europe, a Christian-based Scout alternative, but it is uncertain to whom they were linked.\n\n\nRegional associations\nSeveral countries have multiple organizations, divided on the basis of religion (for example, France and Denmark), ethnic identification (as is the case in Bosnia and Israel), or language (like Belgium). Belarus instead has regional Scouting organizations. Regional Scouting divisions of Belarus include the GomelScouts in Gomel. Because usage of the Belarusian language and the Russian language are contentious issues in the country, the emblem itself is captioned in English.\n\n\nInternational Scouting units in Belarus\nIn addition, there are American Boy Scouts in Minsk, serving in Boy Scout Troop 1101, linked to the Direct Service branch of the Boy Scouts of America, which supports units around the world.\n\n\nSee also\n\nBelarusian Republican Youth Union\nScouting in displaced persons camps\nTranslate be-x-old:Гісторыя скаўтынгу на Беларусі to English\n\n\nReferences\n\nWorld Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, World Bureau (2002), Trefoil Round the World.

Sir Andrew was the eldest son of William Wood, a merchant, who was almost certainly a scion of the prominent Wood families holding lands in Banffshire, Aberdeenshire, Kincardineshire, Perthshire and Angus. He was employed by James III of Scotland to protect Scottish trade with Holland. Wood also defended Dumbarton in 1481 against a fleet of Edward IV of England. During the Battle of Sauchieburn, Wood's ships sailed up and down the Forth, taking on board wounded soldiers. He was famous for inflicting many defeats on foreign pirates and privateers as well as squadrons of ships sent by the English government to harass the Scots. After winning several sea battles in the 1480s against the English, he was made a free Baron, with lands including Largo in Fife.  Some records suggest that he was also made a chief of Clan MacDonald for his help in the king's expedition by land and sea after which Domhnall Dubh of the Isles was captured and kept in prison for forty years. Sir Andrew's ruined castle can be found in Upper Largo.\nSir Andrew Wood's grandson was amongst the barons of Parliament in 1560 who subscribed to the Articles for upholding the new reformed religion. He quickly joined those upholding the claim of the infant James VI of Scotland, after the downfall of Mary, Queen of Scots.\nSir Andrew's successors built a hospital and a school in Fife for their kinsmen named Wood, and were prominent in Scottish history both politically and militarily. They continued to be a significant influence in British politics and were foremost among the thousands of Scots who contributed enormously to the economic and armed expansion of the British Empire well into the 19th century. The main line of Sir Andrew’s descendants is considered by the Court of the Lord Lyon King of Arms to be the chiefly one. The record of succession is complete right down to modern times.\n\n\nClan profile\nTimothy Michael Herbert Fawcett Wood, has matriculated the undifferenced Arms and Supporters of the first Chief of Clan Wood in the present line, Admiral Sir Andrew Wood of Largo in Fife, at the Court of the Lord Lyon King of Arms of Scotland.  He is the hereditary Representative of the Ancient Family of Wood of Largo and Chief of the Name. The crest badge that is used by members of the clan comprises the Crest of the Chief's Arms held within a traditional strap and buckle and contains the motto of the Clan's Chiefs, which is TUTUS IN UNDIS (Latin: \"Safe on the Waves\").\nAccording to the clan's official website, since 2017, Oonagh Elizabeth Susan Fawcett Wood has succeeded her father as Representative of the Ancient Family of Wood of Largo and Chief of the Name and Baroness of Largo. She is the middle offspring of her late father and is predominantly based in London England.\n\n\nClan castles\nLargo Castle which was to the north of Lower Largo in Fife was the main castle connected with the Clan Wood. The castle dated from the fifteenth century but it was replaced by Largo House which was started in about 1750. The only remains of the original castle are a single round tower with a conical roof. The castle was held by the infamous Andrew Wood of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nhttp://www.clan-wood.org.uk/\nClan Wood at ScotClans.com",

    "text": "The Devil Bat is a 1940 black-and-white American horror film produced by Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) and directed by Jean Yarborough. The film stars Bela Lugosi along with Suzanne Kaaren, Guy Usher, Yolande Mallott and the comic team of Dave O'Brien and Donald Kerr as the protagonists. It was the first horror film from PRC.\n\n\nPlot\nForeword\n\"All Heathville loved Dr. Paul Carruthers...the doctor found time to conduct certain private experiments — weird, terrifying experiments.\"\nDr. Paul Carruthers (Bela Lugosi), a chemist and physician in the small town of Heathville, is offered a $5,000 bonus from his employers for his contributions to the company, a pittance compared to the million dollars in income the company earned from his work. (His employers argue that he took a buyout early in the company's history instead of retaining his partnership stake.) Embittered and insulted, he seeks revenge and develops a system in which ordinary bats are enlarged to massive size, training them to be drawn to a new, pungent aftershave he is testing. He then distributes the lotion to his enemies as a \"test\" product.\nOnce they have applied the lotion, the chemist then releases his Devil Bats in the night, targeting the families of his employer's owners. The bats succeed in attacking and killing the owner's two sons and his partner. A hot shot reporter from the Chicago Register, Johnny Layton (Dave O'Brien) gets assigned by his editor (Arthur Q. Bryan) to cover and help solve the murders. He and his bumbling photographer \"One-Shot\" McGuire (Donald Kerr) begin to unwind the mystery with some comic sidelights.\nIn the climactic closing scene, Layton dumps a sample of the aftershave on Carruthers, leading the bat to attack and kill its own master. Mary, the last surviving member of her family, runs into Johnny's arms.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\nPRC was a young studio when it planned to enter the horror film genre, which had been neglected by the major studios during 1937 and 1938. Lugosi was beginning a comeback when he signed a contract on October 19, 1940, with PRC's Sigmund Neufeld to star in the Poverty Row studio's first horror film.\nThe shooting of the film began a little more than one week later. PRC was known for shooting its films quickly and cheaply, but for endowing them with a plentiful amount of horror, and The Devil Bat established this modus operandi.\n\n\nCurrent status\nFollowing its theatrical release, The Devil Bat fell into public domain and since the advent of home video, has been released in countless truncated, poorly edited video and DVD editions.\nIn 1990, the film was restored from original 35mm elements by Bob Furmanek and released on laserdisc by Lumivision. In 2008, Furmanek supplied his original elements to Legend Films, which performed a new restoration and also created a computer-colorized version. Both the restored black-and-white and colorized versions were subsequently released on DVD.\nIn 2013, The Devil Bat was released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber under its Kino Classics label.\n\n\nReception\nThe film was re-released in 1945 on a double bill with Man Made Monster. The Los Angeles Times described the duo as \"two of the scariest features on the market.\"\nIn the book Poverty Row Horrors! (1993), Tom Weaver judges The Devil Bat as one of Lugosi's best films for the poverty row studios.\n\n\nSequels\nPRC's 1946 film Devil Bat's Daughter starred Rosemary LaPlanche as Paul Carruthers's daughter. Neither Lugosi nor any other actors reprise their roles; Carruthers is an unseen character in the latter film. In contrast to the horror elements of the original, Devil Bat's Daughter was mainly a psychological thriller.\nIn 2015 Indie filmmaker Ted Moehring directed the sequel Revenge of the Devil Bat, which stars Lynn Lowry, Ruby Larocca and veteran actors Gary Kent, John Link, Dick Dyszel, George Stover, and Conrad Brooks.\n\n\nSee also\nBela Lugosi filmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nWeaver, Tom (1993). \"The Devil Bat (PRC, 1940)\" in Poverty Row Horrors!

By September 9, 1943, he was serving as a Sergeant in the 142nd Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division. On that day, he participated in the Allied landings near Salerno, Italy.

As a rifleman of an infantry company, Sgt. Logan landed with the first wave of the assault echelon on the beaches of the Gulf of Salerno, and after his company had advanced 800 yards inland and taken positions along the forward bank of an irrigation canal, the enemy began a serious counterattack from positions along a rock wall which ran parallel with the canal about 200 yards further inland. Voluntarily exposing himself to the fire of a machinegun located along the rock wall, which sprayed the ground so close to him that he was splattered with dirt and rock splinters from the impact of the bullets, Sgt. Logan killed the first 3 Germans as they came through a gap in the wall. He then attacked the machinegun. As he dashed across the 200 yards of exposed terrain a withering stream of fire followed his advance. Reaching the wall, he crawled along the base, within easy reach of the enemy crouched along the opposite side, until he reached the gun. Jumping up, he shot the 2 gunners down, hurdled the wall, and seized the gun. Swinging it around, he immediately opened fire on the enemy with the remaining ammunition, raking their flight and inflicting further casualties on them as they fled. After smashing the machinegun over the rocks, Sgt. Logan captured an enemy officer and private who were attempting to sneak away. Later in the morning, Sgt. Logan went after a sniper hidden in a house about 150 yards from the company. Again the intrepid Sgt. ran a gauntlet of fire to reach his objective. Shooting the lock off the door, Sgt. Logan kicked it in and shot the sniper who had just reached the bottom of the stairs. The conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity which characterized Sgt. Logan's exploits proved a constant inspiration to all the men of his company, and aided materially in insuring the success of the beachhead at Salerno.\n\n\nTexas Legislative Medal of Honor\nJames Logan was the first recipient of the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor on May 30, 1997\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of Medal of Honor recipients\n\n\nReferences\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Army Center of Military History.\n\"Medal of Honor recipients - World War II (G–L)\".

It is based on the DC Comics character Mari McCabe / Vixen, a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to mimic the abilities of animals. The series is set in the Arrowverse, the same fictional universe as Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow. In January 2016, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on October 13, 2016.\n\n\nPremise\nAfter her parents were killed in Africa by local corruption, Mari McCabe inherits her family's Tantu Totem, gaining the powers of the animal kingdom, using them to fight as Vixen to stop threats like those that claimed her family.\n\n\nCast and characters\n\n\nMain\nMegalyn Echikunwoke as Mari McCabe / Vixen:\nBorn in an African village near the river of Zambezi but raised in the United States, Mari is orphaned at a young age and inherits her family's mystical Tantu Totem, allowing her to access the powers of the animal kingdom.

In total, the six episodes encompass one 30-minute story. The series, described as an \"origin story\", is set in Detroit, Michigan and \"prominently\" features characters from Arrow and The Flash. Keto Shimizu and Brian Ford Sullivan, writers on Arrow, also serve as writers for Vixen. On adding Vixen to the established universe, Guggenheim said, \"Vixen's such a great character. First of all, she represents magic, which is an area that we haven't explored on either of the two shows just yet. One thing we're always saying is, 'Flash is very different from Arrow, Arrow is very different from Flash.' If Arrow is crime and The Flash is science, Vixen has a big magic component.\" Guggenheim also talked about why the series originated as animation, saying, \"One of the things we can do in animation is really push the envelope in a way that we can't on either of the two shows. So there's a much larger production value. We're taking advantage of the animated form.\"\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that the series would debut on August 25, 2015, with new episodes debuting weekly. In July 2015, Guggenheim revealed the series takes place around episode S03E15 and S03E16 of Arrow, saying, \"We were shooting [episode] S03E14 [of Arrow] when we wrote Vixen so we sort of tied it to the continuity not of when it ultimately came out because that would require us projecting very, very far into the future, but we just committed to our timeline of around when we were writing it. We knew, of course, at that point that Oliver would be going off to the League of Assassins and changing his costume as a result, so this takes place just right before that.\" Blake Neely, composer of Arrow and The Flash, composed the music for Vixen along with Nathaniel Blume. In January 2016, CW President Mark Pedowitz announced that The CW had renewed Vixen for a second season of six episodes, again totaling about a half-hour of content. Pedowitz also stated he regretted not airing the entire series as a half-hour special on The CW, something he hoped to do with season two. In January 2017, in terms of renewing Vixen for a third season, Pedowitz said, \"We haven't had that discussion, but based on the success of [the second] season I have no reason why not to.\" The entire series made its broadcast debut on The CW on August 30, 2017.\n\n\nHome media\nIn February 2017, Warner Bros. announced Vixen: The Movie for release on digital download on May 8, 2017, and on Blu-ray and DVD on May 23, 2017. The release sees the first two seasons combined into a single story, with 15 minutes of never-before-seen content. Bonus features on the release include the Justice League Unlimited episodes \"Hunter's Moon\" and \"Grudge Match\" and a new featurette.\n\n\nReception\n\nIGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the series a 7.3/10, praising the action sequences, the animation and the tone, saying the series \"finds its niche in the Flash/Arrow-verse\". Schedeen criticized the short run time and the voice acting of some actors, particularly those crossing over from the live-action shows, saying \"There's a certain stiffness and even slowness to Stephen Amell's Ollie, Grant Gustin's Barry and  Carlos Valdes' Cisco that isn't present in live-action. This is especially apparent whenever the characters launch into witty banter with each other.\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the series a \"B+\" rating.\nIn 2017, Vixen was nominated for the Golden Reel Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing – Computer Episodic (Webisode).\n\n\nArrowverse\n\nGuggenheim stated that if the series was successful, a live-action series centered on the character could be possible. Echikunwoke appeared as the character on Arrow during the fourth-season episode \"Taken,\" in which Mari aided Oliver Queen and his team in rescuing his kidnapped son. After Vixen's appearance on Arrow, Pedowitz reiterated again that it would be possible for the character to spin out to her own live-action series, or potentially join the characters on Legends of Tomorrow. It was originally intended for Echikunwoke to reprise her role in the second season of Legends of Tomorrow, but she was unable to do so due to previous commitments. Maisie Richardson-Sellers was ultimately cast to portray Amaya Jiwe, the grandmother of McCabe who also operated as Vixen. Kuasa appears throughout the third season of Legends of Tomorrow, portrayed by Tracy Ifeachor, while Chuck McCabe appears in the episode \"I, Ava\" and is portrayed by Eli Gabay. The events of the season end up retroactively changing the continuity of Vixen, resulting in an altered timeline where Zambesi was never destroyed, and Mari shares the Vixen mantle with Kuasa.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nVixen at IMDb",

    "text": "Bugzilla is a web-based general-purpose bug tracking system and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project, and licensed under the Mozilla Public License.\nReleased as open-source software by Netscape Communications in 1998, it has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a bug tracking system for both free and open-source software and proprietary projects and products. Bugzilla is used, among others, by the Mozilla Foundation, WebKit, Linux kernel, FreeBSD, KDE, Apache and LibreOffice. Red Hat uses it, but is gradually migrating its product to use Jira. It is also self-hosting.\n\n\nHistory\nBugzilla was originally devised by Terry Weissman in 1998 for the nascent Mozilla.org project, as an open source application to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape Communications for tracking defects in the Netscape Communicator suite. Bugzilla was originally written in Tcl, but Weissman decided to port it to Perl before its release as part of Netscape's early open-source code drops, in the hope that more people would be able to contribute to it, given that Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time.\nBugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to Perl, and the first version was released to the public via anonymous CVS. In April 2000, Weissman handed over control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez. Under her leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla development became more community-driven. In July 2001, facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape, Hernandez handed control to Dave Miller, who was still in charge as of 2020.\nBugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10, 2007, and brought a refreshed UI, an XML-RPC interface, custom fields and resolutions, mod_perl support, shared saved searches, and improved UTF-8 support, along with other changes.\nBugzilla 4.0 was released on February 15, 2011, and Bugzilla 5.0 was released in July 2015.\n\n\nTimeline\nBugzilla's release timeline:\n\n\nRequirements\nBugzilla's system requirements include:\n\nA compatible database management system\nA suitable release of Perl 5\nAn assortment of Perl modules\nA compatible web server\nA suitable mail transfer agent, or any SMTP server\nCurrently supported database systems are MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQLite. Bugzilla is usually installed on Linux using the Apache HTTP Server, but any web server that supports CGI such as Lighttpd, Hiawatha, Cherokee can be used. Bugzilla's installation process is command line driven and runs through a series of stages where system requirements and software capabilities are checked.\n\n\nDesign\n\nWhile the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a technical support ticket system, task management tool, or project management tool, Bugzilla's developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects.\n\n\nZarro Boogs\nBugzilla returns the string \"zarro boogs found\" instead of \"0 bugs found\" when a search for bugs returns no results. \"Zarro Boogs\" is intended as a 'buggy' statement itself (a misspelling of \"zero bugs\") and is thus a meta-statement about the nature of software debugging, implying that even when no bugs have been identified, some may exist.\nThe following comment is provided in the Bugzilla source code to developers who may be confused by this behaviour:\n\nZarro Boogs Found\nThis is just a goofy way of saying that there were no bugs found matching your query. When asked to explain this message, Terry Weissman had the following to say:\nI've been asked to explain this ... way back when, when Netscape released version 4.0 of its browser, we had a release party. Naturally, there had been a big push to try and fix every known bug before the release. Naturally, that hadn't actually happened. (This is not unique to Netscape or to 4.0; the same thing has happened with every software project I've ever seen.) Anyway, at the release party, T-shirts were handed out that said something like \"Netscape 4.0: Zarro Boogs\". Just like the software, the T-shirt had no known bugs. Uh-huh. So, when you query for a list of bugs, and it gets no results, you can think of this as a friendly reminder. Of *course* there are bugs matching your query, they just aren't in the bugsystem yet...\n— Terry Weissman\nFrom The Bugzilla Guide – 2.16.10 Release: Glossary\n\n\nWONTFIX\nWONTFIX is used as a label on issues in Bugzilla and other systems. It indicates that a verified issue will not be resolved for one of several possible reasons including fixing would be too expensive, complicated or risky.\n\n\nSee also\n\nComparison of issue-tracking systems\nList of computing mascots\nCategory:Computing mascots\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Geoffrey William Stirling  (March 22, 1921 – December 21, 2013) was a Canadian-American businessman and media magnate, best known for his work in his home city of St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\n\nLife\nStirling was born in St. John's to Edgar Stiling and Ethel (Uphill) Stirling. He attended the University of Tampa, began his media career as a stringer for Time and the Chicago Tribune, and retained close ties to the United States throughout his lifetime, including a second winter home in Arizona in his later years. After his brief time in American media, he spent a brief time in Honduras hunting alligators for skin; he hated the job, but was inspired when he noted that The Miami Herald was available there, leading him to conclude that a Newfoundland newspaper would be viable.\nStirling was a co-founder in the Economic Union Party, a late-1940s political movement that sought closer ties to the United States for the Dominion of Newfoundland, which was then still independent from Canada. It was one of two organizations that unsuccessfully opposed the dominion's confederation into Canada, which eventually occurred in 1949. The leader of the confederation forces, Joey Smallwood, was an established rival of Stirling's, having doubted that Stirling's newspaper would succeed because Smallwood himself had failed. Stirling argued that Smallwood's overtly political polemics had alienated readers and that a newspaper would need to appeal to a broad audience to succeed.\n\n\nMedia businesses\nAlong with other members of his family, Stirling owned several media outlets in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador under the corporate brand Stirling Communications International. Specifically, the properties are independent television station CJON-DT; radio station CHOZ-FM; and the Newfoundland Herald, a weekly news, gossip and TV listings magazine.\nStirling pioneered many television firsts in North America. CJON-TV (NTV) was the first in Newfoundland to air programs in colour. CJON-TV became the first station to broadcast 24 hours a day in 1972.\nStirling was also the founder of CKGM, an English-language radio station in Montreal. in 1959. He owned the station until 1985.\n\n\nPersonal views\nStirling is regarded as an eccentric for both how he managed his businesses and for how he used his media outlets to promote a variety of personal interests such as eastern mysticism and intestinal health. For example, he devoted many hours of, often unscheduled, broadcast time to conversations with gurus such as Ram Dass and Swami Shyam and to a variety of esoteric subjects ranging from pyramids to unidentified flying objects, a practice which continues today as the station is run by his son G. Scott Stirling. Geoff's grandson, Jesse is the host of the CJON interview program \"Meetings with Remarkable People.\" Many of his past interviews and archives can be seen currently on CJON on Saturday mornings from 2:00AM to 4:00AM Newfoundland time, under the name \"Captain Atlantis Late Night.\" When he watched his own television station he would sometimes phone Master Control to order that a favorite tape immediately pre-empt the current broadcast or that the technician apply a particular effect to the screen.\nStirling appeared in the 1974 documentary film Waiting for Fidel about a trip he made to Cuba along with former Newfoundland premier Joey Smallwood and director Michael Rubbo. The trio never met the Cuban leader. Many segments of the program involve Smallwood and Stirling discussing what they would like to ask Castro whenever the expected meeting happens. Some of the dialogue occurs while Stirling is demonstrating yoga and standing on his head while he is conversing with Smallwood.\nStirling supervised the creation of the graphic novel Atlantis featuring the superheroes Captain Atlantis (Captain Newfoundland) and Captain Canada, drawing on elements of Canadian history as well as ancient alien astronauts mythology and New Age philosophy. Captain Canada has become a mascot for the NTV station and has appeared in television programs, commercials, and numerous public events.\n\n\nLater life\nIn 2001, Stirling was inducted into the CAB Broadcast Hall of Fame; in 2009, he was awarded the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador. In his later years, Stirling split his time between Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador, and his ranch in Wickenburg, Arizona, where he once owned (now defunct) Wickenburg radio station KSWW. Stirling died at the age of 92 on December 21, 2013.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWaiting for Fidel at IMDb\nBiography from the History of Canadian Broadcasting site\nThe Atlantis Universe – with photos of the characters",

He was a human rights activist and philanthropist for over 60 years. He was also an author having published 16 books, including a book titled Le manifeste du dernier monde in 1980.\n\n\nBiography\nHonorat was born on April 1, 1931, in Port-au-Prince. After completing his degrees in agronomy and law, he became a human rights activist. He had been an activist for 40 years before becoming prime minister, while also working as a professor of law and human rights. The philanthropist and humanitarian was accused of having ties to François Duvalier. Honorat stated that their families were, indeed, close and in fact, there were family ties between them. However, in a December 1991 phone interview with correspondents from Washington D.C.'s EIR, he also stated that he quickly became an activist after Duvalier staged the 1961 coup, which was why he left his position as tourist director. The rift between families would lead to Honorat's eventual exile to New York after Francois' son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, unjustly expelled him from the country in 1980. Honorat became prime minister of Haiti on October 11, 1991. President Nérette and Honorat spoke out against the U.S.-led embargoes, calling them genocides. Like many other prime ministers since 1988, Honorat's term would be short-lived and ended after interference by corrupt military officials. He spent eight months in office. He also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship from October to December 1991.\nHonorat continued to be praised in the diplomatic arena. His degrees in agronomy and law, along with his fluency in French, Spanish, Creole, Mandarin, German, and English, served him well throughout his career.\nHonorat was also an author, publishing his first book Le manifeste du dernier monde in 1980.\nJean-Jacques Honorat died in Port-au-Prince on July 26, 2023, at the age of 92.\n\n\nReferences",

After his father died in a car accident, Urata was sent to Japan in 1924 to be raised by his relatives in Kumamoto prefecture. He briefly also lived in Japan-occupied Korea, and was admitted to Waseda University after high school. However, he did not have a chance to study there because in 1937 he returned to Hawaii at his mother's insistence, as the threat of war in Japan increased.\nAfter returning to Hawaii in 1937, Urata became a teacher at a Japanese language school. He also enrolled in the Mid-Pacific Institute to learn English. Soon after he was admitted into the University of Hawaii, Pearl Harbor was attacked and World War II began in the Pacific. In March 1943, he was arrested by the FBI and imprisoned at the Honouliuli Internment Camp. While there, he befriended Kenpu Kawazoe, a journalist who sparked Urata's interest in the Holehole bushi. Urata was later transferred to the Tule Lake War Relocation Center.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter he was released from Tule Lake, Urata returned to Hawaii in December 1945. He sold newspapers for a while, then was hired to do Japanese music programming at KULA, a local radio station. He also reformed his pre-war music group, the Shinko Orchestra, to play for weddings and parties. He then studied with Masao Koga in Japan for a year and a half before starting his own music studio, where he taught hundreds of students.\nUrata worked with Raymond Hattori in 1960 to create a score for the Holehole bushi. However, because they had based their score on one person's rendition of the genre, many singers were upset. Urata decided to gather more recordings of Holehole bushi. He released a record of them in 1967. He collected recordings until the 1980s, when he gave his collection to Franklin Odo, who in turn gave it to the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.\nUrata died on October 23, 2009. Before he died he was presented with awards from the governments of both the United States and Japan.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nUrata's collection of audio recordings",

    "text": "Richard Hill (born January 26, 1953) is an American actor, author, and former gridiron football player. He is perhaps best known for his appearances in several films from veteran producer Roger Corman, including playing the title role in two installments of his Deathstalker series. He is also a published writer of non-fiction, having collaborated with controversial baseball figure Pete Rose on a 2004 tell-all book.\n\n\nFootball career\nHill was a three-sport letterman for Perrysburg High in Perrysburg, Ohio. In football, he twice won MVP honors in the Northern Lakes League, and was also a league all-star in basketball. He was recruited by the Georgia Tech football program, but his career was plagued by injuries.\nBefore 1972, NCAA players were required to spend a year on a freshman team before graduating to the varsity team. Despite a slow start which he attributed to an ankle sprain, Hill led the so-called \"Baby Jackets\" in ground gains, in part because future College Hall of Famer Randy Rhino was moved to defense. Hill's second year started slow again on a weak team, and he was redshirted partway into the season, although head coach Bill Fulcher called him \"probably as good a back as we have at Tech\".\nHill came out strong in the 1973–74 campaign and led the team with six touchdowns by early November, when he suffered a ligament tear that took him out of action for the rest of the schedule. Unsure if he would even be able to play until late into the pre-season, Hill took the field for the 1974–75 campaign but was quickly sidelined with a hamstring injury. He recovered and helped a rejuvenated Tech offense to several school records in the final stretch. \nHill was a Rhodes Scholarship nominee at Georgia Tech, from where he graduated in 1975 with a major in business. Thereafter, he briefly enrolled at Emory University to study law, before attempting to turn pro. Hill trained with the Detroit Lions of the NFL, but did not make the team. He signed a contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL in the spring of 1976, but suffered a dislocated shoulder during the preseason and left training camp with no appearance on record in the regular season.\n\n\nFilm career\nHill's acting break came when he was scouted at a Los Angeles beach and offered the small part of a lifeguard in a production called One of a Kind.\nThe same setting begat a leading role in Beach Patrol, the 1979 pilot for a proposed Aaron Spelling series, although the show was not picked up.\nHill was able to capitalize on his athletic background to keep his career going: he played a college football star (albeit from Michigan) in Detour to Terror, an NBC telefilm starring and produced by O.J. Simpson, and had a recurring role as another football player on the daytime drama Days of Our Lives. He also guest-starred as a varsity football player on an episode of Charlie's Angels, another Spelling production. In 1981, he was cast in Today's FBI, a re-imagining of classic show The FBI, which ran for a single season on ABC. In the later stages of his career, Hill has occasionally worked as a director of episodic television.\nIn 1983, Hill made his theatrical debut in Deathstalker, which was part of a wave of heroic fantasy films that followed Conan The Barbarian in its wake. The film was profitable for Roger Corman's New World Pictures, and Hill subsequently starred in several action films for Corman (including the third Deathstalker sequel) and his associate Cirio Santiago. Hill also appeared in Warrior Queen, a film aping the Deathstalker template but made by another exploitation producer, Harry Alan Towers. In 1994, he played a secondary protagonist in the final installment of the Class of... series, Class of 1999 II. Around the same time, the actor made another push for a leading role with Immortal Soldier, an android film which he co-wrote and was to feature genre veterans Maria Conchita Alonso, Jeff Wincott, Robert Davi, Michael Ironside and Louise Fletcher. However the project, promoted by upstart Hatch Entertainment, did not materialize.\nIn the 1980s, Hill was a member of the Hollywood All-Stars, a touring celebrity softball team raising money for various charitable causes.\n\n\nWriting career\nEarly in his entertainment career, Hill expressed an interest in writing, and was working on a spec script based on his college recruiting experience. A baseball fan, he wrote another about the life of Jim Eisenreich, who battled through Tourette syndrome to become a Major League player. After that one was optioned, his agent tried to pitch him as a writer for a planned biopic of Pete Rose, a fellow Ohioan with whom Hill had become acquainted at a 1986 celebrity softball game. While neither film projects panned out, Rose read the Eisenreich script and chose Hill to write a book about his life. In the resulting opus, My Prison Without Bars, Rose admitted to betting on MLB games for the first time, an accusation he had steadfastly denied before.\nIn 2023, Hill published another biography, dedicated to humanitarian doctor and fellow Georgia Tech graduate G.B. Espy. Hill met Espy during a public speaking engagement, and the idea of the book was suggested to him by former Tech basketball player Roger Kaiser, an admirer of the doctor's career.\n\n\nSelected filmography\nNote: This Rick Hill is not to be confused with several homonyms, including an Australian actor and a kickboxer who appeared in Bloodfist II for his frequent employer Roger Corman.\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nRick Hill at IMDb\nOfficial website\nRick Hill stats at SRCFB",

Its headquarters are still in Archdale. His intent with SEBRA was to establish a bull riding association to help young athletes get started in the sport.\nWith the strong growth of the PBR, Davis soon stepped down from SEBRA.  He was succeeded as president by Chan Canter.  Within five years, SEBRA had grown from sanctioning 150 events per year to more than 400 events across the United States.\nSEBRA runs and promotes schools and clinics to help bull riders advance to professional event. SEBRA also helps its producers develop stronger shows with higher attendance and a higher caliber of bull riders. PBR riders such as J.B. Mauney, Brian Canter, Billy Robinson, and Josh Faircloth all started in SEBRA events.\nSEBRA also works on increasing its fan base. SEBRA's smallest venues can accommodate 800 fans while other performances can attract crowds of 5,000 people a night. Thousands of fans now follow SEBRA bull riders and events through the SEBRA website and social media. SEBRA provides its bull riders more than $500,000 in cash payouts from their regular events each year. Each year, the top 40 SEBRA bull riders are invited to the SEBRA National Finals to compete for more than $60,000 in cash and awards. SEBRA also sanctions barrel racing at their bull riding events. SEBRA also used to sanction bareback bronc and saddle bronc riding at some of their events. Since 2023, SEBRA also has the Crossfire Division for novice-level bull riders.\n\n\nSeason champions\n\n\nBull Riding\n\nSource:\n\n\nBarrel Racing\n\nSource:\n\n\nCrossfire Division Bull Riding (Novice)\n\n\nSaddle Bronc Riding (Defunct)\n\nSource:\n\n\nBareback Bronc Riding (Defunct)\n\nSource:\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

Modern versions produce up to 110 kN (24,729 lbf) of thrust per engine in vacuum. RL10 versions were produced for the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V and the DCSS of the Delta IV. More versions are in development or in use for the Exploration Upper Stage of the Space Launch System and the Centaur V of the Vulcan rocket.\nThe expander cycle that the engine uses drives the turbopump with waste heat absorbed by the engine combustion chamber, throat, and nozzle. This, combined with the hydrogen fuel, leads to very high specific impulses (Isp) in the range of 373 to 470 s (3.66–4.61 km/s) in a vacuum. Mass ranges from 131 to 317 kg (289–699 lb) depending on the version of the engine.\n\n\nHistory\nThe RL10 was the first liquid hydrogen rocket engine to be built in the United States, with development of the engine by Marshall Space Flight Center and Pratt & Whitney beginning in the 1950s. The RL10 was originally developed as a throttleable engine for the USAF Lunex lunar lander. The engine was electric spark ignited.\n\nThe RL10 was first tested on the ground in 1959, at Pratt & Whitney's Florida Research and Development Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. The first successful flight took place on November 27, 1963. For that launch, two RL10A-3 engines powered the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas launch vehicle. The launch was used to conduct a heavily instrumented performance and structural integrity test of the vehicle.Multiple versions of this engine have been flown. The S-IV of the Saturn I used a cluster of six RL10A-3S, a version which was modified for installation on the Saturn and the Titan program included Centaur D-1T upper stages powered by two RL10A-3-3 Engines.\nFour modified RL10A-5 engines were used in the McDonnell Douglas DC-X.\nA flaw in the brazing of an RL10B-2 combustion chamber was identified as the cause of failure for the 4 May 1999 Delta III launch carrying the Orion-3 communications satellite.\nThe DIRECT version 3.0 proposal to replace Ares I and Ares V with a family of rockets sharing a common core stage recommended the RL10 for the second stage of the J-246 and J-247 launch vehicles.  Up to seven RL10 engines would have been used in the proposed Jupiter Upper Stage, serving an equivalent role to the Space Launch System Exploration Upper Stage.\n\n\nCommon Extensible Cryogenic Engine\n\nIn the early 2000s, NASA contracted with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne to develop\nthe Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE) demonstrator. CECE was intended to lead to RL10 engines capable of deep throttling. In 2007, its operability (with some \"chugging\") was demonstrated at 11:1 throttle ratios. In 2009, NASA reported successfully throttling from 104 percent thrust to eight percent thrust, a record for an expander cycle engine of this type. Chugging was eliminated by injector and propellant feed system modifications that control the pressure, temperature and flow of propellants. In 2010, the throttling range was expanded further to a 17.6:1 ratio, throttling from 104% to 5.9% power.\n\n\nEarly 2010s possible successor\n\nIn 2012 NASA joined with the US Air Force (USAF) to study next-generation upper stage propulsion, formalizing the agencies' joint interests in a new upper stage engine to replace the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10.\n\n\"We know the list price on an RL10.  If you look at cost over time, a very large portion of the unit cost of the EELVs is attributable to the propulsion systems, and the RL10 is a very old engine, and there's a lot of craftwork associated with its manufacture. ... That's what this study will figure out, is it worthwhile to build an RL10 replacement?\" \nFrom the study, NASA hoped to find a less expensive RL10-class engine for the upper stage of the Space Launch System (SLS).\nUSAF hoped to replace the Rocketdyne RL10 engines used on the upper stages of the Lockheed Martin Atlas V and the Boeing Delta IV Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) that were the primary methods of putting US government satellites into space. A related requirements study was conducted at the same time under the Affordable Upper Stage Engine Program (AUSEP).\n\n\nImprovements\nThe RL10 has undergone multiple upgrades over the decades. The RL10B-2, used on the DCSS, incorporated an extendable nozzle made from carbon–carbon, electro-mechanical gimbaling to reduce weight and increase reliability, and achieved a specific impulse of 465.5 seconds (4.565 km/s).\nBeginning in the 2000s, Aerojet Rocketdyne introduced 3D printing (additive manufacturing) into RL10 production. The RL10C-1-1 was the first engine to include a 3D-printed component, featuring a nickel superalloy main injector. Building on that experience, in 2015 the company began developing a more extensive upgrade that employed an additively manufactured copper thrust chamber. According to the company, the new process reduced chamber fabrication time from approximately 20 months to 4–6 months compared with earlier hand-fabricated stainless steel chambers, enabling production of up to one engine per week rather than one per month. This variant, designated RL10C-X during development, entered production as the RL10E-1 and is planned for use on United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket, scheduled for its first flight in 2025.\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nCurrent\nCentaur III: The single engine centaur (SEC) version uses the RL10C-1, while the dual engine centaur (DEC) version retains the smaller RL10A-4-2.  An Atlas V mission (SBIRS-5) marked the first use of the RL10C-1-1 version.  The mission was successful but observed unexpected vibration, and further use of the RL10C-1-1 model is on hold until the problem is better understood. The engine was used again successfully on SBIRS-6.\nCentaur V stage: On May 11, 2018, United Launch Alliance (ULA) announced that the RL10 upper stage engine had been selected for its Vulcan Centaur rocket following a competitive procurement process. Early versions of the Centaur V will use the RL10C-1-1, but later versions will transition to the RL10E in 2025. Vulcan flew its successful maiden flight on January 8, 2024.\nInterim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage: The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage or ICPS is used for the SLS and is similar to the DCSS, except that the engine is an RL10B-2 and it is adapted to fit on top of the 8.4 meter diameter core stage with four RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engines.\n\n\nIn development\nExploration Upper Stage: The Exploration Upper Stage will use four RL10C-3 engines.\n\n\nCancelled\nOmegA Upper Stage: In April 2018, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems announced that two RL10C-5-1 engines would be used on OmegA in the upper stage.  Blue Origin's BE-3U and Airbus Safran's Vinci were also considered before Aerojet Rocketdyne's engine was selected.  OmegA development was halted after it failed to win a National Security Space Launch contract.\nAdvanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage: As of 2009, an enhanced version of the RL10 was proposed to power the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES), a long-duration, low-boiloff extension of existing ULA Centaur and Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) technology for the Vulcan launch vehicle.  Long-duration ACES technology is intended to support geosynchronous, cislunar, and interplanetary missions. Another possible application is as in-space propellant depots in LEO or at L2 that could be used as way-stations for other rockets to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO or interplanetary missions. Cleanup of space debris was also proposed.\n\n\nTable of versions\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nEngines on display\nAn RL10A-1 is on display at the New England Air Museum, Windsor Locks, Connecticut\nAn RL10 is on display at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, Illinois\nAn RL10A-1 is on display at the Cernan Earth and Space Center, River Grove, Illinois\nAn RL10 is on display at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama\nAn RL10 is on display at Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana\nTwo RL10 engines are on display at US Space Walk of Fame, Titusville, Florida\nAn RL10 is on display at the Cox Science Center and Aquarium, West Palm Beach, Florida.\nAn RL10 is on display in the Aerospace Engineering Department, Davis Hall at Auburn University.\nAn RL10A-4 is on display at the Science Museum in London, UK.\nAn RL10 is on display at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, NC\nAn RL10 is on display at the San Diego Air & Space Museum in San Diego, CA.\nAn RL10B-2 is on display outside the Discovery Cube Orange County in Santa Ana, CA.\n\n\nSee also\nSpacecraft propulsion\nRL60\nMARC-60\nRD-0146\nXCOR/ULA aluminum alloy nozzle engine, under development in 2011\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nConnors, Jack (2010).

    "text": "Lucie Marie Ludovika Anastasia Adelheid Karola Hedwig Reventlow (1884–1984) was a German-born Danish philanthropist who is remembered for supporting the scout movement in Denmark. In particular, she adapted her home, Brahetrolleborg Manor on the island of Funen, as a scouting school. In addition, she created a housekeeping school on the premises. After spending the Second World War in England, where she served in the Air Raid Precautions, she returned to Brahetrolleborg, upholding its historical traditions until she died, almost 100 years old.\n\n\nBiography\nBorn on 24 October 1884 in Züllichau, Germany (now Sulechów, Poland), Lucie Marie Ludovika Anastasia Adelheid Karola Hedwig Reventlow was the daughter of Count Eberhard Carl Paul Erdmann Emanuel Haugwitz Hardenberg Reventlow (1850–1931) and Catinka Elisabeth Maximiliane Georgine von Pappenheim (1859–1906). She was raised in an aristocratic family by a father who was an officer in the German army with connections in Italy and Denmark. In 1909, she married Lensgreve Christian Einar Reventlow, one of Denmark's largest landowners with his Brahetrolleborg estate in southern Funen. It was his second marriage. Together they had two daughters and also a son, Christian, who died at the age of 16.\nAfter the end of the First World War, Lucie Marie Reventlow helped to care for the unfortunate Viennese children who came to Denmark after suffering from the breakup of Austria-Hungary. She also cared for her father who had come to Denmark in 1919 after losing his German estate together with his younger daughter, her sister Naka Haugwitz (1887–1948), who unlike her mother had recovered from tuberculosis when she was 18.\nThanks to her sister's involvement, Reventlow participated in the Danish Girl Guides (Det Danske Pigespejderkorps), becoming head of the board from 1921 to 1933. In 1922, in collaboration with Elisabeth Flagstad ( (1894–1938), she helped to establish the Danish scouting school (Spejderskolen) at Brahetrolleborg, renovating the foresters' quarters and providing suitable furniture to house 24 students. The premises were also used as a housekeeping school which proved so popular that it had to move into larger premises at the nearby village of Korinth. Thanks to Reventlow's support, the Brahetrolleborg-Korinth facility functioned as the focus of girl scouting activities in Denmark until 1988 when it became an \"efterskole\" with an emphasis on scouting.\nDespite the financial difficulties which resulted following her husband's death in 1929, Reventlow continued to maintain Brahetrolleborg after selling off other properties. She also assisted with the conversion of the Pederstrup estate on Lolland into the Reventlow Museum in memory of the statesman Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow (1748–1827).\nDuring the Second World War, Reventlow went to England, where in 1940 she married the British officer Bertram James Walker. She served in the Air Raid Precautions, receiving a medal for her support. After Walker died in 1947, she returned to Denmark, where she lived in Brahetrolleborg Manor for the rest of her life, upholding local traditions dating back to the 18th century.\nLucie Marie Reventlow died in Fåborg on 20 April 1984, almost 100 years old. She is buried in Theofili Skov near Vesterborg, Lolland.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos,  (10 September 1823 – 26 March 1889), styled Earl Temple until 1839 and Marquess of Chandos from 1839 to 1861, was a British soldier, politician and administrator of the 19th century. He was a close friend and subordinate of Benjamin Disraeli and served as the secretary of state for the colonies from 1867 to 1868 and governor of Madras from 1875 to 1880.\nBuckingham was the only son of Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He joined the British Army, eventually rising to become a colonel. Buckingham entered politics, as Lord Chandos, in 1846 when he was elected unopposed from Buckinghamshire as a candidate of the Conservative Party. Buckingham served as a member of Parliament from 1846 to 1857, when he resigned. He contested a re-election in 1859, but lost. Buckingham served in various political offices during his tenure.\nIn March 1867, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies and served until December 1868. He also served as governor of Madras from 1875 to 1880. As governor, he handled the relief measures for the victims of the Great Famine of 1876–1878. Buckingham also served as Lord of the Treasury, Keeper of the Privy Seal of the Prince of Wales, Deputy Warden of the Stannaries, Deputy Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Chairman of the London and North-Western Railway, member of the Imperial Privy Council, Lord President of the Council and chairman of the committees in the House of Lords. He died in 1889 at the age of 65.\n\n\nBackground and education\nBuckingham was the second child and only son of Richard, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and his wife Lady Mary, younger daughter of John Campbell, 4th Earl of Breadalbane and Holland (later the 1st Marquess of Breadalbane). His sister, Lady Anna Eliza Mary Gore-Langton, was a women's rights campaigner. As his father's son and heir apparent, he was styled Earl Temple from birth. He was 15 years of age when his paternal grandfather died and his father became the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. From this time, he was styled Marquess of Chandos until he succeeded his father as Duke.\nUpon his father's death in 1861, his titles were Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, Marquess of Chandos, and Earl Temple of Stowe in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; Marquess of Buckingham, Earl Temple, Viscount and Baron Cobham in the Peerage of Great Britain; and Earl Nugent in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1868, he was also recognised by the House of Lords as Lord Kinloss in the Peerage of Scotland. He inherited 10,500 acres, mostly in Buckingham.\nThe young Lord Temple, later Lord Chandos, attended Eton until 1841 and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford, from which he later received an honorary degree of D.C.L. Two years after graduation, Lord Chandos (as he then was) was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and he would eventually become Honorary Colonel of that regiment. He was also Hon. Colonel of the 1st Administrative Battalion, Middlesex Artillery Volunteers and later of the City of London Artillery.\n\n\nEarly career\n\nIn 1846, Buckingham, as the Marquess of Chandos, entered Parliament as Conservative MP for Buckinghamshire, and remained as an unopposed MP until 1857. The young Lord Chandos was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Oxfordshire on 3 February 1846, Hampshire on 17 February, and Northamptonshire on 29 May.\nIn 1852, he entered Lord Derby's administration as a Lord of the Treasury, a position he held for exactly ten months. That year, he was also appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal of the Prince of Wales, Deputy Warden of the Stannaries, deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, and chairman of the London and North-Western Railway. In 1857, he resigned as MP for Buckinghamshire and did not stand for re-election. In 1861, he succeeded his father as Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (and in various other titles across four Peerages) and took his seat in the House of Lords. In the 1860s he was chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company.\nBuckingham's political career was stagnant until 1866, when he was appointed to the Privy Council and became Lord Derby's Lord President of the Council. He served as Lord President of the Council until 8 March 1867, when he succeeded Lord Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\n\nAs Secretary of State for the Colonies\nBuckingham was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies when Lord Carnarvon resigned in March 1867 over the Reform Bill and served from 8 March 1867 to 1 December 1868. During this period, he was also appointed Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. As Secretary of State for the Colonies. Buckingham had to deal with the British North America Act. He also attracted controversy over his dispute with Bishop Colenso of Natal. Buckingham's tenure ended in December 1868 when the Conservative Party ministry of Benjamin Disraeli resigned. He was succeeded as Colonial Secretary by Lord Granville.\nOn 21 July 1868, the House of Lords recognised him as the 10th Lord Kinloss in the Peerage of Scotland, which had been dormant since the death of the 6th Lord Kinloss, his three-times great-grandfather Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin, in 1747. Through the House of Lords ruling, Buckingham's father was recognised posthumously as de jure 9th Lord Kinloss, his maternal grandmother Lady Anna Brydges as de jure 8th Lady Kinloss, and his great-grandfather James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos as de jure 7th Lord Kinloss. Though the lordship was the most minor of Buckingham's many titles, it was the only one that could be inherited by his daughters, and he established his right to it at a time when the likelihood emerged that he would leave no male heir.\n\n\nGovernor of Madras\n\nWhen the Conservative Party was re-elected to power in the United Kingdom in 1874 and Disraeli became the Prime Minister once again, Buckingham was appointed Governor of the Madras Presidency, British India. Buckingham moved to Madras and took his seat on 23 November 1875.\nBuckingham served as the governor of Madras from 1875 to 1880. His tenure was plagued by deteriorating socio-economic and health conditions. In 1876, the Great Famine of 1876–78 broke out in Madras Presidency. By August 1877, the famine had spread all over the Presidency and over 18 million people were affected. To make matters worse, the rains failed in parts of Madras and Mysore. Large quantities of grain were shipped from Bengal to Madras port, and through his efforts, famine relief was distributed to 839,000 people in the Madras districts, besides 160,000 in the Bombay Districts and 151,000 in the Mysore districts.\nThe Governor appealed to the principal cities of England, Scotland, Ireland and India for assistance. At Buckingham's suggestion, the Lord Mayor of London collected relief funds of up to £475,000 in 1877 (£56.5 million as of 2023). Though the famine eventually came to an end in 1878, the issue had far-reaching effects.\nAs a part of the famine relief work, Buckingham had commenced the construction of a navigation channel between Madras city and the northern part of the Madras Presidency so that transportation of supplies to the interior in cases of emergency would be easy. More than 715,000 people were employed as labourers in Madras to assist with the relief work. Opened in 1878, this canal was named after Buckingham as the Buckingham Canal. Buckingham Street in Penang, Malaysia was also named after him by the Tamil labourers who were brought there during the British colonial period.\nDispleasure of the tribes of the northern part of the Presidency over the stringent taxation schemes of the British government erupted in the form of a major rebellion in 1879. The rebellion was eventually suppressed through a joint operation of the Madras police and army and the Hyderabad army, and the captured prisoners were sent to the Andamans. Many of the stringent taxation laws were repealed.\nOn 30 August 1880, William Patrick Adam was appointed Governor of Madras and he succeeded Buckingham in December 1880.\n\n\nLater life and death\n\nIn May 1886, Buckingham succeeded Lord Redesdale as Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords. He made few speeches in the House of Lords and succeeded in paying off most of his father's debts. Gradually, towards the later part of his life, his financial situation improved. By 1883, he owned 10,482 acres (4,242 ha) of land with a total value of £18,080.\nBuckingham died in March 1889, aged 65, from diabetes at Chandos House, London. His illness was unexpected and not originally thought to be serious; the House of Lords postponed voting on several bills until he recovered. Within a week, however, his illness proved fatal, despite the efforts of Dr. Henry Walter Kiallmark, the family physician, and Sir James Paget, who was called in to assist.\nThe duke was buried at the family vault in the church at Wotton House, Buckinghamshire.\nWith no male issue, the dukedom and marquessate of Buckingham and Chandos and the Earldom of Temple became extinct. Several of his other titles survived due to available heirs: his nephew William Gore-Langton succeeded him in 1892 as fourth Earl Temple of Stowe, which was created with a special remainder; his eldest daughter, Lady Mary, succeeded him in the Scottish lordship of Kinloss, which can be held by females, as Lady Kinloss; and his distant relative Charles Lyttelton succeeded him as eighth Viscount Cobham.\n\n\nFamily\nBuckingham married firstly Caroline Harvey, daughter of Robert Harvey of Langley Park, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, and sister of Sir Robert Harvey, 1st Baronet of Langley Park, in 1851. They had three daughters:\n\nMary Morgan-Grenville, 11th Lady Kinloss (1852–1944)\nLady Anne (1853–1890)\nLady Caroline Jemima Elizabeth (1858–1946)\nCaroline, Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos, died in February 1874.\nBuckingham married, secondly, Alice Graham-Montgomery, daughter of Sir Graham Graham-Montgomery, 3rd Baronet, in 1885. Born in 1848, she was 25 years younger than he. In 1897, she was one of the guests at the Duchess of Devonshire's Diamond Jubilee Costume Ball. There were no children from this marriage. Widowed in 1889, Alice, Dowager Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos, married the 1st Earl Egerton in 1894.

This series focused on two different sororities in a fictional high school in Arizona. Palm Canyon may be located somewhere around Tucson because some characters imported dates from that area. This series was written with a humorous tone.\n\n\nPlot summary\nAt Palm Canyon High School, located in fictional Palm Canyon, Arizona, most girls aspired to be members of Chi Kappa, the most prestigious sorority at the school. One of their many rules was that they kept membership strictly at ten members.\nA girl named Elissa Hanes wanted to join, as did her friend Kim Adler. Kim and a newcomer were accepted, but Elissa wasn't. However, Kim got disgusted with the sorority's scheming tactics and quit the group in public.\nElissa and Kim eventually created their own sorority, The Pack. They set a limit of ten members and invited any girl who was interested to join. The 10-member limit often used by Chi Kappa would help legitimize the Pack as a solid group.\nTracy McVane, another former Chi Kappa member and friend of Elissa's, joined the Pack after being offended by Chi Kappa's unethical behavior. Some of the other Chi Kappa members, such as Melanie Deborah Kane and Daisy Baron, were also allies of the Pack despite their membership in the more established Chi Kappa. The officers were de facto until the next year.\nMany of the stories, covering two of the eight books in the series, focused on the students' lives and the rivalry between the two sororities: the established Chi Kappa and the up-and-coming Pack. The characters narrated the stories. Most narrators came from the Pack with five narrators, while Chi Kappa had three.\n\n\nTitles\nThere are eight books in the Sorority Sisters series.\n\n\nReception\nPublishers Weekly reviewed the first book in the series: \"Although not as funny as Sheila Greenwald's Rosy Cole books, which are aimed at the same audience, this attractively designed, easy-to-read title will undoubtedly garner its own fans\".\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Soulcalibur Legends (ソウルキャリバー レジェンズ, Sōrukyaribā Rejenzu) is a 2007 action-adventure game developed by Project Soul and published by Namco Bandai Games for the Wii. It is a spin-off of the Soulcalibur fighting game series.\nThe game features seven playable characters, most prominently Siegfried and Ivy; it is set in-between the first two installments in the series, Soul Edge (1996) and Soulcalibur (1998), and follows Siegried's journey as he seeks the true power of the legendary sword Soul Edge.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game features competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes in addition to the single player story mode.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\n\nPlot\nThe story of Soulcalibur Legends takes place between Soul Edge and Soulcalibur, and is based around Siegfried Schtauffen's transformation into Nightmare. The game begins as Siegfried finds Soul Edge on a ship. He battles Cervantes on the deck of the ship. Later, Siegfried is tasked by the Masked Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to find the remaining pieces of Soul Edge in order to use it to win the war against Barbaros of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\nCharacters\n\nThe game features seven playable characters: Siegfried, Ivy, Sophitia, Mitsurugi, Astaroth α (a prototype for the character in other games), Taki and Lloyd Irving, who is a guest character from Tales of Symphonia.\nSeries staples Nightmare and Cervantes make an appearance in the game as non-playable bosses. Assassins, Berserkers and Lizardmen from Soulcalibur II also appear in the game as generic enemies.\n\nSultan Barbaros (voiced by Kenji Nomura) - Barbaros originally appears to be the main villain in Soulcalibur Legends. He was once the leader of a band of thieves when his band discovered Soulcalibur in the home of a general. Barbara, part of the same gang stated that Barbaros changed personality-wise when he claimed Soulcalibur. The spirit sword bestowed Barbaros with immense power, causing him to grow into a giant and allowed him to conquer the Ottoman Empire where he crowned himself sultan. He fought against the Holy Roman Empire, leading an army of Evils (monsters) to lay siege to the city of Vienna. The Masked Emperor enlisted the help of Siegfried to regain the shards of Soul Edge and combat Barbaros since Soul Edge was the only weapon that could stand up to Barbaros and Soulcalibur. After recovering all the shards Siegfried battled Barbaros and defeated him, causing Soulcalibur to emerge from his forehead.\nFafnir - After the Evil Seed event, Fafnir the dragon is a Guardian who appears as a boss character in the game. Fafnir was the first dragon and that all the myths about dragons all over the world were inspired by him. He was slain by the hero Sigmund (whom Siegfried is named after) who slew the dragon using his sword Requiem. According to the legend, Sigmund asked his friend to reforge his broken sword, Gram, who gave his life for the sword. In his grief, Sigmund renamed the sword Requiem in honor of his friend and after defeating Fafnir he placed Requiem in an altar in the ancient Cathedral where Fafnir roosted. In the 16th century Fafnir is one of the Guardians that holds a shard of Soul Edge. The heroes need to enlist the aid of a scientist named Leonardo who claimed to have invented a weapon that could kill a dragon, which were needed because Fafnir could not be fought while in the air by conventional means. With these weapons Siegfried and Ivy are able to slay Fafnir and recover the shard. Later on Fafnir and the other guardians are revived by Soulcalibur but are slain once again by Siegfried.\nIlona Farkas (voiced by Atsuko Tanaka) - Iska Farkas' sister who got taken by Barbaros. Iska is always mumbling about Ilona and how he regrets not saving her. When Barbaros attacked Hungary, Iska fled but forgot Ilona. The Masked Emperor was made to look like her, revealed at the end of Soulcalibur Legends. Before his death, Iska starts to say something to her, but it is cut off. Their graves are shown at the credits, showing that Ilona did die or at least had a headstone dedicated to her.\nIska Farkas (voiced by Romi Park) - He is one of the key characters in the game. Despite being initially presented as an ally, he is eventually revealed to be the main antagonist, having manipulated the characters into retrieving Soul Edge and Soul Calibur for his use. He is a refugee and Hungarian prince who serves as a court jester for a Masked Emperor. Iska has heterochromia with one blue eye and one red eye. His belts also correspond to this trait. He was born in Buda who lived with his sister Ilona until the usurper sultan, Barbaros, attacked the city and destroyed it, though his sister allowed him to escape with his life by sacrificing herself. Iska then went around the world looking for shelter, but all those that took him in eventually betrayed and used him, and then he studied under the famous alchemist Paracelsus who taught him much at Basel, until Iska disappeared, stealing Paracelsus's notes on the creation of false humans and was said to have made at least one successful artificial human. He thought up a crazed scheme to take over the world using the swords Soul Calibur and Soul Edge, to gain power for his lost sister. He used Paracelsus's notes to create a homunculus, made to look in the form of his sister. She managed to become the Masked Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He faked a story of being brought in by the \"Masked Emperor\" and becomes her court jester. His scheme comes into effect, as his homunculus has Siegfried and several other companions reluctantly agree to help the Holy Roman Empire against Barbaros of the Ottoman Empire (who wields Soul Calibur) by strengthening Soul Edge, which Siegfried wields. Iska is very persuasive in keeping his comrades to uphold their agreements and constantly reminisces about missing his sister and his home, lamenting his weakness, and wishes that he had strength and power which he did not have then to survive the pains of his life. After Soul Edge regains power and Siegfried kills Barbaros, claiming Soul Calibur, the \"Masked Emperor\" claims Soul Edge and tries to attack Siegfried and claim Soul Edge for Iska. However, a new version of the Evil Seed comes from Soul Calibur as the two swords clash, knocking Siegfried far away. Siegfried ends up sealing Soul Edge's power after realizing that he killed his own father at the peak of the Himalayas, however keeps it. He also gets Requiem here. The group storms Vienna to defeat the Emperor, and after Siegfried does, he plants Soul Edge into the ground alongside Soul Calibur. Iska then claims them (restoring Soul Edge's power using Soul Calibur), revealing his scheme to Siegfried. He then attempts to kill Siegfried, but Siegfried instead wins and Iska dies. During the credits there are two graves that say Iska Farkas and Ilona Farkas. Siegfried keeps Soul Edge, eventually succumbing to the Evil Seed and becoming Nightmare.\nAmmon - He is a Guardian and boss character in the game. Once a powerful pharaoh, Tutoankuamen (shortened to Ammon) of the Old Kingdom of Egypt ruled with queen Ankhesenamen in his temple named the Temple of Ammon. One day, the queen fell ill from a disease from which Ammon's most experienced doctors and healers could not treat and she died soon after. He became so distraught after she died that he sought the Soul Edge hearing of its properties to try and revive her. Once acquiring it, he studied it to see if he could use its power to but no avail. After a long period of having devoted himself to researching it, he began to grow weaker with each day due to its influence until he himself died. Sometime afterwards, a shard of sword that been had already been in the hands of the Cervantes and then destroyed by the Sophitia made its way into the depths of his temple where he was entombed due to their prior association. Over time his guards stationed inside would slowly become corrupted with Ammon himself being revived and twisted by its power to act as Guardians.\nGeki (voiced by Naomi Kusumi) is a boss character. He is the counterpart of Maki, and during Geki's second and third battles, he fights alongside her. After coming in contact with a shard of Soul Edge, he and Maki became Malfested Guardians. He's appeared in Soulcalibur VI though under a different role.\nMaki (voiced by Yukie Maeda) is a boss character. She is the counterpart of Geki, and she fights alongside him during his second and third battles. After coming in contact with a shard of Soul Edge, she and Geki became Malfested Guardians. She's also appeared in Soulcalibur VI though under a different role.\n\n\nMarketing and release\nSoulcalibur Legends was released on November 20, 2007 in North America, and was released in Japan on December 13, 2007.\nOn January 11, 2008, it was announced that Ubisoft had signed an agreement with Namco Bandai Games to distribute the game and Soulcalibur IV in PAL-region territories, including Europe and Australia. The game eventually saw a release in these territories on August 28, 2008.\nA manga adaptation was published during the first year of the Japanese publication Kerokero Ace. The adaptation featured Siegfried, Iska and Ivy joining together on the main quest of the game. The adaptation's style was mostly comedic, including frequent 4-komas with running gags (such as Siegfried's annoyance that Ivy towered over him).\n\n\nReception\n\nReviews for Soulcalibur Legends have been mixed. Metacritic lists the aggregate score for Soulcalibur Legends at 52/100. It scored far lower than the main series games and is the lowest selling of the series.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website Archived February 1, 2012, at the Wayback Machine (in Japanese)",

    "text": "HMS Thrasher was launched in 1804 at Brightlingsea, or Colchester as the merchant vessel Adamant. The British Royal Navy purchased her in June 1804, renamed her, and fitted her out as a gunbrig. She captured numerous small merchant vessels, most of them Dutch or Danish. After the Navy sold her in 1814, she returned to mercantile service under her original name of Adamant. She made a voyage to Malta in 1815 and was wrecked as she was returning to London.\n\n\nMerchantman\nAdamant first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1804.\n\nWarren had owned an earlier Adamant, with Spalton, master, but had sold her in August 1803 to the Royal Navy, which had fitted her out and commissioned her as the sloop HMS Bonetta.\n\n\nRoyal Navy\nThe Navy purchased the Adamant of this article in June 1804. She underwent fitting by Thompson, on the Thames, between June and 7 July, and then at Deptford Dockyard until 5 September. In July Lieutenant William Chester commissioned Thrasher for the Downs.\nLieutenant Samuel Knight took command in March 1805.\nIn 1806 Thrasher was temporarily reclassified as a fireship under the command of Lieutenant John Forfar. Lieutenant Josiah Dornford replaced Forfar on 28 July 1807. From August 1807 Thrasher served in the Downs and off the Texel.\nIn July 1807 Thrasher detained and sent into the Downs Providentia, Richeljen, master, from Bordeaux to Tonningen, and Gute Hensight, Cooke, master, from Bordeaux to Copenhagen. Both vessels were Danish.\nOn 22 December 1808, Thrasher brought into Ramsgate Rose in June, George master. Thatcher had found Rose in June near Dungeness, dismasted. She had been sailing from Cork before her crew abandoned her.\nOn 26 March 1809 Thrasher sailed from Dungeness early in the morning and sailed towards Boulogne. As she approached the coast she saw some 40 French vessels, including six brigs and two schooners. Thrasher sailed along the flotilla from 7am to 2pm, engaging it from both broadsides. The French ships blocked the shore batteries from firing on Thrasher. Thrasher sank three vessels, drove six ashore, and forced several to return to port.\nIn August–September 1809 Thrasher took part in the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign.\nThrasher, Lieutenant Dornford, captured Noitgedejt on 15 May 1810.\nOn 4 July 1810 Thrasher and Bruiser captured Twe  Gebroders.\nOn 24 August Thrasher and Bruiser captured Revanche, a lugger boat privateer.\nOn 8 September Thrasher captured Drie Gesuisters, Gute Hoffnung, and Frau Catharina.\nThrasher and Bruiser were in company and shared in the prize money for the captures  on 21 April 1811 of Frau  Anna, Jonge Andreas, Junge Catharina, Fran Maria, and Frau  Gretje.\nOn 19 August Thrasher captured Secfrau.\nThrasher, Pincher, and Parthian were in company on 22 and 25 October 1811 when they captured To Wenner, Esperance, and Jeune Remmer. A Danish vessel that was a prize to the three British ships stranded on Sandy Island. It was expected that part of her cargo of pitch, tar, oil, and fish would be saved.\nOn 24 September 1812, Thrasher captured Jonge Cornelius.\nThrasher and Redbreast were in company on 1 November at the capture of Mercurius, Pusche, master. Mercurius arrived at Yarmouth on 11 November.\nOn 3 March 1813, Thrasher Lieutenant Dornford, and Blazer captured the American schooner Sea Nymph. Nymph, had been sailing from New York to Amsterdam. Her captors brought Nymph into Heligoland. A violent gale on 7 March drove Nymph on to Sandy Island, wrecking her. However, most of the cargo was saved.\nThen on 10 July Thrasher was part of a squadron that captured eight small vessels in the Elbe and Weser. The squadron included Desiree, Calliope, Shamrock, Brev Drageren, the hired armed cutter Princess Augusta, and gunboats.\nOn 27 or 28 October Thrasher, under Lieutenant Dornford, was in company with Calliope. The shared in the proceeds of the capture on that day of Frou Margaretha (or Frau Margaretha).\nOn 14 November Thrasher captured Anna.\nAt some point in 1813 Thrasher brought over to England the officer charged with the important intelligence of the French having been driven across the Rhine. On another occasion, Thrasher brought the Russian General Tchaplitz, to whom had been entrusted the keys of Hamburg.\nDornford left Thrasher on 14 July 1814.\nDisposal: The \"Principal Offices  and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\" offered the \"Thrasher gun-brig, of 150 tons\", lying at Chatham, for sale on 3 November 1814. She sold on that day for £970.\n\n\nMerchantman again\nThe purchasers of Thrasher returned her to the name Adamant. Although she re-entered Lloyd's Register, neither Lloyd's Register, nor the Register of Shipping, recorded the transition. Still, accounts of her wrecking in 1815 make the transition clear (see below).\n\nOn 14 May 1815, Adamant, Woodcock, master, sailed from Gravesend for Malta. She arrived at Malta on 24 June, having come via Falmouth.\n\n\nFate\nOn 3 December 1815 Adamant, Woodcock, master, was driven ashore near Seaford, Sussex. She was refloated and made for Newhaven, Sussex but subsequently was wrecked. Her crew were rescued. Adamant was on a voyage from Malta to London. A week later Lloyd's List reported that Adamant had gone to pieces, but that some of her cargo and part of the materials had been saved.\nLater in December 1815, the Morning Post wrote: \"The Adamant, from Malta, which was lately wrecked off Newhaven, in Sussex, was originally a King's ship, called the Thrasher gun-brig, and copper-bottomed. The cargo and vessel was besieged by the inhabitants for miles round the country, who considered them fair game for plunder.\" The story went on to explain that the underwriters from Lloyd's Coffee House, valuing vessel and cargo at perhaps £100,000, engaged two officers from the Bow Street Office, to try to recover some of the cargo and to arrest the ringleaders. The officers received the cooperation of local Custom's officials. They searched some 200 houses and found plunder in many, including sacks of copper sheathing from Adamant; they also arrested some individuals. Many inhabitants were astonished at the idea that they had done anything wrong, \"considering it an undisputed and ancient right for the inhabitants near a spot where a wreck takes place, to take whatever of the vessel and cargo they could take from the sea.\"\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\nBohn, Henry George (1852).

    "text": "Gasteria excelsa, or thicket gasteria, is a succulent plant native to the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.\n\n\nDescription\n\n \n\nIt is one of the largest of the Gasteria species, second only to Gasteria acinacifolia in height. It has smoother, thicker, wider, darker leaves than its relative, and forms solitary, robust rosettes of stiff, sharp, triangular leaves.\nIt can be distinguished from its closest relatives by the unusually sharp, heavily serrated, white margins on their leaves. The leaves are a distinctive mottled, dark green colour, with a smooth surface (though juvenile plants' leaves are rough). \nThe leaves of fully grown plants are often channeled on the upper side, with sharp edges, and (like its relatives) a keel on their lower side.\nThe erectly branched inflorescence is often over a meter in height, with pink-green flowers and appears between November and February. The specific epithet, excelsa, means \"lofty\" or \"high\" in Latin. It refers both to the great height of the plant's inflorescence, as well as to the high cliff-face habitat of this species.\nThey are popular as ornamental plants for containers, but have a very large root system.\n\n\nDistribution\nThis species is indigenous to the Eastern Cape, South Africa, where it is widely distributed in the thicket vegetation of the Transkei - both inland and near to the rocky coast. It occurs from Grahamstown in the west to as far north as Cala. \nIts favoured habitat is dense shady thicket, rocky south-facing sheer cliffs and slopes. It has been recorded at 1500 meters in the southern Drakensberg mountains, at a greater elevation than any other Gasteria species.\n\n\nCultivars and forms\nThis is a variable species, with many forms and varieties. Like most Gasteria species, it also grades into related species, sometimes with a smooth range of intermediates. A few forms have become popular in cultivation:\n\n'Cala' (named after the locality for the northernmost range of this species) has robust, short, compact leaves with wrinkled margins\n'Gaika' (from Stutterheim) has paler, striped leaves\n'Nquancule' has long sharp scimitar shaped leaves, not unlike Gasteria acinacifolia.\nIn the north along the Mzimvubu river, a transitional form, between Gasteria excelsa and its northern neighbour Gasteria croucheri, is now considered to be a separate transitional species, Gasteria loedolffiae, with some features of both G. excelsa and G. croucheri.\nPhysically it resembles G. croucheri (although with a more dull matt green colour and young plants are more asperulous than tubercled) while its flowers more closely resemble those of G. excelsa.\n\n\nReferences",

The club was founded in 1923 but ceased to exist in 2020 after going bankrupt. A few days after the bankruptcy, the club announced that rather than dissolving entirely, it would merge with KSV Temse to form Lokeren-Temse, starting in the Belgian Second Amateur Division (fourth level).\nLokeren first reached the first division in 1974–75. Since then, it had a short spell in the Second Division between 1993–94 and 1995–96. Lokeren had its most successful period in the 1980s, achieving second place in the league in 1980–81 as well as a Belgian Cup final the same year. Its best European result was reaching the quarter-final of the 1980–81 UEFA Cup. In the year 2000, the club merged with K Sint-Niklase SKE. They were registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association with the matricule number 282. Lokeren's colours were white, black and yellow. They played their home games at the Daknamstadion.\nIn 2012, Sporting Lokeren won the Belgian Cup, the club's first-ever honours, after beating KV Kortrijk in the Cup Final. They won their second Cup just two years later, after beating Zulte Waregem 1–0.\n\n\nHistory\nThe matricule No. 282 was given in 1920 to a club named Football Club Racing Club Lokeren (nicknamed Racing FC), but the team stopped its activity the next year. On 22 January 1923 Racing Club Lokeren was founded.  Between 1945 and 1951, it had a slight name change (to Racing Athletiek- en Football Club Lokeren) and the new name since 1951 was Koninklijke Racing Club Lokeren. Due to financial problems, the fusion with the other team from the town (Koninklijke Standaard FC Lokeren) became necessary in 1970. The new club was then named Koninklijke Sporting Club Lokeren.\nIn 2000, the club merged with Koninklijke Sint-Niklaas SKE to form Sporting Lokeren Sint-Niklaas Waasland. The latest name change occurred in 2003, with the province name added to the club name.\nIn 2018, Sporting Lokeren were relegated to the First Division B, the second tier of Belgian football. In 2019, the club was taken over by a group led by Louis de Vries and Alexander Janssen, taking the positions of president and CEO respectively.\nOn 20 April 2020, the club was declared bankrupt during the 2019–20 season. Lokeren had outstanding debts of €5 million and was not able to pay its staff and players anymore.\nOn 22 April 2020, Lokeren agreed to merge with KSV Temse to form a new club in K.S.C. Lokeren-Temse and to start in the Second Amateur Division, the national fourth level.\n\n\nHonours\nBelgian First Division:\nRunners-up (1): 1980–81\nBelgian Second Division:\nWinners (1): 1995–96\nBelgian Cup:\nWinners (2): 2011–12, 2013–14\nRunners-up (1): 1980–81\nBelgian Super Cup:\nRunners-up (2): 2012, 2014\n\n\nEuropean record\n\n\nFinal squad\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

The club was founded in 1923 but ceased to exist in 2020 after going bankrupt. A few days after the bankruptcy, the club announced that rather than dissolving entirely, it would merge with KSV Temse to form Lokeren-Temse, starting in the Belgian Second Amateur Division (fourth level).\nLokeren first reached the first division in 1974–75. Since then, it had a short spell in the Second Division between 1993–94 and 1995–96. Lokeren had its most successful period in the 1980s, achieving second place in the league in 1980–81 as well as a Belgian Cup final the same year. Its best European result was reaching the quarter-final of the 1980–81 UEFA Cup. In the year 2000, the club merged with K Sint-Niklase SKE. They were registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association with the matricule number 282. Lokeren's colours were white, black and yellow. They played their home games at the Daknamstadion.\nIn 2012, Sporting Lokeren won the Belgian Cup, the club's first-ever honours, after beating KV Kortrijk in the Cup Final. They won their second Cup just two years later, after beating Zulte Waregem 1–0.",

It was the first one that year to originate in Melbourne.\nIt was a play by Australian actor and author Allan Trevor and was produced in Melbourne. Trevor called the play \"a study in motives — the motives that make people accept what is not right to achieve their own ends.\" He said the plot was \"based very loosely on the case history of one of the numerous generals 'bowlerhatted' for no apparent reason during World War II.\" Trevor added that \"It has as a leading character a 62 year old man still vital enough to dominate a television play. Dramatic events do not all happen to the young, clean cut chaps with wavy hair who turn up so often.\"\nIt was the Australian TV debut of Raymond Westwell. He had only acted once before in Australia, in a stage production of Ross, but worked as a director of theatre, notably Camelot. He said he accepted the role \"because he was getting a bit rusty as far as acting was concerned. This will help keep me fresh and flexible.\" His wife Joan MacArthur had a role playing the wife of Westwell's character.\n\n\nReception\nThe TV critic for The Sydney Morning Herald thought that despite \"a liberal sprinkling of cliches and a pattern of stilted patches in its dialogue\" the play \"maintained a high degree of tension... Two major merits distinguished it. One was the originality of its theme, and the other a consistently capable standard of acting.\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Angry General at IMDb",

    "text": "Anna Dodsworth (née Barrell; c. 1740–1801) was a British Romantic poet who has enjoyed increased attention in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\n\nLife\nAnna Barrell's mother died when she was young and she was educated by her father, Francis Barrell. She began writing when she was seventeen, when she wrote an elegy to her brother. Shortly thereafter she married Frank Dodsworth, vicar, of Dodington Kent. The marriage lasted forty-three years, until her death in 1801. There is no record of any children.\nDodsworth produced \"both occasional poems for her friends and family and wry social commentary in rhymed metrical verse.\" Her only published collection, Fugitive Pieces, was edited and printed posthumously by her husband \"in a very limited number\" for private distribution. According to the unsigned preface,\n\nTHE writer of the following PIECES was desirous that they should be printed by subscription after her decease, and that the profits thence arising should be given to an hospital. But\nupon examination, the subjects appeared not likely to engage the attention of the publick, and the POEMS themselves seemed in too unfinished a state to brave criticism. They are withholden therefore from the world in general, under a persuasion that so would the Author herself have acted, had she lived to hear the sentiments of those, whom she requested, during her last illness, to revise them. A few copies only have come from the press, in order to be distributed among her select friends. They felt an interest in them when they were written, and will not, it is hoped, peruse them with indifference now. To these, the friends of former happy days, friends, who long knew the deceased, and knowing, loved her, the Editor presents a memorial of one, to whose virtues he was indebted for three and forty years of uninterrupted felicity.\nDodsworth's poems have since been anthologized in Women romantic poets: 1785-1832 (1992), British women poets of the 19th century (1996), and British Satire, 1785-1840 (2003).\n\n\nWorks\nFugitive Pieces.

At the time of the poet's birth, his father, Jean-Baptiste Samain, and his mother, Elisa-Henriette Mouquet, conducted a business in \"wines and spirits\" at 75 rue de Paris. Samain's father died when he was quite young; it was necessary for him to leave school and seek a trade. He moved to Paris in around 1880, where his poetry won him a following and he began mixing with avant-garde literary society, and began publicly reciting his poems at Le Chat Noir.  His poems were strongly influenced by those of Baudelaire, and began to strike a somewhat morbid and elegiac tone.  He also was influenced by Verlaine; his works disclose a taste for indecisive, vague imagery.  Samain helped found the Mercure de France, and also worked on the Revue des Deux Mondes.\nSamain published three volumes of verse: Au Jardin de l'Infante (1893), which made him famous; Aux flancs du vase (1898) and Le Chariot d'or (1901). His poetic drama Polyphème was set to music by Jean Cras. Samain died of tuberculosis.\n\n\nMusical settings\nMany composers set Samain's poetry to music, including Lili Boulanger, Nadia Boulanger, Alfredo Casella, Édouard Devernay, George Enescu, Gabriel Fauré, Swan Hennessy, Charles Koechlin, Jacques Leguerney, Adela Maddison, Georges Migot, Paul Paray, Ottorino Respighi, Adrien Rougier, Camille Saint-Saëns, Alice Sauvrezis, Marcelle Soulage, and others.\n\n\nQuotation\n\nJe rêve de vers doux et d'intimes ramages,\nDe vers à frôler l'âme ainsi que des plumages,\nDe vers blonds où le sens fluide se délie\nComme sous l'eau la chevelure d'Ophélie,\nDe vers silencieux, et sans rythme et sans trame\nOù la rime sans bruit glisse comme une rame,\nDe vers d'une ancienne étoffe, exténuée,\nImpalpable comme le son et la nuée,\nDe vers de soir d'automne ensorcelant les heures\nAu rite féminin des syllabes mineures.\nDe vers de soirs d'amour énervés de verveine,\nOù l'âme sente, exquise, une caresse à peine...\nJe rêve de vers doux mourant comme des roses.\n--Au Jardin de l'Infante\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nGosse, Edmund William (1911). \"Samain, Albert Victor\" .

    "text": "First Orbit is a 2011 feature-length, experimental documentary film about Vostok 1, the first human space flight around the Earth. By matching the orbit of the International Space Station to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible, in terms of ground track and time of day, documentary filmmaker Christopher Riley and European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli were able to film the view that Yuri Gagarin saw on his pioneering 1961 orbital space flight. This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive of Scientific and\nTechnical Documentation. The film features the music of composer Philip Sheppard.\n\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough the film archive of Gagarin’s training, preparations, and subsequent world tour is extensive, footage of the actual Vostok 1 flight hardly exists. In 2010 Riley came up with the idea to film Yuri’s original view of the Earth from space through the International Space Station's new giant-windowed cupola.\nThe International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes, but it does not always follow the same route that Gagarin took. To find out when filming opportunities might occur, the European Space Agency (ESA) teamed Riley up with German Flight Dynamics Engineer, Gerald Ziegler. Ziegler discovered that the ISS covered similar ground to Gagarin's Vostok 1 spaceship approximately every week. To complicate things further, the filmmakers needed to film at exactly the same time of day that Gagarin made his flight: passing over Gagarin’s launch site, near the Aral Sea, at 06:07 UT and into the nightside of Earth over the Pacific Ocean at 06:37, before emerging into sunlight again over the Southern Atlantic at 07:10 UT and passing across the African continent and the Middle East, returning to the ground at 07:55 UT, just north of the Caspian Sea.\nFurther calculations confirmed that opportunities to film this trajectory, with the correct sun angles, at this exact time of day, only came around once every six weeks. According to Riley, the second challenge was fitting these filming opportunities into crew time on board the space station. \"The astronauts have a busy schedule; conducting a packed programme of experiments, Earth observations and activities like sleep, exercise and meal times. This meant that accommodating the extra filming request for First Orbit was yet another challenge for the ESA mission directors,\" he told BBC news in a March 2011 interview. On the final flight path back towards Gagarin's landing site, the scenes shot for First Orbit are slightly to the east of the original Vostok 1 trajectory. Because the vantage point is so high, the vista was similar to that of Gagarin's vantage point.\nMission directors Roland Luettgens and Giovanni Gravili worked closely with the team to turn the filming opportunities into precise technical notes which translated Chris's camera directions into instructions for the crew. After a brief test shoot in November 2010, conducted by NASA's Expedition 25 astronaut Doug Wheelock, European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli filmed most of the footage for the project in early January 2011. This new footage showed the Earth as Gagarin would have seen it almost exactly fifty years before. The film does include views of the Moon, though. When Gagarin flew into the nightside of the Earth on 12 April 1961, there was a crescent moon and, according to his 1960s autobiography, Road to the Stars, Gagarin tried looking for the Moon out of curiosity, to see what it looked like from space. Unfortunately, it was not in his field of view. The filmmakers added the Moon into the scene as a tribute.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music in First Orbit was composed by Philip Sheppard and was taken from his album Cloud Songs. Riley first worked with Sheppard in 2006 on the Sundance award-winning feature documentary film, In the Shadow of the Moon. Since that time, he had worked on a new suite of music inspired by space flight, which he donated to this new film project.\nCoincidentally, the music in the film was taken on board the ISS by NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman before it was used in the film. Catherine Coleman flew to the ISS with astronaut and First Orbit cameraman Paolo Nespoli without either of them knowing about the other's connection to the film project.\n\n\nArchive audio\nThe producers sourced portions of Gagarin's original mission audio for First Orbit from the Russian State Archive. These historic recordings principally document the conversation between Yuri Gagarin on board Vostok 1 and Sergei Korolev on the ground. According to Riley, it is the first time that such quantities of the flight have been heard outside Russia. Additional archive audio in the film comes from a Radio Moscow report broadcast during the flight and news bulletins from the BBC and the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia TASS. The Russian recordings in the film are subtitled in English.\n\n\nGlobal distribution\n\nThe finished film was streamed through the website www.firstorbit.org in a global YouTube premiere on 12 April 2011. On the day of release the film was viewed 1.3 million times within 24 hours and 2.3 million times within 48 hours. In addition to this online première the film opened on over 1600 screens around the world in more than 130 countries, including UNESCO HQ in Paris, Boeing HQ in Seattle, and the European Space Agency’s Columbus Control Centre near Munich. In October 2011 the producers announced a call to action to translate the film into as many languages as possible. Their translation campaign resulted in 30 new languages which were published for free on the project's web site. To make these translations as accessible as possible the producers launched a crowd funding campaign on IndieGoGo to manufacture multi-language DVD and Blu-ray discs of the film. They raised only 20% of their target amount, but went ahead with the production anyway, releasing a limited run of discs on 12 March 2012, through the project's web site, and Amazon, almost exactly a year after the film was originally launched.\n\n\nSee also\nGagarin: First in Space, 2013 docudrama\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFirst Orbit - the project's web page\nFirst Orbit on YouTube - the global premiere channel for the film\nFirst Orbit at IMDb",

    "text": "Izy (French pronunciation: [iˈzi]) was a low-cost train service between Brussels and Paris. Services started on 3 April 2016, and ended on 10 July 2022.\n\n\nBackground\nBased on the Ouigo train service by SNCF, Thalys began its own low-cost service to compete with international coach services such as Eurolines and Megabus, and car pooling services such as BlaBlaCar. At its peak, Izy operated up to three services per day using two TGV high speed train sets leased from SNCF. Since 2020, Izy operated only four return trips between Friday and Monday.\n\n\nConcept\n\nThe model of the service was based on low-cost airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet, having the following features:\n\nTickets could only be bought on-line through a dedicated website izy.com or mobile app, not from ticket machines, ticket counters or through the regular Thalys website. Tickets had to be purchased at least four hours in advance of the journey and were either delivered by e-mail four days prior to travel, or via the mobile app as an e-ticket consisting of a QR code.\nSimilar to some low-cost airlines, whilst two pieces of luggage (maximum size, cabin baggage at 35 cm×55 cm×25 cm, and hand luggage at 27 cm×36 cm×15 cm ) were allowed free of charge, larger bags had to be paid for.\nThe journey took between 2 hours 8 minutes and 2 hours 30 minutes, while the regular Thalys service takes 1 hour 22 minutes. This is due to the fact that IZY trains used the Paris–Lille railway between Paris and Arras, instead of the high-speed LGV Nord line, allowing Izy to pay lower track fees to SNCF.\nThe trains carried fewer members of staff, who are tasked with basic maintenance of the train as well as serving passengers.\nUnlike on Thalys services there was no Wi-Fi and individual power sockets were only available on Standard XL seats.\nThe only way to contact the company was via a webform. There was no customer service telephone number or e-mail address.\n\n\nPricing\nIn order to offer significantly lower prices than on standard Thalys trains, Izy trains lacked a buffet car and had a greater number of more tightly packed seats. Standard adult fares started from €19 single depending on the time of the journey and how far it was booked in advance. A premium service named Standard XL started at €29 and offered a slightly larger seat and an individual power socket. There were also two lower costs options, a collapsible seat in the vestibule for as little as €15 and a non-guaranteed seat option for as little as €10. Thalys promised to charge no more than €59 for a ticket for Standard and €69 for Standard XL.\nSupplementary fees were as follows:\n\nFor children that are 10 or under, a flat fee of €10 was charged no matter the journey.\nAdditional baggage (per piece) was €10 if booked at the time of booking, €20 on-line prior to travel, or €30 if purchased at the station immediately before travel.\nPets could be taken on board; provided that they were in a carry case they travelled for free as part of the hand luggage. If not, a fee of €30 was charged per animal, or €15 if booked at the same time as the owner. Guide dogs were exempt from charges.\nAn SMS information option for a supplementary fee of €2 per person.\n\n\nRolling stock\n\nIzy used a dedicated TGV Réseau triple-voltage trainset, number 4551, painted in a silver, white and green IZY livery with purple doors.\nIn 2019, this was replaced by a former Eurostar Class 373/TGV TMST, formed with half-trainsets 373213 and 373224. The Izy livery on this set used white instead of silver paint and features more purple.\nSince 2021, Izy trains were operated with conventional Thalys PBA/PBKA rolling stock.\n\n\nStations\nIzy used the main train stations of Brussels-South and Paris-Gare du Nord, in comparison to Ouigo, which serves secondary stations such as Marne-la-Vallée for Paris, and Tourcoing, which is near Lille. However, the Izy service did not use the same rail line as Thalys, but rather conventional older rail lines. For this reason it was more at risk of delays caused by other trains or factors on the rail system than the dedicated Thalys high speed line.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCompany website\n Media related to IZY at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "GlobalHue was a privately owned advertising agency specializing in what the firm called a culture based approach to marketing, with offices in New York City and Southfield, Michigan (Detroit). The agency provided companies with an integrated approach to marketing to ethnic-specific audiences.\nThe agency offered full-service marketing, advertising, media planning and buying, digital, events and promotions, and public relations for blue-chip clients including Verizon Wireless, Walmart, Chrysler Group LLC, U.S. Navy, Jeep, and OneMain Financial. \nIn 2016, amidst the lawsuits against the company, both the Detroit and New York offices were closed.\n\n\nHistory\nGlobalHue was founded in 1988 by Don Coleman as Don Coleman Associates in Southfield, Michigan. \nIn 1997, the firm transitioned to become Don Coleman Advertising, a firm specializing in marketing to African Americans. \nIn 1999, True North Communications acquired a 49% stake in Don Coleman Advertising. Interpublic Group's purchase of True North in 2001 brought along the minority interest in Don Coleman Advertising. \nIn 2002, the firm acquired Hispanic agency Montemayor y Asociados and Asian-American agency Innovasia Communications to become GlobalHue, covering the three main U.S. ethnic segments. \nIn 2003, GlobalHue CEO Coleman initiated a buyback from IPG to become the independent multicultural agency GlobalHue.\nIn 2009, GlobalHue's capitalized billings were $833.7 million. \nIn 2009, GlobalHue was named “Multicultural Advertising Agency of the Decade” by Advertising Week.\nIn 2010, Black Enterprise magazine named GlobalHue the BE 100 Advertising Agency of the Year, which was also awarded in 1998 and 2003.\n\n\nTotal Market\nIn 2009, as multicultural marketing was becoming increasingly mainstream, GlobalHue enlarged its focus to a category it calls “total market,” encompassing population segments of mixed ethnicities that are united on the basis of affinities, values and culture. Its ad campaigns for Chrysler Jeep, MGM Grand Detroit and the Bermuda Department of Tourism took this “total market” approach.\n\n\nResearch\nIn 2009, GlobalHue conducted a large survey of U.S. consumers and created a report on the findings. “Multicultural Nation: Convergence and Divergence in the New America”  presented insights for marketing to a complex ethnic and cultural consumer population. The report confirmed that prevalent assumptions about segments, both Non-Hispanic Whites and ethnic, are becoming irrelevant and even risky for brand success in the diversified consumer market.\n\n\nCampaigns\n\n\nMGM Grand Detroit casino\nIn the 2009 “Touch the Lion” campaign for MGM Grand Detroit casino, GlobalHue created billboards depicting golden female eyes flashing devilishly against a dark background and the casino lion logo. The “demon” eyes drew protest from the Detroit religious community, which in turn attracted media attention. The casino posted the biggest single-day “coin-in” in its history - $25.9 million – after the campaign. The golden eyes theme was also used in print advertising. In 2010, the casino was the most profitable within the 12-casino MGM group and the largest Detroit area casino in gross revenue with 41.2 percent of the total gaming revenue.\n\n\nBermuda Department of Tourism\nFor the Bermuda Department of Tourism's “Feel the Love” campaign for the total market, GlobalHue rebranded the island vacation destination as a weekend and short vacation option for a youthful, upscale “urbane traveler” from major East coast cities, rather than day trippers on cruises. Before the campaign, visitors per year between 1990 and 2005 averaged 531,988. For three years during the campaign, the number of visitors averaged 620,215, representing a 16.6% increase over the previous 15 years.  Mar 16, 2009:  Don Coleman's GlobalHue is accused of ripping off the government of Bermuda by overbilling its $13 million tourism advertising contract. In a report by Bermuda auditor general Larry Dennis, GlobalHue is accused of: Overbilling the account by $1.8 million.  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/globalhue-accused-of-overbilling-bermuda-account-agency-plays-race-card/ Archived 2015-06-11 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\nChrysler 300C sedan\nThe 2008 Chrysler 300C sedan campaign titled “The Artist Inside You” was targeted at African American business people and entrepreneurs encompassing TV, print, radio and digital, featuring 300C cars as customized works of art. The campaign aired in January and February, the worst period in the automotive sales year. It was also challenged by poor public perceptions of American car quality and high regard for imports. In spite of that, the 300C had 1,100 dealer orders in nine days and sold out in record time.\nThe strategy placed the vehicle at the center of custom car culture and its intersection with urban influencers. Through partnership with DUB magazine, a hip hop car culture brand, GlobalHue aligned the 300C with urban recording artists including Snoop Dogg and Sean Paul and sports stars such as Steve Smith and Corey Maggette, placing the vehicle in music videos, magazines, custom wheel ads, MTV Cribs, custom car shows and everywhere urban culture and custom cars came together. A key moment of the campaign occurred when the rapper 50 Cent called the Chairman of Chrysler to place an order and the recording of the call was leaked. This increased the 300C's status as an urban icon, superseding overall Chrysler brand awareness.\nLate in the model lifecycle, GlobalHue produced a more public and traditional campaign that acknowledged the car's urban icon status.\n\n\nVerizon Wireless\nGlobalHue helped Verizon connect with African-Americans through a grassroots Gospel competition for print and television titled “How Sweet the Sound”. The campaign drew on the community's affinity for church participation.\n\n\nWalmart\nWalmart's ad campaign supporting Black History Month in 2009 for TV, radio and digital with “Grandma’s Hands” drove positive awareness of the brand among African Americans; as a result, corporate sponsorship of year-long Black History initiatives is a permanent part of the brand's marketing.\n\n\nChrysler Jeep(R)\nIn 2009 GlobalHue was awarded the global Jeep(R) brand account by Chrysler Group. GlobalHue created a three-part phased campaign titled “I live. I ride. I am. Jeep.” which positioned Jeep as \"a new way of working, playing and living always on your own terms.\" The campaign included outdoor and transit, broadcast, print, digital and retail ads, and sought to expand the brand's appeal to a younger, more diverse and urban customer base. In the year of the campaign, Jeep posted double-digit sales growth and became the Chrysler Group's top selling brand.\n\n\nJeep Compass\nGlobalHue's 2011 Jeep Compass campaign, titled \"Bloodline\", launched in February.  \"Bloodline\" showcased the Jeep Compass in urban and off-road settings, and features the bloodlines of father-daughter athletes Muhammad and Laila Ali and father-son actors James and Scott Caan. Critics had not considered previous incarnations of the Compass as fully part of Jeep's \"military and off-road heritage\"; the new model received an updated available four-wheel drive powertrain and Jeep's \"Trail Rated badge\". The campaign declared the Compass's Jeep lineage.\n\n\nUS Census 2010\nFor the 2010 US Census, GlobalHue was awarded the information campaign for Americans of Hispanic, Portuguese, African, African-Caribbean and African American ethnicity. Census’ goal of 90 percent compliance was challenged by skepticism and distrust within these populations. With a message of strong community empowerment, use of non-traditional formats (such as lunch trucks, local restaurant menus, Webisodes mimicking popular telenovela), and a focus on clarifying the government commitment to confidentiality, GlobalHue's strategy for the campaign “It’s In Your Hands” helped this Census become one of the most successful ever conducted.\nThe Hispanic campaign included a mural painted in Spanish Harlem, used as the basis of print and TV ads, referring to the historic means of communication in Hispanic societies. One TV spot for the Hispanic market, “Communidad,” tested well, and was used in the general audience market. Midway through the campaign, 95 percent of Hispanics stated that their families intended to be counted.\n\n\nHonors\n2010 AdWeekMedia Multicultural Agency of the Decade \nBlack Enterprise 100 Company of the Year Award \n\n\nLegal Troubles\nDon Coleman's GlobalHue is accused of ripping off the government of Bermuda by overbilling its $13 million tourism advertising contract. In a report by Bermuda auditor general Larry Dennis (pictured), GlobalHue is accused of: - Overbilling the account by $1.8 million. - Prebilling the government in violation of its own rules. - Not keeping invoices and billing records. - Not returning discounts and credits to the client. - Using a media buyer, Cornerstone, that charged commissions of up to 181 percent (Cornerstone's average commission charged was 51 percent, the report says, and the average media industry commissions tend to be about 15 percent.)\nTop executives of Coleman's GlobalHue firm filed a class action lawsuit in Manhattan federal court claiming they have not been paid in months. The lawsuit claims the company's employees, including its executive creative director and the former head of the Wal-Mart account, saw their last paychecks on March 15.\nColeman “repeatedly assured employees that they would be paid for the work that they performed,” the lawsuit said. But the money never came through — even as Coleman continues to assign them work, they said.\nOne former employee told The Post that the first sign of trouble came in December when the company failed to make good on one of two monthly paychecks. At the time, the company blamed the problem on the bank. Eventually, Coleman held a staff meeting in New York where he confessed to “financial challenges,” this person said. The 6’ 2” linebacker explained that he was in the process of working with investors who would provide enough funding to make sure it never happened again, this person said. “We were strung along for months and months,” this person said.\nThe ad agency lost several big accounts this year including UB Bancorp, Autozone and AARP. FIAT Chrysler stopped working with GobalHue last year after five years. Separately, Coleman is being pursued in Manhattan federal court for $1.24 million by a real estate company that says GlobalHue broke its lease for two floors of office space at 123 Williams Street downtown.\nColeman is also being sued in Manhattan federal court by Leonard Howard, who says he was ordered to drive Coleman's daughter Kelli Coleman around town from morning to night without overtime.\nHoward said he was ordered to wait for Kelli Coleman while she “spent long evenings in various clubs in New York City,” and then to pick her up the next day at 8 am to take her to the gym. He, too, stopped getting paid in March, he said.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nGlobalHue\nCulture Blog\nGlobalHue YouTube Channel Archived 2016-11-24 at the Wayback Machine\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/globalhue-accused-of-overbilling-bermuda-account-agency-plays-race-card/ Archived 2015-06-11 at the Wayback Machine\nhttp://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/former-multicultural-agency-of-the-decade-globalhue-has-not-paid-employees-in-more-than-3-months/111750 Archived 2017-07-29 at the Wayback Machine",

    "text": "Jeffrey Linton Osborne (born March 9, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and lyricist. He is the former drummer and lead singer of the American R&B/soul group L.T.D., with whom he began his musical career in 1970. In 2024, Osborne was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nEarly life and family\nOsborne was born in Providence, Rhode Island. Born the youngest of twelve children which consisted of six brothers and six sisters, Osborne's family was musically inclined. Some of Osborne's siblings went on to have music careers as well; his brother Billy Osborne was his band-mate in L.T.D. Osborne's father, Clarence \"Legs\" Osborne, was a popular trumpeter who played with Lionel Hampton, Count Basie and Duke Ellington. Osborne's father died in 1961 when Osborne was thirteen.\n\n\nL.T.D.\nOsborne began his music career in 1970 becoming a member of the American soul band \"Love Men Ltd.\", who would later become known as L.T.D. The band recorded hit singles such as \"(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again\" (1977), \"Concentrate on You,\" \"Love Ballad\" (1976) and \"Holding On (When Love Is Gone)\" (1978). At first, Osborne served as only a drummer, sharing lead vocal duties with his brother Billy Osborne but, by 1976, he became the group's primary lead vocalist. Osborne and his brother both left the band in late 1980 to start solo careers. Osborne sang lead vocals on L.T.D.'s three No. 1 songs on the U.S. R&B Chart and for the band's three gold and platinum albums.\n\n\nSolo career\n\nIn 1982, Osborne sang the opening song \"I Just Want to Be Your Friend\" for the comedy film The Toy. Osborne later released his self-titled debut album in 1982, which featured two hit singles, \"On the Wings of Love\" and \"I Really Don't Need No Light\" (1982), peaking at No. 29 and No. 39, respectively, on the pop chart. It was followed the next year by Stay with Me Tonight, his first solo gold album, which spawned four more hits, \"Don't You Get So Mad\" (No. 25), the title track (No. 30), \"Plane Love\" (No. 10 R&B, No. 6 dance), and \"We're Going All the Way (No. 48). \"Stay with Me Tonight\" (May 1984, No. 18) and \"On the Wings of Love\" (August 1984, No. 11) would belatedly reach the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 1985, Osborne wrote the lyrics to the Whitney Houston hit \"All at Once\" (music by Michael Masser). He appeared on USA for Africa's fundraising single, \"We Are the World\" in 1985. Osborne sang the unreleased single \"Everything Good Takes Time\" which was part of a video tribute to Julius Erving ('Dr. J') in 1987. He would later appear on Celebrity Duets in 2006, performing \"On the Wings of Love\" with Alfonso Ribeiro. Osborne lent his vocals to the theme song of the soap opera, Loving, from 1992 to 1995 as well as the first-season theme song for the Kirstie Alley comedy Veronica's Closet.\nOsborne had two more gold albums, Don't Stop and Emotional, the latter of which had his highest-charting solo pop hit, \"You Should Be Mine\", which peaked at No. 13 in 1986. The following year, Osborne had the highest-charting hit of his career duetting with Dionne Warwick on \"Love Power\", which reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also topped the Adult Contemporary singles chart. It was a turning point in his pop success, as his albums and singles began charting lower and lower. Osborne's 1988 single \"She's on the Left\" would be his final Hot 100 entry, as well as his only No. 1 R&B hit.\n\n\nLater career\nIn the new millennium, he returned with a series of albums that, while far from the success he enjoyed in the 1980s, returned him to Adult R&B radio, scoring modest chart singles such as \"Rest of Our Lives\" (No. 75, 2003) and his cover of Barbara Mason's classic \"Yes, I'm Ready\" (No. 64, 2005). \nIn 2008, Osborne sang the national anthem before game 4 of the NBA Finals at Staples Center in Los Angeles, a feat which he repeated in 2009 before game 1 of the 2009 NBA Finals, and also again in 2010 before game 1 of the NBA Finals, all at Staples Center. He also performed the national anthem prior to game 3 of the 1988 World Series, a feat he repeated two years later at game 3 of the 1990 World Series, both at the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California. He also regularly sang the national anthem before Hartford Whalers games. On March 1, 2010, Osborne appeared on The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love season finale, \"After the Final Rose\", singing his hit \"On the Wings of Love\" while Bachelor Jake Pavelka took to the dance floor with his newly announced fiancée, Vienna Girardi. In 2024, Osborne was selected for induction into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame\n\n\nPersonal life\nOsborne married Sheri Osborne in 1983, and together they have three daughters: Tiffany Nicole, Dawn, and Jeanine Osborne; and a son, Jeffrey Jr. His wife died in 2025 at the age of 69.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nCharted singles\n\n\nFilmography\nThe Young Messiah – Messiah XXI (2006) (DVD)\n\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 2019 Osbourne was recognized with the Wheeler community Spirit Award, given to a member of the Providence, RI community who advocates for those who have fewer opportunities. Recipients are recognized for their efforts in four key areas:\n\nPassion for equity and social justice, both locally and globally\nAppreciation for and promotion of the benefits of education\nCommitment to creating opportunities in the community for those who otherwise might not have a voice or an advocate\nResilience in the face of challenge and adversity. We ask each recipient to attend the annual Wheeler School Community Potluck Dinner, where the award is presented. The Family Potluck dinner is a school-wide event, sponsored by the Upper School's diversity club Students Involved in Cultural Awareness (SICA), the Office of Unity & Diversity, and the Wheeler Parent's Association.\nOsborne received the 2014 New England Pell Award for Artistic Excellence from Providence (Rhode Island)'s Trinity Repertory Company in honor of his artistic achievements and philanthropic work in Rhode Island.\n\n\nGrammy Awards\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

It was vacant for several years, then became a residence and boarding house during the late Depression.\nIn 1940, Embassy Building No. 10 became the headquarters of what is now the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation. \nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1986.  Although the ways in which the building responds to its site make up a part of its National Register nomination — \"The symmetry of the facade belies the actual form and plan, designed for  the wedge-shaped lot situated in the acute angle formed by the intersection of Lament and Sixteenth Streets, N.W.\" — the context has been lost: at some point, the section of Lamont Street adjacent to the building was closed, consolidated with the property immediately to the north, and turned into a parking lot and playground.\nIn 2012, the DC DPR moved \"its central office operations…to two new location\"s in order to \"provid[e] a better working environment for DPR employees, and a place to better serve customers\" than was possible in the aging building. In 2020, the Junior Achievement of Greater Washington organization, sought approval from the Historic Preservation Review Board to add an auditorium clad in limestone.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Embassy Building No. 10 at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "National Barn Dance, broadcast by WLS-AM in Chicago, Illinois starting in 1924, was one of the first American country music radio programs and a direct precursor of the Grand Ole Opry.\nNational Barn Dance also set the stage for other similar programs, in part because the clear-channel signal of WLS could be received throughout most of the Midwest and even beyond in the late evening and nighttime hours, making much of the United States (and Canada) a potential audience. The program was well received and thus widely imitated. National Barn Dance ended its broadcast in 1968.\n\n\nHistory\n\nNational Barn Dance was founded by Edgar L. Bill. To him goes the credit for arranging to have a program of \"down-home\" tunes broadcast from radio station WLS, of which Bill was then director. Having lived on a farm, he knew how people loved the familiar sound and informal spirit of old-fashioned barn dance music. The first broadcast was an impromptu sustaining program. An avalanche of telephone calls and letters indicated a definite demand from the public for this type of broadcast, and National Barn Dance was born.  It first aired on WLS on April 19, 1924, and originated from the Eighth Street Theater starting in 1931.  The show was picked up by NBC Radio in 1933. NBC expanded the program's coverage in 1942, adding it to the schedules of international broadcast shortwave stations. In 1946, it switched to the ABC Radio Network and aired until 1952 on Saturday nights from 6:30 p.m. to midnight.\nGeorge D. Hay (a.k.a. The Solemn Ole Judge) has always claimed that he started the WLS Barn Dance when he worked for them as an announcer, but research is showing that this was a falsehood of documented history and that his claim was to help him get a job as the first director of WSM Radio c. 1925 Nashville, Tennessee.\nThe show regularly featured Gene Autry, Henry Burr, Red Foley, The Three Little Maids, Jenny Lou Carson, Eddie Dean, Lulu Belle and Scotty, Pat Buttram, George Gobel, The Williams Brothers (featuring future crooner Andy Williams), Arkansas Woodchopper, The DeZurik Sisters and the Hoosier Hot Shots. Other guests included Smiley Burnette, Eddie Peabody and Joe Kelly, best remembered today as the host and moderator of NBC's Quiz Kids. The announcer was Jack Holden and it was once sponsored by Alka-Seltzer. The program aired from The Center Theater in Chicago, and people used to stand outside in the snow and cold waiting to get in. The National Barn Dance was the only known radio program to charge an admission fee.\nABC made two moves that ultimately led to National Barn Dance's slow demise. The first was the cancellation of the network broadcast in 1952. After a few years, audiences finally began to wane, and the program ceased live performances after 1957. The show continued to air on WLS until 1959 when ABC bought the station and changed the format to Top 40 rock and roll, canceling National Barn Dance outright. The show moved to Chicago's WGN-AM, with Orion Samuelson as the show's host, until it finally left the air in 1968.\n\n\nChronology\n1924–33: WLS (AM)\n1925–28: Two separate versions, WLS-AM (National Barn Dance) and WSM-AM (WSM Barn Dance); the latter became the Grand Ole Opry in 1928\n1933–46: WLS (AM), carried by NBC Radio\n1946–52: WLS (AM), carried by ABC Radio\n1952–60: WLS (AM)\n1960–68: WGN-AM\n\n\nPerformers\n\n\nFilm and TV\nA fictionalized account of the show's origins, The National Barn Dance (1944), was filmed by director Hugh Bennett from a screenplay by Hal Fimberg and Lee Loeb. The film starred Jean Heather, Charles Quigley, Robert Benchley, Mabel Paige and Charles Dingle, while Pat Buttram and Joe Kelly appeared as themselves.  Two acts who were radio show regulars, The Hoosier Hotshots and The Dinning Sisters, also had featured musical spots in the film.  Paramount Pictures reportedly paid WLS $75,000 for the rights in 1943.\nABC Barn Dance, a filmed TV series featuring some of the radio performers, was telecast on ABC from February 21–November 14, 1949. Hosted by Jack Stillwell and Hal O'Halloran, the 30-minute musical variety format presented a mix of folk music with country and Western tunes.\nIn 1964, it became a nationally syndicated program through Mid-America Video Tape Productions, then a subsidiary of television station WGN-TV in Chicago (the predecessor of Tribune Entertainment).\n\n\nOffshoots\nIn 1925, prior to network radio or syndication, Hay brought his Barn Dance concept to Nashville, Tennessee. The result was a show called the WSM Barn Dance. It became so popular that on December 10, 1927, Hay renamed it the Grand Ole Opry. WSM became one of the first NBC affiliates in 1927, and the Opry is still on the air today.\nA second program was launched in the 1930s by National Barn Dance's then-president John Lair in Renfro Valley, Kentucky; the Renfro Valley Barn Dance still takes place weekly but is no longer aired on radio (although a sister program, the Renfro Valley Gatherin', does still air weekly on Sunday mornings).\n\n\nReferences\n\nPrairie Farmer WLS National Barn Dance Crew photograph dated June 16, 1934 in \"WLS Family Album 1935.\" Chicago: The Prairie Farmer Publishing Company, 1934, p. 30.\n\n\nListen to\nNational Barn Dance (October 2, 1943)\n\n\nExternal links\n\nWLS National Barn Dance\nNational Barn Dance at IMDb \nPBS: The Hayloft Gang: The Story of the National Barn Dance",

    "text": "Peter John Wagner II (born October 3, 1959) is an American actor,  singer, and golfer, best known for his roles on General Hospital, Santa Barbara, The Bold and the Beautiful, and Melrose Place.\n\n\nEarly life\nWagner was born in Washington, Missouri, to Peter John Wagner, a car salesman (died 1990), and Irene M. (née Amberg) \"Scotty\" Wagner (1920–2022), a homemaker. His only sibling, his elder brother Dennis Wagner (1953–2018), died of leukemia after a nearly two decade battle.\nRaised Catholic, Wagner attended St. Gertrude's parochial school and St. Francis Borgia Regional High School in his hometown, where he played football and basketball. He attended the University of Missouri for one year, then junior college before eventually enrolling at the University of Arizona, where he tried out for the golf team and drama department. The drama department offered him a full scholarship.\n\n\nActing career\nWagner first appeared on the scene in 1982 in the role of Clint Masterson, in Douglas Marland's short-lived cable soap opera, A New Day In Eden, co-produced by Susan Flannery, who would later co-star with Wagner on The Bold and the Beautiful.\nHis most famous role has been Frisco Jones on the soap opera General Hospital (1983–1987, 1989–1991, 1994–95, 2013). He was half of a supercouple (with real-life wife Kristina Wagner's character, Felicia) and played the father of Georgie and Maxie Jones. He played Warren Lockridge on Santa Barbara from 1991 until that series' conclusion in 1993.\nHe appeared in several made for television films, including Lady Killer and  Frequent Flyer. He appeared for many years on Aaron Spelling's Fox nighttime soap opera Melrose Place, as the alternately caring/conniving Dr. Peter Burns (1994–99); he directed episodes as well. His character and Heather Locklear's \"Amanda\" were featured together on a beach in the series finale's closing scene, having faked their own deaths.\nHe appeared in another Aaron Spelling project, the short-lived NBC television series Titans with Yasmine Bleeth in 2000, and in Spelling's daytime soap opera Sunset Beach (in 1997).\nFrom 2003 to 2012, he played Nick Marone on the CBS daytime soap The Bold and the Beautiful. He reprised this role on June 16, 2025. On February 28, 2006, he and a contestant Christine Denos won $142,550 (including the standard $100,000 top prize) in the game show Wheel of Fortune; at the time, it set a single-episode largest winning record (and second largest overall) until Michelle Lowenstein surpassed said record on October 14, 2008, as the inaugural $1,000,000 winner.\nIn 1985, Wagner was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for \"Best Younger Actor\" for his work on General Hospital. He was nominated again in 2005 for \"Best Lead Actor\" for The Bold and the Beautiful.\nWagner guest-starred on primetime television in notable programs such as Monk, Hot in Cleveland, and Castle.\nIn January 2013, it was announced that Wagner had agreed to reprise the iconic role of Frisco Jones on General Hospital for several episodes in early 2013. Since 2014, he has played Bill Avery on When Calls the Heart. Wagner also starred on the Hallmark Channel in the Wedding March movies, with The Wedding March 3: Here Comes the Bride having premiered in February 2018 and   Netflix movie Falling for Christmas in 2022.\n\n\nDancing with the Stars\nIn 2012, Wagner was a contestant on season 14 of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya.  They were eliminated from the competition on April 3, 2012, placing 11th.\n\n\nSinging and stage career\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nSingles\n\nAlthough Wagner had been playing the guitar since he was 14, his initial audition for the role of Frisco Jones on General Hospital with producer Gloria Monty did not include any singing. Wagner had five auditions with ABC before ultimately winning the role of \"Frisco Jones\". His final audition in 1983 included performing the Kenny Loggins song \"Wait a Little While\".\nABC musical honcho Kelli Ross hooked Wagner up with Quincy Jones who oversaw his initial 5 song EP All I Need. Eventually, they would release a full ten song LP of All I Need once the song \"All I Need\" began to rise up the charts. Quincy Jones protégés Glen Ballard and Clif Magness produced Wagner's first two albums on Qwest Records/Warner Brothers. Wagner's singing talents led him to appearances on American Bandstand, Solid Gold, Soul Train and The Merv Griffin Show.\nEventually, his musical theater talent led to the title role(s) in a Broadway run of Jekyll & Hyde, making him the first celebrity casting. Wagner has stated this was \"a role of a lifetime\" and performing the dual characters on Broadway was his most fulfilling professional experience. Wagner says \"the role I had the most fun playing, TV-wise, would be Dr. Peter Burns (Melrose Place). He was sort of an evil character who could redeem himself. Theatrically, it was when I played Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Jekyll & Hyde on Broadway.\" He also appeared in a national theatre tour in 1987 in the role of Tony in West Side Story, and a national tour of Grease in 1988.\nWhile he toured as a rock/pop performer in concert consistently from 1985 to 1988, Wagner did not perform in the 1990s except for an occasional benefit appearance. In 2005, Wagner resumed performing in concert sporadically. His more recent concerts have included a diverse blend of songs from his own catalog, cover songs from artists such as Neil Young, Lindsey Buckingham, and Paul McCartney, and originals.\nIn 2012, Wagner released new music, the single \"Will the Rain Fall Down\" on iTunes. He also performed the song acoustically on The Bold and the Beautiful. In 2014, Wagner released the full-length release On the Porch. A notable song from this release was the fan-favorite \"The Right Key\", which made its debut on General Hospital in 1989.  He made a music video for \"Driving Miss Daisy\" which premiered on YouTube.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nPersonal life\nWagner was married to actress Kristina Wagner, who played opposite him on General Hospital as his love interest Felicia Cummings. They divorced in 2006. They had two sons, born in 1990 and 1994. Their younger son Harrison died in Los Angeles on June 6, 2022, of an accidental drug overdose.\nOn June 13, 2022, Jack and his former wife announced a scholarship fund in honour of their son who struggled with addiction issues. All funds donated to the Harrison Wagner Scholarship Fund will be used to directly help young men pay their rent or a portion of their rent who could not otherwise afford their care at New Life House (a sober living facility in California).\nWagner began dating his Melrose Place love interest Heather Locklear in 2007; they became engaged in August 2011. The couple called off their engagement on November 15, 2011.\nIn May 2013,  Wagner confirmed to Soaps In Depth that he and  his former The Bold and the Beautiful co-star Ashley Jones had been dating for about a year. They were no longer together as of 2015.\nIn November 2011, Jack met his 23-year-old daughter, Kerry, for the first time at a concert in Florida. Kerry had been placed for adoption at birth by her birth mother and had recently hired a private investigator to find her biological parents. This was the subject of Wagner's \"personal story\" in his Dancing with the Stars performance on April 2, 2012.\nWagner is a highly accomplished golfer and at one point considered a career in pro golf. He won the Missouri junior college championship in 1980, and is the only non-professional athlete to have won the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic, an annual competition featuring American sports and entertainment celebrities. Wagner first won the event in 2006 and repeated as champion in 2011, when he bested Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. He has a total of nineteen top ten finishes. The tournament, televised by NBC in July, is played over three rounds at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Lake Tahoe.\nWagner has a Celebrity Golf Classic named after him that raises funds for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Wagner created the event to support the Society's mission to cure such cancers as leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. The Golf Classic raised more than $600,000 in its first two years to fund critical cancer research and patient services.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJack Wagner at IMDb\nJack Wagner at the Internet Broadway Database",

Born into the longstanding tailoring house of Henry Creed & Company in Paris, he launched his eponymous label in London in 1946. The first elected member of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, he had success in both Britain and the United States.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nCreed was born in 1909 at 29 rue Singer in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, the sixth child and third son born to tailor Henry Creed (1824–1914). Like Charles Worth, the Creed family was British and became part of the French couture establishment, rising to prominence in the 19th century. His grandfather, also named Henry Creed, had introduced women's professional tailoring to Paris in the 1890s. The company – which said its tailoring roots dated back to the 1700s – had a reputation for creating fine women's riding habits as well as men's tailoring; clients included the British and French royal families. Creed's father was said to have designed the outfit worn by Mata Hari when she was shot.\nCharles Creed was educated in France and Vienna, also spending some time as a designer with Bergdorf Goodman in New York, where he was said to have been very popular with clients. After a six-month spell completing his fashion industry education at Linton tweed mill in Carlisle – a key supplier to couturiers, notably Coco Chanel – he returned to work at the family firm in Paris in 1933. He retained a workspace in Knightsbridge during the early 1930s, which he shared with fellow designer – and later IncSoc member – Mattli. He was already considered notable enough in the United States to be chosen – alongside names such as Elsa Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin – to design clothes for Frances Drake in the 1936 film version of I'd Give My Life. Creed was designing for the family firm in Paris  at the outbreak of war, moving back in 1940 after the fall of France. He later described how he left Paris hours ahead of the Germans – with his father Henry Creed, then 80, refusing to evacuate the city where he had spent his life.\n\n\nEstablishment of label\nCharles Creed established his London showroom and workspace initially in Fortnum & Mason, moving to a basement air raid shelter once the London air raids started in earnest. In early 1941, he toured the United States to promote British woollens to American consumers and encourage them to support the war effort. He also contributed to the war effort as a member of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers (IncSoc) in 1942. According to the fashion journalist Ernestine Carter, while Creed contributed to a 1941 collection with other IncSoc founding members, he was not among the eight founder members, but was the first elected member of the Society.\nCreed opened his eponymous label in London in 1946. His 1947 collection – produced in a year when rationing was still in force in Britain – was greeted enthusiastically by a reviewer for Melbourne newspaper The Age, who described wool and jersey dresses with coordinating coats and box jackets, plus tailored suits in striped tweeds and black barathea worn with brightly coloured blouses. His 1947 range was also showcased in a British Pathé feature, alongside hats by Danish milliner to the Queen Aage Thaarup.  Three years later, Creed's place among the British couture establishment was cemented by the inclusion of one of his suits in a fashion show sequence in the film Maytime in Mayfair – all the designers were IncSoc members.\nCreed was well connected among broader fashion circles. His wife Patricia Cunningham had been appointed fashion editor of Vogue at the age of 23; a 1952 article in The Sydney Morning Herald about the women behind London's top designers described her as: \"his severest critic\", adding that she attended his fashion shows in order to take notes about hits and misses in the collection.\n\n\nBrand hallmarks\nCreed's store was located at 31 Basil Street, Knightsbridge. The premises was masculine in tone, with dark panelling on the walls and displays of Napoleonic toy soldiers (Creed had a fine collection that was later to be the subject of a British Pathé film). This love of military themes and detailing was to influence his designs, which featured frogging, braiding and piping. Capes and tricorn hats were also part of his design signature. While he did make some evening wear, designs were normally slim and tailored.\n\n\nLegacy\nSeveral years before his death, Creed had established a wholesale fashion house specialising in knitwear and planned to focus on this after the closure of his couture business in 1966.\nAfter the closure of his couture house, he donated a selection of model garments to the Victoria and Albert Museum to illustrate his design style. His work was also exhibited as part of a 2007  V&A exhibition called The Golden Age of Couture. The family name lives on in the Paris perfume house of Creed.\n\n\nPublications\nCreed, Charles, Maid to Measure (Jarrolds, 1961)\nde la Haye, A., 'Material Evidence' in Wilcox, C. ed., The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-1957 (V&A Publications, 2007), p. 96-7 & pl.4.6\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCharles Creed outfit from Victoria and Albert Museum archive\nCharles Creed photographed by Norman Parkinson, National Portrait Gallery\n'Golden Age of Couture' exhibition brochure\nBritish Pathé film about Charles Creed's toy soldier collection\n1947 British Pathe feature, showing Charles Creed clothes with Aage Thaarup hats",

The species is named after the presence of tetrapods, the only Clathrinid sponge known to possess such spicules.\n\n\nDescription\nThe cormus is formed of thin, regular and tightly anastomosed tubes. It is attached to the substrate by a few tubes, which are not true stalks. There are no water-collecting tubes, but vents on the surface. Cells with granules could not be found because of the state of preservation of the type specimen. The skeleton comprises equiangular and equiradiate triactines and tetractines on the tubes’ interior, and tripods and tetrapods on the exterior delimiting the cormus. The actines of the triactines and tetractines are conical, with sharp tips. The apical actine of the tetractines is shorter than the facial ones, conical, sharp and straight. The spines are located at the tip. Tripods and tetrapods are very abundant. The tripods are true tripods. Tetrapods are similar to tripods in that they also possess stout actines and a raised centre. However, they have developed a fourth, apical, actine, which is shorter than the facial ones; it is conical and differs from the apical actine of the tetractines in that it is smooth.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWorld Register of Marine Species entry",

    "text": "Kevin Robert Kesar (born July 19, 1985), is an American professional wrestler. He is performing on the independent circuit under the ring name Killer Kross. He is best known for his tenure in WWE, where he performed under the ring name Karrion Kross.\nPrior to his tenure in WWE, Kesar performed for Impact Wrestling, Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), and multiple promotions on the independent circuit under the ring names Kevin Kross and Killer Kross. In AAA, he was a member of the MAD and La Facción Ingobernable stables. He has also appeared on season four of AAA's American project Lucha Underground as The White Rabbit, the member of Paul London's Rabbit Tribe stable.\nKesar signed with WWE in February 2020 under the ring name Karrion Kross and began a winning streak on their NXT developmental brand that led him to winning the NXT Championship before having to relinquish it due to injury. Kross regained the title in April 2021 at NXT TakeOver: Stand & Deliver. After making his main roster debut on the Raw brand that July, his winning streak was immediately broken, he lost the NXT Championship to Samoa Joe the following month, and his on-screen character was subsequently altered. WWE released Kesar in November 2021 and began making appearances in various independent promotions, as well as brief appearances in Major League Wrestling (MLW) and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). He returned to WWE in August 2022 and performed there until August 2025, after his contract expired.\n\n\nEarly life\nKevin Robert Kesar was born on July 19, 1985 in New York City. He is of Central American, Puerto Rican, Italian, Greek, Scandinavian, Croatian, British, and Irish descent. \nKesar spent parts of his early life in New York and Toronto, Canada.

After the match, Moxley was so impressed by Kross that he gave Triple H's contact and was signed by WWE.\n\n\nLucha Underground (2015–2018)\nBetween 2015 and 2016, Kevin Kross worked multiple dark matches for Lucha Underground. On December 14, 2015, Kross made his debut for the promotion, defeating Vinny Massaro in a dark match.\nOn July 11, 2018, Kross returned with a new character called The White Rabbit, he gave his wooden scepter to Paul London and ordered him to murder Mascarita Sagrada in cold blood for leading the Rabbit Tribe to his secret lair.\n\n\nLucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2017–2020)\n\nOn March 19, 2017, as Kevin Kross, he made his AAA debut at Rey de Reyes, helping Johnny Mundo to win the AAA Mega Championship, AAA Latin American Championship and AAA World Cruiserweight Championship.

Once in a secluded area backstage, however, Kross attacked and choked a handcuffed Williams, revealing himself as the actual attacker. Kross made his in-ring debut on the July 5 episode of Impact, defeating Fallah Bahh. Two weeks later, Kross defeated Williams via referee stoppage after applying a choke hold.\nOn the August 9 episode of Impact, Kross helped Austin Aries retain his Impact World Championship against Eddie Edwards, hitting the latter with a Saito Suplex following a ref bump. Aries announced Kross as his \"insurance policy\" the following week. The duo were joined by Moose, who betrayed Edwards during a tag team match on August 30. At Bound for Glory on October 14, Kross and Moose were defeated by Edwards and Tommy Dreamer in an impromptu tag match. In the main event, Kross and Moose were in the corner of Aries as he lost the Impact World Championship to Johnny Impact.\nAfter his alliance with Aries ended, Kross entered a storyline with Impact, in which Kross told Impact that he needed him to keep up Impact's title run much longer. At Homecoming on January 6, 2019, Kross attacked both Impact and his wife Taya Valkyrie after the main event. On the January 25 episode of Impact!, Kross challenged Impact for the World Championship, however, the match ended in a double disqualification. At Impact Wrestling: Uncaged, Kross lost a fatal four-way for the title that also featured Moose and Brian Cage. Kross then entered into a feud with Eddie Edwards in May after Kross destroyed a kendo stick that was gifted to Edwards by Tommy Dreamer. This resulted in them wrestling in hardcore matches such as a street fight and first blood match.\nOn May 13, it was reported that Kross asked for his release from Impact Wrestling following contract renegotiations. His issue stemmed from problems with his creative direction, as well as his current pay per appearance deal. He was not released at the time. At Slammiversary XVII on July 7, Kross lost a first blood match to Eddie Edwards, where he reportedly refused to do a blade job and they used fake blood instead. Reports indicated there was concern over \"lack of blood testing and the absence of an on-site doctor.\" Following that match, he was not booked to appear at the July, August or September television tapings and the two sides continued to negotiate. It was reported that his contract was set to expire in December but that the company had the option to roll it over for another year. In December, Impact Wrestling released Kross from his contract.\n\n\nMajor League Wrestling (2020)\nKross made his debut for Major League Wrestling (MLW) at the Fightland event on February 1, 2020, where he defeated Tom Lawlor.\n\n\nWWE (2020–2021)\nBefore signing with WWE, Kesar made a one-off appearance on the February 16, 2015, episode of Raw as Kevin Kross, where he teamed with Darren Young to face The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor) in a match that resulted in a no contest.\nOn the February 4, 2020 episode of WWE Backstage, it was confirmed that Kross had signed with WWE. In the following weeks, mysterious video packages were shown that were later to be revealed about Kross, revealing his new look consisting of a shaved head and a goatee. On the April 8 episode of NXT, Kross and Scarlett (shortened from her former ring name Scarlett Bordeaux) were seen in a car watching Johnny Gargano following his match with Tommaso Ciampa. The following week, Kross debuted by attacking Ciampa. On the May 6 episode of NXT, under the new ring name Karrion Kross, he made his debut by defeating Leon Ruff in a squash match. At TakeOver: In Your House on June 7, Kross defeated Ciampa via technical submission. At TakeOver: XXX on August 22, he defeated Keith Lee to win the NXT Championship for the first time. However, the following day, WWE announced that Kross had suffered a separated shoulder during the match, and on the August 26 episode of NXT, he vacated the title; this ended his reign at only 4 days, making it the shortest in the title's history.\nOn the December 9 episode of NXT, Kross returned and attacked Damian Priest. At New Year's Evil on January 6, Kross defeated Priest. At the second night of TakeOver: Stand & Deliver on April 8, he defeated Finn Balor to win the NXT Championship for the second time. On the May 25 episode of NXT, Kross retained the title against Balor in his first title defense. On June 14 at In Your House, Kross successfully retained the championship by defeating Pete Dunne, Kyle O'Reilly, Johnny Gargano, and Adam Cole in a fatal 5-way match. On the July 14 episode of NXT, Kross faced Gargano to defend the NXT Championship with Samoa Joe as guest referee where he successfully retained. On August 22 at TakeOver 36, Kross lost the NXT Championship to Joe, suffering his first loss in NXT; this was his final match in NXT before he was moved to Raw.\nWhile he was NXT Champion, Kross made his main roster debut on the July 19 episode of Raw, where he was defeated by Jeff Hardy in a non-title match in less than two minutes, marking his first pinfall loss in WWE. Because of said result, many critics and audiences complained that it damaged the formidable character of Kross. According to Kross in an interview after his release, the match originally was supposed to last 10-minutes before being abruptly shortened to 90 seconds just after he made his entrance to the ring. After losing the NXT Championship, Kross was transferred to Raw on its August 23 episode, performing without Scarlett and debuting a new look where he wore a gladiator helmet and suspenders in his entrance; his new attire and character direction was further criticized, with many deeming these changes unnecessary and poorly thought out. WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley talked about WWE's problems, saying that Kross' character was \"greatly watered down and even made a joke of when they debut on the main roster.\" Foley's comments were supported by another WWE Hall of Famer, Booker T. On November 4, Kross and Scarlett were released from their WWE contracts, ending their one-year tenure with the company.\n\n\nReturn to MLW (2022)\nIn February 2022, Kross made his return to MLW, where he was absent for 2 years.

Kross returned during the Collision 2022 tapings, defeating Yuya Uemura.\n\n\nReturn to WWE (2022–2025)\n\nKesar made his unannounced return to WWE as Karrion Kross on the August 5, 2022 episode of SmackDown, now sporting a longer hair; accompanied by Scarlett, he attacked Drew McIntyre at the end of the show and officially joined the SmackDown brand. Kross defeated McIntyre in a strap match at Extreme Rules, but was defeated at Crown Jewel in a steel cage match. As part of the 2023 WWE Draft, Kross and Scarlett were drafted to the SmackDown brand.\nAfter a four-month hiatus, Kross made his return on the December 8 Tribute to the Troops special episode of SmackDown, taking part in the United States Championship #1 Contender Tournament, where he lost in the first round to Bobby Lashley. On SmackDown: New Year's Revolution, Kross, accompanied by Scarlett, the Authors of Pain (AOP) and Paul Ellering, attacked Bobby Lashley and the Street Profits, creating the Final Testament stable. On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Kross participated in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by Lashley, which caused Kross to return to the ring to eliminate Lashley in retaliation. At Night 2 of WrestleMania XL, the Final Testament was defeated by The Pride (a stable formed by Lashley and Street Profits) in a Philadelphia Street Fight ending their feud.\nDuring night 2 of the WWE Draft, which occurred on April 29, 2024, The Final Testament was drafted to WWE Raw. He, along with the rest of the Final Testament, began feuding with The New Day, attempting to drive a wedge between Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston, claiming that Kingston had been preventing from Woods from achieving success as a singles competitor, leading to several bouts between the factions. The feud concluded on the August 19 episode of Raw when The Final Testament lost to The New Day and Odyssey Jones in a Six-Man Tag Team Match. On February 7, 2025, The Final Testament disbanded after AOP and Paul Ellering were released from their WWE Contracts, leaving Kross and Scarlett the only members left.\nAfter the disbandment of The Final Testament, Kross would be involved in backstage segments where he would try and convince various superstars to embrace their dark side, with the character being called \"The Devil's Advocate\" (inspired by Sean O'Haire and Kevin Sullivan's characters), some of whom include Sami Zayn and AJ Styles. Kross would go on to appear in Styles’ match against Logan Paul at WrestleMania 41, preventing interference from a member of Paul’s entourage. Kross would attempt to persuade Styles to hit Paul with brass knuckles, to no avail, after which Styles proceeded to lose the match. Kross would appear later on the WrestleMania 41 recap show with Scarlett where he would cut a highly acclaimed shoot promo criticizing the company and his booking. The promo at the WrestleMania 41 recap show as well as the Devil's Advocate character gave him an increase of popularity, even being cheered as a heel against the babyface wrestler Sami Zayn at Night of Champions and SummerSlam. The SummerSlam bout would be Kross' final appearance in WWE, since he and Scarlett left WWE on August 10 following the expiry of their contracts which would not be renewed, thus ending their second tenure of three years with the company. After departing from WWE, Kross, in an out-of-character interview, revealed that he was only given twenty four hours to sign his new contract offer, which did not include Scarlett re-signing along with him, ultimately leading to his decision to depart the company.\n\n\nSecond return to independent circuit (2025–present)\nKesar, as Karrion Kross, made his return to GCW on April 17, 2025 at Josh Barnett's Bloodsport XIII, where he defeated J. R. Kratos. On August 23 at GCW Homecoming, Kesar, as Killer Kross, and Scarlett made their first post-WWE appearance, where they attacked Matt Cardona.

    "text": "The Islamic New Year (Arabic: رأس السنة الهجرية, Raʿs as-Sanah al-Hijrīyah), also called the Hijri New Year, is the day that marks the beginning of a new lunar Hijri year, and is the day on which the year count is incremented. The first day of the Islamic year is observed by most Muslims on the first day of the month of Muharram. The epoch (reference date) of the Islamic era was set as the year of the emigration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijrah, which equates to 622 CE in the Gregorian calendar. All religious duties, such as prayer, fasting in the month of Ramadan, and pilgrimage, and the dates of significant events, such as celebration of holy nights and festivals, are calculated according to the Islamic calendar. Hijri New Year is observed by 24 countries as a public holiday.\nWhile some Islamic organizations prefer determining the new month (and hence the new year) by local sightings of the moon, most Islamic institutions and countries, including Saudi Arabia, follow astronomical calculations to determine future dates of the Islamic calendar. There are various schemas for calculating the tabular Islamic calendar (i.e. not based on observation), which results in differences of typically one or even two days between countries using such schema and those that use actual lunar sightings. For example, the Umm al-Qura calendar used in Saudi Arabia was reformed several times in recent years. The current scheme was introduced in 1423 AH (15 March 2002).\nA day in the Islamic calendar is defined as beginning at sunset. For example, 1 Muharram 1432 was defined to correspond to 7 or 8 December 2010 in civil calendars (depending on the country). For an observation-based calendar, a sighting of the new moon at sunset of 6 December would mean that 1 Muharram lasted from the moment of sunset of 6 December to the moment of sunset of 7 December, while in places where the new moon was not sighted on 6 December 1 Muharram would last from the moment of sunset of 7 December to the moment of sunset of 8 December.\n\n\nAlternative date\nTwelver Shia Muslims believe the Islamic new year is the first of Rabi' al-Awwal rather than Muharram, due to it being the month in which the Hijrah took place. This has led to difference regarding description of the years in which some events took place, such as the Muharram-occurring battle of Karbala, which Shias say took place in 60 AH, while Sunnis say it took place in 61 AH.\n\n\nGregorian correspondence\n\nSince the Islamic lunar year is eleven to twelve days shorter than the solar year as approximated by the  Gregorian calendar, the Islamic New Year does not occur on the same Gregorian calendar date every year.\nThe following dates beyond the current year are the Gregorian calendar dates are predicted to correspond with 1 Muharram (Islamic new year), according to Saudi Arabia's Umm al-Qura calendar. (Dates calculated according to the tabular Islamic calendar may differ from the Umm al-Qura calendar dates by one or even two days on either side, because the motions of the sun and moon are not strictly linear and because observation methods and locations differ.)\n\n\nSee also\nSolar Hijri calendar#New Year's Day\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nCalendar converters\n\nBeers, T.S.

He served throughout the First World War, mainly on the Western Front in France and Belgium and, after being promoted to captain in 1915, he ended the war having been mentioned in despatches and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1919, the same year in which he married.\nThe interwar period saw Reeve remain in the army and transferred to the Royal Artillery, which was followed by attendance and subsequent graduation from the Staff College, Camberley, from 1924 to 1925, where Noel Irwin, Douglas Graham, Vyvyan Pope and Thomas Riddell-Webster were among his many fellow students that year who ultimately became general officers. Following this, he served from 1926 to 1930 as a staff officer at the War Office in London before transferring from the Royal Artillery back to the Rifle Brigade, where he commanded the regiment's 1st Battalion from 1936 to 1938. 1938 saw him promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier and placed in command of the Hong Kong Infantry Brigade in Hong Kong. He held this position until late 1941, two years after the outbreak of the Second World War.\nReturning to the United Kingdom, Reeve became Deputy Adjutant General with Home Forces from 1942 to 1943, the same year in which, on 15 May, he was promoted to the acting rank of major-general. He then became commander of Sussex District until 1944 when he was made Deputy Adjutant General with Middle East Command, then commanded by General Sir Bernard Paget. He held this post until 1946 when, after more than thirty-five years of military service, he retired from the army and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.\n\n\nPersonal life\nHis only son having been killed in action in the North African campaign in 1942, his wife died soon after Reeve's retirement, in 1949. He married again the following year and retired to Bury St Edmonds in Suffolk, where he spent the rest of his life until his death on 25 June 1983, at the age of 92.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nSmart, Nick (2005).

    "text": "Avoch (  OKH; from the Scottish Gaelic: Abhach – meaning mouth of the stream) is a harbour-village located on the south-east coast of the Black Isle, on the Moray Firth.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nOrigins\nOrmond Castle or Avoch Castle was a stronghold built on the site and served as a royal castle to William the Lion; passed on to the Morays of Petty then Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway, upon his marriage to Joanna de Moravia in 1362. Descendants of Archibald, were to take the title of Earl of Ormonde from the castle. Legend has it that the village was founded by survivors of the Spanish Armada in 1588.\n\n\nEstate owners\n\n\nPittonachy, Rosehaugh and Scatwell\nAvoch was in the control of David Chalmers, Lord Ormond from 1560/61 but he forfeited his castle and control of Avoch in 1568 when he was exiled due to his part in assisting the escape of Mary Queen of Scots. The castle and village then passed to Andrew Munro of Milntown. In the late 16th century the Munro of Pittonachy family held the estate of Pittonachy in the parish until Hugh Munro, III of Pittonachy (d.1670) sold it. It then became a property of the Mackenzies who renamed it Rosehaugh. George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh was the first of his family to hold the estate. He was succeeded by his son, also called George Mackenzie, who left an only daughter who died without issue and thus the Mackenzie of Rosehaugh branch became extinct in the male line. In 1688, the estate was purchased from Mackenzie of Rosehaugh by Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, IV of Scatwell, a family originally from the parish of Contin. Kenneth's son, Roderick Mackenzie, built a new mansion called Rosehaugh House, although in Alexander Mackenzie's 19th century history it was still referred to by the old Munro name of \"Pittonachty\" (Pittonachy). This mansion was demolished in 1959.\nMackenzie of Scatwell who owned the estate during the Jacobite rising of 1745 refused to raise his men for the Jacobite cause despite being threatened with military execution by the Jacobite George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie. Scatwell was apparently happy that Cromartie therefore did not return from his expedition to Sutherland.\n\n\nRoyston\nThe other estate in the parish of Avoch was the Royston Estate which was owned by James Mackenzie, Lord Royston (died 1744) who was the fourth son of George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie (died 1714). James Mackenzie, Lord Royston married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh but their only son, George, predeceased him. When James Mackenzie, Lord Royston died in 1744 he was survived by two daughters, Anne who married but without issue and Elizabeth who married Sir John Stewart of Grandtully with issue. According to contemporary documents, the Royston estate rental records of Avoch, in 1747 the estate was then held by Lord Royston's grandson, John Stewart. In 1826, the dormant male Baronetcy of Royston was assumed by a descendant of the Mackenzies of Cromarty and Tarbat, Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Mackenzie. He died in 1841 without issue and so was succeeded by his younger brother, Sir James Sutherland Mackenzie, who also died unmarried in 1858 and the Baronetcy of Royston became dormant again. Upon his death the baronetcy should have gone to his cousin John Mackenzie, but he did not assume the title.\n\n\nSir Alexander Mackenzie\nIntrepid Scottish explorer in Canada Sir Alexander Mackenzie, the first European to explore the great Canadian river now known as the Mackenzie River, crossing North America twice, to the Arctic Ocean in 1789 and Pacific Ocean in 1793, retired to Avoch in 1812 where he died in 1820 and was buried in the old Avoch Parish churchyard.\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nIndustry\nMuch of Avoch's wealth has come from its fishing industry, and it remains a significant contributor to the village economy, with several large fishing boats owned or crewed from Avoch and an active fishermen's co-operative based there. The harbour is no longer used by the larger boats for landing but is used by leisure craft and boats taking visitors to see the dolphins in the inner Moray Firth at Chanonry Point. In addition to the fishing industry, commuting to Inverness and tourism provide income to the village.  Lazy Corner, named for the youngsters who gathered there to pass the time, has been moved by the road widening in the Eighties, and spruced up by a sculpture intended to add character to the village.  It is still a gathering place.\n\n\nSee also\nClootie well\nRosehaugh House\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nLamb, W. Kaye (1983). \"Mackenzie, Sir Alexander\". In Halpenny, Francess G. (ed.).

    "text": "Taylor v. Standard Gas and Electric Company, 306 U.S. 307 (1939), was an important United States Supreme Court case in United States corporate law that laid down the \"Deep Rock doctrine\" as a rule of bankruptcy and corporate law. This holds that claims, as creditors, upon an insolvent subsidiary company by controlling shareholders or other insiders, like managers or directors, will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors.\n\n\nFacts\nThe Deep Rock Oil Corporation was an undercapitalized subsidiary of the defendant Standard Gas Company.\n\n\nJudgment\nThe Supreme Court held that, where a subsidiary corporation declares bankruptcy and an insider or controlling shareholder of that subsidiary corporation asserts claims as a creditor against the subsidiary, loans made by the insider to the subsidiary corporation may be deemed to receive the same treatment as shares of stock owned by the insider.\nTherefore, the insider's claims will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors, i.e. other creditors will be paid first, and if there is nothing left after other creditors are paid then the insider gets nothing. This also applies (and indeed the doctrine was first established) where a parent company asserts such claims against its own subsidiary.\nThe doctrine will be applied where equity requires, particularly where the subsidiary was undercapitalized at the time that it was established, and can thereby be shown to have been mismanaged for the parent corporation's benefit.\n\n\nSee also\nUS corporate law\n\n\nExternal links\nText of Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., 306 U.S. 307 (1939) is available from: Justia  Library of Congress",

    "text": "White pudding, oatmeal pudding or (in Scotland) mealy pudding is a meat dish in Great Britain and Ireland.\nWhite pudding is broadly similar to black pudding, but does not include blood. Modern recipes consist of suet or fat, oatmeal or barley, breadcrumbs and in some cases pork and pork liver, filled into a natural or cellulose sausage casing. Recipes in previous centuries included a wider range of ingredients.\n\n\nHistory and recipes\nWhite pudding is often thought of as a very old dish that, like black pudding, was a traditional way of making use of offal following the annual slaughter of livestock. Whereas black pudding-type recipes appear in Roman sources, white pudding likely has specifically medieval origins, possibly as a culinary descendant of medieval sweetened blancmange-type recipes combining shredded chicken, rice and almonds, or as a way of lightening up offal with the addition of cream, eggs and breadcrumbs. Meatless versions were common, as they could be eaten during the Lenten period of abstinence. Many older recipes are sweetened: a 15th-century British pudding combined pork liver, cream, eggs, breadcrumbs, raisins and dates, while a 1588 recipe collection featured a white pudding made of beef suet, breadcrumbs, egg yolk and currants, flavoured with nutmeg, sugar and cinnamon. A similar recipe given in Woolley's 1670 book The Queen-Like Closet used hog's lights and was filled into intestine sausage-skins. By the mid-18th century, Elizabeth Raffald's white pudding recipe, \"White Puddings in Skins\", combined rice, lard, ground almonds, currants and egg, using sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and mace as flavourings; by this period the inclusion of offal such as liver or lights, as well as sweet flavourings, was becoming rarer.\nAn oatmeal pudding recipe found in the 18th-century Compleat Housewife is made with beef suet and cream, thickened with oatmeal and mixed up with egg yolks, then baked in a dish with marrow.\nAlongside these more refined and elaborate recipes, a simpler form of white pudding was popular in Ireland, Scotland, the West Country and some parts of Northern England, combining suet, oatmeal (or barley in Northumberland), seasoning and onions, in sheep's or cow's intestines. In Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland and Ireland, they were referred to by the names marag gheal or putóg bhán. These oatmeal-based puddings survived into modern Irish and Scottish cuisine, although with significant regional differences. In Cornwall and Devon, these are either Hog's or Groats pudding depending on the fineness or coarseness of texture. Modern commercially made Scottish white puddings are generally based on oatmeal, onions and beef suet; the same mixture simply fried in a pan is known as skirlie. In Ireland, white puddings also include a substantial proportion of pork or pork liver and pork fat. Most modern white puddings are filled into a synthetic cellulose casing and boiled or steamed; typical spices used include white pepper, nutmeg and sage.\n\n\nPreparation\nWhite pudding may be cooked whole, or cut into slices and fried or grilled.  Irish white pudding is an important feature of the traditional Irish breakfast. Scottish white pudding is often served, like skirlie, with minced beef and potatoes, or is available deep fried in many chip shops.\n\n\nRegional variants\n \nWhite puddings were once also associated with south-western England: Taylor, in the 17th century, mentions \"the white puddings of Somersetshire\". Hog's pudding, still made in Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, is very similar to other white puddings although is somewhat more highly spiced.\nAnother Scottish variant, fruit pudding, includes dried fruit in addition to beef suet and oatmeal.\n\n\nSee also\n\nBoudin\nGoetta\nHaggis\nRed pudding\nScrapple\nWeißwurst\nList of Irish dishes\n\n\nReferences",

The basis of their formation was the 77th Tengisky infantry regiment who possessed a similar uniform. They were sent as part of the expedition to Holland in 1799. They were sent to Hanover as part of the Hanover Expedition in 1805 and participated in the War of the Fourth Coalition as well. They took part in the Battle of Czarnowo, where they repulsed the second French attack and under the command of Major Palibin and Lieutenant Colonel Lokhov recaptured a height on the Russian left, dislodging the French in hand-to-hand fighting and recapturing a light battery. The battle of Czarnowo is also where the regiment is known to have distinguished themselves in the fighting.\nTheir participation in the Battle of Eylau included flanking the French under Major Makhov and Captain Panov, utilising a battalion and two companies respectively. They turned back a cavalry charge from Murat's horsemen and captured multiple prisoners, and went on to repulse attacks from Moran, Saint-Illaire and Gudin's divisions.\nWith the regiment's battalions effectively dispersed across the 3rd Infantry corps under Tuchkov's 1st Western Army and the 32nd infantry division, they fought in numerous battles.\nThe Battle of Klyastitsy is among their distinguishing moments. Under Captain Kyrlov, the 2nd battalion pursued the dislodged French, who had set fire to the only bridge across the Nischu river. They stormed the bridge regardless and continued a pursuit of the French infantry, routing them off the field at bayonet point.\nTheir contributions to the Battle of Borodino were made in the fight against V Corps, initially repulsing them from the Utitska village and heavily damaging a French column in the fighting.\nOn the day of April 13, 1813, they were given the title of Pavlovsky Life-Guard for the courage rendered in the Patriotic war.\n\n\nCampaigns\n1799–1813\nFrench Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\n1828–1829\nRusso-Turkish War\n1831\nPolish campaign\n1863–1864\nPolish campaign\n1877–1878\nRusso-Turkish War\n1914–1917\nFirst World War\n\n\nCommanders\nDmitry Neverovsky\nRichard Troyanovich Meves\n\n\nMemorials\nThere is a memorial to the Pavlovsky regiment at Borodino's fields.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nGorokhoff, Gerard.

Ethiopian runner Gebregziabher Gebremariam won the men's race in a time of two hours, eight minutes and fourteen seconds on his debut performance over the distance. Edna Kiplagat of Kenya took first place in the women's race with her winning time of 2:28:20.\nThe pre-race favorite for the men's competition was Haile Gebrselassie, the marathon world record holder. However, he dropped out in the final ten miles (16 km) of the race due to a knee injury and later declared that he was retiring from competition, bringing a close to one of the most successful careers in long-distance running which included eight world titles and 27 world best marks.\nIn the wheelchair races, Great Britain's David Weir (1:37:29) and America's Tatyana McFadden (2:02:22) won the men's and women's divisions, respectively. In the handcycle race, Americans Dane Pilon (1:21:23) and Helene Hines (2:02:16) were the winners.\nAmong the fun runners in the marathon event was Edison Peña, a Chilean miner who was saved from the 2010 Copiapó mining accident the previous month. He was invited to the competition as he had used running as a means of maintaining hope during the 69-day period he spent underground. He completed the distance in 5 hours, 40 minutes, 51 seconds.\nA total of 44,704 runners finished the race, 28,661 men and 16,043 women.",

    "text": "William Duckett White (1807–1893) was a squatter and politician in Queensland, Australia. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council.\n\n\nEarly life\nWilliam White was born into a large Quaker family on 5 October 1807 in Moate, County Westmeath, Ireland and was educated at the Quaker school in Mountmellick in County Laois. In 1835 William married Jane Simpson from Cork.\n\n\nPastoral career\nWilliam and Jane White and their two children emigrated from Ireland to Sydney as assisted immigrants in 1840. When he arrived in Australia, William assumed his grandmother's maiden name as a second Christian name, and became known thereafter as William Duckett White. From 1842 to 1844 White taught school in the Mangrove area north of Sydney until accepting an offer in 1845 to manage the Beau Desert pastoral run in the Moreton Bay District for his cousin Joseph Phelps Robinson. When Robinson died in 1848, his brother George Robinson and W.D. White took over the lease of Beau Desert, one of the largest runs on the Logan River. In 1857, White left Beau Desert under the management of his son Ernest White and William, and with his wife Jane and their daughter Helena moved to Eagle Farm near Brisbane.\n\nThe Robinson-White partnership acquired the leases of many cattle runs in Queensland. In addition to the Beau Desert lease they took up three runs in the Gold Coast hinterland in the early 1850s: Tubber in 1852 and Murry Jerry and Dungogie runs in 1853. In 1867 they took up the lease of Pimpama and Cumboomba (or Coombabah) runs in the Beenleigh area but these were thrown open for selection in 1869, and the lease forfeited. In 1871 White and partner William Barker leased the runs of Kerry, Sarabah, and Nindooinbah adjacent to Beau Desert. Much of Beau Desert was cut up for closer settlement in the 1860s and early 1870s following which WD White and his sons acquired the Bluff Downs leases in the Kennedy District. From 1882 the W.D. Whites & Sons formed a partnership with William Collins, Sir Malcolm McEachern, and Sir Simon Fraser. This partnership, called White Collins & Co., leased Beaudesert North, Eulolo, and Glen Ormiston and survived for about a century. The White partnership also owned land in Tingalpa (Lota) and town properties in Beenleigh and Southport.\n\n\nLota House\n\nLota House was erected on the Tingalpa land in 1865–66 and on completion it was transferred to W.D.White's wife Jane. Jane owned Lota House until her death in 1887 and bequeathed it to their son Albert with a proviso that it remain William's home for his lifetime. William died at Lota House in 1893 and is buried alongside Jane in the Tingalpa churchyard. \n\n\nPolitics\nWhite was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on 26 April 1861. Although a lifetime appointment, he resigned from the Council on 5 August 1880.\n\n\nLater life\nWD White was active in the local community, being one of the first members of the Bulimba Divisional Board established in 1879–80, a warden of the Tingalpa Anglican Church (now Christ Church, Tingalpa).\nWhite died 11 August 1893 at Lota House. He was buried in Tingalpa Cemetery (Christ Church, Tingalpa) on Saturday 12 August 1893.\n\n\nSee also\nMembers of the Queensland Legislative Council, 1860–1869; 1870-1879; 1880-1889\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAttribution\n This Wikipedia article incorporates text from \"The Queensland heritage register\" published by the State of Queensland under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 7 July 2014, archived on 8 October 2014).\n\n\nFurther reading\nWhite, Michael William Duckett, 1939- (1990), An early settler, the Duckett White family in Australia, Hennessy Investments, ISBN 978-0-646-01816-4{{citation}}:  CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link) CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n\n\nExternal links\n\nE.

    "text": "The Bataan-Cavite Interlink Bridge, also known as the Manila Bay Bridge, is a planned bridge that will cross Manila Bay and connect the provinces of Bataan and Cavite in the Philippines. Construction is expected to begin in 2025.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nBackground and early proposals\nBataan 1st district representative Felicito Payumo first proposed the construction of a bridge crossing Manila Bay in 1987, which he named as the \"Trans Manila Bay Crossing\".\nAs chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), Payumo attempted to realize the Trans Manila Bay Crossing as a bridge–tunnel system in the early 2000s. At least two Japanese firms, Itochu and NKK presented feasibility studies for the bridge–tunnel link to the SBMA but such plans were never realized.\nIn 2016, Payumo revived the proposal again, pitching the bridge as means to decongest traffic in Metro Manila and boost the economy. Comparing the proposed bridge to the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, Payumo has noted that commuters in Cavite and other parts of Southern Luzon do not need to pass through Metro Manila to reach Central Luzon if such bridge would be built.\nThe China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) began its onsite study as preparation for the possible construction of the bridge in late 2017. Its team first visited the coastal towns in Bataan.\n\n\nApproval\nThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) approved the bridge project in early 2020 with a budget of ₱175.7 billion. The implementation of the bridge project is projected to last six years.\nIn October 2020, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) signed a $59 million engineering design contract, awarded to the joint venture of T. Y. Lin International from the US and Korea's Pyunghwa Engineering Consultants Ltd., who are working in tandem with Geneva-based Renardet S.A. and local firm DCCD Engineering Corporation.\nBy March 2023, the project's detailed engineering design was already 70% complete, according to the DPWH. The construction of the bridge was targeted to start in 2024 before being moved to 2025.\n\n\nConstruction\nThe Bataan–Cavite Interlink Bridge, envisioned to be one of the world's longest marine bridges, is estimated to cost $3.91 billion to construct. The amount is set to be bankrolled through a multi-tranche financing scheme under which $2.1 billion will be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) while $1.14 billion will be co-financed by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The remaining $664.23 million will be funded by the Philippine government.\nOn December 12, 2023, the ADB announced it has approved the $2.1 billion funding it promised for the construction of this bridge. On December 15 of the same year, the Philippine government, through the Department of Finance (DOF), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed the first tranche of the financing for this project, worth $650 million of the total $2.1 billion loan package. On the other hand, AIIB announced that their share of first tranche funding, worth $350 million, will be available to the Philippine government by January 2024.\nOn May 22, 2024, AIIB announced that the loan for the bridge was approved, with a total cost of US$1.14 billion.\nConstruction was projected to start around 2024. The bidding process for the first package is set to begin in January 2024. Construction of the bridge is estimated to take five years to complete.  \nThe detailed engineering design of the mega bridge project and the bidding of the initial contract package has been completed and is planned to be funded through an official development assistance (ODA). The construction's planned starting schedule has been moved to early or mid 2025. \n\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Bataan–Cavite Interlink Bridge will span approximately 32.15 km (19.98 mi) in total length, of which around 26 km (16 mi) will traverse the waters of Manila Bay. The four-lane, dual carriageway bridge system will connect Barangay Alas-asin in Mariveles, Bataan, to Barangay Timalan Balsahan in Naic, Cavite.\nThe project includes two main cable-stayed bridges—the North Channel Bridge and the South Channel Bridge—along with 23.5 km (14.6 mi) of marine viaducts, a minor nearshore navigation bridge, and approach roads on both ends. A turnaround interchange is planned near Corregidor Island, and a future connection to the island has been considered, though it is not included in the bridge project.\nThe North Channel Bridge will span a 300 m (980 ft) wide shipping lane between the Bataan coast and Corregidor Island. It will feature two 142 m (466 ft) tall towers, a main span of 400 m (1,300 ft), and a vertical clearance of 40.5 m (133 ft) to accommodate maritime traffic. The South Channel Bridge, considerably larger, will cross the 750 m (2,460 ft) wide deep-water channel between Caballo Island and the Cavite shoreline. It will include two 304 m (997 ft) tall towers, a main span of 900 m (3,000 ft), and provide 72.3 m (237 ft) of vertical clearance.\nIn addition, a 315 m (1,033 ft) long nearshore navigation bridge will be constructed closer to the Cavite coast, with a 150 m (490 ft) clear span and 25 m (82 ft) of clearance, enabling passage for Philippine Coast Guard vessels and large fishing boats through a newly established 90 m (300 ft) wide navigation channel.\nThe marine viaduct segments will maintain a standard elevation of 21 m (69 ft) above sea level, with 100 m (330 ft) spans in deeper waters and 60 m (200 ft) spans in shallower areas, ensuring unrestricted access for small fishing vessels and traditional boats. A vehicle turnaround interchange supported by piles will be located near Corregidor Island to provide emergency access and traffic management flexibility.\nThe Bataan approach road will be approximately 5.9 km (3.7 mi) long, beginning near the Mariveles Freeport Area and connecting to the Roman Superhighway via a trumpet interchange. It will include two underpasses for local access, a 100 m (330 ft) bridge over a gully, and transition to a coastal viaduct approximately 200 m (660 ft) inland. A Bridge Monitoring and Maintenance Compound will be built along this segment and will be serve for bridge's maintenance and support.\nOn the Cavite side, the approach road will extend for about 1.3 km (0.81 mi), terminating at a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Antero Soriano Highway. Provisions have been included for a potential future link to the Cavite–Laguna Expressway\n\n\nReferences",

It was conducted in specific academic (e.g., scientific, literary) or vocational streams.\nAs of the 2024–2025 academic year, the Jordanian Ministry of Education restructured the system. Tawjihi is now a two-year program covering Grades 11 and 12, with students selecting either academic or vocational (BTEC) tracks in Grade 9.\n\nIn Grade 11, students sit ministerial exams in common subjects: Arabic, English, Jordanian history, and Islamic studies. The Grade 11 average contributes approximately 30% toward the final Tawjihi score.\nThe remaining 70% comes from Grade 12 assessments based on student-selected subjects. Students pick six subjects, four of which are examined, depending on the chosen field in the second semester of Grade 11.\nThe main fields and required subjects (examined subjects only) are:\n\nMedical/Health: Chemistry, English, Biology, optional\nEngineering: Math, Physics, two optional subjects\nTechnology: Math, three optional subjects\nLanguages and Social Sciences: Specialized Arabic, Advanced English, two optional subjects\nLaw and Legislative Science: Specialized Arabic, Specialized Islamic Studies, two optional subjects\nBusiness: Business Mathematics, Financial Literacy, Advanced English, one optional subject\nStudents who fail a Grade 11 subject may retake it in Grade 12 without affecting university eligibility.\nAdmission to higher education is determined by Tawjihi scores. Competitive fields, such as medicine and engineering, generally require high averages (typically 85% or above). The restructured Tawjihi program began in the 2024–2025 academic year; the first cohort under this system will graduate in 2026.\n\n\nOptional Subjects\nStudents may select optional subjects from the following list (no duplicates allowed):  \n\nMathematics\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\nGeology\nArabic/Specialized\nIslamic Studies/Specialized\nEnglish Language/Advanced\nScience of Society and Psychology\nBusiness Mathematics\nFinancial Literacy\nHistory\nGeography\nAll students are required to take \"Digital Skills,\" which is examined by the school and does not count toward the four selected optional subjects.\n\n\nJordanian Tawjihi Equivalency\nForeign secondary education programs such as the General Certificate of Education (GCE), SAT, and International Baccalaureate (IB) may be recognized as Tawjihi-equivalent. The Ministry of Higher Education converts foreign grades to Tawjihi-equivalent grades. Non-Tawjihi graduates compete under a 5% quota for public university places.\n\n\nGCE/IGCSE/GCSE Equivalency\nProof of 12 years of schooling required.\nPass six O-level/IGCSE/GCSE subjects and two A-level subjects.\nO-level/IGCSE/GCSE: A, B, C, D\nA-level/AS: A, B, C, D, E\nArab students must include Arabic at O or A level (Modern Arabic, First Language Arabic, or Arabic 9164).

    "text": "The Romani people in Greece, or Romá (Greek: Ρομάνι/Ρομά), are called Tsinganoi  (Greek: Τσιγγάνοι), Athinganoi (Αθίγγανοι),  or the more derogatory term Gyftoi (Greek: Γύφτοι). On 8 April 2019, the Greek government stated that the number of Romani citizens in Greece is around 110,000. Other estimates have placed the number of Romani people resident in Greece as high as 350,000.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nOrigin\n\nThe ancestors of the Romani people originated in South Asia, likely from the regions of present-day Punjab, Rajasthan and Sindh. Linguistic evidence has shown that roots of Romani language lie in what is now India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indo-Aryan languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines. The language has been significantly influenced by contact with other languages, particularly Persian, Armenian, Byzantine Greek. It's grammar and phonology also reflect South Slavic influence.\n\n\nArrival in Europe\nA number of words in the Romani language originating from early Armenian indicate that Romanies were in Armenia prior to linguistic changes of the 9th century. From Armenia, they migrated through Anatolia, before arriving in the Balkans—Europe proper—during the Byzantine period. They are believed to have been present in Constantinople by the 9th century, possibly as early as the 7th century. The shift in the self-identification of the Romani people from \"Doma\" to \"Roma\"/\"Romani\" is believed to have taken place during the Romanies' arrival and settlement in the Balkans during the Byzantine era. \"Roma\"/\"Romani\" is believed to have been influenced by the Medieval Greek word Romaios, meaning Eastern Roman—inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire.\nThe name Gypsy (Gyftos = Γύφτος) sometimes used for the Romani people was first given to them by the Greeks, who supposed them to be Egyptian in origin. Due to their nomadic nature, they are not concentrated in a specific geographical area, but are dispersed all over the country. The majority of the Romanies in Greece yet are Hellenized and Orthodox Christians who speak the Romani language in addition to Greek, or the Romano-Greek language, like the Finikas Romika. There are several other dialects spoken by the Roma In Greece, as the Agios Athanasios-Balkan Romani, the Parakalamos-Romacilikanes, or the Volos Sevlengere Roma. Mostly Muslim Roma who live in Western Thrace speak Turkish and the Rumelian Romani dialect. Sedentary Romanies from the Serres region believe their Ancestors were once taken from Egypt by the Ottomans in 1517 to work of the Land of Turkish Feudallords in Rumelia. Also in Evliya Çelebi's Seyahatname of 1668, he mentioned that, at the time, the Roma from Komotini (Gümülcine) swore their Ancestors came from Egypt. Banyan merchants came once via Indo-Roman trade relations and settled there for a while in Roman Egypt, so their Ancestors may be Doms in Egypt.\n\n\nMigration to Turkey\n\nDuring the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, different Muslim Turkish Roma groups from Greece, like the Tütünčides (Tobacco traders/workers) or the Sepetčides (Basketmakers) moved to Turkey, and were called Mübadil Romanlar.\n\n\nSettlements\nThe Roma in Greece live scattered on the whole territory of the country, mainly in the suburbs. Notable centres of Romani life in Athens are Agia Varvara which has a very successful Romani community and Ano Liosia where conditions are poorer. Roma largely maintain their own customs and traditions. Although a large number of Roma has adopted a sedentary and urban way of living, there are still settlements in some areas. The nomads at the settlements often differentiate themselves from the rest of the population. They number 200,000 according to the Greek government. According to the National Commission for Human Rights that number is closer to 250,000 and according to the Greek Helsinki Watch group to 300,000.\nAs a result of neglect by the state, among other factors, the Romani communities in Greece face several problems including high rates of child labour and abuse, low school attendance, police discrimination and drug trafficking. The most serious issue is the housing problem since many Roma in Greece still live in tents, on properties they do not own, making them subject to eviction. In the past decade these issues have received wider attention and some state funding.\nOn two occasions, the European Committee of Social Rights found Greece in violation of the European Social Charter by its policy towards Roma in the field of housing. Furthermore, between 1998-2002, 502 Albanian Roma children disappeared from the Greek Foundation for children Agia Varvara. These cases were not investigated by the Greek authorities until the European Union forced an investigation, which only led to the recovery of 4 children. The children who were sold were presumably sold to human traffickers for sexual slavery or organ harvesting, according to a report submitted by the Greek government to the European Commission.\n\n\nReligion\nThe majority of the Romanies in Greece are Orthodox Christian like the groups Medvedara (Bear-leader), Katsiveli, Fitsiria, Mandopolini etc., while a small part of them, the Erli/Erlides (Greek: Ερλίδες), and Tourkogyftos are Muslim Roma concentrated in Western Thrace.\n\n\nNotable Roma from Greece\n\nManolis Angelopoulos, singer\nKostas Hatzis, singer and musician\nIrini Merkouri, singer\nChristos Patsatzoglou, football player (retired)\nVassilis Saleas, clarinetist\nEleni Vitali, singer and composer\nZafeiris Melas, singer\nPanagiotis Paiteris, football player\n\n\nSee also\n\nMinorities in Greece\nMuslim minority in Greece\nThe Blond Angel Case\nAncient Greece–Ancient India relations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nRoma in Greece, 1999",

    "text": "The shepherd's leap (Spanish: salto del pastor) is a folk sport practised throughout the Canary Islands.\n\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the shepherd's leap may date back to the Guanches, the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands prior to the Castilian conquest period of the early 15th century.  Canarian shepherds required a specialised means of transporting themselves safely across ravines and down steep embankments, and settled on the use of long wooden poles known as lanza or garrote. These poles are fitted with sharp metal points called regatón.\n\n\nDescription\nSalto del pastor practitioners have developed a wide range of techniques to facilitate quick and agile movement across extremely difficult and dangerous terrain. These techniques range from pole-vaulting across crevices to the \"dead drop\" in which the practitioner leaps into space from heights of up to eight metres (26 ft), jamming the pole into the ground below and then sliding down the pole. There are many other types of leaps, depending on the nature of the obstacle to be cleared. Some of these are sufficiently dangerous to have given rise to legends such as the salto del enamorado (lover's leap) and the salto de media luna (half moon leap).\n\n\nDevelopment\nAs the shepherd's leap has now developed into a folk-sport, the pole is also used in competitive events, which include climbing up and jumping over walls, speedy descents down steep rocks, precision leaps, and acrobatic feats.\n\n\nOther data\nThe lance of the shepherd is part of the iconographic attributes of Saint Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur, who is the first saint of the Canary Islands. This is because said Saint was a pastor or peasant before becoming a missionary in Guatemala.\n\n\nSee also\nFierljeppen\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWeb oficial de la Federación de Salto del Pastor Canario\nPatronato de Turismo, Salto del Pastor Canario\nCurso de Salto del Pastor Canario\nWeb del Gobierno de Canarias sobre juegos y deportes tradicionales\nDetalles de construcción de garrotes",

    "text": "Charles Edward William Sheringham (born 17 April 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Snodland Town on dual-registration with Isthmian League North Division club Waltham Abbey. He is the son of former England forward Teddy Sheringham.\n\n\nClub career\n\n\nEarly career\nSheringham was born in Chingford, London, while his father Teddy was playing for Millwall. Sheringham followed in his father's footsteps by also progressing through Millwall's academy set–up, but he subsequently moved on to another of his father's former teams, Tottenham Hotspur. Having been released by \"Spurs\", Sheringham was given a trial at AFC Bournemouth which proved unsuccessful. On 11 October 2004, it was announced that the 16-year–old striker had been offered a trial at Championship side Ipswich Town. He was a member of the team that won the 2004–05 FA Youth Cup by beating Southampton 3–2 on aggregate on 23 April 2005 in front of a crowd of 14,889 at Portman Road, coming on as a 71st minute substitute for Danny Haynes. The young striker's performance impressed manager Joe Royle enough for him to be offered a one–year contract on 11 May 2005.\nHe was transferred to Charlton Athletic on a free transfer but failed to make an impact and was very soon released, after which he went on trial at Crystal Palace, playing several games for Kit Symons's reserve side. He impressed, and was kept on for the pre–season by manager Peter Taylor, scoring in a first team pre–season friendly at Stevenage Borough. He also impressed against the American Major League Soccer champions Los Angeles Galaxy which led to him being given a professional contract, on a month–by–month deal. He then impressed even further, and was given a full contract, lasting two years.\nOn 18 April 2007, Sheringham flew out to America with teammate Lewwis Spence to join Crystal Palace's feeder club Crystal Palace Baltimore on loan for four months, though he had to fly home early with a hairline fracture of the foot.\nSheringham was released at the end of the January 2008 transfer window without making a single first team appearance for \"The Eagles\". Following his release from Crystal Palace Sheringham headed to Denmark on an eight–day trial at Fremad Amager of the Danish 1st Division. The trial was set up by Teddy Sheringham, an old friend of Fremad Amager manager Jakob Friis-Hansen. However, the move fell through at the last minute.\n\n\nNon–League career\nFollowing the move to Denmark falling through, Sheringham had a brief, though successful, spell at Conference South side Cambridge City where he scored six league goals in only five league games. His impressive goal scoring tally attracted interest from fellow Conference South team Welling United and he signed for the club at the start of the 2008–09 season. Sheringham was Welling's top scorer that season, scoring 26 goals in all competitions of which 19 were in the league.\nSheringham then signed for another Conference South side, Bishop's Stortford on 15 May 2009. Once again he proved to be a great goal scorer by scoring 17 league goals in 28 league games for \"The Bishops\". His form attracted Conference side Histon and on 12 February 2010 Sheringham moved to Histon on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season. However, he failed to score in the loan period which saw him make 15 appearances for the club. On 17 June 2010, Sheringham signed for Conference South side Dartford. Here Sheringham rediscovered his goal scoring form, netting 30 league goals in 46 league games.\n\n\nFootball League career\n\n\nAFC Bournemouth\nHis impressive form for Dartford attracted interest from League One side Bournemouth. In October 2011 he signed for Bournemouth on an 18-month contract. He made his Football League debut for the south coast club on 25 October 2011, coming on as a late substitute, against Colchester United. He scored his first football league goal in his sixth appearance against Brentford on Boxing Day 2011. The game, which would end up being his last for Bournemouth, ended 1–1. Following the Brentford game Sheringham suffered a severe foot injury and underwent surgery in October 2012. On 20 March 2013, he rejoined Conference side Dartford on an initial one-month loan deal.

Rolling Stone magazine ranked it at number 119 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The song was featured in Final Destination Bloodlines.\n\n\nThe Isley Brothers\nIn performances around 1958, the Isley Brothers would typically end their shows with a cover version of Jackie Wilson's hit \"Lonely Teardrops\".  At one performance at the Uptown Theater in Philadelphia, lead singer Ronald Isley could see the audience standing and yelling their approval, so he extended the song by improvising a call-and-response around the words \"You know you make me wanna...\" \"Shout!\".    The group developed the song further in later performances and rehearsals, using a drawn out \"We-eee-ll\" copied from Ray Charles' \"I Got a Woman\".  On returning to New York City at the end of their engagement, they suggested to record producers Hugo & Luigi that they record the \"Shout!\" climax of the performance as a separate song. The producers agreed and suggested that the band invite friends to the recording studio to generate a party atmosphere.\nThe recording took place on July 29, 1959 at the RCA Victor Studios in New York City, with Hugo and Luigi choosing the studio musicians and the Isley Brothers inviting organist Herman Stephens.  Released by RCA Victor in August 1959, with the song split over both sides of the record, the single reached number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's first chart hit, and later the brothers' first gold single on the basis of its longevity. It reached number 44 in Canada. Ronald Isley later said that church groups wrote to radio stations asking them to stop playing the record, because of its use of a traditional black gospel sound.\n\n\nOther recordings\n\nOne month after the initial release, Johnny O'Keefe performed the song on his Australian TV show Six O'Clock Rock. He released it as a single, which reached number 2 in Australia. His 1964 re-recording was only a minor hit at number 49.\nJoey Dee and the Starliters reached number 6 with their recording of the song in 1962. It begins with Joey Dee quietly speaking his suggestion to do a little bit of \"Shout\" before he begins singing, in which the group only covers the first part of the song, omitting the \"Say you will\" portions as well. They also reworked the chorus portion of the song into an even bigger hit, \"Peppermint Twist\", while the Isley Brothers' version re-charted that same year at number 94.\nIn 1964, in the U.K., a version by Scottish pop singer Lulu reached number 7 (attributed to Lulu and the Luvvers). She re-recorded the song in 1986, and it reached number 8.\nIn 1968, The Chambers Brothers had a hit with the song which got to no. 83 nationally.\nIn 1977, 1978, and 1983 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers covered the song during live performances over these years.\nPolaroid used a version of the song, retitled \"Shoot\", in a 1990s-era ad campaign.\nThe National Football League (NFL)'s Buffalo Bills commissioned a version of \"Shout\" in 1987 with modified lyrics sung by jingle writer Scott Kemper. It has served as the team's official fight song ever since, except for a brief period in 1993 when Polaroid's worldwide licensing of the song for the aforementioned ad campaign led to a dispute over royalties, during which the team used a version of \"Shout! Shout!

    "title": "List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=25924054",
    "text": "The JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series features a large cast of characters created by Hirohiko Araki. Spanning several generations, the series is split into nine parts, each following a different descendant of the Joestar family. Parts 7-9 take place in a separate continuity from the previous six. Many of the characters have supernatural abilities which give them a variety of unique traits.\n\n\nCreation and conception\n\n\nPart 1: Phantom Blood\nWhen first beginning the series, Dio Brando is the character that Araki looked forward to drawing the most. Inspired by FBI profiling of serial killers and how they control their victims through psychological manipulation, he gave Dio a similar trait, using his charisma to ensure his followers do his bidding. Araki revealed that he had not thought up a weakness for the character and that it was difficult to come up with a way for Dio to be defeated. As the first Joestar, Araki created Jonathan Joestar to be \"a symbol of purity and dignity\", which he admitted might have resulted in him being \"boring\". Jonathan's physical transformation during the seven-year skip was done with his upcoming battle with Dio in mind and inspired by muscular film actors popular at the time, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. A fan of karate manga as a child, Araki also wanted JoJo to exude an aura of strength like in Karate Baka Ichidai, leading to the character learning the supernatural Hamon technique. As Jonathan's teacher, Araki modeled Will A. Zeppeli after martial arts masters in Jackie Chan movies and Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid, whose \"silly\" appearances hide their strength. Araki dressed him as a magician and modeled his mustache after those of Salvador Dalí and the character Iyami from Osomatsu-kun. The Zeppeli name is derived from the English rock band Led Zeppelin.\n\n\nPart 2: Battle Tendency\nBecause it was \"unprecedented\" to kill off the main character in a Weekly Shōnen Jump manga, and wanting to shift from physical battles to more \"cerebral\" fights, Araki made Part 2's protagonist look very similar to Jonathan but with a more adventurous and confrontational personality. The author referred to Joseph Joestar as \"a muscle-bound B.T.\", the main character from his earlier series Cool Shock B.T.; a shōnen manga hero who bends the rules as he fights. Having not been able to show a friendly rivalry between Jonathan and Dio, Araki introduced Caesar Zeppeli to present a more positive friendly rivalry between him and Joseph. Wanting each user to have a different type of Hamon with a unique design, he gave Caesar the seemingly fleeting bubbles as a \"representation of his fate and the burden he is carrying\". He enjoys giving characters weapons with faults and having them make up for it with strategy. The author stated that these \"spheres\" were inherited by both Gyro Zeppeli in Steel Ball Run and Josuke Higashikata in JoJolion. Araki created the warrior-type Lisa Lisa, based on a neighborhood girl he knew as a child, to stand out compared to previous shōnen manga female characters who were typically cute and designed to be \"a man's ideal woman\". He stated that at the time it was hard to get Japanese readers to remember a foreign name, so he chose something with repetition. Having to surpass Dio, the Pillar Men's designs were based on Roman statues, Egyptian sphinxes and Japanese nio statues to give them godlike features. Araki designed Kars with a turban to show his superior intelligence and that he is their king, his Brilliant Bone Blade ability harkening to Araki's earlier series Baoh.\n\n\nPart 3: Stardust Crusaders\nAlthough a Japanese protagonist, Araki modeled Jotaro Kujo after American actor Clint Eastwood, including his poses and catchphrases. Although the author said the character might seem \"rough\" compared to other Jump protagonists, Jotaro fits his own image of a hero perfectly as a \"loner\" who does not do the right thing for attention. Araki said the character wearing his school uniform in the desert has its roots in Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Babel II, and that if he were to draw the part over again, he would base the Stands on Tetsujin 28-go. Araki said he had a lot of readers asking him to bring older characters back. Although he is not a fan of bringing them back simply for nostalgia, he did not hesitate having Joseph return to save his daughter because it is completely true to the character. The author thought of having Joseph drop out partway through due to his age, but ended up \"playing it by ear\" as serialization continued. He gave him the role of \"navigator\", introducing new readers to the Joestar family, Dio, Hamon and Stands, and his own Stand being a support ability rather than offensive. Araki said he gave Avdol an \"ethnic\" design to have some sort of connection to Egypt and that at the time of serialization, he and most of the readers had a strong interest in the \"birthplaces of civilization\", making the design a \"product of the times\".\nAraki stated that he had Kakyoin act as a foil to Jotaro. Although they both wear school uniforms, Kakyoin's well-tailored one gives him the feel of an honor student, while Jotaro's loose-fitting one and accessories convey that he is a delinquent. He made him Jotaro's first real Stand opponent to visually convey the concepts between short-range and long-range Stand abilities. The author revealed that he always read the kanji for Kakyoin's given name as \"Tenmei\", but his editor approved the reading Noriaki for the tankōbon much to his surprise. His surname was taken from a town in Sendai. In order to not have him overlap with Jotaro and Joseph, Polnareff was given a distinctive look and personality, which in turn made him shine on his own. Because he is a versatile character who could say goofy lines or serious ones, he \"needed\" to make more appearances. More appearances means more fights, and because he made it through so many life-or-death situations, Araki feels that Polnareff grew the most in the story. The author used foreign models as reference for his hair, and also drew it like Rudol von Stroheim's from Battle Tendency. The character's name was inspired by those of Araki's three favorite French people, actors Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo, and musician Michel Polnareff. Not having any limitations on what he can put in the series, Araki has animals appear and even had one join the Joestar party. Although he feels that The Fool is a perfect fit for Iggy, it just happened to be the last tarot card for him to assign aside from The World. Additionally, he thought of assigning The Fool to an enemy instead, but things just \"ended up working out the way they did\". Being the first time he made an animal a major character and the first time he showed one in battle, Araki used Yoshihiro Takahashi's Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin as a reference.\nWith the series meant to be long-running, Araki took great care in deciding which unique Stand user to put the main cast against and when, in order to keep readers interested. He designed Strength, Ebony Devil, and Yellow Temperance so that their appearances and abilities did not overlap. But as these were all one-on-one battles, he then decided to introduce Hol Horse and J. Geil as a team. He had always planned on having Noriaki Kakyoin and Jean Pierre Polnareff switch allegiances to the good guys, but not Hol Horse, even though he considered the idea. Although he drew a color illustration with Hol Horse alongside the Joestar group and had the character return several times through the story, he suspects he did not go through with it because his personality overlaps with Polnareff's. He also said that because he did not put many limitations on Hol Horse's Stand, it kind of got out of control, plus it overlaps with Kakyoin's Emerald Splash. He did enjoy Hol Horse's \"why be number one when you can be number two\" philosophy, which the author carried over to Yoshikage Kira in Diamond Is Unbreakable, and his outlaw appearance is similar to that of Gyro Zeppeli from the later part Steel Ball Run and might have been inspired by Buichi Terasawa's Cobra.\n\n\nPart 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable\nWith Part 4, Araki said that he moved away from \"muscle men\" as they fell out of popularity with his readers, and he wanted to focus more on fashion. When designing his characters' outfits, Araki considers both everyday fashion and \"cartoonish, bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life\". He also forgoes using specific color schemes for his characters and gives his readers different impressions through various color combinations. Araki said that while he drew several characters in Parts 1 through 3 naked to evoke Greek or Roman gods, he stopped doing it so much from Part 4 onward to be a \"bit closer to home\".\n\n\nPart 5: Golden Wind\nAraki said that the main focus of Golden Wind was to draw \"beautiful men\" who can only exist in a world where there is \"beauty in meeting one's doom.\" He wanted the characters and fashion to be in the style of the Italian city of Rome. The curls in Giorno Giovanna's hair were inspired by Michelangelo's statue David. Araki cited Guido Mista and Prosciutto as characters he enjoyed drawing; the former due to his positive attitude and for being \"true to himself without doubts\" and the latter for his \"brotherly relationship\" with his subordinate Pesci and fun Stand power. Araki decided to grant Trish Una a Stand power while writing the series, creating Carne's Stand simply for her to fight it, and had more fun drawing Carne than his Stand.\n\n\nPart 6: Stone Ocean\n\nFor Stone Ocean, Araki wrote a female protagonist for the first time which he found complicated, but also interesting due to the humanity she could possess.\n\n\nPart 7: Steel Ball Run\nFor Steel Ball Run, having not specifically set out on creating a disabled character, Araki explained that Johnny Joestar's paraplegia was a natural result of wanting to show a character who could grow, both physically and mentally, during a race where \"he would be forced not only to rely on other people, but horses as well\".\n\n\nPart 8: JoJolion\nFor JoJolion, Araki stated that the -lion in the title is derived from the Ancient Greek εὐαγγέλιον (evangelion), in reference to the Gospels; \"By combining this word with 'JoJo', I've meant for the title to signify the existence of the protagonist 'Josuke' in this world\".\n\n\nCharacters\n\nThe series' protagonists are the members of the Joestar Family (ジョースター家, Jōsutā Ke), with a majority of its members bearing a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade. In Parts 1–6, the Joestar bloodline was inherited by the Kujo Family (空条家, Kūjō Ke) and Josuke Higashikata. Dio, having stolen Jonathan's body at the end of Part 1, fathered a few sons bearing the Joestar bloodline while awakening use of Stands in Jonathan's descendants. In the alternate universe depicted in Parts 7–9, Johnny Joestar marries Rina Higashikata with the Higashikata Family becoming a distinct branch of the Joestar family.\n\n\nJoestar family tree - Original Continuity\n\n\nJoestar family tree - Second Continuity\n\nNote: Josuke Higashikata is the fusion between Josefumi Kujo and Yoshikage Kira. Not pictured here are several unnamed siblings of George Joestar III and the unborn second child of Jobin and Mitsuba Higashikata.\n\n\nPart 1: Phantom Blood\nSet in England in the 1880s, the Joestar family adopts the orphaned Dio Brando.\n\nJonathan Joestar (ジョナサン・ジョースター, Jonasan Jōsutā)\n\nThe main protagonist of Phantom Blood, Jonathan is the son of George Joestar I who carries his surname with pride while striving to be a gentleman who never betrays his code of honor and defending those in need even when at a grave disadvantage. He is a passionate person, he wants to be the best at everything that he does, whether it is fighting or even table manners. Jonathan's life becomes one of misery when Dio Brando is adopted by George, eventually resulting in his father's death as Dio sought to kill both of them. This motivates Jonathan to learn how to utilize Hamon energy from Will A. Zeppeli to settle the score with Dio, though his power later increases drastically when a dying Zeppeli transfers his remaining Hamon into him. Jonathan eventually defeats Dio, but Dio survives and then manages to kill him and take over his body when he and Erina were traveling to America. As a result of Dio gaining a Stand with Jonathan's body, all of Jonathan's descendants gain Stands as well. Jonathan's body also has an unnamed Stand that Dio uses, seemingly identical in both appearance and function to Joseph's Hermit Purple. Jonathan's body is ultimately destroyed in Stardust Crusaders when Jotaro and Joseph expose it to the sun.\nDio Brando (ディオ・ブランドー, Dio Burandō)\n\nThe main antagonist of the series, Dio secretly murdered his abusive father Dario Brando before becoming a member of the Joestar household with the intent of inheriting it for himself. When this ultimately fails after Jonathan catches him in the act of poisoning George Joestar, Dio uses the Stone Mask to transform himself into a vampire with the intent of using his zombies to conquer the world. Though defeated, Dio resurfaces in the 1980s under the name of Dio (DIO（ディオ）) as the antagonist of Stardust Crusaders, having taken Jonathan's decapitated body for his own while manifesting his time-stopping Stand The World (世界（ザ・ワールド）, Za Wārudo). Despite his death at Jotaro's hands, Dio directly influenced many events that transpired in Diamond is Unbreakable, Golden Wind, and Stone Ocean.\nRobert E. O. Speedwagon (ロバート・E・O・スピードワゴン, Robāto Ī Ō Supīdowagon)\nRobert E. O. Speedwagon (c.1863-1952) first appears as an Ogre Street thug boss attacking Jonathan, but soon realizes the young man's worthiness and dedication, becoming his greatest friend. He helps uncover Dio's plot to assassinate George Joestar, using poison, and from that point onward remains by Jonathan's side, helping in whatever way he could to defeat Dio. By the 1930s, Speedwagon's success upon founding his own oil company enables him to found the Speedwagon Foundation, a powerful and influential organization which assists the Joestar family a great deal in subsequent story arcs. He appears in Battle Tendency as a supporting character, where he is captured by Nazi commander Rudol von Stroheim in order to get information on the Stone Mask and the Pillar Men. He is saved by Joseph after the latter sneaks into the Mexican base that Stroheim occupies. Speedwagon eventually dies of a heart attack in between the events of Battle Tendency and Stardust Crusaders.\nWill A. Zeppeli (ウィル・A・ツェペリ, Wiru Ē Tseperi)\nWill A. Zeppeli (died 1888) was on a ship with a crew studying Aztec ruins as a young man, when his father put on the Stone Mask and killed everyone in the crew but his son. After this horrific event, Will travels the world in order to destroy the mask, and sees a man cure someone using Hamon. Will is then directed to his master, Tonpetty, who teaches him to use Hamon. However, Tonpetty foresees Will's death during his training, warning him that should he complete his training he will surely die. He trains Jonathan in Hamon after the Joestar's house burns down and joins him to destroy Dio and the mask. He is fatally wounded by Tarkus, but manages to transfer his Hamon to Jonathan before dying.\nStraizo (ストレイツォ, Sutoreitso)\nStraizo (died 1938) is a Hamon user who first appears as one of Tonpetty's pupils, aiding Jonathan in the fight against Dio. However, in the 1930s during Battle Tendency where he succeeded his mentor, Straizo admitted his desire for youth and envied Dio. This motivated him into betraying Speedwagon and using one of the newly discovered Stone Masks to become a vampire. Straizo makes an attempt on Joseph's life and is defeated on the Brooklyn Bridge, destroying himself with the Hamon he stored in his body prior to becoming a vampire. He is also the adoptive father of Lisa Lisa, who is Joseph's mother.\nErina Pendleton (エリナ・ペンドルトン, Erina pendoruton)\nErina Pendleton (c.1869-1950) is a girl from Jonathan's town and eventual love interest. Erina and Jonathan begin a romantic relationship but it is ruined when Dio forcefully kisses her. This causes Jonathan to brutally retaliate against Dio. After the Joestar mansion burns down, Jonathan reunites with Erina when she tends to his wounds and they resume their relationship. After Dio is defeated, they marry each other. However, on their honeymoon ship is ambushed by Dio. Dio fatally wounds Jonathan and he begs a pregnant Erina to save herself and an orphan girl and both survive the explosion. After her son George dies and Lisa Lisa is forced to flee, Erina becomes the sole guardian of her grandson Joseph Joestar. She dies due to natural causes after the events of Battle Tendency.\nBruford (ブラフォード, Burafōdo)\nBruford (died 1888) was formerly, along with Tarkus, a powerful knight from 16th Century Great Britain that that worked under Mary Stuart sent to fight Jonathan Joestar by Dio's orders. After being resurrected, Bruford still possessed a warrior's code of honor as he asked for Dio's blessing to duel Jonathan, once Jonathan made a direct hit on him after destroying his arms, Bruford regained his former humanity from the Hamon slowly destroying his body. Accepting his defeat with grace, noting he lost his hatred, Bruford only expressed only content to be reunited with Mary in the afterlife. After learning of Jonathan's name, Bruford gives the youth his sword, which he renamed Luck and Pluck before he died and completely turned to ash.\nWang Chan (ワンチェン, Wan Chen)\nWang Chan (died February 9, 1889) is a Chinese apothecary who provides Dio with the poison to kill George Joestar, the same kind he used to kill his own father Dario years ago. Later, he gets brought back to the Joestar Estate and narrowly escapes the flames. As Wang Chan searches for the Stone Mask in the rubble, Dio emerges and turns him into his zombie servant. He serves loyally, and after Dio's penultimate defeat, he takes his master's head on board the ship carrying Jonathan and Erina. Despite his efforts and Jonathan being mortally wounded by Dio, Wang Chan is killed by Jonathan, who uses Hamon to destroy his head and subsequently control his corpse in order to sabotage the engine of the ship and ensure its destruction with Dio and the other zombies on board.\n\n\nPart 2: Battle Tendency\nSet in 1938–39, about 50 years after the events of Phantom Blood.\n\nJoseph Joestar (ジョセフ・ジョースター, Josefu Jōsutā)\n\nJoseph (born Sept. 27, 1920) is the main protagonist of Battle Tendency and the grandson of Jonathan Joestar. Having been brought up by his grandmother Erina and Speedwagon, he developed a coarser and more rebellious attitude than that of his gentlemanly grandfather, but he still has a noble heart. While able to use Hamon like his grandfather, Joseph is not initially as skilled in its use until he trains under Lisa Lisa. He initially uses a pair of Hamon-empowered clackers in battle, but relies more on mind games rather than brute strength in fights, employing his uncanny ability to predict his opponent's actions down to what they say. He returns as a main character in Stardust Crusaders. Now 50 years older, he has acquired the vine-like Stand Hermit Purple (隠者の紫（ハーミットパープル）, Hāmitto Pāpuru) which he uses to fight or take 'spirit photos' of faraway things using electronic equipment such as cameras and television sets (though doing so destroys said equipment). He can also use Hermit Purple's vines as wires to channel Hamon. Joseph leads the team of men to confront Dio in Egypt to save his daughter, Holly Kujo. He returns as a supporting character in Diamond Is Unbreakable, where he meets his illegitimate son Josuke Higashikata and is shown to be physically and mentally weaker now due to old age. While Joseph doesn't make an appearance in Stone Ocean, Araki has stated that he is likely still alive.\nRudol von Stroheim (ルドル・フォン・シュトロハイム, Rudoru Fon Shutorohaimu)\nRudol von Stroheim (died February 1943) is a commander of the Nazi forces sent to research Santana in Mexico after the other Pillar Men were discovered in Rome. Stroheim is responsible for not only saving the life of Speedwagon, though only for intel on the Stone Mask for his government, but also helping Joseph defeat Santana by blowing himself up. He returns later as a cyborg to assist in the fight against Kars, upgrading himself with ultraviolet lamps. After providing Joseph with his artificial hand prior to World War II, Stroheim dies in 1943 on the front-line during the final days of the Battle of Stalingrad while trying to cover Nazi troops retreating from the city.\nCaesar Anthonio Zeppeli (シーザー・アントニオ・ツェペリ, Shīzā Antonio Tseperi)\nCaesar Zeppeli (died 1939) is a suave ladies' man and the grandson of Will A. Zeppeli. He is rather cool and collected, especially compared to Joseph, with whom he is grudgingly paired to fight the Pillar Men. But over time, Joseph starts to grow on him so much that he is able to understand his strange thought patterns and they form an unbeatable duo. He infuses the Hamon into soap bubbles he creates with his specially-made gloves. He dies fighting against Wamuu, but is able to transport his remaining Hamon for Joseph just like his grandfather did for Jonathan.\nPillar Men (柱の男, Hashira no Otoko)\nThe Pillar Men are the main antagonists of Battle Tendency, the last four members of an ancient race of humanoids encased in pillars whose extraordinary strength, intelligence, and lifespan made them revered as gods and demons. But Kars, motivated by his race's true potential, wiped out his people when they opposed him for endangering the world with the Stone Mask. Despite their apathy to humans and Kars's conduct, the other Pillar Men are chivalrous warriors who battle Hamon users in fair fights. Each has total control over their body, able to transform it to suit their needs while able to digest non-Hamon users via physical contact, Kars, Esidisi, and Wamuu having honed unique specialties called Modes (流法（モード）, Mōdo) to combat Hamon users.\nSantana (サンタナ, Santana)\nSantana is discovered in a Mexican pyramid in 1938 by Straizo's Speedwagon Foundation team and then taken by the Nazi forces under Stroheim for live human experiments to see if he can be used to power the German army, even using a Stone Mask vampire on him to see how much more powerful he is. Santana escapes, as he can contort his body to escape through a ventilation shaft, and shows he has mastered human language and the mechanisms of the Germans' weaponry when he manages to withstand their attacks. Joseph and Stroheim manage to stop him by escaping to the outside, as Joseph traps him in a well at high noon, turning him back to stone. His remains are taken to a Speedwagon Foundation laboratory while permanently exposed to ultraviolet lamps to trap him.\nEsidisi (エシディシ, Eshidishi)\nEsidisi has an erratic temper, quick to sob uncontrollably and just as quick to calm himself down. His Heat Control Mode (怪焔王の流法（モード）, Kaiennō no Mōdo) allows him to make his blood boil to 500 °C (932 °F), which he injects into his foes to burn them alive by extending his needle-like blood vessels out of his own body. Esidisi's search for the Super Aja leads him to Venice, where he faces Joseph after murdering Loggins. Claiming to have intimate knowledge of The Art of War as he was in China during the lifetime of Sun Tzu, Esidisi matches Joseph's own quick wits in a battle of deception. But Joseph takes advantage of Esidisi's lack of knowledge of sleight of hand to defeat him with a Hamon attack via a cut and restore rope trick, destroying Esidisi's body. Esidisi survives, but is reduced to a disembodied nervous system, possessing the body of Suzi Q to get her to mail the Super Aja to Kars and then plans to destroy her from the inside with her heated blood killing the Hamon users. However, Joseph and Caesar's contrasting Hamon abilities force Esidisi out of Suzi Q's body, which results in the weakened Pillar Man's permanent death when exposed to the sunlight.\nWamuu (ワムウ, Wamū)\nWamuu (C.8,000 BCE-1939) is Esidisi and Kars' loyal servant, who is a strong and honorable warrior, but reflexively attacks anyone who steps on his own shadow. His Wind Mode (風の流法（モード）, Kaze no Mōdo) allows him to control the air in his lungs, turning it into a powerful wind at his disposal, from using it like a razor sharp blade to rendering him invisible. He spares Joseph's life after the young man wounds him, allowing him a month's reprieve to master Hamon while placing a poison ring in the human's heart as added incentive while revealing the antidote in his lip piercing. His next fight is against Caesar, who manages to hold his own, but cannot defeat Wamuu's Wind Mode. He fatally wounds Caesar, allowing the dying man to obtain the antidote out of respect for the human's valiant effort. Wamuu later faces off against Joseph in a deadly chariot race, blinding himself to regain a psychological advantage over his opponent, before he is defeated by Joseph's wits and Hamon mastery. As Wamuu's disembodied head lays dying, Joseph eases the Pillar Man's passing by giving him drops of his own blood. Wamuu returns the favor by killing off a horde of vampires that attempts to kill Joseph in revenge, asking Joseph to take the antidote to give him peace of mind while expressing gratitude for facing such a worthy opponent.\nKars (カーズ, Kāzu)\nKars (born C.10,000 BCE) is the leader of the Pillar Men and the creator of the Stone Masks. He is intelligent and ruthless, and single minded in his dedication to become the Ultimate Being (究極の生命体（アルティミット・シイング）, Arutimitto Shiingu). This led to Kars wiping out his own people when they deemed his intention as sheer madness. Later facing Hamon users in his quest for a Super Aja stone to perfect the mask's use for his kind, Kars developed a Light Mode (光の流法（モード）, Hikari no Mōdo), which allows him to produce saw-bladed appendages from his body which produce a radiant glow. Unlike his subordinates, Kars has no honor whatsoever and intends to fulfill his goals by any means. Kars finally succeeds in getting the stone by deceiving Lisa Lisa during their match with a vampire decoy and then tricking the Nazis into exposing him to ultraviolet rays while wearing the Aja-embedded stone mask. Once evolved, now immune to sunlight and able to tap into his own genetic structure, Kars can produce animal-like extensions of himself, undergo reactive evolutionary mutations, and utilize Hamon. In the end, Kars is defeated as a result of his own hubris, using a Hamon attack on Joseph, who uses the Super Aja to intercept it in a volcano. The resulting eruption blasts Kars into the vacuum of space, causing his immortal body to freeze solid. Because he is unable to die, he drifts through space for the remainder of time, eventually ceasing thought.\nLisa Lisa (リサリサ, Risa Risa)\nLisa Lisa (born c.1888) is a mysterious female Hamon master and Caesar's Hamon teacher who lives in Venice, Lisa Lisa is one of the few remaining Hamon users and keeper of the Super Aja, a perfectly cut Red Stone of Aja which she guards from the Pillar Men. She is revealed to be Joseph's mother Elizabeth (エリザベス, Erizabesu), who Erina saved as an infant on the night of Jonathan's death and entrusted to Straizo. Elizabeth married Erina's son George Joestar II and was forced to go on the run after killing her husband's murderer, one of Dio's surviving zombies who infiltrated the Royal Air Force. Lisa Lisa fights with Hamon by conducting it through her specially made scarf. Because of her Hamon abilities, she appears to be in her mid 20s despite actually being in her 50s.\nSuzi Q (スージーQ, Sūjī Kyū)\nLisa Lisa's personal assistant who is ditzy and forgetful but loyal to her cause. She develops a crush on Joseph after seeing his face without a special Hamon training mask on for the first time. She is possessed by a disembodied Esidisi and is forced to send the Super Aja to the Pillar Man's allies and then attack the others before Caesar and Joseph manage to use Hamon to force the Pillar Man out of her body without endangering her life. She nurses Joseph back to health after his battle with Kars, and then becomes his wife in the end of Battle Tendency, but forgets to let everyone else know that Joseph survived his battle with Kars. She later gives birth to their daughter Holly. Suzi Q makes a return appearance in Stardust Crusaders to watch over her daughter while Joseph and Jotaro are en route to Cairo to destroy Dio.\n\n\nPart 3: Stardust Crusaders\nSet from 1987 to 1988, the series follows Jotaro Kujo and his comrades who travel to Egypt from Japan in search of the evil and immortal vampire Dio Brando, now referred to only as Dio.\n\nJotaro Kujo (空条 承太郎, Kūjō Jōtarō)\n\nThe main protagonist of Stardust Crusaders and the grandson of Joseph Joestar through Holly. He is depicted as a rough delinquent with a kind heart as he journeys to Egypt with his grandfather and allies to defeat Dio and save his mother's life. Jotaro tends to have an introverted mindset, rarely showing emotion. However, he uses this to his advantage to keep calm and make a plan in a dire situation. His Stand is Star Platinum (星の白金（スタープラチナ）, Sutā Purachina) whose power is incredible strength, speed, and precision. Star Platinum also has enhanced eyesight, allowing Jotaro to see things that can normally not be seen with the human eye. Later on, Star Platinum gains the ability Star Platinum: The World (星の白金（スタープラチナ）　世界（ザ・ワールド）, Sutā Purachina Za Wārudo), allowing Star Platinum to stop time. He returns in Diamond Is Unbreakable to meet his biological uncle Josuke while investigating enemy stands in the town of Morioh. Since Dio's defeat, he has become a famed marine biologist. He makes a minor appearance in Golden Wind when he sends Koichi Hirose to Italy to spy on Dio's son, Giorno Giovanna. He returns in Stone Ocean to aid his daughter, Jolyne Cujoh, against the forces of Enrico Pucci, but falls unconscious after both his Stand and memory discs were stolen by Pucci's Stand, Whitesnake. Pucci uses Jotaro's memories to aid in his plan to transform Whitesnake into C-Moon, and Jolyne spends most of the Part trying to retrieve Jotaro's discs. After the discs are returned to him, he awakens and assists Jolyne in the final battle with Pucci. He nearly kills Pucci, but is killed instead after C-Moon evolves into Made in Heaven. However, Jotaro appears to have been revived after Pucci is killed and the universe resets once more, as Pucci's death also erases his existence. While he is not seen in the ending of Part 6, it is mentioned that his daughter and her allies are driving off to meet him, although unlike Jotaro, the remainders come with alternative names.\nMohammed Avdol (モハメド・アヴドゥル, Mohamedo Avuduru)\nAn Egyptian ally of Joseph and Jotaro Kujo from Cairo, a fortune teller who narrowly escaped from Dio and helped Joseph understand Stands. His Stand is Magician's Red (魔術師の赤（マジシャンズレッド）, Majishanzu Reddo), which allows him to manipulate fire, usually in the shape of the ankh. Magician's Red's signature move is Crossfire Hurricane (クロスファイヤーハリケーン, Kurosufaiyā Harikēn), which sends out several fiery ankhs at the target. While in India, Avdol is seemingly killed by the combined efforts of Hol Horse and J. Geil, but is later revealed to have survived and rejoins the group at the Red Sea. During the group's infiltration of Dio's mansion, Avdol is vaporized after he sacrifices himself to save Polnareff and Iggy from Vanilla Ice.\nNoriaki Kakyoin (花京院 典明, Kakyōin Noriaki)\nKakyoin is a highschool student that Dio inflicted with a mind-controlling flesh bud and sends after Jotaro, only for life is instead saved by Jotaro with Kakyoin pledging to help him kill Dio. His Stand is Hierophant Green (法皇の緑（ハイエロファントグリーン）, Haierofanto Gurīn), which he can shrink down to enter people and control them from the inside, produce strange tendrils that can thrash people, or perform a long-ranged attack using blasts of green energy known as Emerald Splash. Hierophant Green was originally known as Hierophant Emerald (ハイエロファントエメラルド, Haierofanto Emerarudo). He is later killed by Dio in Egypt and uses his final moments to inform the group about The World's ability. The spin-off manga Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak reveals that Kakyoin was born in Morioh and ended up under Dio's control during his family's vacation to Egypt when the villain uses his younger cousin as a hostage.\nJean Pierre Polnareff (ジャン・ピエール・ポルナレフ, Jan Piēru Porunarefu)\nA French traveler initially under Dio's control, Polnareff attacks Jotaro's group during their stay in Hong Kong before being defeated by Avdol. After reforming, he joins them on the hunt for Dio in order to find his sister's murderer, J. Geil. Polnareff is chivalrous and honorable, but is also goofy and naive, and tends to get into trouble frequently. His Stand is Silver Chariot (銀の戦車（シルバーチャリオッツ）, Shirubā Chariottsu), an armored knight wielding a rapier that can boost its blinding speed further by casting off its armor while producing a series of afterimages, while sacrificing defense. Polnareff later makes an appearance during the events of Golden Wind, having been crippled by Diavolo who stole the Arrows from him. Polnareff kept one arrow he intended to give to Giorno's gang, but was forced to use it on himself with his dying breath to enhance his Stand into Chariot Requiem (チャリオッツ・レクイエム, Chariottsu Rekuiemu) as a final gambit to protect the arrow. Chariot Requiem, acting on its master's last command, can manipulate the souls of others in various ways like causing souls to swap bodies with someone nearby. Further exposure to Chariot Requiem causes living bodies and souls to mutate. Chariot Requiem acts as a shadow to people's souls, and when they look at it, its shadow always falls in the opposite direction. It creates a sun-like light source behind them but if that light source is destroyed Chariot Requiem is destroyed as well. Chariot Requiem's abilities end up saving Polnareff as they transfer his soul into Coco Jumbo, a turtle that was used by Giorno's gang. After Chariot Requiem is destroyed, Polnareff still manages to survive inside the turtle's body and now accompanies Passione's new leader, Giorno.\nIggy (イギー, Igī)\nA stray Boston Terrier who thwarted the New York animal control officers for years until Avdol managed to capture the dog for the Speedwagon Foundation. He is recruited to the group when they arrive in Egypt. To keep him calm, the Speedwagon Foundation and the Joestar Group offer him coffee-flavored chewing gum as a treat for his compliance. His Stand The Fool (愚者（ザ・フール）, Za Fūru) is one of few that possess a physical form, a biomechanical being with two wheels instead of hindlegs that can manipulate sand and dirt, forming wings to allow Iggy to glide away from danger. The Fool can also use sand to shape-shift into different objects, and even people. Iggy is thought to be a self-serving coward as he avoids fighting N'Doul and many other Stand users as the group heads to Cairo, but he shows his intelligence during his fight with Pet Shop and his bravery and loyalty when he saves Polnareff from Vanilla Ice at the cost of his life.\nHol Horse (ホル・ホース, Horu Hōsu)\nAn arrogant cowboy and the wielder of the Emperor (皇帝（エンペラー）, Enperā) Stand, which takes the form of a revolver. Upon being fired, the Emperor can control the bullet's flight path, allowing it to turn in midair. He prefers to operate with a partner, as his Stand is fairly weak and not effective without backup. Hol Horse is originally hesitant on working for Dio, and even attempts to shoot him behind his back, but eventually accepts Dio as a master after he experiences the power of Dio's Stand first hand. While originally seen working with J. Geil, he later becomes partners with Boingo with hope to kill the Joestars, but accidentally gets shot by his own Stand, incapacitating him. Hol Horse is among the surviving minions of Dio who attempt to resume normal lives after his death, becoming the protagonist of the spin-off manga, Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak; taking place a month before the events of Diamond is Unbreakable.

Her Stand Justice (正義（ジャスティス）, Jasutisu), a massive mist with a skull and hands, allows her to manipulate anything with an open wound like a puppet. After the death of her son J. Geil, one of Dio's assassins who made an enemy out of Polnareff, Enya decides to personally attack the Joestar group before being captured and later killed by her allies to keep the nature of Dio's Stand a secret.\nJ.

His Stand is Hanged Man (吊られた男（ハングドマン）, Hangudo Man), a light-based Stand which manifests itself through reflections. Any attack done on a person's reflection will be mirrored on the person themself. He first shows by making his Stand appear in front of Polnareff and forcing him to separate from the rest of the group, making him an easy target for him and his partner Hol Horse. After a short confrontation between Emperor and Silver Chariot, Muhammad Avdol joins the fight but is quickly disposed of by a combination of Emperor and Hanged Man.

After Avdol finds out that N'Doul could only locate the group through the sounds they make, Jotaro forces Iggy to cooperate with them, as he was the only one capable of detecting N'Doul's attacks. After N'Doul's defeat by Jotaro, he commits suicide to keep Dio's Stand a secret.\nBoingo (ボインゴ)\nA young Stand User and member of the Egypt 9 Glory Gods, a shy boy whose book-like Stand, Tohth, allows him to see the intermediate future and that what it predicts to happen is set in stone.

However, D'Arby is not afraid to cheat to win a match, and ends up taking the souls of Polnareff and Joseph. Jotaro challenges D'Arby at poker, which the gambler comments is his strongest game. However Jotaro's unreadable poker face, intimidation, and use of Star Platinum to play mindgames proves too much for him, as D'Arby tries to force himself to call Jotaro's bet, he falls apart completely and becomes a hysteric mess, admitting defeat in his heart. Polnareff, Joseph and the hundreds of other souls D'Arby had collected over the years were freed from his collection.

He is an expert in playing video games. Like his brother's, his Stand Atum (アトゥム神, Atumu-shin) also carries the power of stealing the souls of whom D'Arby defeats in his games, storing these souls inside dolls. Terence is seen as far more dangerous than his brother, largely because his Stand also has the ability to read the minds of other people, though limited to only answering \"yes or no\" questions. Despite the limitation, he was able to defeat Kakyoin and steal his soul, but like his brother, also ended up losing to Jotaro as he was unable to notice Joseph helping Jotaro cheat at the baseball game they were playing.\nVanilla Ice (ヴァニラ・アイス, Vanira Aisu)\nVanilla Ice was the last Vampire created by Dio and one of the penultimate Stand Users the Joestar Group faces upon infiltrating Dio's Mansion, after the group is split up, he is sent to take out the team consisting of Avdol, Polnareff, and Iggy.

When Josuke was four years old, he awakened a Stand due to Dio's influence on the Joestar bloodline in the events of Stardust Crusaders. But because of his gentle nature, his Stand worked against him, causing him to become fatally ill, similar to Holly's illness in Stardust Crusaders. While en route to the hospital, his mother gets her car stuck in the snow, but an unknown delinquent with a pompadour helps his mother release the car from the snow and drive Josuke to safety. Overwhelmed by the selflessness and kindness of the unknown delinquent, Josuke wears his hair in a similar pompadour to honor him, and erupts into a violent rage if anyone insults his hair, as he associates his hair with the delinquent who saved him. His Stand is Crazy Diamond (クレイジー・ダイヤモンド, Kureijī Daiyamondo), a close range Stand which has the ability to restore objects to their original form, including healing other people's injuries and also any inanimate object such as food and drink, for example it can use its ability to revert lemonade back to water, sugar and lemons.

He has been murdering women in Morioh for over 15 years, with Reimi Sugimoto as the first of his victims. Once killing his victim, Kira will keep their severed hand as a \"girlfriend\", carrying it around with him and using it for various fetishtic purposes before discarding it when it begins to decay. Kira later manifests his Stand Killer Queen (キラークイーン, Kirā Kuīn) with the Arrow that his father Yoshihiro acquired from Enya, the Stand possessing the ability to turn any object into a bomb, with the explosion leaving no trace. Kira frequently uses Killer Queen to dispose evidence of his murders. The Stand also possesses a secondary ability called Sheer Heart Attack (シアーハートアタック, Shiā Hāto Atakku), an indestructible tank-like bomb linked to Kira's left hand that relentlessly locks on to heat signatures. Kira is eventually exposed by Josuke's group acting on Reimi's behalf and murders a man named Kosaku Kawajiri (川尻 浩作, Kawajiri Kōsaku) while fleeing his pursuers, forcing Aya Tsuji into using her Stand and give him Kosaku's face and fingerprints before killing her off. Kira attempts concealing himself in the Kawajiri household while fighting his murderous urges, with Kosaku's son Hayato Kawajiri (川尻 早人, Kawajiri Hayato) eventually realizing the truth. Kira acquires a new ability when pierced by the Arrow a second time called Bites The Dust (負けて死ね（バイツァ・ダスト）, Baitsa Dasuto; Kanji lit. \"lose and die\") which he implants in Hayato, placing the boy on a time-loop where anyone who learns of Kira's identity from the boy is killed with their death fixed for every future loop. But Hayato exploits the time loop to trick Kira into exposing himself and cancel Bites the Dust to defend himself against Josuke, eventually being killed off when run over by a reversing ambulance and later being dragged off by the spectral hands of Ghost Alley. He makes a return appearance in the side-story Dead Man's Questions as a wandering spirit with no knowledge of who he really is.\nKoichi Hirose (広瀬 康一, Hirose Kōichi)\nA classmate of Josuke's who meets him when Jotaro is searching for Josuke, resulting in the two becoming quick friends. Koichi is a young freshman in high school, and despite his age, he is very short. Throughout the series, he forms a student-teacher relationship with Jotaro. When Koichi is stabbed by the Arrow from Keicho Nijimura, he was initially rendered unconscious and thought to be fatally wounded, but soon awakened his Stand Echoes (エコーズ, Ekōzu), which has three distinct forms, or Acts, that he gains as he develops as a character. However, Koichi can only call upon one at any given time. Echoes Act 1 can replicate sound effects, such as a train alarm; he can attach these sound effects as written kana to anything, and if he attaches them to an opponent, he can overwhelm them with sound. Echoes Act 2 also writes out sound effects in kana, but rather than replicating the noise, it replicates the phenomenon that would create that sound effect (e.g. attaching the word \"whoosh\" causes a gust of wind to blow by, or \"sizzle\" will cause something to glow with heat). Acts 1 and 2 are also long range, and Koichi can use either of them as a scout to find a specific target. Echoes Act 3 loses the former abilities and its long range, but gains the ability \"3 Freeze\", which causes a target to become extremely heavy to the point that it is incapable of moving. Act 3 also shows its own sentience separate of Koichi, which is rare in Stands. It talks in a monotone voice, and frequently says vulgar phrases in English.\nOkuyasu Nijimura (虹村 億泰, Nijimura Okuyasu)\nThe youngest of the two Nijimura brothers who are responsible for creating the majority of Stand users in Morioh via the Bow and Arrow. Okuyasu is overly dependent on his elder brother Keicho to make hard decisions. After his brother dies, he seeks revenge against the user of the Stand Red Hot Chili Pepper, Akira Otoishi, and becomes friends with Josuke and Koichi. Okuyasu's father is a bizarre creature that can regenerate rapidly, rendering him immortal. He was mutated by a flesh bud made from Dio's cells after the latter's death at the hands of Jotaro. At first, Okuyasu and Keicho plotted to kill their father to relieve him of his suffering, creating Stand users via the Bow and Arrow for this very purpose. However, after he learns that his father still has sentience, he gives up on the plan. His Stand is The Hand (ザ・ハンド, Za Hando), which erases whatever space it swipes with its right hand, drawing objects closer to Okuyasu or drawing Okuyasu himself closer to an object. Should he erase the middle of an object, the two remaining halves will snap together (demonstrated when he erases the middle of a sign, causing it to say something different with the middle portion gone). While this ability is quite useful and could be devastating in the right hands, Okuyasu himself is rather unintelligent, rarely using it to its full potential.\nKeicho Nijimura (虹村 形兆, Nijimura Keichō)\nThe eldest of the two Nijimura brothers who are responsible for creating the majority of Stand users in Morioh via the Bow and Arrow. Keicho is a minor yet influential character in the arc. He is very abrasive and brutal, yet is far more intelligent than Okuyasu. He's the first to possess the Bow and Arrow in Morioh, using it to create potential Stand users that can kill his mutated father; however, after seeing how his father still has sentience, he has trouble dealing with the situation. He is later killed by Akira Otoishi, one of the Stand users who had his Stand activated thanks to Keicho. His Stand is Bad Company (バッド・カンパニー, Baddo Kanpanī), which is unique for taking the form of a miniature organised military force but with greatly lethal firepower.\nRohan Kishibe (岸辺 露伴, Kishibe Rohan)\nAn abrasive but well meaning mangaka who writes the manga Pink Dark Boy for Weekly Shōnen Jump. He eventually befriends Koichi and the two come across Reimi Sugimoto (杉本 鈴美, Sugimoto Reimi), a ghost who warns the two about a serial murderer in Morioh. It is revealed later that 15 years prior to the events of Diamond is Unbreakable, Reimi was Rohan's babysitter. On the night Reimi was murdered by Yoshikage Kira, she sneaks the four year old Rohan out the window to save his life. This inspires him to help Jotaro and the others find and stop Yoshikage Kira. His Stand is Heaven's Door (ヘブンズ・ドアー, Hebunzu Doā), which allows him to peel a person's skin open like a book and read their memories and abilities. He can also write commands in the pages which the recipient must follow. Heaven's Door originally appears as a manuscript that one must consciously look at to be placed under effect. Later on, it gains a physical form resembling the unnamed protagonist of Pink Dark Boy. Rohan is subject of multiple one-shot spinoffs such as Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan and Rohan au Louvre.\nAkira Otoishi (音石 明, Otoishi Akira)\nA rogue guitarist and enemy of Josuke, his Stand is Red Hot Chilli Pepper (レッド・ホット・チリ・ペッパー, Reddo Hotto Chiri Peppā), a long-range Stand that can control electricity. His awakening of a Stand makes him mad with power, and he steals Keicho Nijimura's arrow, killing him in the process. He tried to shoo away Jotaro afterwards, fearing Star Platinum's power. Otoishi is dangerously self-centered, using his newfound power to steal from various people and wreak havoc in the city, and even kill anyone who gets in his way without hesitation. He also dedicates himself to his craft as a guitarist; also desiring recognition or fame as a rock star. Akira is confident, but also smart enough to utilize his abilities to the fullest and is somewhat proficient in manipulation, evident through his battle with Okuyasu. However, although smart, he often fails to notice minor details that can lead to his downfall, as shown in his fight with Josuke. After losing to Josuke and being sent to prison, he no longer causes trouble as he fears retaliation from Jotaro. His last appearance was in the one-shot Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan, asking Rohan Kishibe for autographs.\nYuya Fungami (噴上裕也, Fungami Yuya)\nHe is a member of a motorcycle gang who got into an accident and used his Stand Highway Star (ハイウェイ・スター, Haiwei Sutā) to steal Josuke and Rohan's life energy in order to recover from their injuries. Introduced while attacking Josuke from a distance, accompanied by his three admirers, Yuya appears to be a vain, selfish and dishonest person. However, he demonstrates a sense of courage, bravery and high perception skills when joining the battle against Terunosuke Miyamoto, as he manages to save both Koichi and Josuke. His Stand possesses a disjointed set of powers that make fighting it a dangerous task, and even Josuke must flee the Stand to find the user and defeat him. Two of its basic but most notable features are its speed and range: Highway Star can run up to 60 km/h and maintain that running speed indefinitely to pursue its prey; Furthermore, its pursuit of Josuke around Morioh while Yuya was at Grape Hills Hospital demonstrates its great range, the stand is also capable of throwing a barrage of punches, creating illusions to lure in its prey and disassemble itself from its humanoid form into many foot shaped pieces that can more easily pursue a target.\n\n\nPart 5: Golden Wind\nSet in 2001 Italy, two years after the events of Diamond is Unbreakable.\n\nGiorno Giovanna (ジョルノ・ジョバァーナ, Joruno Jobāna)\n\nThe main protagonist of Golden Wind, born Haruno Shiobana (汐華 初流乃), Giorno is the illegitimate son of Dio. However, because Dio's head was attached to the decapitated body of Jonathan Joestar at the time of Giorno's conception, he is technically a Joestar, Jonathan's biological son, and bears the Joestar birthmark as proof of his Joestar lineage. Bearing a similarity to both men in regard to personality (Jonathan's sense of morality and Dio's indifference to his enemies), he is initially observed by Jotaro and Koichi in case he became a threat like Dio. Giorno's dream of becoming a \"Gang-Star\" in the Passione mob family formed after rescuing a wounded mafia member as a child, who gave him protection in exchange. Giorno was originally born with black hair, but it eventually became a blond color similar to Dio's when he fully awakened his Stand. As a combination of Dio and Jonathan, he is kind, caring, and calm, a trait traced from Jonathan; but also confident, brutal, and a cunning strategist, a trait inherited from Dio. He aspires to overthrow Passione's boss, to end the drug trade, and turn the gang into an organization which helps the people of Italy, much akin to Robin Hood.\nHis Stand is named Gold Experience (ゴールド・エクスペリエンス, Gōrudo Ekusuperiensu), which has the ability to imbue things with life, which is mostly used to turn inorganic objects into living organisms. Later on, Giorno learns how to create body parts with Gold Experience, giving him the ability to heal himself and others (albeit causing significant pain in the process). Giorno can also use Gold Experience to sense the lifeforce of others. When the Stand Arrow chooses Giorno, his Stand becomes Gold Experience Requiem (ゴールド・エクスペリエンス・レクイエム, Gōrudo Ekusuperiensu Rekuiemu), which greatly evolves its life-giving properties and also has the ability to return any kind of process back to a state of \"zero\", nullifying any desired action. The stand explaining that Giorno is consciously unaware of its full ability, Gold Experience Requiem's nullification even affects death, allowing the Stand to force a person into an infinite loop of endless deaths of greatly varying causes.\nBruno Bucciarati (ブローノ・ブチャラティ, Burōno Bucharati)\nInitially a caporegime in the Passione mafia family, Bucciarati teams up with Giorno and leads a group of rogue gang members against their boss. Bucciarati grew up in a fishing village and after his parents divorced, he chose to live with his father. When he was twelve years old, his father was shot by drug dealers who had hired his boat and when they tried to kill him in the hospital, Bruno fatally stabbed them. He entered the world of the Passione mob for protection, but years later was horrified to discover that Passione was responsible for what happened to his father. Bucciarati's Stand is Sticky Fingers (スティッキィ・フィンガーズ, Sutikkī Fingāzu), which has the ability to place a fully functional zipper on any object just by touching it. For example, Sticky Fingers can place a zipper on a wall, unzip it, and then pass through the resulting opening. The zipper can also be used to take things or people apart, or even mismatch various objects, and he can use this ability on himself if necessary. Bucciarati's hatred of drugs aspires him to help Giorno's dream of overthrowing the boss. During their first confrontation with Diavolo, Bucciarati is killed, but Giorno's Gold Experience manages to keep Bucciarati alive, albeit in a corpse-like state, until he fully passes on in the final battle with Diavolo after giving Giorno the arrow he needed to defeat the boss.\nLeone Abbacchio (レオーネ・アバッキオ, Reōne Abakkio)\nA member of Bucciarati's gang, Abbacchio is a former policeman who aspired to protect people, but became disillusioned upon realizing that the ungrateful public he swore to protect disrespected the police, and that richer criminals bribed their way out of punishment using the general corruption present in law enforcement. He soon learnt to work with the contradictions, and eventually accepted a bribe from a criminal. Sometime later a break-in was reported at an old man's house committed by the same man who'd paid him said bribe. He hesitated to shoot the man, and as a result his partner leapt in front of a bullet fired at him by the thief, killing him. Labelled a dirty cop, he lost his job, and fell into a drunken depression, and lost his will to live until Bucciarati recruited him to the gang. His Stand Moody Blues (ムーディー・ブルース, Mūdī Burūsu) can repeat the past movements of anything or anyone like a 3-D video recording, transforming into that person or thing. While doing so, Moody Blues becomes an easy target for enemies to attack since it cannot defend itself when it is \"rebroadcasting\". Once it is out of \"rebroadcasting\" mode, it can attack again. Abbacchio can also use Moody Blues' transformations to disguise his Stand as a person. When Giorno joins the gang, Abbacchio trusts him the least out of the group and frequently confronts him on his decisions. Abbacchio is later stabbed in the chest by Diavolo after the boss disguised himself as a young soccer player while Abbacchio was using his Stand to recreate the boss's face. Despite his fatal wound, Abbachio was successful in recreating the boss's face and quickly imprinted it into a rock before dying. In the afterlife, he is reunited with his deceased partner, who commends him for his commitment towards helping his comrades.\nGuido Mista (グイード・ミスタ, Guīdo Misuta)\nAnother member of Bucciarati's gang. He was sentenced to prison for killing gang members that had attacked him after he'd come to the aid of a woman being assaulted, with the court not believing the truth that Mista had been acting in self defense, since he hadn't been injured. Somehow, through the will of destiny, all of the bullets fired at him had missed, and Mista fired back four shots with pin-point accuracy whilst under fire. Bucciarati arranged for the charges to be dropped, and recruited Mista to his gang. Mista uses a revolver as his weapon of choice in conjunction with his stand, Sex Pistols (セックス・ピストルズ, Sekkusu Pisutoruzu). Sex Pistols is represented by six bullet-shaped humanoids, numbered from #1 through #7 with no #4. Mista controls them by telling them to send the bullet ricocheting in a certain direction. Each of them have distinct personalities; they love to eat, and if not fed, will not work. Sex Pistols has no #4, due to Mista's tetraphobia, associating the number 4 with bad luck or danger much like the Japanese and other Eastern cultures, despite being Italian.\nNarancia Ghirga (ナランチャ・ギルガ, Narancha Giruga)\nA member of Bucciarati's gang. He was abandoned by his father after his mother died from an eye disease. As a result, Narancia became a run-away street-living delinquent. He was savagely beaten by the police, after another delinquent he looked up to framed him for a burglary. He developed a persistent eye infection similar to his mother, having spent a year in a junior offender detention center. At age 15, filthy, ill and homeless, he was picked up by Fugo and taken to meet Bucciarati who funded his return to health. Narancia was so overwhelmed with Bucciarati's kindness that he vowed to follow him forever. After joining the gang, he befriends Fugo and looks up to him as a role-model and mentor. His Stand Aerosmith (エアロスミス, Earosumisu) is a toy-like tiny airplane, equipped with machine guns and bombs to attack enemies. It detects expelled carbon dioxide on a radar-like display, but Narancia cannot distinguish between his targets and other sources of carbon dioxide such as innocent bystanders or open flames. Narancia is eventually attacked by Diavolo while he was in Giorno's body as a result of Silver Chariot Requiem resulting in him getting impaled on a gate. Though Giorno is able to heal his body of the punctured wounds Diavolo inflicted, Narancia's soul was already gone by the time his body healed.\nPannacotta Fugo (パンナコッタ・フーゴ, Pannakotta Fūgo)\nHe was the first person to join Bucciarati's team. In the anime he was molested by his college professor when he was 13 years old, causing him to savagely beat his abuser, resulting in him being expelled and disowned by his family, who'd never cared much for his well-being at all. Fugo tends to have an erratic temper, erupting into a violent rage before quickly calming himself down. His Stand is Purple Haze (パープル・ヘイズ, Pāpuru Heizu), a humanoid with a violet-and-white diamond pattern skin and a glass gladiator's helmet. Its main form of attack comes from the three globes on the back of its hands, each of which contains a powerful virus that is released when any of the globes are broken. Once this happens, the virus will spread and rapidly devour organic matter—a human body will be annihilated in about 30 seconds. However, the virus is destroyed by sunlight. Purple Haze is difficult for Fugo to control in even the best of situations, since it represents everything he hates about himself, which explains its manic behavior surrounding the idea of cleanliness, and its inability to distinguish friend from foe, with the virus even being able to affect Fugo himself. He is the only member of Bucciarati's team who refuses to join him when Bucciarati decides to turn on the boss. He later stars in the light novel Purple Haze Feedback, which takes place after the events of Part 5. In the events of Purple Haze Feedback, he is given the mission to eliminate Passione's remaining drug team to test his loyalty to the organization, as well as a form of atonement for his departure from Bucciarati's team. At the end of the novel, he and Giorno meet again, and having overcome his personal demons, Fugo swears loyalty to Giorno.\nTrish Una (トリッシュ・ウナ, Torisshu Una)\nTrish is the daughter of the boss, although she'd never met him, a result of her parents union when he was living under the pseudonym \"Solido Naso.\" She is protected by Bruno's team from her father's enemies, until it is revealed he'd only had her protected so that he could eliminate the threat she posed to him due to her very existence. She eventually awakens her own Stand Spice Girl (スパイス・ガール, Supaisu Gāru) which has the ability to soften any material giving it a similar sensation to rubber.\nCoco Jumbo (ココ・ジャンボ, Koko Janbo)\n\nCoco Jumbo is a turtle gifted to the group by the boss. Its Stand, Mr. President (ミスター・プレジデント, Misutā Purejidento), manifests as an interdimensional hotel room inside its shell which the group use as a mobile safe house. During Chariot Requiem's attack on Rome, Polnareff's recently-deceased soul seeks refuge inside Mr. President and remains there even after Chariot Requiem's destruction.\nDiavolo (ディアボロ, Diaboro)\nThe main antagonist of Golden Wind and dominant personality of Vinegar Doppio (ヴィネガー・ドッピオ, Vinegā Doppio), speculated to have come about as great enough cause of dissociative identity disorder to exist as two souls occupying the same body that shape shifts depending on the dominant persona. The youthful Doppio, unaware he is an alter ego, serves as Diavolo's middle man to his subordinates. Diavolo is the father of Trish Una and the boss of Passione. He is obsessed with erasing any trace of his past to preserve his anonymity, having Bucciarati's team escort Trish to his location so that he can murder her; he believes their link as genetic relatives could be used to track him, putting his anonymity in jeopardy. Doppio is killed while in Bucciarati's body during the effect of Chariot Requiem prior, Diavolo being in Guido's body with Trish's soul before returning to his body. Diavolo is ultimately defeat by Giorno, placed in an infinite loop of being killed thanks to the power of Gold Experience Requiem.\nHis Stand is King Crimson (キング・クリムゾン, Kingu Kurimuzon), which has the ability to erase the time in which an action will take place, altering what happened in between two intangible points, the effect of which is a sudden time-skip covering up to ten seconds. Time flows normally for Diavolo in skipped time and he alone may move around objects in erased time (visually represented as Diavolo and the object superimposed on each other, in a fashion akin to Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2). For example, this stops Risotto Nero from killing Diavolo when he takes control of Aerosmith in a last ditch-effort to take Diavolo with him, since he uses the time skip to move out of the way of the hail of bullets. King Crimson has a secondary ability called Epitaph (エピタフ, Epitafu) that exists as a second face on King Crimson's forehead and can be used to predict 10 seconds into the future. This method allows him to see within the erased time; any object or individual other than Diavolo must behave according to the prediction. If Epitaph shows him an undesirable outcome, time skip is used to move to a more desired position to counterattack as soon as the time skip ends. If Epitaph shows him an outcome that works in his favor, time skip will allow fate to play out said actions while Diavolo stays hidden. While Doppio does not possess a Stand himself, Diavolo allows him to wield King Crimson's arms and Epitaph.\nHitman Team / Execution Squad (La Squadra Esecuzioni) (暗殺チーム, Ansatsu Chīmu)\nAn execution squad of Stand users within the Passione group under the leadership of Risotto Nero, consisting of Formaggio, Illuso, Prosciutto, Pesci, Melone, Ghiaccio, Sorbet and Gelato. Prior to the events of the series, Sorbet and Gelato planned to overthrow the boss, but the boss found out and had them brutally executed. The rest of the team serve as the main antagonists of the part's first half, planning to overthrow the Boss themselves via receiving his whereabouts from Trish.\n\n\nPart 6: Stone Ocean\nSet in 2011-12 Florida, USA, ten years after the events of Golden Wind.\n\nJolyne Cujoh (空条 徐倫, Kūjō Jorīn)\n\nThe main protagonist of Stone Ocean, Jolyne Cujoh is the daughter of Jotaro Kujo and an unknown American woman. Framed for a DUI homicide, she is sent to Green Dolphin Street Prison, where she investigates and battles Dio's most trusted disciple, Father Enrico Pucci. Initially bitter against Jotaro for being absent during her childhood, it becomes her priority to recover his memories and Stand after they are stolen. Her Stand is Stone Free (ストーン・フリー, Sutōn Furī), which allows her to turn her body into an elastic but relatively fragile thread. However, when the thread is tightly coiled together, she can create a much more durable and powerful humanoid Stand. She later dies protecting Emporio, but manages to cut Enrico's right eye in the process. After Emporio defeats Pucci, he meets a reincarnation of her named Irene, who also carries the Joestar birthmark.\nEnrico Pucci (エンリコ・プッチ, Enriko Putchi)\nEnrico Pucci is the main antagonist of Stone Ocean and a loyal follower of Dio, having met him in the 1980s while on the path of priesthood at the age of fifteen and received an Arrow from him. Pucci would later learn of his twin brother Wes and that he is dating their younger sister Perla, his attempt to break them up ending up in causing her death. It was at that time that Pucci acquired his Stand Whitesnake (ホワイトスネイク, Howaitosuneiku), who can steal a person's Stands and memories in the form of compact discs that can be freely inserted into other people and objects. Enrico sought out Dio and learned of his plans of creating \"heaven on earth\", retrieving one of Dio's finger bones to carry out Dio's plan should he die. Placing himself in Green Dolphin Street Prison, stealing Jotaro's memories to execute Dio's vision, Pucci arranged events to create the Green Baby and then absorb it for his Stand to undergo an evolution into the gravity-manipulating C-Moon (C-MOON（シー・ムーン）, Shī Mūn) once at Cape Canaveral. Enrico uses his Stand's ability to complete its evolution into Made in Heaven (メイド・イン・ヘブン, Meido in Hebun), which can accelerate time up to and past a Big Crunch while preserving all living organisms and prohibiting the souls of the dead from reincarnating. The final result of Made in Heaven's time acceleration is a universe where all surviving organisms have subconscious precognition of their destiny, which he believes to be heaven. While he killed Jolyne and the others, Pucci is killed by Emporio during a second acceleration of time before his new universe can be made permanent, creating a new universe without the precognitive effects of its previous iteration. Made in Heaven was previously named \"Stairway to Heaven\" (天国への階段（ステアウェイ・トゥ・ヘブン）, Suteawei Tu Hebun) in the serialization, but was later changed in the tankōbon volumes.\nEmporio Alniño (エンポリオ・アルニーニョ, Enporio Arunīnyo)\nEmporio Alniño is an 11-year-old Cuban-American child, born inside the Green Dolphin prison. He seeks to avenge his mother, who was murdered by Pucci, and has an edge due to Pucci knowing nothing about his existence. He is always seen wearing a baseball uniform and cap, resembling those worn by the Chicago Cubs. His non-combat Stand, Burning Down the House (バーニング・ダウン・ザ・ハウス, Bāningu Daun Za Hausu), can manipulate, see, and use ghostly objects. He sympathizes with Jolyne and becomes one of her most crucial allies. Emporio eventually succeeds in killing Enrico Pucci using Weather Report's Stand, and lives on in the new universe as the lone witness to Jolyne's story.\nErmes Costello (エルメェス・コステロ, Erumēsu Kosutero)\nErmes Costello is Jolyne's friend in prison. When she was 17, her older sister allowed herself to be spotted by a homicidal car salesman named Sports Maxx, subsequently saving Ermes from his wrath, but ending her own life in the process. Enraged, Ermes deliberately had herself arrested in an effort to track Sports Maxx down. Her Stand, Kiss (キッス, Kissu), is a humanoid-like Stand covered in stickers depicting a woman's lips. Using the stickers will duplicate an item perfectly for as long as the sticker is on it. When the sticker is removed, the original item and the duplicate will violently smash into each other and fuse back together, leaving the original object damaged. Ermes is killed in the final battle with Pucci, but Emporio meets a hitchhiker with her appearance and personality after Pucci's defeat.\nWeather Report (ウェザー・リポート, Wezā Ripōto)\nWeather Report is an amnesiac prisoner who allies himself with Jolyne and seeks his memory back after Father Enrico Pucci took it. Weather was originally born as \"Domenico Pucci\" (ドメニコ・プッチ, Domeniko Putchi) to the wealthy Pucci family, being the younger twin brother of Enrico Pucci. He was stolen from the clinic nursery by a woman whose own baby had died soon after birth on the same day. He lived as Wes Bluemarine (ウェス・ブルーマリン, Wesu Burūmarin), until Pucci met the kidnapper at a confessional and found out that they were brothers. Pucci hired detectives to separate Wes from their sister, Perla, whom he had been dating. Unbeknownst to Pucci, the detectives he hired were part of the Ku Klux Klan, and seeing Wes' stepfather was a black man, assumed he was of mixed race. They lynched him and seemingly killed him, prompting Perla to commit suicide. Wes survived and killed the racist detectives with his newly-awakened Stand, Weather Report. Pucci used his own Stand to remove Wes's memories. With no memory of his past or name, Wes adopted the name of his Stand, and eventually ended up in Green Dolphin Street Prison. He regained his memories later in the part thanks to Donatello Versace's Stand, Underworld. This unlocks both his true, more cocky and sinister personality, as well as his Stand's true potential - an ability named Heavy Weather (ヘビー・ウェザー, Hebī Wezā) that creates rainbows which use subliminal messages to make anyone seeing them transform into snails. He is consumed by rage against Pucci, suicidally attempting to kill him. Weather is eventually killed by Pucci, but not before using Whitesnake to turn his Stand into a disc, which eventually becomes the key to Pucci's downfall. After Pucci's defeat, Emporio and the reincarnations of his friends offer a ride to a hitchhiker with a striking resemblance to him.\nNarciso Anasui (ナルシソ・アナスイ, Narushiso Anasui)\nAnasui is an androgynous inmate placed in Green Dolphin Street Prison for murdering his girlfriend, who was having an affair with another man. He falls in love with Jolyne to an obsessive degree, believing that he would be able to \"purify\" himself both by courting and marrying her, and helping her defeat Pucci. Anasui wields the Stand Diver Down (ダイバー・ダウン, Daibā Daun), which allows him to enter objects and restructure their insides. He ultimately sacrifices himself in the final battle with Pucci to warn Jotaro of Made in Heaven's attack. After Emporio defeats Pucci, Emporio meets a reincarnation of him named Anakiss, who is engaged to Jolyne's reincarnation with plans to marry.\nFoo Fighters (フー・ファイターズ, Fū Faitāzu)\nFoo Fighters, commonly referred to as F.F. (F・F（エフ・エフ）, Efu Efu), is a fusion of a colony of plankton and a Stand of the same name, created by Enrico Pucci to guard Jotaro's Stand Disc. But upon being defeated by Jolyne, Foo Fighters allies with her out of gratitude, possessing the corpse of a prisoner named Atroe (エートロ, Ētoro). F.F sacrifices herself for Narciso, preferring death with her memories over being remade as a new being with no sentience. While referenced as female in Japanese media, Foo Fighters is referred to with non-binary pronouns in the anime's English dub.\nDonatello Versus (ドナテロ・ヴェルサス, Donatero Verusasu)\nDonatello is one of Dio's illegitimate sons, and the half-brother of Ungalo, Rikiel, and Giorno Giovanna, who fatefully meets Enrico Pucci. His Stand, Under World (アンダー・ワールド, Andā Wārudo), can resurrect the memories of people, things, or events from the ground. After failing to eliminate Ermes Costello and Jolyne in the memory of a plane crash, Versus betrays Pucci by stealing Weather Report's memory disc. Afterward, Versus seeks Jotaro's memory disc in an attempt to claim Pucci's destiny, but is eventually cornered by Jolyne and Ermes and forced to drive to Weather and Pucci's location. In the ensuing chaos, Versus is used as a decoy by an escaping Pucci before being killed by Anasui.\n\n\nPart 7: Steel Ball Run\nSet in a rebooted universe in post-Civil War America circa 1890.\n\nJohnny Joestar (ジョニィ・ジョースター, Jonī Jōsutā)\nJohnny Joestar is the main protagonist of Steel Ball Run. Born in Kentucky and spending some time in the United Kingdom, Johnny was a horse racing prodigy until an altercation left him paralyzed from the waist down. He participates in the Steel Ball Run in order to follow Gyro Zeppeli and learn how to use the Spin, as it is the only thing that has made him able to stand on his own again. Johnny races on the horse Slow Dancer (スロー・ダンサー, Surō Dansā) and eventually develops the Stand Tusk (タスク, Tasuku), at first allowing him to shoot his fingernails at people, but it soon evolves through a series of Acts. With Act 2 he imparts his fingernails with the Spin, allowing him to move the holes his fingernails produce. Act 3 allows Johnny to teleport parts of himself through the holes after he shoots himself with an Act 2 fingernail. The final form of Act 4 is the most powerful offensive Stand in the part, allowing Johnny to trap whoever his nail hits in a constant loop during which they cannot leave where they were located at the time of the attack until the Spin is stopped by Johnny, or else they will eventually be killed by the Super Spin literally unraveling their DNA; Act 4's physical form is also so strong that it can bend reality itself, ripping apart the barriers between dimensions to travel to alternate timelines or peeling the layers of his own dimension. In JoJolion, Johnny is revealed to have married a Japanese woman named Rina Higashikata with the Higashikata Family as his descendants alongside Joseph \"Fumi\" Joestar and the universe's version of Yoshikage Kira.\nLucy Steel (ルーシー・スティール, Rūshī Sutīru)\nLucy Steel is a fourteen-year-old girl who tries to help Johnny and Gyro, and is the wife of the Steel Ball Run promoter Stephen Steel. She eventually obtains the Stand Ticket to Ride (涙の乗車券（チケット・ゥ・ライド）, Chiketto u Raido) that offers her a form of divine protection. In Jojolion, an elderly Lucy became an agent of the Speedwagon Foundation and encounters Fumi while investigating the Higashikata Family in 1941.\nFunny Valentine (ファニー・ヴァレンタイン, Fanī Varentain)\nFunny Valentine is the main antagonist of Steel Ball Run, and a dishonorably discharged American soldier who became the 23rd President of the United States. His ultimate goal is to reassemble the Saint's Corpse and use its power for world dominion, using the corpse's heart to gain the Stand Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap（いともたやすく行われるえげつない行為）, Dātī Dīzu Dan Dāto Chīpu (Itomo Tayasuku Okonawareru Egetsunai Kōi)) or D4C (D4C（ディー･フォー･シー）, Dī Fō Shī) for short. D4C enables Valentine to travel between alternate dimensions by being pressed between two objects and transfer his mind into another version of himself, usually as a means to cheat death. The Stand also enables Valentine to summon others from alternate realities, though only he and his counterparts are immune to the usual demise of two iterations of the same person annihilating each other in the form of Menger sponges upon physical contact.\nDiego Brando (ディエゴ・ブランドー, Diego Burandō)\nDiego Brando, nicknamed Dio, is a British racer in the Steel Ball Run, riding the horse Silver Bullet (シルバーバレット, Shirubā Baretto). He is initially just a rival to Gyro and Johnny, but allies himself with Valentine and grows to hate them. After being subject to the Stand of Dr. Ferdinand, Diego acquires one of the Saint Corpse's eyes and obtains the Stand Scary Monsters (恐竜（スケアリー・モンスター）, Sukearī Monsutā), allowing him to transform into a dinosaur at will, as well as transform other living beings into dinosaurs or fossilize them. After he turns on the president, attempting to assassinate him, and dies, Valentine uses D4C to bring another Diego Brando into this iteration of reality. This alternate Diego possesses the Stand The World (THE WORLD（ザ・ワールド）, Za Wārudo), which functions the same as its original universe counterpart.\nGyro Zeppeli (ジャイロ・ツェペリ, Jairo Tseperi)\nGyro Zeppeli is a disgraced magistrate and executioner from the Kingdom of Naples, who participates in the Steel Ball Run to free someone who he believes has been wrongly imprisoned, racing on his horse Valkyrie (ヴァルキリー, Varukirī). Gyro is a master of a mystical art called the Spin, which is channeled through Steel Balls and is the art of imparting the knowledge of the Golden rectangle into throwing the Steel Balls, causing the Spin to be transferred from the ball to the target. It has both healing and offensive properties, as the Zeppeli family has used the Spin in both their medical practice and in their work as executioners for the church. Gyro later develops an ability called Scan (スキャン, Sukyan) when one of his Steel Balls is imparted with a piece of the Saint's Corpse. Scan gives Gyro the ability to look inside people, making his Spin's attacks even more deadly. With the power of the Super Spin, accessed by having Valkyrie run at a fast enough speed to make everything incorporate the Golden rectangle, he develops the Stand Ball Breaker (ボール・ブレイカー, Bōru Bureikā), which, when a Steel Ball hits its mark, causes the vast energies kept by the Spin to accelerate the life of cells in the target so much so that the cells die. Gyro's real name is Julius Caesar Zeppeli ((ユーリウス・カイザー・ツェペリ, Yūriusu Kaizā Tseperi).\nSandman (砂男（サンドマン）, Sandoman)\nSandman was a member of a Native American tribe, from which he had become ostracized from for embracing the \"white man's\" culture. He believes that the only way to stop the encroachment of his tribe's land is to play by the settlers' rules, thus he enters the Steel Ball Run race hoping to use the prize money to buy back his ancestor's land and protect his tribe. During the fight against Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli, Gyro uses his newfound Golden Rectangle technique to injure the overconfident Sandman, leading to his death. He uses the Stand called In a Silent Way (イン・ア・サイレント・ウェイ, In A Sairento Wei), which is able to store sounds in objects and activate their corresponding effect when touched, similar to Echoes Act 2 from the original universe. Sandman's real name is Soundman (サウンドマン, Saundoman), with the former being a mispronunciation used by white settlers.\n\n\nPart 8: JoJolion\nThe series follows the rebooted timeline from Steel Ball Run, with the story taking place immediately after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\nJosuke Higashikata (東方 定助, Higashikata Jōsuke)\nThe main protagonist of JoJolion, he was originally Josefumi Kujo (空条 仗世文, Kūjō Josefumi), a young man who was friends with his universe's version of Yoshikage Kira. When he helped Kira steal a branch of the Locacaca Tree for his mother Holly, it resulted in Kira being fatally wounded before he and Josefumi were buried alive by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The properties of the New Locacaca Fruit they created caused Josefumi to acquire parts of Kira's physical and genetic traits and effectively become a fusion of the two, an entirely different person with no memory of his past. He is found and named \"Josuke\" by Yasuho Hirose, who brings him into the care of the Higashikata family. When Josuke learns of his origins, he suffers an existential crisis until deciding to honor his components' intentions to save Holly and track down the New Locacaca.\nJosuke possesses the Stand Soft & Wet (ソフト＆ウェット, Sofuto Ando Wetto), which allows him to produce bubbles that, upon contact with an object, can steal an aspect of the object that can then be used for other purposes, such as a person's eyesight or the friction of the floor. Josuke is also able to freely control the size of these bubbles, creating small ones when he needs to steal something discretely or bigger ones when he needs to steal larger things, up to and including entire people. His bubbles are actually soft, spinning lines; thus revealing that his Stand is related to the Spin. Combined with Killer Queen's ability to create bombs, this unlocks a new ability called Soft & Wet: Go Beyond (S＆W（ソフトアンドウェット） 越えて行く, Sofuto Ando Wetto Gō Biyondo), which creates explosive bubbles that can pass through any barrier, including Wonder of U's Flow of Calamity.\nWhile Josefumi's connection to the Joestar family is ambiguous at best (he is inconsistently drawn with the Joestar birthmark, and his family tree beyond his parents is unknown), Kira is the great-great-grandson of Johnny Joestar, making Josuke the great-great-grandson of Johnny by proxy.\nYasuho Hirose (広瀬 康穂, Hirose Yasuho)\nYasuho is a young woman who discovers Josuke buried in the ground and helps him throughout the search for his true identity, and later helps him search for the Locacaca. Her Stand is Paisley Park (ペイズリー・パーク, Peizurī Pāku), which has the ability to \"direct\" things around Yasuho, although it often acts on Yasuho's subconscious needs rather than her being able to directly control it. Later gaining slightly better control over her Stand, Yasuho is eventually able to use Paisley Park to directly interface with different types of electronic devices and gather data from them.\nRai Mamezuku (豆銑 礼, Mamezuku Rai)\nA man who is the Higashikata family's private fruit grower and appraiser. After being tracked down and attacked by a hostile Stand user due to his affiliations with the Higashikata family, Mamezuku decides to meet up with Josuke and Yasuho for help, eventually joining the two in their search for the Locacaca. His Stand is Doggy Style (ドギー・スタイル, Dogī Sutairu), which enables him to unravel his body into prehensile ribbon-like wires, not only increasing his range but also increasing his durability to certain forms of attacks. He knows the Spin, and is the one who revealed the secret within Josuke's stand.\nNorisuke Higashikata IV (四代目東方憲助, Yondaime Higashikata Norisuke)\nThe current head of the Higashikata family, and owner of the Higashikata Fruit Company. In the hopes of helping his family find a cure for the Higashikata Family Curse, a disease that gradually petrifies the firstborn male of every generation, he adopts Josuke Higashikata to help him recover his memories, as he knew that Josuke was searching for a cure in his past life. His Stand is King Nothing (キング・ナッシング, Kingu Nasshingu), which is able to break down into jigsaw pieces, and track a specific person or object with their scent.\nJobin Higashikata (東方 常敏, Higashikata Jōbin)\nA major antagonist of the part, he is the eldest son of Norisuke, and the heir to the Higashikata Fruit Company. Jobin worked with Tamaki Damo's Locacaca Smuggling Organization to launder money for them, in the hopes of taking one of the fruits to cure his family from the Higashikata Curse, and elevate their place in society. Jobin is willing to push his family to the top by any means necessary, even resorting to murder. His stand is Speed King (スピード・キング, Supīdo Kingu), which has the ability to store heat in any object it touches, which can become as hot as 300 °C, and can be transferred to humans who touch such objects, with the possibility of being lethal. Alternatively, he can simply use Speed King to touch humans, and heat them directly, which can place them in heat strokes, or worse.\nToru (透龍, Tōru)\nToru is the main antagonist of JoJolion, who is introduced in the Doctor Wu and Awaking 3 Leaves story arc. He is portrayed as Yasuho Hirose's ex-boyfriend from high school and a part-time worker at TG University Hospital with ties to the hospital's head doctor, Satoru Akefu. It is revealed later that Akefu is an alias for Toru's Stand Wonder of U (ワンダー・オブ・U（ユー）, Wandā Obu Yū), and that he is the true mastermind behind the activities of the Rock Humans. His main goal is to obtain the New Locacaca, causing him to clash with Josuke and the Higashikata family. Wonder of U causes anyone who attempts to pursue him or his stand to suffer \"calamities\", spontaneous freak accidents via objects crashing into them with disproportionate force (A cigarette butt has enough force to pierce someone's hand). It is revealed near the end of Part 8 that his Stand only manipulated the \"laws of calamity\" towards those who pursued him, and that it was a force of nature itself. After Toru's death, Wonder of U continued to attack Norisuke IV until being destroyed by Josuke using Soft & Wet: Go Beyond.\n\n\nPart 9: The JoJoLands\nThe series follows the rebooted timeline from Steel Ball Run and JoJolion, with the story taking place in Oahu, Hawaii, sometime in the early 2020s.\n\nJodio Joestar (ジョディオ・ジョースター, Jodio Jōsutā)\nJodio Joestar is a 15-year-old gangster living with his family on Oahu, Hawaii, where he acts as a gofer for the state's underground drug trade. Using his stand, November Rain (11月の雨（ノーベンバー・レイン）, Nōbenbā Rein), Jodio can create raindrops with crushing force. Despite his popularity among his peers and his outwardly cocky persona, he suffers from Antisocial personality disorder and finds it difficult to be truly happy.\nDragona Joestar (ドラゴナ・ジョースター, Doragona Jōsutā)\nDragona Joestar is Jodio's 18-year-old brother. Aside from operating in his gang, Dragona works in a fashion boutique. Despite being born male, he is fascinated with femininity to the point he takes breast enlargement injections to fit into women's clothing more naturally. His stand, Smooth Operators (スムース・オペレイターズ, Sumūsu Opereitāzu), consists of small robots capable of displacing anything.\nPaco Laburantes (パコ・ラブランテス, Pako Raburantesu)\nPaco Laburantes is a 19-year-old classmate of Jodio's, and part of their gang. He comes from an abusive household, having one of his ears partially bitten off by his father, and engages in thievery as if it were a sport. His stand, The Hustle (THEハッスル, Za Hassuru), is capable of bulging his muscles to grab onto objects without using his hands, allowing him to make impressive sleights of hand.\nUsagi Aloha'oe (ウサギ・アロハオエ, Usagi Arohaoe)\nUsagi Aloha'oe is a 17-year-old classmate of Jodio's, who takes part in stealing the diamond under Meryl Me Qi's request. He is also one of Meryl's most frequent customers, causing his other accomplices to rule him off as an addict and a hindrance. Using his stand, The Matte Kudasai (THE MATTE KUDASAI（ザ・マッテ・クダサイ）, Za Matte Kudasai), he can use an existing object to transform into what someone else wants it to be, excluding his own wishes.\nMeryl Me Qi (メリル・メイ・チー, Meriru Mei Chī)\nMeryl Me Qi is the principal of Jodio's school and owner of a fashion boutique, who is also the boss of Jodio and his classmates. She instructs them to steal a diamond from a then unknown Japanese tourist visiting the islands.\nBarbara Ann Joestar (バーバラ・アン・ジョースター, Bābara An Jōsutā)\nBarbara Ann Joestar is the mother of Jodio and Dragona Joestar. Due to the support of her sons, everyone respects her and assists her when needed.\nRohan Kishibe (岸辺 露伴, Kishibe Rohan)\nRohan Kishibe is a successful Japanese manga artist visiting Hawaii for a 15-day vacation. Jodio and his classmates are tasked with stealing the diamond from his villa. Unlike other Part 7-9 counterparts to the original universe, Rohan's appearance is identical to his prior incarnation. Like his original counterpart, his stand is Heaven's Door (ヘブンズ・ドアー, Hebunzu Doā), which can peel a person's skin open to reveal pages of a book underneath, showing the person's memories and personality.\nCharming Man (チャーミング・マン, Chāmingu Man)\nCharming Man is a secondary ally initially introduced as an antagonist attempting to steal the Lava Rock from Jodio's group for their own purposes. It is later revealed that Charming Man has a younger brother named Mauka that has been sucked into the lava tube of the Hualālai volcano from where the Lava Rock originates, hence his interest for it. He then helps the group to claim the rights of Howler, the infrastructure management company that owns the Lava Rock's land. One of the most proimminent details of Charming Man is his rough, rock-like sandy skin, according to Paco. Like every member of Jodio's group, Chaming Man wields the stand Bigmouth Strikes Again (ビッグマウス・ストライクス・アゲイン, Biggumausu Sutoraikusu Agein), that allows him to use a layer of his skin to manipulate perception and blend with its surroundings (for example fuse with the sky). This Stand also allows him to change his appearance and hide weapons under his skin, like a knife. He is also an expert bicyclst.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Malcolm Armstrong Harrison (3 September 1941 – 2 November 2007) was a New Zealand clothing designer and textile artist.\n\n\nCareer\nBorn in Christchurch, Harrison started his career as a window dresser with the D.I.C department store in his home town, while taking night classes in patternmaking. In the 1960s he worked as a clothing designer in Auckland. In 1961, aged 19, he was a finalist in the New Zealand Gown of the Year competition; in 1962 he won second place in the competition with an embroidered and beaded dress called Scheherazade. Harrison worked with    Auckland fashion designer Colin Cole before opening his own boutique, Jasper Johnsons Jamboree, in Takapuna, and developed a reputation for his gowns, bespoke suits and bridal wear.\nIn the 1970s, Harrison shifted his practice from clothing production to quiltmaking, beginning a successful career as a textile artist. His early works were quilts made from dress fabric scraps. His first quilt exhibition was shown in 1979 at the Denis Cohn Gallery in Auckland. These works \"reflected fabric art trends of the time - traditional American quilting techniques depicted subjects including Kiwi aviation pioneer Richard Pearse\".\nHarrison credited Denis Cohn for giving his artistic career a major boost. Cohn introduced Harrison to Wellington art dealer Janne Land, who showed his work regularly until his death.\nThroughout his textile career, Harrisons's work ranged from large-scale quilts to smaller needlepoint canvases and simple works stitched on cloth. Textile historian Ann Packer recognises Harrison as “the man who pioneered quilting as an art form in New Zealand...a storyteller par excellence who creates his narratives in stitch.”\n\n\nMajor works and commissions\nThe Family is a popular and well-known collection of 35 dolls crafted by Harrison over 30 years and exhibited widely throughout New Zealand. The Family was first exhibited at The Dowse Art Museum in 1987, and was re-exhibited several times, including in 2005 and 2014.\nIn 1994, the Parliamentary Service Commission appointed Harrison to design and oversee the creation of two large-scale works for Parliament Buildings in Wellington. The two works, These are Matters of Pride and Whanaungatanga (Relationships), combined Māori weaving traditions with European embroidery practices and drew upon the skills of four Māori weavers and over 700 embroiderers. They took two years to complete.\nOther commissions include Oceania, located in the Bank of New Zealand tower in Queen Street in Auckland, and work in the North Shore City Council Chambers.\n\n\nRecognition\nIn 1992, Harrison represented New Zealand at the Fibre Triennial in Łódź, Poland.\nIn 2004 Harrison was awarded the inaugural Creative New Zealand Craft/Object Art Fellowship, worth $65,000. He created a new body of work as recipient of the award, drawing inspiration from Francisco Goya's etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (c. 1799). The works were shown at an exhibition titled Minus Reason at Auckland gallery Objectspace in 2005.\n\n\nLegacy\nSince Harrison's death on Waiheke Island in 2007, a number of exhibitions have been staged surveying his work or linking his career to that of other artists.\nObjectspace staged a memorial exhibition, Requiem, in 2008. Malcolm Harrison: A celebration, a touring survey exhibition of Harrison's work, showed at the Waiheke Community Art Gallery in 2017. The exhibition included quilt works, tapestries, assemblages, small sculpture, works on paper, poetry, and illustrations and texts for children's books.\nIn 2018 The Dowse Art Museum will show Sleeping Arrangements, an exhibition that brings a selection of Harrison's quilts together with works by three other artists of different generations to his own: Grant Lingard (1961–1995), Zac Langdon-Pole (b. 1988), and Micheal McCabe (b. 1994).\nHarrison's work is held in the collections of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and The Dowse Art Museum.\n\n\nFurther reading\nPeter Shaw, Malcolm Harrison: Quiltmaker, New Zealand Crafts 6, July 1983\nMalcolm Harrison: A celebration, exhibition catalogue, Waiheke Community Art Gallery, 2017\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "KMNY (1360 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Hurst, Texas, and serving the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.  It is owned by Multicultural Broadcasting and broadcasts a Spanish-language Christian radio format known as \"La Voz 1360.\"  KMNY uses a brokered programming approach, where preachers buy blocks of time on the station and can ask for donations during their shows to support their ministries.\nBy day, it is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for AM radio stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.  But at night, to protect other stations on 1360 AM, it reduces power to 890 watts.  While the daytime signal covers the Metroplex, the nighttime signal is limited to a smaller area west of Dallas.  KMNY uses a directional antenna at all times, employing a six-tower array after sunset.  The transmitter is off MacArthur Boulevard in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nThe early years\nIn April 1947, the station signed on as KXOL, originally licensed in Fort Worth. The first voice ever heard live over the air was that of disc jockey, and later actor, Norman Alden. It featured a variety of entertainment programs and country music during its early years. From 1956 to 1976, KXOL played Top 40 music, competing with 1270 KFJZ for youthful listeners. Station personalities during the late 1950s included comedians George Carlin and Jack Burns.\nWith the rise of FM radio and a decrease in ratings and revenue after the combination of Dallas and Fort Worth into one radio market, KXOL switched back to country music in 1976.  In the early 1980s, KXOL also carried the weekend editions of the Texas Night Train and Wonderful Radio London programs, which were heard full-time on Mexican border blaster station XERF AM 1570.\nOther than the special weekend programming, KXOL continued as a country station until it was sold in 1985 and became KWJS, featuring Christian radio programming.  KWJS became KNRB on June 1, 1988, featuring country and then religious formats.\n\n\nChildren's Radio\nIt became KAHZ on September 24, 1993, airing children's programming from the Radio AAHS network.  After Radio AAHS discontinued operations in January 1998, Children's Broadcasting Corporation, KAHZ's owner, needed programming for the network of stations until the company could find buyers. The station, along with the other nine CBC-owned and operated Radio AAHS affiliates, flipped to \"Beat Radio\", which played electronic dance music 12 hours each night until late October 1998.\nKAHZ switched to Catholic religious programming in 1998 and later to Spanish-language talk programming.\n\n\nBiz Radio Network\nThe KMNY call sign began to be used on March 4, 2005.  A business talk format debuted the following month as KMNY Biz Radio 1360. Nighttime slots were filled with brokered programming in Spanish, Chinese and other languages, or automated adult standards music during non-sponsored times.\nBeginning in 2006, KMNY began airing \"The Hi-Fi Club\".  It was a live, weekly oldies/talk show that resurrected its name from KXOL's \"Coca Cola Hi-Fi Club\", heard 1959–62 and originally hosted by comedian George Carlin.  Hosts Mike Shannon, John Lewis Puff, and Ray Whitworth covered historic local and national events, along with local radio and television history, regularly breaking an unwritten rule by discussing competing area stations by name.  Offbeat and candid in nature, it also features live and recorded interviews with historical local radio notables such as Norman Alden, Bob Schieffer, Bud Buschardt, George Gimarc, Jack Burns, Russ Bloxom and Bob Allen.\nIn November 2006, \"The Hi-Fi Club\" presented the radio special, \"As it Happened:  The Lost JFK Assassination Tapes of KXOL-1360\" over KMNY.  This was a two-hour compilation of audio recordings from KXOL, mostly in the post-assassination hours and continuing into the early morning of 11/23/1963.  The recordings were edited from reels provided by KXOL newsman Russ Bloxom, who was on duty at the station's newsdesk when President John F. Kennedy was killed, and had never been replayed.  \"The Hi-Fi Club\" reunited the recordings with their original frequency, and Russ Bloxom provided a new five-minute interview as part of the presentation.  An edited version of the presentation aired over KMNY on November 23, 2008.\nIn January 2007, the station aired a sports talk show titled \"Sports Kings\".\n\n\nProgressive Talk and Retro Radio\nIn January 2008, the station began airing progressive talk programming sponsored by Rational Radio (via Nova M Radio) from 7PM-midnight, featuring Mike Malloy.\nThe BizRadio Network left KMNY (1360) for KJSA 1110 AM on May 23, 2008.  Testing of the new 1110 frequency's signal began in April 2008.  (In 2007, KJSA received a construction permit to move from 1120, to 1110 AM—with a considerable power increase to 20,000 watts.)  From May 24 to June 30, 2008, KMNY aired \"Retro Radio\", a block format put together by \"The Hi-Fi Club\"'s Mike Shannon.  Weekdays, oldies shows were hosted by Jim Thomas, Bud Buschardt, Randy Carlisle, Josh Holstead, John Lewis and Jay Weaver; \"The Larry Stanley Show,\" an irreverent 'guy talk' show, aired Saturdays; and \"The Hi-Fi Club\" expanded to Sunday afternoons.  Music during non-show times consisted of automated classic rock.  Retro Radio aired a tribute to George Carlin upon his death in June 2008.  KXOL-1360 veterans Bob Bruton and Jack Burns participated.\n\n\nRational Radio\nRational Radio group leased the entire 24-hour-a-day KMNY schedule from MRBI beginning July 1, 2008.  It concluded on December 31, 2009. In addition to Mike Malloy, the new schedule featured Dial Global's Ed Schultz, Bill Press, and Thom Hartmann, and Air America's Lionel.  KMNY's \"The Hi-Fi Club\" was on the station prior to the switch of the station from Biz Radio to Rational Radio and was carried over into the Rational Radio Format.\nOn April 1, 2009, Rational Radio added local hosts The Pugs and Kelly Show on weekday afternoons with Richard Hunter following. Weekend hosts included Cindy Sheehan of \"Cindy Sheehan's Soapbox\" and Jack E. Jett. The rest of the lineup was filled syndicated programming including Thom Hartmann and Air America Radio.\nIn December 2009, station president Dave Clifton announced that the station had been outbid for its lease renewal and would move much its locally originated programming to internet radio. While Rational Radio seeks a new broadcast home, they ended their run on KMNY on December 31, 2009.\n\n\nReturn to Business\nOn January 1, 2010, KMNY returned to a business talk radio format, airing the Biz Radio Network once again with a 24-hour lineup.  In February 2010, the programming on KMNY 1360 switched to various ethnic and foreign language shows, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek.\nOn April 28, 2014, owner Multicultural announced the station was for sale, though as of 2022, there is still no buyer for KMNY.  Multicultural began airing a Spanish-language Christian radio format sometime later.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFacility details for Facility ID 10825 (KMNY)   in the FCC Licensing and Management System\nKMNY in Nielsen Audio's AM station database\nRational Radio 1360 official website\nDallas Air America- now North Texas Progressive\nDFW Radio/TV History\n\"The Hi-Fi Club\" (2006)\nDFW Radio Archives\nRandy A.

    "summary": "KMNY (1360 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Hurst, Texas, and serving the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.  It is owned by Multicultural Broadcasting and broadcasts a Spanish-language Christian radio format known as \"La Voz 1360.\"  KMNY uses a brokered programming approach, where preachers buy blocks of time on the station and can ask for donations during their shows to support their ministries.\nBy day, it is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for AM radio stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.  But at night, to protect other stations on 1360 AM, it reduces power to 890 watts.  While the daytime signal covers the Metroplex, the nighttime signal is limited to a smaller area west of Dallas.  KMNY uses a directional antenna at all times, employing a six-tower array after sunset.  The transmitter is off MacArthur Boulevard in Grand Prairie, Texas.",

    "text": "The history of IBM research in Israel dates from 1972 with the establishment of the IBM Haifa Research Lab. The research lab is located in a custom-built complex on the University of Haifa campus, with branches in Haifa and Tel Aviv. The staff at the IBM Haifa Research Lab works on projects connected to the topics of healthcare, cloud computing, formal and image and video analytics among others.\n\n\nOverview\nAt the IBM Haifa Research Lab, 25% of the technical staff have doctoral degrees in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Employees are actively involved in teaching at Israeli higher education institutions such as the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) and supervising post-graduate theses. Many employees have received IBM awards for achievements and excellence.\nOver the years, the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel described itself as attempting to strike a delicate balance between applied (relatively short-term) and long-term industrial research. While contributing to product development on many levels, the Lab also maintains close ties to the academic world. The Lab aims to simultaneously meet the needs of the present day while helping shape the future of information technology.\nSince its establishment in 1972, the  IBM Haifa Research Lab described itself as trying to be responsive to both the research goals of IBM and the specific needs of Israeli industry – from medical non-invasive diagnosis projects, to computer-controlled irrigation, scheduling El Al flight crews, and Hebrew voice recognition. Today, its contributions play a role in emerging technologies such as IBM's eLiza project for self-managing computer systems, iSCSI for the IBM TotalStorage IP Storage 200i, the InfiniBand high bandwidth network protocol, Enterprise Storage Systems, and information retrieval engines. In addition, verification tools developed in Haifa are used throughout IBM labs to verify and test software and hardware.\n\n\nBeginnings\nIn 1971–73, Dr Alfred Inselberg (AI) from the IBM Los Angeles Scientific Center was on sabbatical leave at the Technion's new department of Applied Mathematics. In 1972, Shimon Yagil contacted AI explaining that IBM Israel was looking for ways to increase IBM's presence in Israel. He asked AI to make presentations on IBM's Scientific Centers and write a proposal for such a Scientific Center in Israel. David Cohen, general manager of IBM Israel, and others attended the presentations and enthusiastically endorsed the proposal which eventually IBM World Trade accepted. This was the genesis of the idea. Prof. Phillip Rabinowich lobbied for IBM's center to be at the Weizmann Institute. However, the Scientific center was established at the Technion, as promoted by Shimon and AI, so that the undergraduate and graduate students there will learn about IBM's scientific activities.\nThe concept of establishing a research center for IBM in Israel was the idea of the late David Cohen, then general manager of IBM Israel, and the late Prof. Josef Raviv, an Israeli computer scientist who headed a research group at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York City. Raviv was active in the growth of the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel.\nIn 1971, Raviv spent a year on sabbatical in Israel, where he met with Cohen. They convinced IBM management to open a center in Israel, modeled after the Scientific Centers in the United States, England, Germany, France and Italy. These centers described themselves as non-profit organizations whose goals were to promote the development of computer science and utilize advanced technology to solve problems critical to the local community. Raviv, Cohen and IBM said that with its international reputation for scientific research, a pool of talented researchers, and the support of advanced research institutions, Israel offered an attractive environment for research and development operations. This was a groundbreaking step. At the time, beyond the military industry, the field of hi-tech seemed to be almost non-existent in Israel, and computing appeared to be just starting to gain momentum in academic institutions.\nIn 1972, the IBM Israel Scientific Center opened its doors in the Computer Science Building of the Technion, with a handful of employees: Raviv as manager, three researchers, and one programmer.\n\n\nEarly collaborative projects\nUsing the Technion's computing facilities, the Center embarked on projects in the fields of medicine, agriculture, economics, computer sciences, and applied mathematics in computer applications.\nAt first, the Center said its work was done in cooperation with Israeli public and academic research groups. Teams composed of Scientific Center personnel and research partners worked on joint projects, and their results were published in the public domain, as per IBM guidelines for all Scientific Centers. This may have turned out to be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the focus on projects had the potential to make a difference for the country without having to make direct return-on-investment considerations. On the other hand, researchers said they were frustrated by the inability to see their work mature into practical implementation and use.\n\n\nJoint Ventures across the Oceans\nIn the late 1970s, Raviv began searching for ways to expand the Scientific Center's activities. He approached other Scientific Centers in Europe about conducting joint research projects. One of these was a project in farm management, in collaboration with the Madrid Scientific Center. This allowed the Haifa team to buy their first computer. It was a 5110—a portable computer roughly the size of a suitcase. The research team implemented algorithms on this machine and carried it from one kibbutz (collective farm) to another, to solve their individual irrigation problems.\nAn important project was the development of an ultrasound system for the early detection of liver cancer, in conjunction with IBM Austria and Israel's Sheba Hospital. Although today ultrasound equipment is routinely used in a wide range of medical applications, at the time it was a relatively new technology. Haifa's expertise in signal processing was key to the development of this project.\nAnother important project appears to have been computer assisted medical diagnosis – a computer-based system to aid physicians in their diagnostic and treatment decisions in different medical fields. The project, headed by Bezalel Gavish, developed new artificial intelligence methods (production systems). The first area tested was endocrinology and infertility done in cooperation with the Sheba medical center, Tel hashomer. The project was later tested with a group at the Rotschild hospital in Haifa, Dutch Hospitals in the Netherlands. It was extended to other fields of endoctinology, to Congenital malformation, and to heart related issues.\nDue to collaborative projects such as these, the Scientific Center quickly became recognized as a focal point for research and development in engineering and scientific computing for IBM's European Scientific Centers. This facilitated the growth of the Center from fifteen to twenty-two employees. To accommodate its expansion, the Scientific Center moved to newer and larger premises in the Technion's Andre and Bella Meyer Advanced Technology Center in 1982.\n\n\nResearch group opens in Haifa\nRaviv was still considering ways to expand the Center. As he searched for new avenues for cooperation, he hit on the idea of subcontracting to the IBM Research labs in the United States. He thought that perhaps the labs in the US could use specific skills to solve specific problems, and might be interested in working on a per-project basis.\nAt the time, this was a radical idea, but as it took shape, Dr Ralph Gomory, Director of IBM Research, decided to sponsor the concept and created the Haifa Research Group (HRG) in 1982. This new activity began with only two projects—vendor chip testing and DAIOS (DASD I/O simulations)—and grew at an unprecedented rate. These two projects formed a core of activity that eventually led to the creation of the Haifa Research Lab's Verification Technologies and Storage System Technologies departments and to the Haifa Microelectronics Development Lab.\nIn 1983, the Scientific Center and HRG came together under the roof of the Science and Technology Division of IBM Israel. It became a legal subsidiary of IBM Israel in 1989, which, at the time, was managed by Joshua Maor. Its major research and development projects in the 1980s included Hebrew computational linguistics (including text-to-speech synthesis for the blind), optimization of water distribution systems, computer-based education technology, portrait compression, signal processing for the hearing impaired, document recognition and processing, hand-written and printed text recognition, data compression and parsing techniques, and VLSI design verification, and testing tools.\n\n\nIBM as solutions provider\nDuring the late 1980s, the emphasis of the Scientific Center's work began to shift. IBM was phasing out its Scientific Centers as computing became more widely used. In Israel, a decision was made to change the focus of the Center's work to benefit IBM Israel by finding solutions for its customers. In 1992, the Israel Scientific Center formally became known as the Advanced Solutions Center of IBM Israel.\nIn recognition of the value that the Center was bringing to IBM, in 1993, Dr Jim McGroddy, director of IBM Research, renamed it the IBM Haifa Research Laboratory. At the time, it was one of only three laboratories affiliated with the IBM Research Division outside of the United States, the others being Zurich and Tokyo. At the time, the Center had more than 250 employees; to accommodate its growing staff, HRL moved into Building 8/1 in the MATAM Advanced Technology Center at the southern tip of Haifa, not far from the Carmel Beach.\nDuring the 1990s, HRL's contributions to research and development were reflected in a variety of IBM products, such as the hardware and software for RS/6000 workstations, mathematical elementary functions for several IBM computers, consistent backup of data without interruption to active applications, and design verification of certain IBM products. HRL became the largest Research lab outside the United States.\nIn 1999, on his 65th birthday, Raviv retired as director of HRL and began to pursue the establishment of an IBM development center in Israel. A few months later, he and his wife, Joanna, were killed in a car crash while on vacation in New Zealand.\nThe development center planned by Raviv eventually became the Israel Systems and Technology Group (STG) Lab. The activities of the Israel STG Lab include storage technologies, high-speed networks, high-speed circuits, software/ hardware integration, and physical design of VLSI components.\n\n\nCollaboration with academia\nIn its 30th year, the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel moved to a new home on the University of Haifa campus. From its vantage point on the Carmel mountain range, the building has views of the Mediterranean Sea and the city of Haifa. \nThe researchers at the Lab teach at the Technion, the University of Haifa, and Tel Aviv University. They supervise student theses and undergraduate projects. Several staff members are also involved in special projects with academic institutions in Israel, the United States, and Europe, including collaborations with Purdue University, Bar-Ilan University, the University of Maryland, and numerous academic institutions throughout Europe. Today, the IBM Haifa Research Lab describes itself as having the highest number of employees in Israel's hi-tech industry who hold doctorate degrees in science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Researchers participate in international conferences and are published in professional publications.\nThe IBM Haifa Research Lab is part of the IBM R&D Labs in Israel.\n\n\nSee also\nIBM R&D Labs in Israel\nScience and technology in Israel\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Gewehr-Granatpatrone 40 or GGP/40 for short was a shaped charge rifle grenade used by German forces during the Second World War.  It was originally developed for Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger units to provide them with a light and portable anti-tank weapon.   \n\n\nHistory\nThe GGP/40 was developed by WASAG in 1940 at the request of the Luftwaffe.  It was not operational in time for the French Campaign but it is thought to have been operational in 1941 and first used by Fallschirmjäger units during the Battle of Crete.  However, it soon became apparent that its aerodynamics, accuracy, range and armor penetration were all poor.  In 1942 a requirement for a better projectile with 50 mm (2 in) to 70 mm (3 in) of armor penetration was drawn up but experience on the Eastern Front soon showed that even that level of performance would be insufficient so development was abandoned.  The army by that time had also developed better rifle grenades.\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe GGP/40 was not fired from the same Gewehrgranatengerät or Schießbecher (\"shooting cup\") used by the army, instead using its own spigot type launcher. Unlike the rifle grenades used by the army the GGP/40 did not fit inside the Schießbecher but instead, it had a rubber gasket at the base and fit around the Schießbecher and was held in place by a clip.  The GGP/40 was propelled by a rifle cartridge that fired a hollow wooden bullet instead of a blank cartridge.  Another key difference between the GGP/40 and the army grenades was that it was fin-stabilized instead of spin-stabilized and did not have a rifled driving band.  The major components of the GGP/40 were; rubber base gasket, six tail fins, hollow cylindrical base, graze fuze, bell-shaped warhead, RDX filling, internal steel cone, and convex nose cap.  The GGP/40 more closely resembled a mortar round than the army's rifle grenades.    \nThe GGP/40 upon hitting the target ignited the graze fuze which in turn ignited the RDX filling which collapsed the internal steel cone to create a superplastic high-velocity jet to punch through enemy armor.  In general, a longer and wider internal cone equates to increased armor penetration.  Since shaped charge weapons rely on chemical energy to penetrate enemy armor the low velocity of the grenade did not adversely affect penetration.  \n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The gens Seccia, Secia, or Siccia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome.  Few members of this gens occur in history, but a number are known from inscriptions.  The best known members include Lucius Siccius Dentatus, who won martial fame in the fifth century BC, and Gaius Secius Campanus suffect consul under Domitian.\n\n\nOrigin\nThe nomen Seccius seems to be derived from the cognomen Secus.  Chase classifies it among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.  The surname Campanus, borne by the consul Secius, belongs to a class of cognomina derived from places of origin or residence, and indicates that at least some of this family claimed Campanian ancestry, or some other connection with that region of Italy.\n\n\nPraenomina\nThe main praenomina of the Seccii were Gaius, Gnaeus, Lucius, and Sextus, all of which were very common throughout Roman history.\n\n\nBranches and cognomina\nThere is no evidence that the Seccii were ever divided into distinct families.  The surname Dentatus, borne by one of the earliest appearing in history, referred to someone with prominent teeth.  The other cognomina of this gens occur largely in imperial times, when they used a great variety, some of which were the original names of freedmen who adopted Roman names upon their manumission.  A large number of them bore the surname Secundus and its derivatives, Secundinus and Secundina, and the diminutive Secundilla, originally given to a second child.  In its masculine form it is only found as a surname under the Republic, but the feminine form, Secunda, was a common praenomen among Roman women, and in imperial times the distinction between the name as a praenomen and a cognomen begins to blur.\n\n\nMembers\nThis list includes abbreviated praenomina.

The resolution received 13 votes for and 1 abstention with the US vetoing it.\nThe resolution proposed by Egypt received an amendment by Austria, which inserted the phrase \"held by Hamas and other groups,\" in relation to the hostages held by Hamas and other groups in Gaza, and inserting the word \"immediate\" when referring to ensuring that humanitarian access be maintained, which did not gain the two-thirds majority required, with 89 votes for, 61 against and 21 abstentions, so was not adopted. An amendment from the United States of America, calling for wording rejecting and condemning \"heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages\" in resolution's first paragraph, garnered 84 votes for, 62 against and 25 abstentions so did not reach the two-thirds threshold to be carried.\n\n\nVoting record\n\n\nResponse\nOn December 13, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that Australia supported the resolution out of concern for civilians in Gaza Strip, adding that \"Australia has consistently affirmed Israel's right to defend itself...in doing so, we have said as Israel must respect international humanitarian law, civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.\" Reuters described this as it as \"a rare split with...the United States\" and noted that Canada, Australia and New Zealand released a joint statement on December 12 supporting the ceasefire. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations, described the vote as \"historic\" and said the resolution demands an end to the conflict, and said \"we will not rest until we see compliance of Israel with this demand.\" The Israeli Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan argued that the resolution was \"disgraceful\" attempt to restrain Israel, and claimed that \"continuing Israel's operation in Gaza is the only way any hostages will be released.\" He also claimed that supporting the resolution gave terrorists \"a free pass,\" declared that \"a ceasefire will prolong the death and destruction in the region\" and said the resolution was \"hypocritical\".\nMathu Joyini, South Africa's UN representative, invoked South Africa's painful experience with apartheid and said that countries need to take action \"in accordance with international law\" and called the resolution \"an opportunity...to illustrate that the [UN]...is not tone-deaf to the suffering of the most vulnerable.\" Munir Akram, the Pakistani permanent representative to the U.N., denounced the amendments proposed by the US and Austria as \"condemn[ing] only one side but exonerate the other\" and arguing that blame \"has to be placed on both parties, especially on Israel,\" and noted that if Hamas was named, but not Israel, it \"provide[s] a justification to the Israeli war machine to continue its roulette wheel of death.\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, stated that the US saw the humanitarian situation in Gaza as \"dire\" and that \"civilians must be protected with international humanitarian law,\" she urged nations to support an amendment condemning Hamas, and said that a \"ceasefire...would be temporary at best, and dangerous at worst...to Israelis...and...Palestinians.\" Izzat Al-Rishq, member of the Hamas Political Bureau welcomed the resolution and condemned what he described as a \"war of genocide and ethnic cleansing\" against Palestinians.\nAbdulaziz Alwasil, the Saudi ambassador to the UN, supported the resolution, saying Saudi Arabia was voting in favor to end \"the suffering caused by an inhumane military attack by the Israeli occupation forces,\" called for an immediate ceasefire to end the conflict, and the need for \"a comprehensive and just solution for the Palestinian question\" aligned with the Arab Peace Initiative, the two-state solution, and establishment of \"a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\" The Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Zhang Jun stated that the events in Gaza \"is a tragedy, and we must do more.\" In a press release on December 12, Council on American–Islamic Relations National Executive Director Nihad Awad expressed support for the resolution and called on the US government to \"change course\" and for countries across the world to \"pressure the Israeli government to end its campaign of terror in Gaza.\" In a statement to reporters supporting Canada's vote in favor of the resolution, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said \"from the very beginning we have said that Israel has the right to defend itself. How Israel defends itself matters...What is unfolding before our eyes will only enhance the cycle of violence. This will not lead to the durable defeat of Hamas.\" The Canadian Ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae told CBC that the \"status quo\" of the fighting is not sustainable \"from a humanitarian perspective\" while Liberal Party parliament members Anthony Housefather and Marco Mendicino disagreed with Canada's UN vote.\nOn 19 December, a statement from the Liberian information ministry claimed that the nation's president, George Weah, had intervened to reverse its vote on the resolution, from opposing a ceasefire to supporting a ceasefire. Liberia was the only African member-state to vote against the ceasefire. President Weah claimed the Liberian diplomats at the UN voted on the matter without his support.\n\n\nSee also\nUnited Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-10/21\nUnited Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-10/23\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 2712\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a 1956 American science-fiction horror film produced by Walter Wanger, directed by Don Siegel and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The black-and-white film was exhibited in 2.00:1 Superscope and shot in the film noir style. Daniel Mainwaring adapted the screenplay from Jack Finney's 1954 science-fiction novel The Body Snatchers. The film was an independent production but distributed  by Allied Artists Pictures as a double feature with the British science-fiction film The Atomic Man (and in some markets with Indestructible Man).\nThe film's storyline concerns an extraterrestrial invasion that begins in the fictional California town of Santa Mira. Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this \"quiet\" invasion and attempts to stop it.\nThe slang expression \"pod people\" that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n\nPlot\nA psychiatrist, Dr. Hill, is called to a Los Angeles hospital, where a man named Dr. Miles Bennell is being held in custody. Miles recounts the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital.\nIn the nearby town of Santa Mira, Miles sees a number of patients suffering from the belief that their relatives have been replaced with identical-looking impostors. Psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kauffman assures Miles that these cases are merely a mass hysteria. Miles's ex-girlfriend Becky Driscoll has recently come back to town after settling a divorce, and they rekindle their relationship. The couple are called to the home of Miles's friend Jack Belicec, who has found a body in his basement. It has no features or fingerprints, but under their observation it takes on the features of Jack. Remembering that Becky's father was uncharacteristically emerging from his basement, Miles searches there and finds a duplicate of Becky. When Miles calls Dan to the scene, the bodies have disappeared, and Dan tells Miles that he is falling for the same hysteria.\nDistraught by the incidents, Jack and his wife Teddy spend the night at Miles's place. They find duplicates of themselves emerging from pods in Miles's greenhouse and conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with copies. Miles tries to make a call to authorities, but the operator claims that all lines are busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town. Miles and Becky realize that all of Santa Mira's inhabitants have been replaced. They hide at Miles's office for the night.\nThey observe truckloads of the pods arrive downtown. Chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Dan and Jack arrive at Miles's office with pods for Becky and Miles, and say they and Teddy are now members of an extraterrestrial race which arrived on Earth through seeds which sprouted the pods. After their takeover, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality.\nUsing misdirection, Miles and Becky overcome and knock out their captors, and leave the office. To avoid recapture, they pretend Dan succeeded in replacing them with emotionless pod people. However, Becky screams at a near-traffic accident, exposing their humanity to the aliens. An alarm is sounded and the couple flees.\nThe couple hide in a mine outside town. After their pursuers move on they hear music, and Miles leaves Becky to investigate. He sees a farm with hundreds of pods being loaded onto trucks. Miles returns to find Becky succumbing to fatigue. Upon kissing her, he realizes that she has been replaced by a pod person. Becky sounds the alarm as Miles runs away. Desperate, he screams at the drivers on the highway for help.\nMiles finishes his story. A driver is wheeled into the hall on a gurney after having been injured in an accident. The attendant recounts that the man had to be dug out from under a load of mysterious pods coming from Santa Mira. With a key detail thus confirmed, Dr. Hill now believes Miles's story. He alerts the police to block the roads in and out of Santa Mira and calls the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\nCast\nStarring\nKevin McCarthy as Dr. Miles Bennell\nDana Wynter as Becky Driscoll\nKing Donovan as Jack Belicec\nCarolyn Jones as Theodora \"Teddy\" Belicec\nFeaturing\nLarry Gates as Dr. Dan Kauffman\nVirginia Christine as Wilma Lentz\nRalph Dumke as Police Chief Nick Grivett\nKenneth Patterson as Stanley Driscoll\nGuy Way as Officer Sam Janzek\nJean Willes as Nurse Sally Withers\nEileen Stevens as Anne Grimaldi\nBeatrice Maude as Grandma Grimaldi\nWhit Bissell (uncredited) as Dr. Hill\nRichard Deacon (uncredited) as Dr. Bassett\nWith\nBobby Clark as Jimmy Grimaldi\nTom Fadden as Uncle Ira Lentz\nEverett Glass as Dr. Ed Pursey\nDabbs Greer as Mac Lomax\nPat O'Malley as Baggage Man\nSam Peckinpah as Charlie, the Gas Meter Reader\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nNovel and screenplay\nJack Finney's novel ends with the extraterrestrials, who have a lifespan of no more than five years, leaving Earth after they realize that humans are offering strong resistance, despite having little reasonable chance against the alien invasion.\n\n\nBudgeting and casting\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers was originally scheduled for a 24-day shoot and a budget of US$454,864. The studio later asked Wanger to cut the budget significantly. The producer proposed a shooting schedule of 20 days and a budget of $350,000.\nInitially, Wanger considered Gig Young, Dick Powell, Joseph Cotten, and several others for the role of Miles. For Becky, he considered casting Anne Bancroft, Donna Reed, Kim Hunter, Vera Miles, and others. With the lower budget, however, he abandoned these choices and offered the part to Richard Kiley, who had just starred in The Phenix City Story for Allied Artists. Kiley turned the role down and Wanger cast Kevin McCarthy, an Academy Award nominee five years earlier for Death of a Salesman, and relative newcomer Dana Wynter, who had done several major dramatic roles on television.\nFuture director Sam Peckinpah had a small part as Charlie, a meter reader. Peckinpah was a dialogue coach on five Siegel films in the mid-1950s, including this one.\n\n\nPrincipal photography\nOriginally, producer Wanger and Siegel wanted to film Invasion of the Body Snatchers on location in Mill Valley, California, the town just north of San Francisco, that Jack Finney described in his novel. In the first week of January 1955, Siegel, Wanger, and screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring visited Finney to talk about the film version and to look at Mill Valley. The location proved too expensive, and Siegel with Allied Artist executives, found locations resembling Mill Valley in the Los Angeles area, including Sierra Madre, Chatsworth, Glendale, Los Feliz, Bronson, and Beachwood Canyons, all of which went on to make up the fictional town of \"Santa Mira\" for the film. In addition to these outdoor locations, much of the film was shot in the Allied Artists studio on the east side of Hollywood.\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers was shot by cinematographer Ellsworth Fredericks in 23 days between March 23 and April 27, 1955. The cast and crew worked a six-day week with Sundays off. The production went over schedule by three days because of the night-for-night shooting that Siegel wanted. Additional photography took place in September 1955, filming a frame story on which the studio had insisted (see Original ending). The final budget was $382,190.\n\n\nPost-production\nThe project was originally named The Body Snatchers after the Finney serial, but Wanger wanted to avoid confusion with the 1945 Val Lewton film The Body Snatcher. The producer was unable to come up with a title and accepted the studio's choice, They Come from Another World and that was assigned in summer 1955. Siegel objected to this title and suggested two alternatives, Better Off Dead and Sleep No More, while Wanger offered Evil in the Night and World in Danger. None of these was chosen, and the studio settled on Invasion of the Body Snatchers in late 1955. The film was released at the time in France under the mistranslated title L'invasion des profanateurs de sépultures (literally: Invasion of the defilers of tombs), which remains unchanged today.\nWanger wanted to add a variety of speeches and prefaces. He suggested a voice-over introduction for Miles. While the film was being shot, Wanger tried to get permission in England to use a Winston Churchill quotation as a preface to the film. The producer sought out Orson Welles to voice the preface and a trailer for the film. He wrote speeches for Welles' opening on June 15, 1955, and worked to persuade Welles to do it, but was unsuccessful. Wanger considered science-fiction author Ray Bradbury, instead, but this did not happen, either. Mainwaring eventually wrote the voice-over narration himself.\nThe studio scheduled three film previews on the last days of June and the first day of July 1955. According to Wanger's memoranda at the time, the previews were successful. Later reports by Mainwaring and Siegel, however, contradict this, claiming that audiences could not follow the film and laughed in the wrong places. In response, the studio removed much of the film's humor, \"humanity\", and \"quality\", according to Wanger. He scheduled another preview in mid-August that also did not go well. In later interviews, Siegel pointed out studio policy was to not mix humor with horror.\nWanger saw the final cut in December 1955 and protested the use of the Superscope aspect ratio. Its use had been included in early plans for the film, but the first print was not made until December. Wanger felt that the film lost sharpness and detail. Siegel originally shot Invasion of the Body Snatchers in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Superscope was a post-production laboratory process designed to create an anamorphic print from nonanamorphic source material that would be projected at an aspect ratio of 2.00:1.\n\n\nOriginal ending\n \nBoth Siegel and Mainwaring were satisfied with the film as shot. The original ending did not include the flashback framing, and ended with Miles screaming as truckloads of pods pass him on the road. The studio, wary of a pessimistic conclusion, insisted on adding a prologue and epilogue suggesting a more optimistic outcome to the story, leading to the flashback framing. In this version, the film begins with Bennell in custody in a hospital emergency ward, telling a consulting psychiatrist (Whit Bissell) his story. In the closing scenes, pods are discovered at a highway accident, confirming Bennell's warning, and the authorities are alerted, likely stopping the pod distribution and resolving the extraterrestrial threat.\nMainwaring scripted this framing story and Siegel shot it on September 16, 1955, at the Allied Artists studio. In a later interview, Siegel complained, \"The film was nearly ruined by those in charge at Allied Artists who added a preface and ending that I don't like.\" In his autobiography Siegel added that \"Wanger was very much against this, as was I. However, he begged me to shoot it to protect the film, and I reluctantly consented [...].\"\nWhile the Internet Movie Database states that the film had been revised to its original ending for a re-release in 1979, Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique magazine notes that the film was still being shown with the complete footage, including a 2005 screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honoring director Don Siegel.\nAlthough most reviewers disliked it, George Turner (in American Cinematographer) and Danny Peary (in Cult Movies) endorsed the subsequently added frame story. Nonetheless, Peary emphasized that the added scenes changed significantly what he saw as the film's original intention.\n\n\nTheatrical release\nWhen the film was released domestically in February 1956, many theaters displayed several pods made of papier-mâché in theater lobbies and entrances, along with large lifelike black-and-white cutouts of McCarthy and Wynter running away from a crowd. The film earned more than $1 million in the first month, and in 1956 alone earned more than $2.5 million in the U.S. When the film was released in the UK (with cuts imposed by the British censors) in late 1956, the film earned the equivalent of more than half-a-million dollars in ticket sales.\n\n\nReception and legacy\n\n\nCritical reception\nThough Invasion of the Body Snatchers was largely ignored by critics on its initial run, Filmsite.org ranked it as one of the best films of 1956. The film holds a 98% approval rating and 9.1/10 rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus reads: \"One of the best political allegories of the 1950s, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an efficient, chilling blend of sci-fi and horror.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nIn recent years, critics such as Dan Druker of the Chicago Reader have called the film a \"genuine Sci-Fi classic.\" Leonard Maltin described Invasion of the Body Snatchers as \"influential, and still very scary.\" Time Out called the film one of the \"most resonant\" and \"one of the simplest\" of the genre. Mark Steyn described it as \"a big film\", despite its limited budget.\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"—the best 10 films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres—after polling more than 1,500 people from the creative community. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was acknowledged as the 9th-best film in the science-fiction genre. The film was also placed on AFI's AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills, a list of America's most heart-pounding films.\nThe film was included on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 29th scariest film ever made. IGN ranked it as the 15th-best sci-fi picture. Time magazine included Invasion of the Body Snatchers on their list of 100 all-time best films, the top 10 1950s Sci-Fi Movies, and Top 25 Horror Films. In 1999, Entertainment Weekly listed it as the 53rd best movie of all time. Similarly, the book Four Star Movies: The 101 Greatest Films of All Time placed the movie at #60.\n\n\nThemes\nSome reviewers saw in the story a commentary on the dangers facing the United States for turning a blind eye to McCarthyism. Leonard Maltin wrote of a McCarthy-era subtext, or of bland conformity in postwar Eisenhower-era America. Others viewed it as an allegory for the loss of personal autonomy and individualism in the Soviet Union or communist systems in general.\nFor the BBC, David Wood summarized the circulating popular interpretations of the film as: \"The sense of postwar, anticommunist paranoia is acute, as is the temptation to view the film as a metaphor for the tyranny of the McCarthy era.\" Danny Peary in Cult Movies pointed out that the studio-mandated addition of the framing story had changed the film's stance from anti-McCarthyite to anti-communist. Michael Dodd of The Missing Slate has called the movie \"one of the most multifaceted horror films ever made\", arguing that by \"simultaneously exploiting the contemporary fear of infiltration by undesirable elements, as well as a burgeoning concern over homeland totalitarianism in the wake of Senator Joseph McCarthy's notorious communist witch hunt, it may be the clearest window into the American psyche that horror cinema has ever provided.\"\nIn An Illustrated History of the Horror Film, Carlos Clarens saw a trend manifesting itself in science-fiction films, dealing with dehumanization and fear of the loss of individual identity, being historically connected to the end of \"the Korean War and the well-publicized reports of brainwashing techniques.\" Comparing Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Brian Neve found a sense of disillusionment rather than straightforward messages, with all three films being \"less radical in any positive sense than reflective of the decline of [the screenwriters'] great liberal hopes.\"\nDespite a general agreement among film critics regarding these political connotations of the film, actor Kevin McCarthy said in an interview included on the 1998 DVD release that he felt no political allegory was intended. The interviewer stated that he had spoken with the author of the novel, Jack Finney, who professed no specific political allegory in the work.\nIn his autobiography, I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History, Walter Mirisch writes: \"People began to read meanings into pictures that were never intended. The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an example of that. I remember reading a magazine article arguing that the picture was intended as an allegory about the communist infiltration of America. From personal knowledge, neither Walter Wanger nor Don Siegel, who directed it, nor Dan Mainwaring, who wrote the script nor original author Jack Finney, nor myself, saw it as anything other than a thriller, pure and simple.\"\nDon Siegel spoke more openly of an existing allegorical subtext, but denied a strictly political point of view: \"[...] I felt that this was a very important story. I think that the world is populated by pods and I wanted to show them. I think so many people have no feeling about cultural things, no feeling of pain, of sorrow. [...] The political reference to Senator McCarthy and totalitarianism was inescapable but I tried not to emphasize it because I feel that motion pictures are primarily to entertain and I did not want to preach.\" Film scholar J.P. Telotte wrote that Siegel intended for pods to be seductive; their spokesperson, a psychiatrist, was chosen to provide an authoritative voice that would appeal to the desire to \"abdicate from human responsibility in an increasingly complex and confusing modern world.\"\n\n\nSubsequent adaptations\nThree subsequent adaptations of The Body Snatchers have been made: Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Body Snatchers (1993), and The Invasion (2007).\nAn untitled fifth adaptation from Warner Bros. was reported to be in development in 2017. David Leslie Johnson was signed to be the screenwriter.\n\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD in 1998 by U.S.-label Republic (an identical re-release by Artisan followed in 2002); it includes the Superscope version plus a 1.375:1 Academy ratio version. The latter is not the original full frame edition but a pan and scan reworking of the Superscope edition that loses visual detail.\nDVD editions exist on the British market (including a computer-colorized version), German market (as Die Dämonischen), and Spanish market (as La Invasión de los Ladrones de Cuerpos).\nSeveral Blu-ray Disc versions have been released, including two bare-bones Blu-ray Disc editions by Olive Films in 2012 and German company Al!ve (under the title Die Dämonischen) in 2018. Sinister Films released a Blu-ray in Italy on March 18, 2014. This version, under the title L'Invasione degli Ultracorpi, contained many special features, including an interview with lead actor Kevin McCarthy and the 1957 Studio One episode entitled \"The Night America Trembled\", an unreleased filmed reconstruction of the famous Orson Welles radio transmission \"War of the Worlds\", starring Ed Asner, James Coburn, and Warren Beatty. Olive Films subsequently released a special-edition Blu-ray in 2018, containing extensive bonus features including several featurettes, two audio commentaries, one with film historian Richard Harland Smith and a second with Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, and filmmaker Joe Dante, and a 1985 archival interview with McCarthy.\n\n\nRelated works\nRobert A. Heinlein had previously developed this subject in his 1951 novel The Puppet Masters, written in 1950. The Puppet Masters was later plagiarized as the 1958 film The Brain Eaters, and adapted under contract in the 1994 film The Puppet Masters. A similar theme was used in the 1953 film Invaders From Mars.\nSeveral thematically related works followed Finney's 1955 novel The Body Snatchers, including Val Guest's Quatermass 2 and Gene Fowler's I Married a Monster from Outer Space.\nThe 1986 film Troll has a snippet of a movie seen on TV in which Spot (a dog) and Tweetie (a canary) are declared to be pod persons.\nA Looney Tunes parody of the film was released, entitled Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers (1992). The adaptation was directed by Greg Ford and places Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Porky Pig in the various roles of the story.\nIn 2018, theater company Team Starkid created the musical parody The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals, the story of a Midwestern town that is overtaken by a singing alien hivemind. The musical parodies numerous horror and musical tropes, while the main character also wears within the show a suit reminiscent of Bennell's wardrobe.\nThe May 1981 issue of National Lampoon featured a parody titled \"Invasion of the Money Snatchers\"; the gentile population of Whiteville is taken over by pastrami sandwiches from outer space and turned into Jews.\nThe Host segments of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode The Giant Spider Invasion parody this film. In the episode, as Pearl, Brain Guy, and Professor Bobo are out camping, they end up discovering flowers that they nickname \"Zucchini Throw Pillows\" which are actually Body Snatcher Aliens in disguise. They end up getting sent to the Satellite of Love along with the titular movie, causing Pearl, Brain Guy, and all the Bots (except Mike and Bobo) to become affected. Per Mike's encouragement, Bobo manages to save everyone by destroying the mother body snatcher alien, killing all the aliens and turning everyone affected back to normal. But because Pearl missed out on the SOL Crew's reactions to the movie, she forces them to watch it again.\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch, a 1982 film with similar themes involving androids, is also largely set in a California town named Santa Mira.\nThe film was also parodied in the 2012 SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Planet of the Jellyfish\" (referencing Planet of the Vampires and Planet of the Apes) featuring characters from Bikini Bottom being replaced by alien clones in their sleep.\nThe film also inspired the 2025 Apple TV series Pluribus, in which the entire world is rapidly dominated by an alien virus. The unaffected protagonist calls affected humans \"pod people.\"\n\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1956\nList of cult films\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) at IMDb\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers at AllMovie\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers at the TCM Movie Database\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers essay by Robert Sklar at National Film Registry [1]\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C Black, 2010 ISBN 0826429777, pages 512-513 [2]\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) is available for free viewing and download at the Internet Archive\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) at Rotten Tomatoes\n\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers: A Tale for Our Times\", by John W.

    "text": "The siege of Zvornik was a military engagement during the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718). The Austrians besieged Zvornik held by the Ottomans. The siege ended in fiasco for the Austrians, who suffered heavy losses.\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the victory of capturing Belgrade, the Austrian forces believed it was the time to intensify their attacks on Bosnia and, if possible, capture as many places as possible. The Austrian general Maximilian von Petrasch was planning for an upcoming invasion of Bosnia in late August and early September. His main goal was the city of Zvornik. Petrasch believed that by capturing Zvornik, he would establish a foothold in Bosnia. Petrasch was also told that Zvornik was in a bad state. Zvornik was located on the Drina River, where the mountains with steep slopes almost reach the river. The fort was also on the left bank of the river. Petrasch assembled around 3,000 men at Rača. The garrison of Zvornik had a strong force of 3,000–5,000 men and were led by Dervish Bey Fidahić and Mehmed Agha Atić.\n\n\nSiege\nOn September 12th, 1717, the army was able to leave Rača, and on the 15th they arrived near Zvornik. The next day, the attack began, and the Austrians routed a force of 100 janisarries from the first guardhouse, but while pursuing them, they immediately had to withstand a furious sortie from the garrison. The Austrians managed to capture the second Ottoman line within the suburbs. The Ottomans retreated into the water city fortified with stone walls and block houses and into the castle. Outside the town, scattered in the rocky terrain, were individual groups of their reinforcements that had come.\nThe Austrians, led by Baron von Beckers, launched the attack on the water city.The walls were scaled, the gate opened from the inside, and the Ottomans were driven away from here as well and forced to retreat into the castle and even further behind it. This was the actual fortress, enclosed by a strong wall and round towers. During the course of the attack, Petrasch fell, severely wounded at the foot. Several officers were wounded as well. This demoralized the troops, during which they suffered 100 casualties. The Ottomans had succeeded in setting the houses in the water city on fire; the Imperial forces were forced to retreat from them on the night of September 19.\nThe Austrians were not able to continue the attack, having used all of their ammunition, and two mortars were exploded. The Austrians did not have enough men to continue the attack. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Köprülüzade Numan Pasha, has been preparing an relieve army led by Kethuda Ibrahim Agha. Seeing this situation, Beckers asked Prince Eugene of Savoy for reinforcements. After the Austrian failure at Novi Grad, Ottoman morale was high, and an upcoming Ottoman relief force made Beckers believe that a longer stay is no longer possible.\nThe Austrians, on September 30, began their retreat. With the onset of night, the remote posts were withdrawn, and at midnight the march began, initially proceeding successfully. But already on October 1, the pursuing Ottomans caught up with the rear guard, who was just busy moving the train stuck in a defilement. The Ottomans attacked the rearguard fiercely, scattering them. A large amount of baggage fell to the Ottomans. The Austrians arrived at Rača on October 3rd under unbearable difficulties. They suffered 1,000 deaths, and 300 were captured, whom would be executed.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe Austrian defeats at Zvornik and Novi delayed their attack on Bihać. As a result, they consolidated their gains on the northern Bosnian border. The victory was due to Bosnian eyalet preparations over the past 15 years.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nCharles Ingrao, Jovan Pešalj (2011), The Peace of Passarowitz, 1718.[1]\nMoriz “von” Angeli (1891), Campaigns of Prince Eugene of Savoy (In German).[2]\nAbel Lukšić (1878), Bosnia and Herzegovina (In German).[3]",

    "text": "Ian Douglas Neilson (born 20 October 1954) is a South African civil engineer and politician who served as the Deputy Mayor of Cape Town from May 2009 to October 2021. He previously served as the Mayoral Committee Member for Finance from 2006 until 2016 and Executive Councillor for Safety and Health from 2000 until 2002.\nHe has served as acting Mayor of Cape Town on two brief occasions in 2018, in May and from 31 October until Dan Plato was sworn in on 6 November.\n\n\nEarly life\nNeilson was born in Boksburg, South Africa. He matriculated from Boksburg High School in 1971.  He obtained a B.Sc. degree in civil engineering from the University of Cape Town in 1975 and a M.Sc. degree in engineering in 1984.\n\n\nProfessional career\nNeilson is a civil engineer and practiced as a consulting engineer in the field of water engineering, He worked across South Africa on various engineering projects. Water supply projects that he worked on were a detailed basin study of the Luvuvhu River Basin (a tributary of the Limpopo River) and the Orange-Vaal Rivers Weir project (an envisaged alternative to the Lesotho Highlands Water Supply System).  He also worked on a number of flood and storm water projects, most notable of which was the design of the canal system at Century City in Cape Town, which later received an award from the Association of Consulting Engineers. It the latter part of his career he established himself as an expert in pipeline design and pipe network planning.\n\n\nPolitical career\nNeilson was involved in politics from his student days at the University of Cape Town where he was involved in opposition to the apartheid government of the day.\nHis first campaign towards elective office was in the 1987 South African general election, when he was a candidate for the Progressive Federal Party (PFP) in the constituency of Pretoria Central.  This constituency was a National Party stronghold and he came fourth in the election behind the Conservative Party and the Herstigte Nasionale Party.\nHe moved back to Cape Town in 1990 and in 1996 was a candidate for the Democratic Party (DP) (a successor of the PFP) in the first local government elections in a new democratic South Africa. He was elected as a Proportional List Councillor to the Council of the Blaauwberg Municipality as the DP's sole representative. He served as a member of the Council's Executive Committee and on the Planning Committee.\nIn 1999 he was appointed by the Western Cape Minister of Local Government to serve on the Unicity Commission, from 1999 to 2000, that was set up to prepare the consolidation of seven local governments into the Unicity of Cape Town.\nSoon before the 5 December 2000 local government election that established the new City of Cape Town, the DP amalgamated with the New National Party (NNP) to form the Democratic Alliance (DA).  Neilson was elected as a DA councillor for Ward 3, an area extending from the wealthy area of Bloubergstrand to the low-cost housing town of Dunoon. The DA won a majority in that election in Cape Town. Neilson was elected by the DA caucus to serve in the city's executive as the Executive Councillor for Safety & Health, a position he held until 2002.\nIn October 2002 a number of former NNP members left the DA to reestablish their former party in the city council. This followed the NNP's withdrawal from the DA the year before. As a result, the DA lost its majority in the Cape Town Council.  Ian was shortly thereafter elected as deputy leader of the DA in the council, a position he held for the remainder of the council term.\n\nAt the local government election of March 2006, Ian was elected as the Ward Councillor for Ward 23, a newly delimited ward that extends from Melkbosstrand to Bloubergstrand and parts of Table View.  The DA was returned as the largest party in the City of Cape Town.  It formed a multiparty government under the leadership of Executive Mayor Helen Zille. Mayor Zille appointed Neilson as the Mayoral committee member for Finance.\n\n\nDeputy Mayor of Cape Town\nAt the national and provincial elections on 22 April 2009, the DA won a majority in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. Helen Zille was elected as Premier of the Western Cape Province and ceased to be the Executive Mayor of Cape Town. In the aftermath of these changes, Dan Plato was elected by the Council as the new Executive Mayor and the composition of the city's multi-party government was changed. Neilson was elected by the Council as Executive Deputy Mayor on 27 May 2009.  He retained the Finance portfolio and chairmanship of the city's 2010 FIFA World Cup committee.\nThe 2011 Local Government Election saw the Democratic Alliance returned to office with an improved vote share.  It won 61% of the total vote.  Neilson was returned as a Proportional List Councillor. The new Mayor, Patricia de Lille, nominated him to retain the posts of Deputy Mayor and Mayoral Committee Member for Finance.\nAfter the 2016 Local Government election when the Cape Town City Council reconvened, he was re-elected to a third term as Deputy Mayor of Cape Town. Councillor Johannes van der Merwe succeeded him as Mayoral Committee Member for Finance.\nOn 8 May 2018, the Democratic Alliance ceased Mayor Patricia de Lille's party membership, effectively removing her as Mayor of Cape Town and councillor with immediate effect. Speaker of the Cape Town City Council, Dirk Smith, appointed Neilson to serve as acting Mayor until a new Mayor was set to be elected. De Lille told the various media outlets that she would be approaching the court to have her removal suspended. Also, de Lille rejected an offer the Democratic Alliance to keep the position of Cape Town Mayor temporarily open while the parties discuss the matter in court. Neilson was supposed to be appointing his interim Mayoral Committee, but the decision was delayed to May 14. On the same day, the Western Cape High Court ruled to reinstate de Lille as Mayor.\nOn 5 August 2018, De Lille announced that she would be resigning as Mayor on 31 October 2018, after months of infighting. Neilson declared his candidacy for the post, but subsequently lost to former Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato.\nOn 31 October 2018, Patricia de Lille resigned as Mayor. Neilson was immediately announced as acting Mayor of Cape Town. He served until Dan Plato was elected. Neilson will not be returning as deputy mayor of Cape Town after the 2021 municipal election. He will be an ordinary councillor.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCity of Cape Town\nDemocratic Alliance",

The five-piece band made an EP (2005's Take It How You Want It), as well as a full-length album Telling Secrets to Strangers (2007).\n\n\nHistory\nSelf Against City formed in April 2004 in Sacramento, California, when vocalist Jonathan Michael, guitarists Jack Matranga and Jeff LaTour, bassist Patrick O'Connor and drummer Chris Trombley decided to record songs together.\nThe quintet pooled their cash and recorded three songs at Fat Cat Studios in Sacramento, California. The songs were uploaded to their PureVolume profile, a link to which was forwarded to Drive-Thru Records owner Richard Reines by a fan of the band. He soon approached the band and asked for more material. Upon hearing the songs, Reines invited the band to play a showcase in Los Angeles for him and Drive-Thru co-owner Stefanie Reines. That same night over dinner, the two offered the band a record deal. On November 6, 2004, Self Against City officially became the first band to sign to Rushmore Records, only a few months after their formation.\nTheir first act as a signed band was to record a cover of Darlene Love's \"Alone on Christmas\" for the Drive-Thru Christmas compilation Happy Holidays from Drive-Thru Records and a sixth song for their debut EP, advance copies of which had been given out at a show at the Boardwalk in Orangevale, California on October 28, 2004. Take It How You Want It finally hit music store shelves on April 5, 2005, while the band embarked on their first nationwide co-headlining tour with Houston Calls the same month. They hit a total of 32 cities across 18 states. Upon returning home in July, LaTour left the band. Though initially the band made efforts to replace LaTour – Blake Abbey of the Daytona Beach, Florida band Abagnale sporadically filled in as a rhythm guitarist – they soon decided to continue on as a four-piece and began writing songs for their first full-length record. Two days before the band left for recording in March 2006, LaTour decided to rejoin.\nSelf Against City began recording their full-length album Telling Secrets to Strangers in April 2006 with producers Steve Haigler and Mike Watts in Long Island, New York. According to Jack Matranga, the album was written as an upbeat pop-rock album. After two weeks of tracking and one week of mixing the album was completed. In June 2006, a month after returning home from recording, O'Connor and Trombley left the band. Drummer Justin Barnes (formerly of Simplistic) officially joined the band in August 2006, two days before the band left for tour with Houston Calls and Quietdrive, while Hunter MacDonald (whom the band met while on tour with JamisonParker temporarily filled in on bass. Towards the end of the year, in search of a new permanent bassist, the group once again recruited fellow vocalist/bassist Blake Abbey in December 2006.\nIn January 2007 Self Against City hit the road with Boys Like Girls and We The Kings on a nationwide tour across America.

    "title": "Tanks in World War II",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=3781969",
    "text": "Tanks were an important weapons system in World War II. Although tanks in the inter-war years were the subject of widespread research, few were made, in just a few countries. However, during World War II, most armies employed tanks, and thousands were built every month. Tank usage, doctrine, and production varied widely among the combatant nations. By war's end, a consensus was forming on tank doctrine and design.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe tank was invented by the British, in 1916, and first used during World War I, with nearly simultaneous development in France. Tanks of the First World War reflected the novelty of the idea and the primitive state of the automotive industry. World War I tanks moved at a walking pace, they were relatively unreliable, and the best usage of them was still developing up to the war's end. A breakthrough in tank design was the Christie suspension, developed by an American engineer, J. Walter Christie, which allowed longer movement of the suspension than conventional leaf-spring systems then in common use, and allowed the tanks to move faster.\nThe doctrine of armored warfare changed radically in the inter-war years as armies sought ways to avoid the deadlock imposed by modern firepower and looked for the means to restore offensive power on the battlefield. Initially, tanks had been used for close support of infantry, but as modern mechanized doctrine was developed by several armies, tanks became an essential part of the combined-arms team. In addition to infantry support, tanks fulfilled traditional cavalry roles, provided mobile artillery support, and were adapted to combat engineering roles.\nTank design gradually improved in the inter-war period also. Reflecting the growth of the automotive industry, tank engines, transmissions, and track systems were improved. By the beginning of the war in September 1939, tanks were available that could travel hundreds of miles on their tracks with a limited number of breakdowns.\nThe war accelerated the pace of change in design. In particular, the gun-vs-armor race of the war led to rapid improvements in firepower and armor.\n\n\nMajor themes\nThe United Kingdom, the US, the Soviet Union, and France produced significant numbers of tanks before and during World War II. The early tanks of Germany were inferior to many of their opponents' tanks in the areas of armor and firepower. However, in their tactical employment the German tanks dominated all rivals early in the war. Germany concentrated the tanks and the few infantry transport vehicles it had into Panzer divisions. German doctrine stressed the use of rapid movement, mission-type tactics and combined-arms where tanks operated with mobile infantry and air support; this doctrine was popularly called [a] Blitzkrieg. For this to work the German tanks were all equipped with radios, which provided unmatched command and control for flexible employment.\nIn contrast, for example, almost 80 percent of French tanks lacked radios, essentially because their battle doctrine was based on a more slow-paced, deliberate conformance to planned movements. This required fewer radios at all levels. French tanks generally outclassed German tanks in firepower and armor in the 1940 campaign, but their poor command and control doctrine negated these advantages. By 1943, two-way radio was nearly universal in all armies.\n\nA trend towards heavier tanks was unmistakable as the war proceeded. In 1939, most tanks had maximum armor of 30 mm (1.2 in) or less, with guns with no larger caliber than 37–47 mm. Medium tanks of 1939 weighed around 20 tonnes (20 long tons). By 1945, typical medium tanks had maximum armor over 60 mm thick, with guns in the 75–85 mm (3.0–3.3-inch) range and weights of 30 to 45 t (30 to 44 long tons). Light tanks, which dominated most armies early in the war, gradually disappeared from front-line service.\nTurrets, which had always been considered, but were not previously a universal feature on tanks, became recognized as essential. It was appreciated that if the tank's gun was to be used to engage both 'soft' (unarmored) and armored targets, then it needed to be as large and powerful as possible, making one large gun with an all-round field of fire vital. Also, mounting the gun in a turret ensured that the tank could fire from hull down cover. Hull-mounted guns required that most of the vehicle be exposed to enemy fire. Multiple-turreted or multi-gun designs such as the Soviet T-35, American Medium Tank M3 (hull mounted and turret gun), French Char B1 (hull mounted howitzer) or British Cruiser Mk I (two ancillary machine gun turrets) slowly became less common during World War II. Experience showed that a tank commander could not effectively direct the fire of several weapons; also, the newer dual-purpose guns eliminated the need for multiple weapons. Most tanks still retained a hull machine gun, and usually one or more machine guns in the turret, to protect them from infantry at short range.\nTanks were adapted to a wide range of military tasks, including engineering. Specialized models, such as flame-thrower tanks, armored recovery vehicles for towing disabled tanks from the battlefield, and command tanks with extra radios were also used. Some of these tank variants live on as other classes of armored fighting vehicle, no longer called \"tanks\". All major combatant powers also developed tank destroyers (self-propelled anti-tank guns for mobile defense) and assault guns, as armored vehicles carrying large-caliber guns, but often no turrets. Turreted vehicles are expensive to manufacture compared to non-turreted vehicles.\nOne trend seen in World War II was the usage of older, lighter tank chassis to mount larger weapons in fixed casemates, as self-propelled guns, tank destroyers or assault guns. For example, the Soviet T-34 could mount an 85 mm gun in the turret, but the same chassis could carry the much more effective 100 mm gun in a fixed casemate such as the SU-100, the successor of the SU-85. Likewise, the obsolete German Panzer II light tank, too vulnerable for a direct fire role, was modified to take a powerful 75 mm PaK 40 gun in an open-topped, fixed casemate as the Marder II self-propelled artillery piece.\nThe German tank destroyers Panzerjäger (\"tank hunters\") were basically made by taking an existing anti-tank gun and mounting it on a convenient chassis to give mobility, usually with just a three-sided gun shield for crew protection. For instance, 202 obsolete Panzer I light tanks were modified by removing the turret and  emplacing a Czech 4,7cm KPÚV vz. 38 (47 mm) anti-tank gun giving the Panzerjäger I self-propelled anti-tank gun.  German tank destroyers based on the Panzer III and later German tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts.\nFully enclosed casemates on the Germans' Sturmgeschütz assault guns, from the beginning of the war, set a pattern used later by the similarly fully enclosed Jagdpanzer casemate-style tank destroyers, with the Soviets' similar Samokhodnaya ustanovka (SU) assault guns being used for the same dual-purpose roles.  However, the lack of a rotating turret had limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that the entire tank normally had to be turned onto its target by the driver, a much slower process than simply rotating a powered turret.  If the vehicle became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it highly vulnerable to counterfire.  This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Even the largest and most powerful of German tank destroyers were found abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one or more hits by high explosive (HE) or armor-piercing (AP) shells to the track or front drive sprocket.\n\n\nTank development timeline\n\n\nTanks of the major combatants\n\n\nSoviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union started and ended the war with more tanks than the rest of the world combined (18,000–22,000). At the start of World War II the most common tank in Soviet service was the T-26 (derived from the Vickers 6-ton), lightly armoured and armed with a 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K) gun capable of penetrating most German tanks at normal combat ranges. Few had radios. The design was mechanically sound although incapable of further development. The BT tank series, based on the Christie suspension system, were usually armed with the same 45 mm gun and were the most mobile tanks in the world at the time. Close-support versions of both tanks existed, armed with 76.2 mm howitzers. However, the BT was at the end of its design life. The Red Army also fielded thousands of light reconnaissance tanks such as the amphibious T-37 and T-38 tanks. These had limited combat value; although highly mobile, they were armed only with 7.62 mm machine guns and had very thin armour. The Red Army also had about 400 T-28 medium, multi-turreted tanks, which were in most respects equal to the German Panzer IV. Again, though, this design dated from 1931 and was obsolete.\nThe Soviet Union ended the 1930s with a huge fleet of tanks almost completely derived from foreign designs, but before 1941 developed some of the most important trend-setting tanks of the war. The problem the Soviet tank force faced in 1941 was not primarily the technical quality of its vehicles, but the very poor state of maintenance, the appalling lack of readiness, and the poor command situation brought on by the purges of the officer class. By 1940, the Red Army had adopted an advanced combat doctrine that its command structure and tank force simply could not execute.\n\nSeveral excellent designs began production in 1940–1941. Just prior to the war, the Red Army embarked on two closely related projects to reorganize its mechanized forces and re-equip them with modern designs that took lessons learned from the Spanish Civil War, the Battle of Khalkhin Gol and the Winter War into account. Some of these designs were copies of other countries' designs. The most significant was the T-34, which was originally designed as the successor to the BT series. Its heavier armour and 76.2 mm dual-purpose gun made it one of the best medium tanks of the first half of World War II. The T-34 eventually took on the roles of many other Soviet tanks. The T-34's chassis made it usable after the war, as it could be continuously upgraded with heavier guns, new turrets and other modifications. The other significant design was the KV-1 tank. These were armed with the same 76.2 mm gun as the T-34, and had the same Kharkiv model V-2 diesel engine. The KV tanks were equipped with a torsion bar suspension and much heavier armour than the T-34. The KV was slow, intended as a breakthrough tank. The KV-2 close-support version was armed with a 152 mm (6.0-inch) howitzer. The KV series was the main Soviet heavy tank until 1943, with the end of production  and the destruction of most surviving vehicles. Early in 1944, the KV's successor, the IS-2 was introduced. It was armed with a 122 mm (4.8 in) gun, with thicker armour and better mobility. A new infantry-support tank was introduced in 1941: the T-50. It was intended to be the replacement for the T-26, and was equipped with a 45 mm gun, torsion-bar suspension and thicker armor than most other tanks in its class. However, production problems with its new engine led to the tank being cancelled after fewer than 70 had been made. The light reconnaissance role was filled by the amphibious T-40 and the cheaper, non-amphibious T-60.\nAt the beginning of German invasion of the USSR, most of the Soviet Union's tank force was composed of the T-26 and BT tanks series. A few T-40s had also appeared, along with about 1,363 mechanically unreliable early-model T-34 tanks and 677 KV series tanks. The early-model T-34s' heavy losses were caused by lack of coordination, lack of supplies, poor training, mechanical issues and the Red Army's general lack of preparation for war. Another difficulty for the T-34 was that it had only a four-man crew, with the tank commander forced to double as the gunner. Although he was spared from loading duties, unlike commanders in French tanks, it still crippled the tank commander's ability to maintain awareness of the battlefield, which gave German armour a tactical advantage.\n\nIn 1941, large numbers of T-60s began to appear, reinforced in 1942 with the similar T-70. Both of these light tanks had torsion-bar suspension, light armour, and small engines. Their simple construction kept them in production even though their combat value was limited. The T-60 had only a 20 mm gun while the T-70 had a 45 mm. In addition, both had one-man turrets, making them difficult to crew effectively. The T-70 formed the basis for the later SU-76 self-propelled gun.\nBy October 1942, the general opinion was that Soviet tanks were among the best in the world, with Life magazine writing that \"The best tanks in the world today are probably the Russian tanks...\". The T-34 outclassed every German tank in service at the time of its introduction. At its height, production of all other tanks except the IS-2 was stopped to allow all available resources to be used exclusively for this tank, due to its widespread success in a variety of roles. The T-34 forced the Germans to adopt new, heavier designs such as the Panther and Tiger I, which in turn forced Soviet, American and British tank forces to upgrade their tanks further. German tendency to develop entirely new tanks toward the end of the war, rather than upgrading existing models, reduced the availability of tanks to German tank formations and helped the Red Army gain the initiative on the Eastern Front.\nLater in the war, the light tank role was increasingly filled by Lend-Lease supplies from the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, including the M3 light tanks and Valentine tank. Ironically, the T-34's speed, which exceeded that of many of the light tanks that were supposed to scout for it, led to even less Soviet light tank production.\n\nIn order to deal with improved German tanks, the Soviets upgunned the T-34 in 1943, creating the T-34-85. This model had a much larger turret mounting an 85 mm (3.3-inch) gun and a larger turret capable of holding 3-men, which finally allowed the tank commander to concentrate fully on maintaining tactical awareness of the battlefield. The Soviets also introduced the 122 mm-armed IS-2 heavy tank, which had heavier armor than the KV while maintaining the same weight. Most of its armor was concentrated in the front of the tank, where it was expected to take most of its hits.\nThe IS-3 variant, produced in mid-1945, had a much more streamlined look and a larger, bowl-shaped tapered turret. Remarkably, the IS-3 had thicker armor but actually weighed slightly less than the IS-2, remaining under 50 tons (as compared to the Tiger II's 68). The armor design of the IS-3 was an enormous influence on postwar tank design, as seen in the Soviet T-55 and T-62 series, the United States M48 Patton and the West German Leopard 1.\nSoviet tank production outstripped all other nations with the exception of the United States. The Soviets accomplished this through standardization on a few designs, generally forgoing minor qualitative improvements and changing designs only when upgrades would result in a major improvement.\nSoviet tanks had turret and gun stabilization, starting with the T-28B, which had a rudimentary form as early as 1938.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\nDoctrine\n\nBritain had been the worldwide trend-setter in tank development from 1915, but had lost its leadership position as the Second World War approached. Hampered by restricted expenditure on the army in favour of the Royal Navy and the massive expansion of the Royal Air Force in the years leading up to the war and still organised for operations in Imperial defence as an expeditionary force, the British Army entered the war unprepared for the very sort of combat its influential theorists such as J.F.C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart had advocated.\nThe British Army had developed two types of tanks – \"Infantry Tanks\" which were heavily armoured with good all terrain performance but were slow. This lack of speed was not considered a flaw as they were designed to support infantry assaults on enemy strong points or urban warfare where the ability to outpace a man on foot was deemed unnecessary. The other type were \"Cruiser Tanks\" which were intended for independent maneuvering, rapid breakouts and flanking attacks. Early Cruiser tanks gained performance at a cost in the armour they could carry. Reliability was an important issue especially in the harsh conditions of North Africa and the mountainous terrain of Southern Europe, where the A10 and A13 in particular were plagued by broken tracks and overheating engines.\n\nBritish tank crews were trained to fire on the move and the armament was mounted for optimum balance such that the gunner could aim with his body rather than use geared elevation. This reduced available space inside the turret. Both early Cruiser and Infantry tanks carried the Ordnance QF 2-pounder, a 40 mm anti-tank gun, a good match for the contemporary German 3.7 cm KwK 36, and effective against tanks of the time but increasingly outclassed as the war progressed. Production shortages caused by losses in France and the Battle of the Atlantic forced the British to delay widespread introduction of the Ordnance QF 6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank gun until 1942.\nThe lack of an adequate high-explosive shell for the 2-pounder and the growing number of 5 cm KwK 38 anti-tank guns in the Afrika Korps gave the German army in Libya a huge advantage for much of late 1941 and early 1942. This began to be offset by late 1942 but the Wehrmacht continued to enjoy a 12–18 month lead in tank and anti-tank gun development and production until the end of 1944. Britain produced 5000 tanks in the year of 1944.\n\n\nPerformance\n\nThe A9 Cruiser Mk I was an effective tank in the French, Greek and early North African campaigns. The 2-pounder gun was better than comparable 37 mm weapons of Germany and the US, and lethal against tanks encountered during the North African campaign. However the minimal armor made the A9 vulnerable to most contemporary anti-tank weapons and the design was quickly superseded by the A10 Cruiser, Mark II.\nA number of A10s were part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sent to France in the early stages of World War II. The A10's cross country performance was recorded as poor, due to narrow, easily thrown tracks, but material losses incurred in the aftermath of Operation Dynamo (the evacuation of the BEF from Dunkirk in late May 1940) meant they could not be withdrawn from front line service quickly and so saw combat in small numbers in North Africa, where reliability and suspension performance in the desert conditions was praised. Sixty worn out examples were also taken to Greece by the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and although they performed well against the German tanks, over 90% were lost due to mechanical breakdowns as opposed to enemy action (mainly through broken tracks).\nAs war broke out, the British had placed into production the A13, a new faster Cruiser tank utilizing the suspension and running gear concepts of the American designer J. Walter Christie. This new suspension provided a fast, highly maneuverable design that became the basis for the rapid evolution of the Cruiser tank such as the Mk IV (A13 Mk II) a British cruiser tank derived from the original A13.\n\nThe A13 Cruiser was developed into the A15 Crusader then the A27 Cromwell. The use of the powerful Rolls-Royce Meteor engine, derived from the Rolls-Royce Merlin, gave the Cromwell high speed and mobility. The final British cruiser design to see service was the A34 Comet; development of the Cromwell, it carried a high-velocity 77  mm gun derived from the Ordnance QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun; one of the most effective Allied anti-tank guns of the war, although the Comet itself saw very little combat.\nBeginning about mid-1942, many British tank units were equipped with vehicles supplied under lend-lease from the United States, such as the Stuart light tank, the Lee (or the British specification 'Grant' variant thereof) and the Lee's/Grant's replacement the Sherman (all these tanks received their names from the British, named after American Civil War generals; the Americans instead used their original alphanumeric designations almost exclusively until after the war). In late 1943, the British found a way to mount the QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun in the Sherman to create the Firefly, a tank with a more capable gun than the 75mm or 76mm gun normally fitted. From mid-1944, as more were produced and British designs were introduced into service the Firefly became increasingly the most common Sherman in use by the British.\n\n\nSpecialist tanks\n\nImmediately before and during the war, the British produced an enormous array of prototype tanks and modified tanks for a variety of specialist engineering tasks (such as \"Hobart's Funnies\", produced for the invasion of France in 1944).\nFor example, the Churchill Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) fired a short range 230 mm (11.4 inch) direct-fire mortar which was used for destroying buildings and clearing obstacles. It could also be equipped with a wide variety of combat engineering equipment such as small bridges, rolled-matt roadways, fascines, and mine rollers.\nMany of these ideas had already been tried, tested, or were in experimental development both by Britain and other nations. For example, the Scorpion flail tank (a modified Matilda II) had already been used during the North African campaign to clear paths through German minefields. Soviet T-34 tanks had been modified with mine-rollers, fascines, and flamethrowers. Close-support tanks, bridge layers, and fascine carriers had been developed elsewhere also. However, the Funnies were the largest and most elaborate collection of engineering vehicles available.\nBy early 1944, Hobart could demonstrate to Eisenhower and Montgomery a brigade each of swimming DD tanks, Crab mine clearers, and AVRE (Engineer) tanks along with a regiment of Crocodile flamethrowing tanks.\n\n\nUnited States\n\nPrior to the entry of the United States into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Army had only a few tanks. During the Louisiana Maneuvers in September 1941, it used trucks with the word \"tank\" painted on their side. Even after Pearl Harbor the 10th Armored Division did not have any tanks, so crews trained by marching down roads in groups and executing orders as if they were in tanks.\nThe Light Tank M2 series was the most important pre-war US tank. These light tanks were mechanically very reliable, with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette — from the use of an air-cooled radial engine for power — and poor armor. Only a few saw combat, on Guadalcanal. Their importance lies in the fact that they formed the basis for the much more successful Light Tank M3 (a.k.a. 'Stuart' in British service) series beginning in 1941. The M3 Light Tank was an improvement of the M2 Light Tank, with heavier armor and a 37  mm gun. From the M3A1 version, this gun was gyrostabilized.\n\nThe new medium tank just entering production in 1940 was the M2 Medium Tank series. This was a poor design with thin armor, a high silhouette, a 37  mm main gun, and seven machine guns.\nFrom 1940, new tank designs were prepared. The Battle of France had shown the importance of medium tanks. The British Army sought to have the US manufacture British designs, but the US refused, offering instead to share the output of US factories building US designs. The United States Army had a requirement for a medium tank with a 75  mm gun, and developed the M3 Medium Tank as an interim design. The medium M3 tank was intended to quickly get a 75  mm gun into the field, pending the design of a tank with a 75  mm gun in a fully rotating turret. The British rejected the design, only accepting after the US told them it was all they had to offer. The British then used the M3 Medium Tank for their own use as the 'Lee', and some with modifications to their requirements as the 'Grant' (I.e: they added a bulge in the back of the turret to fit a radio, among other things.).\nBy February 1942, American civilian automobile factories only made weapons and military vehicles. Automobile manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler used their experience with mass production to quickly build tanks. The country manufactured as many tanks in the first half of 1942 as in all of 1941, with 1,500 in May 1942 alone. American production not only equipped its forces, but through Lend Lease also supplied all the tank needs of the free French (after 1942) and Chinese. By 1944 most British units were also equipped with US-built tanks. Finally, the US supplied over 8,000 tanks to the USSR, half of them the M4 Sherman. Similar to the Soviet Union, the United States selected a few good basic designs and standardized those models. Given the lack of tank design and production experience, it is remarkable that the United States' designs were as good as they were.\nThe first tanks of the United States to see combat were the Light Tank M3. They were deeply flawed in many ways, yet the M3 Light (\"Stuart\") and M3 Medium (\"Lee\" or \"Grant\") were the best tanks available to the Western Allies and were superior to many of their German counterparts in armor protection and firepower. The Light Tank M3 was about as well-armed as the British cruiser tanks with 2-pounder (40  mm) guns in the desert, yet was much more reliable mechanically. Its 37  mm main gun was more powerful than the main guns carried by German reconnaissance tanks. The name given by the British to the Light Tank M3 was 'Stuart'; a nickname used was 'Honey'. The M3 and its improved derivative, the Light Tank M5 series, remained in service throughout the war. By 1943, its 37  mm gun was obsolete, but no better replacement was available. The Light Tank T7 design was proposed as a successor in 1943, armed with a 57  mm gun and with better armor; however, the design was never standardized for production.\nThe appearance of the M3 \"Lee\" medium tank in the summer of 1942 finally gave the British a larger supply of medium tanks than they could otherwise have hoped for. Although poorly designed, with a very high profile, it was produced in great numbers and was very effective when engaging targets other than enemy tanks, such as infantry and gun positions.\n\nThe M3 Medium had the significant disadvantage of its 75  mm main armament being mounted offset in the hull meaning that it could not take hull down cover and use its main gun at the same time. It had a fully traversable turret with a 37  mm cannon as well, but the turret combined with a hull gun gave it a very tall profile. The United States 1st Armored Division also employed the M3 Medium in Africa. It was a stopgap solution, never intended to be a design of major importance. In American and British service the M3 Medium was phased out at the end of the North African campaign. It continued to serve in the Red Army for some time, and in a single campaign in the Pacific. Red Army crews nicknamed it \"grave for seven brothers\" referring to the seven-man crew.\nThe most important American design of the war was the M4 Medium Tank, or \"Sherman\" in British service. The M4 Medium became the second-most-produced tank of World War II, and was the only tank to be used by virtually all Allied forces (thanks to the American lend-lease program); approximately 40,000 M4 Mediums were produced during the war. M4s formed the main tank of American, British, Canadian, French, Polish, and Chinese units. The M4 was the equal of the German medium tanks, the Panzer III and Panzer IV, at the time it first saw service in 1942. The Red Army was supplied with about 4,000 M4s. The M4, although reliable and easy to maintain, was already outgunned by the time the US encountered the up-gunned and up-armored German medium tanks in Italy and Northern Europe (the Panzer IV and various German self-propelled guns) and by late 1943 the arrival of German Panther and Tiger I were even graver threats due to the range, accuracy and penetrating power of their main guns. While it is commonly believed that the Sherman had a tendency to explode catastrophically due to their use of petrol fuel, this is incorrect (almost all tanks used petrol in WWII, excepting Soviet tanks). The Sherman suffered from poor ammunition storage. Welded-on appliqué armor and water jackets were added to combat the problem. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that 60–80 percent of the older dry-stowage and 10–15 percent of wet-stowage Shermans burned when penetrated. The Sherman gained grim nicknames such as \"Tommycooker\" from the Germans, who called British soldiers \"Tommies\".\nTechnically, the M4's design was capable of handling larger guns than the 75  mm and 76  mm guns with which they left the factory. The British fitted Shermans with the more powerful Ordnance Quick Firing 17 pounder (76.2  mm) gun, a variant known informally as the Firefly. By the time of the Normandy campaign, the M4 had become the workhorse tank of the Allied forces. Some M4 Mediums were equipped with the Duplex Drive system (Sherman DD), which allowed them to swim using a collapsible screen and inflated rubber tubes. Along with this were the M4 Dozer (an M4 with a bulldozer blade), the T34 Calliope (mounting a multiple rocket launcher above the turret), the M4A3R3 Flame thrower (flame tank), and the Sherman Crab Mark I (an M4 Medium with a mine flail), as well as many other variants.\nThe United States eventually deployed the Light Tank M24, an improvement over the M3 Light Tank. The M24 had torsion-bar suspension, high mobility, and a compact 75  mm gun. Ergonomically the tank was quite good also. However, the M24 did not appear in combat until December 1944 and equipped only a few units by the end of the war.\nNear the end of the war, the M26 Pershing tank was deployed as the first operational heavy tank of the US Army. It was designated a heavy tank when it was designed in WWII due to its 90  mm gun, which was at the time the largest caliber gun found on a US tank. The Pershing was a very modern design with torsion-bar suspension, heavy armor, and an excellent 90  mm gun. However, it was somewhat underpowered, having the same Ford GAA engine as the M4A3. Intended as an improvement of the M4 Sherman, the prolonged time of development meant that only a small number saw combat in the European theater, most notably in the 9th Armored Division's dramatic dash to take the Bridge at Remagen. In combat, it was, unlike the M4 Sherman, fairly equal in firepower and protection to both the Tiger I and Panther tanks. The M26 basic design was good enough to form the basis for all postwar American tanks through the end of the M60 series.\n\n\nFrance\n\nAt the start of the war, France had one of the largest tank forces in the world along with the Soviet, British, and German forces. Like the British and the Soviets, the French operated two classes of tank: cavalry tanks and infantry tanks.\nThe French had planned for a defensive war and built tanks accordingly. Their infantry tanks were heavily armored. But, also, generally, they were relatively sluggish, and operationally in terms of control of their forces, the French were at a disadvantage and were outmaneuvered by the German forces. When the French were able to mount an attack their tanks could be very effective. On 16 May, during the Battle of France a single Char B1 heavy tank, the Eure, attacked and destroyed thirteen German tanks lying in ambush in Stonne, all of them Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, in the course of a few minutes. The tank safely returned despite being hit 140 times (this event is not verifiable in German documents and relies on the statements of the crew). In his book Panzer Leader, Heinz Guderian wrote of a tank battle south of Juniville:\n\nWhile the tank battle was in progress, I attempted, in vain, to destroy a Char B with a captured 47 mm [1.9-inch] anti-tank gun; all the shells I fired at it simply bounced harmlessly off its thick armor. Our 37  mm and 20  mm guns were equally ineffective against this adversary. As a result, we inevitably suffered sadly heavy casualties.\nThe total tank assets in France and its colonies were perhaps less than 5,800 during the time of the German offensive. After the armistice in the unoccupied Free Zone of France, a clandestine rebuild took place of 225 GMC Trucks into armored cars. When all of France was occupied in 1942, the secret hiding places were betrayed to the Germans.\n\n\nGermany\n\nGermany's armored force was not especially impressive from a technical standpoint at the start of the war. As noted above, it was their advanced combined arms doctrine and unrivaled command-and-control capability that gave German mechanized forces their advantage on the battlefield.\nPre-war plans called for two main tanks: the main tank was to be the Panzer III medium tank, supported by smaller numbers of the howitzer-armed Panzer IV. However, by the beginning of the invasion of Poland, only a few hundred of these vehicles were available. As a result, the invasions of Poland and France were carried out primarily with the less capable Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks (armed with machine guns and a 20  mm autocannon respectively), with some gun-armed light tanks of Czechoslovak design (Panzer 35(t) and Panzer 38(t), both armed with a 37  mm gun). Even in 1941, Panzer III production amounted only to about a thousand tanks, forcing the Germans to use Czech tanks as substitutes for the Panzer III. As the war proceeded, the production of heavier tanks increased.\n\nThe Panzer III was intended to fight other tanks; in the initial design stage, a 50  mm (2  inch) gun was specified. However, the infantry at the time was being equipped with the 37  mm (1.46  inch) PaK 36, and it was thought that in the interest of standardization the tanks should carry the same armament. As a compromise, the turret ring was made large enough to accommodate a 50  mm (2  inch) gun should a future upgrade be required. This single decision later assured the Panzer III a prolonged life in the German Army.\n\nThe Panzer IV was intended to carry a gun that could be used in support of infantry or other tanks, and was initially armed with a short-barreled 75  mm howitzer to fire high explosive (HE) fragmentation shells. In 1941 an average of 39 Panzer IV model tanks per month were built, and this rose to 83 in 1942, 252 in 1943, and 300 in 1944.\nDuring Operation Barbarossa, it was discovered that the Soviet T-34 tank outclassed the Panzer III and IV. Its well sloped armor could withstand most German weapons, and its 76.2 mm gun and AP rounds could penetrate the armor of all German tanks. This forced the Germans to improve their existing models. The Panzer III, which was intended to be the main medium tank, was upgraded to a longer, higher-velocity 50  mm gun.\nThus the Panzer IV, originally intended to be a support tank, became the de facto main medium tank re-armed with a long-barreled, high-velocity 75  mm gun to counter the T-34; the Panzer III, with its smaller turret ring, could not mount a gun larger than 50  mm, which had become inadequate against Allied tanks. The Germans started to develop newer, heavier tanks. This included the Panzer V Panther, which was intended to be the new main German medium tank, with comparably sloped armor to that of the T-34. The Panther tank was a compromise of various requirements. While sharing essentially the same engine as the Tiger I tank, it had better frontal armor, better gun penetration, was lighter overall and thus faster, and could handle rough terrain better than the Tigers. The trade-off was much weaker side armor; the Panther proved to be deadly in open country and shooting from long range, but was vulnerable in close-quarters combat or to flank shots.\nThe Germans also started to develop a new series of heavy tanks. The first was the Tiger, which outclassed all its opponents in terms of firepower and armor when it was first put into operational use. The companies Henschel and Porsche both submitted designs for the Tiger, and the Henschel design was chosen. The even heavier Tiger II (deemed \"King Tiger\" by Allied troops) supplemented the Tiger I late in the war. Its powerful gun – and unlike the Tiger I, its very heavy sloped armor – made it superior to nearly every Allied or Soviet tank in a one-on-one confrontation, but poor mobility, speed, and reliability limited its use.\nPlans were made for a super-heavy tank, the Panzer VII Löwe, which was canceled during the design stage in favor of the yet heavier Panzer VIII Maus of which only two incomplete prototypes were made. Panzer IX and Panzer X were drawings only used for propaganda purposes.\n\n\nItaly\n\nThe Italian army was mainly equipped with tankettes of the L3 series in the 1930s, and these, armed with machine guns, formed the main armor strength of Italy as late as 1940. Italy began fielding heavier tanks beginning with the Fiat M11/39 with a 37  mm the main gun in 1940. This tank and its derivatives, the M13/40, M14/41 and the M15/42 (all with 47  mm main guns) were closely comparable in combat power to light tanks such as the Soviet T-26. A heavier design, the P40 with a 75  mm main gun, was designed but saw no service with Italian forces as it became ready at the time of the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies, after which the Germans took over production, and used roughly one hundred of them. Another tank design, the Fiat M16/43, was developed to match the British cruiser tanks but work on it was stopped when the Axis was pushed out of North Africa in May 1943.\nThe Fiat-Ansaldo M11/39 medium tank was used from 1940 through the early period of World War II. The M11/39 was developed as a \"breakthrough tank\" (Carro di Rottura). It was replaced by the Fiat-Ansaldo M13/40 medium tank which was used in the Greek campaign and in the North African Campaign. The M13/40 was not used on the Eastern Front; Italian forces there were equipped only with Fiat L6/40s and Semovente 47/32 tank destroyers. Armament was sufficient for 1940–41, but did not keep up with the increased armor and firepower on Allied or German tanks and anti-tank guns; its engine was underpowered and unreliable, a condition worsened by the harsh desert climate and the initial lack of training of their crews. Beginning in 1942, the Italian Army recognized the firepower weakness of the M13/40 series and employed the Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun alongside the tanks in their armored units, which proved capable of destroying the enemy medium tanks.\nThe next tank in the series was the Fiat M14/41, a slightly improved version of the M13/40 with a more powerful diesel engine. The tank was also employed in the North African Campaign. Following the withdrawal of Italian forces from North Africa the M14/41 was rarely encountered. A few captured M11, M13, and M14s were pressed into service by British and Australian forces to fill the serious shortage of allied tanks in 1941.\nThe next in the series was the M15/42, a 15-tonne tank first built in January 1943. Some 90 vehicles were built before the Italian armistice in September 1943 and in connection to that event they were used in the battle against the Germans by the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete in Rome. After that point, they were confiscated and used by the Germans who also built another 28 M15/42 tanks. It had a more powerful engine and air filters to cope with the harsh conditions of the desert, and an improved version of the 47  mm gun; however, by the time it entered production it was already obsolete.\n\n\nItalian tank classification\nItaly introduced a new tank classification scheme in 1938. Tanks were designated first with a letter (L, M, or P, for light, medium, or heavy respectively) followed by the weight in tonnes, separated by a slash followed by the year the tank was accepted for service. The classes of light, medium and heavy differed somewhat from other countries. Hence the P26/40, designated as \"heavy\" by the Italians with its 26-tonne weight, was more similar in weight to the medium M4 Sherman tank (30-tonne weight). The Italians also labeled the machine gun-armed L3/35 a \"light tank\", although it is more commonly called a tankette.\n\n\nJapan\n\nLike the US Army (which utilized French and British tanks in World War I), the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) did not have tanks of its own in World War I, so it started out by purchasing foreign tanks for evaluation during World War I and right after the war ended. Like many other nations, the Japanese initially didn't embrace the tank, as it didn't have the cavalry tradition.  Cavalry was used for reconnaissance in the mountainous countryside, and initially, as with most other armies, the first designs were constrained by the tank's infantry-support role. Building tanks of their own met several problems, as Japan's priority tended to be with naval procurements so production for tank steel was on a lower level. However, they finally began designing tanks by the mid-1920s. Inspired by European designs, the Japanese tank program designed and developed the tanks which facilitated their campaigns in China and the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, prior to World War II. They introduced many innovations as they built their designs, including bell crank suspensions, as pioneers in amphibious tanks, and the use of diesel engines that were less likely to catch fire compared with gasoline tank engines that were being used at the time. The Japanese generals had made a mistake in their assessment of the tanks used against China, a country whose army had only three tank battalions, and few anti-tank weapons.\n\nBy 1937, Japan fielded 1,060 tanks in 8 regiments, most designed for and used in the infantry-support role. But this focus left the IJA without a tank capable of taking on other tanks, a deficiency that was brought home hard during the Battle of Khalkin-Gol, a decisive defeat inflicted by the Soviet Union on the Mongolian border in 1939. This proved fatal later when they faced the new generation of Allied tanks, as the great majority of the Japanese models were lightly armored, and not heavily gunned. As in the 1920s, with the priority of steel going to the navy and air force, the Japanese Army has relegated the remaining material for its tanks. Thus the 1930s-designed vehicles went on being mass-produced, and the warning of Khalkin-Gol was too slowly recognized. By 1940 they had the fifth-largest tank force in the world behind the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and Germany, but were behind in medium and heavy tanks. However, after December 1941, with the entry of the United States into the conflict, priority continued to be given to warships and aircraft, weapons that were more conducive to naval warfare; attacking across the Pacific, and defending the Empire from the advancing Americans.\n\nAlthough the Japanese Army widely employed tanks within the Pacific theater of war, the tanks that Allied forces faced there were mostly older designs, such as the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. As the war progressed the Japanese built tanks and self-propelled guns to match up against the Allied tanks. These included the Type 1 Ho-Ni I tank destroyer with a 75  mm gun designed as self-propelled artillery and the Type 2 Ho-I infantry support tank, for the close-fire support role; providing Type 97 equipped tank regiments with additional firepower against the enemy armored fighting vehicles. However, they were only produced in limited numbers. The most modern Japanese tanks, such as the Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank were delayed by material and production shortages. Even after they started to come out of the factories, a doctrine called for them to be held for the defense of the mainland against invasion.\nBetween 1931 and 1945, Japan produced 6450 tanks. Half of them (3300) were made by the Mitsubishi Company. The sub-total of tanks produced between 1940 and 1945 is 4424, i.e. a yearly average comparable to Italy. For a country as large and as industrialized as Japan, that is modest. However, before 1944/45, the naval fleet and the air force had priority of steel allocation and construction. It changed when the homeland became increasingly under direct threat, but it was too late. As with many innovative weapons projects during the final years of World War II, production could not advance beyond either small numbers or the prototype stage due to material shortages, and the loss of Japan's industrial infrastructure to the Allied bombing of Japan.\n\n\nTanks of other combatants\n\n\nRomania\n\nDuring the interwar period, Romania had equipped its army with tanks from its Czechoslovak and French allies. The vehicles acquired by Romania were, however, different in many aspects from their original Czechoslovak and French counterparts. For example, the R-1, which was also built in Romania under license, had a different engine and armor thickness than other AH-IV variants. The R-2 (Romanian designation of the LT vz. 35) had a modified variant, the R-2c, with cemented armor and a different looking rear for both the turret and the hull. French Renault R35s were also acquired – their suspension was later heavily modified, so the wheels were ten times more durable.\nRomania joined the Axis Powers in 1941, so its vehicles fought against the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. They were used in places like Odesa and Stalingrad. The Romanian interwar-developed tank force proved to be hardly effective against Soviet T-34s and KV-1s; during tests, it was found out that the T-34 was invulnerable to the R-2's 37  mm gun. However, Romania did upgrade its tank force with German designs such as Panzer IIIs, Panzer IVs, and StuG IIIs, referred to in the Romanian army as T-3, T-4 and TAs respectively.\nTo further increase its anti-tank capacities, Romania had also started its own production of tank destroyers in late 1942. These included the Mareșal, TACAM T-60, TACAM R-2 and VDC R35, the first of which was started by Wehrmacht officials to have inspired the German Hetzer's design. Attempts were also made to produce medium tanks, such as the R-3 and a later tank project comparable in characteristics to the T-34; neither of them is known to have passed the proposal stage. Heavy modifications were also suggested for captured T-34s (see here).\n\n\nCzechoslovakia\n\nBy the time of the Sudeten crisis, the Czechoslovak army used a complement of light tanks including 298 LT vz. 35 designed by Škoda, as well as 50 LT vz. 34 built by ČKD; 150 LT vz. 38 were ordered but none were delivered before the German occupation. The LT-35 and LT-38 models were superior to the Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks used in the Wehrmacht, so the Germans ordered the production of these models to be resumed.\nBefore the end of production in 1942, 136 more LT-35 and a total of 1414 LT-38 were produced for the Wehrmacht at Škoda Works; these tanks saw operational use in the Polish campaign, the Battle of France, and on the Soviet front. By 1942, Czech-built tanks became progressively vulnerable to Soviet T-34 medium tanks and new anti-tank guns and the LT-35 and LT-38 proved unsuitable for harsh winter conditions in Russia, so they were withdrawn from front line service in 1942; the remaining units were either redeployed in a light reconnaissance role or converted to Hetzer tank destroyers and artillery tractors.\n\n\nPoland\n\nPoland was the first to suffer the German Blitzkrieg, but it had some very good tanks in its armored forces. The most important was the 7TP (siedmiotonowy Polski – \"7-tonne Polish\") light tank, which was better armed than its most common opponents, the German Panzer I and Panzer II.\nLike the similar Soviet T-26, the 7TP was a development of the British Vickers 6-ton (Mk. E) which the Poles purchased and licensed for local production. The main new features of 7TP were: a better, more reliable and powerful diesel engine (which made the 7TP world's first diesel tank), 37 mm anti-tank gun, and slightly thicker armor (17 mm in front instead of 13 mm). Only about 132 tanks were produced between 1935 and the outbreak of the war. The weight increased after the initial 7-tonne prototype was made and the actual serial tanks weighed 9.9 tonnes.\nLike its British predecessor, the 7TP was initially produced in two variants: the twin turret version armed with 2 Ckm wz.30 machine guns, and a single turret version, armed with a 37 mm (1.5 in) Bofors wz. 37 gun. After initial tests, it became clear that the twin-turret variant was obsolete and lacked firepower, so it was abandoned in favor of the more-modern, single-turret design.\nPoland also had the TK tankette (also known as the TK-3) which was based upon an improved chassis of the British Carden Loyd tankette. The 575 TK/TKS tankettes formed the bulk of the Polish armored forces but as their armament was limited to machine guns, their combat value was limited. They suffered heavy losses during the Invasion of Poland. Only the handful of tankettes armed with 20  mm guns had a fighting chance against the enemy tanks; in one instance on 18 September 1939 a 20  mm gunned TKS destroyed three German Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) tanks.\nAll of the 7TP tanks took part in combat in the Polish Defensive War of 1939. Most of them were attached to two light tank battalions (the 1st and the 2nd).\nIt is a paradox that the Polish motorized unit that performed the best had only 16 old Vickers E 6-ton tanks and 4 tankettes with 20  mm autocannon, 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland).\nPoland also purchased and used, in September 1939, 50 (some sources claim 49) Renault R35 tanks but due to extremely rugged terrain and the tank's poor cross-country performance, many ended up destroyed by the crews. 34 tanks crossed into Romania after covering the Polish retreat after the Soviet Invasion of Poland on 17SEP39 and 2 crossed into Hungary. Only about half of the Renault tanks participated in the actual fighting.\nPolish forces in exile after the fall of Poland were reequipped by their allies. Polish LWP forces fighting alongside the Red Army were equipped with T-34, T-70, and IS-2 tanks, along with ISU-122 and SU-76 self-propelled guns. Polish forces in the west were equipped out of British stocks including M3 and M5 Stuarts, M4 Shermans, and a small number of Cromwells. Polish armor units were participants in the Battle of Berlin and played an important role in the campaign in Normandy.\n\n\nSee also\n759th Tank Battalion (United States)\nHistory of the tank\nAssault gun\nTank destroyer\nTanks in World War I\nComparison of World War I tanks\nTanks of the interwar period\nLight tanks of the United Kingdom\nRhino tank\nCold War Tanks\nPost-Cold War Tanks\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBibliography\nAxworthy, Mark (1995).

    "text": "Benjamin Earl King (né Nelson; September 28, 1938 – April 30, 2015) was an American soul and R&B singer and songwriter. He rose to prominence as one of the principal lead singers of the R&B vocal group the Drifters, singing the lead vocals on three of their biggest hit singles: \"There Goes My Baby\", \"This Magic Moment\", and \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (their only US number one hit).  \nAs a soloist, King is best known as the singer and co-composer of \"Stand by Me\", which became a US top-10 hit, both in 1961 and later in 1986 (when it was used as the theme to the film of the same name), and a number-one hit in the United Kingdom in 1987. The single was also placed on the RIAA's list of Songs of the Century. His 1975 single \"Supernatural Thing\" became a top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, King was the original recording artist of songs such as \"Spanish Harlem\", \"I (Who Have Nothing)\", \"So Much Love\", \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\", \"We're Gonna Groove\", and \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore\", all of which have been covered by multiple artists to varying degrees of success. \nKing was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, as a member of the Drifters, and has been nominated as a solo artist. Along with the Drifters' \"There Goes My Baby\", King's songs \"Stand by Me\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" also appeared on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Additionally, he was inducted alongside the Drifters into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 with the Towering song award.\n\n\nEarly life\nBenjamin Earl Nelson was born on September 28, 1938, in Henderson, North Carolina, but moved to Harlem, New York, at the age of nine in 1947. He began singing in church choirs, and in high school formed the Four B's, a doo-wop group that occasionally performed at the Apollo Theater.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nThe Drifters\nIn 1958, King (still using his birth name) joined a doo-wop group called the Five Crowns. Later that year, the Drifters' manager George Treadwell fired the members of the original Drifters, and replaced them with the members of the Five Crowns.\nKing had a string of R&B hits with the group on Atlantic Records. He co-wrote and sang lead on the first Atlantic hit by the new version of the Drifters, \"There Goes My Baby\" (1959). King sang lead on a succession of hits by the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, including \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"This Magic Moment\", and \"I Count the Tears\". He recorded only 13 songs with the Drifters—two backing other lead singers and 11 lead vocal performances—including an unreleased song called \"Temptation\" (later redone by Drifters vocalist Johnny Moore). The last of the King-led Drifters singles to be released was \"Sometimes I Wonder\", which was recorded on May 19, 1960, but not issued until June 1962.\nAfter a year of touring with the Drifters, contract disputes arose with Treadwell, in which King and his manager Lover Patterson demanded greater compensation. Treadwell refused, and King was only hired for studio recordings. On television, fellow Drifters member Charlie Thomas usually lip-synched the songs that King had recorded with the Drifters.\n\n\nSolo career\nIn May 1960, King left the Drifters, assuming the stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining with Atlantic Records on its Atco imprint, his first release, \"Show Me the Way\"/\"Brace Yourself\" failed to hit the charts. His second effort, \"A Help-Each-Other\"/\"How Often\", with Lavern Baker, was not a hit either. King’s first charting single was \"First Taste of Love\". It peaked on the US Billboard at number 53, but it became a bigger hit in the UK, charting at number 27. His first Top 10 release as a solo artist was \"Spanish Harlem\" (1961), written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector and produced by Leiber and Mike Stoller. It peaked on the US pop charts at number 10, and on Billboard's R&B chart at number 15. \nKing's next single, \"Stand by Me\", written with Leiber and Stoller, ultimately would be voted as one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. King cited singers Brook Benton, Roy Hamilton, and Sam Cooke as influences for his vocals of the song. \"Stand by Me\", \"There Goes My Baby\", \"Spanish Harlem\", and \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" were all named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll; and each of those records has earned a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. King's other well-known songs include \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\", \"Amor\", \"Seven Letters\", \"How Can I Forget\", \"I Swear by Stars Above\" , \"It Ain’t Fair\", \"Young Boy Blues\", \"Its All Over\", \"River of Tears\", \"Ecstasy\", \"She’s gone Again\", \"That's When It Hurts\", and \"On the Horizon\". In the summer of 1963, King had a Top 30 hit with \"I (Who Have Nothing)\", which reached the Top 10 on New York's radio station, WMCA.\nKing's records continued to place well on the Billboard Hot 100 chart until the mid-1960s. British pop bands began to dominate the pop music scene, but King still continued to make R&B hits. Some of these hits include \"What is Soul?\", \"Tears, Tears, Tears\", and \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore\". In 1975, King made a comeback on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with the disco hit \"Supernatural Thing\": number 5 on Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard R&B chart. It was also nominated for a Grammy at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards in 1975 for \"best R&B vocal performance, male\". In 1977, King collaborated with Average White Band in releasing the album Benny & Us. The album spawned two top 40 R&B hits, \"A Star in the Ghetto\" and \"Get It Up\".\nKing returned to the Drifters in late 1982 in the United Kingdom and sang with them until the group's break-up and reorganization in 1986. From 1983 until the band's break-up, the other members of this incarnation of the Drifters were Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown.\nA 1986 re-issue of \"Stand by Me\" followed the song's use as the theme song to the movie Stand By Me and re-entered the Billboard top ten after a 25-year absence. This reissue also topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for three weeks in February 1987. The reissue also made King the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 10 in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, either as a member of an act that reached that high (in this case, the Drifters) or as a solo act that did.\nIn 1990, King and Bo Diddley, along with Doug Lazy, recorded a revamped hip hop version of the Monotones' 1958 hit song \"Book of Love\" for the soundtrack of the movie Book of Love. He also recorded a children's album, I Have Songs In My Pocket, written and produced by children's music artist Bobby Susser in 1998, which won the Early Childhood News Directors' Choice Award and Dr. Toy's/the Institute for Childhood Resources Award. King performed \"Stand by Me\" on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2007. Ahmet Ertegun said, \"King is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll and rhythm and blues.\"\nAs a Drifter and as a solo artist, King has achieved a few number-one hits: \"There Goes My Baby\", \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"Stand By Me\", \"Supernatural Thing\", and the 1986 re-issue of \"Stand By Me\". On the US pop and R&B charts combined, he achieved 12 Top 10 hits and 28 Top 40 hits. King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Drifter; he was also nominated as a solo artist.\n\nA re-recording of King's \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" was selected for the Sopranos Peppers and Eggs Soundtrack CD (2001).\nKing was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.\nOn March 27, 2012, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced that \"Stand By Me\" would receive its 2012 Towering Song Award and that King would be honored with the 2012 Towering Performance Award for his recording of the song.\n\n\nLater life\nKing was active in his charitable foundation, the Stand By Me Foundation, which helps to provide education to deserving youths. King was a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey, from the late 1960s onwards.\nKing performed \"Stand by Me\" during a televised tribute to late comedian George Carlin, as he was one of Carlin's favorite artists. On November 11, 2010, King performed \"Stand by Me\" at the Latin Grammys with Prince Royce.\nKing toured the United Kingdom in 2013 and played concerts in the United States as late as 2014, despite reported health problems.\nFollowing a brief illness, King died at Hackensack University Medical Center on April 30, 2015; he was 76 years old. King was married to his wife Betty, for 50 years, and had three children: Terris Cannon, Benjamin King Jr., and Angela Matos, in addition to six grandchildren.\n\n\nLegacy\nKing has been covered by acts from several genres. \"So Much Love\" was recorded by Dusty Springfield and many others. \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" was performed by Shirley Bassey in 1963 and also by Tom Jones in 1970, as well as a 1979 recording by Sylvester. \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore\" was revisited by peer Ray Charles in 1970 and \"Spanish Harlem\" was sung by Aretha Franklin in 1971. \"Stand by Me\" was covered by the Righteous Brothers, Otis Redding, John Lennon, Mickey Gilley, Seal, Florence and the Machine, and Tracy Chapman. The song forms the basis for the Indian hit \"Dildaara\" by songwriters Vishal–Shekhar. King also inspired a number of rock bands: Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded \"Supernatural Thing\" in 1981 and Led Zeppelin did a cover version of \"Groovin'\", which is better known under the title of \"We're Gonna Groove\".\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nLive album\n\n\nCompilation albums\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nAs lead of The Drifters\n\n\nAs a solo artist\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nBen E.

    "text": "William Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789 – 6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist.\n\n\nLife\nSwainson was born in Dover Place, St Mary Newington, London, the eldest son of John Timothy Swainson, an original fellow of the Linnean Society. He was a cousin of the amateur botanist Isaac Swainson. His father's family originated in Lancashire, and both his grandfather and father held high posts in Her Majesty's Customs, his father becoming Collector at Liverpool.\nWilliam, whose formal education was curtailed because of an impediment in his speech, joined the Liverpool Customs as a junior clerk at the age of 14. He joined the Army Commissariat and toured Malta and Sicily. He studied the ichthyology of western Sicily and in 1815 was forced by ill health to return to England where he subsequently retired on half-pay. William followed in his father's footsteps to become a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1815.\nIn 1806 he accompanied the English explorer Henry Koster to Brazil. Koster had lived in Brazil for some years and had become famous for his book Travels in Brazil (1816). There he met Dr. Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff, also an explorer of Brazil and a Russian Consul General. They did not spend a long time on shore because of a revolution, but Swainson returned to England in 1818 in his words \"a bee loaded with honey\", with a collection of over 20,000 insects, 1,200 species of plants, drawings of 120 species of fish, and about 760 bird skins.\nAs with many Victorian scientists, Swainson was also a member of many learned societies, including the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society after his return from Brazil on 14 December 1820, and married his first wife Mary Parkes in 1823, with whom he had four sons (William John, George Frederick, Henry Gabriel, and Edwin Newcombe) and a daughter (Mary Frederica). His wife Mary died in 1835.\nSwainson remarried in 1840 to Ann Grasby, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1841. Their daughter, Edith Stanway Swainson, married Arthur Halcombe in 1863. Swainson was involved in property management and natural history-related publications from 1841 to 1855, and forestry-related investigations in Tasmania, New South Wales, and Victoria from 1851 to 1853. Swainson died at Fern Grove, Lower Hutt, New Zealand, on 6 December 1855.\n\n\nWorks on natural history\n\nSwainson was at times quite critical of the works of others and, later in life, others in turn became quite critical of him.\nApart from the common and scientific names of many species, it is for the quality of his illustrations that he is best remembered. His friend William Elford Leach, head of zoology at the British Museum, encouraged him to experiment with lithography for his book Zoological Illustrations (1820–1823). Swainson became the first illustrator and naturalist to use lithography, which was a relatively cheap means of reproduction and did not require an engraver. He began publishing many illustrated works, mostly serially. Subscribers received and paid for fascicles, small sections of the books, as they came out, so that the cash flow was constant and could be reinvested in the preparation of subsequent parts. As book orders arrived, the monochrome lithographs were hand-coloured, according to colour reference images, known as ‘pattern plates’, which were produced by Swainson himself. It was his early adoption of this new technology and his natural skill in illustration that in large part led to his fame.\nWhen Leach was forced to resign from the British Museum due to ill health, Swainson applied to replace him, but the post was given to John George Children. Swainson continued with his writing, the most influential of which was the second volume of Fauna Boreali-Americana (1831), which he wrote with John Richardson. This series (1829–1837) was the first illustrated zoological study to be funded in part by the British government. He also produced a second series of Zoological Illustrations (1832–1833), three volumes of William Jardine's Naturalist's Library, and eleven volumes of Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia; he had signed a contract with London publisher Longman to produce fourteen illustrated volumes of 300 pages in this series, one to be produced quarterly.\n\n\nClassification\nIn 1819, William Sharp Macleay published his ideas of the Quinarian system of biological classification, and Swainson soon became a noted and outspoken proponent. The Quinarian system later fell out of favour, giving way to the rising popularity of the geographical theory of Hugh Edwin Strickland. Swainson was overworked by Dionysius Lardner, the publisher of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia, and both Swainson and Macleay were derided for their support of the Quinarian system. Both proponents left Britain; Swainson emigrated to New Zealand and Macleay to Australia. An American visiting Australasia in the 1850s heard to his surprise that both Macleay and Swainson were living there, and imagined that they had been exiled to the Antipodes 'for the great crime of burdening zoology with a false though much laboured theory which has thrown so much confusion into the subject of its classification and philosophical study'.\n\n\nNew Zealand estate\nIn 1839, Swainson became a member of the committee of the New Zealand Company and of the Church of England committee for the appointment of a bishop to New Zealand, bought land in Wellington, and gave up scientific literary work. He married his second wife, Anne Grasby, in 1840. He was apparently the first Fellow of the Royal Society to move to New Zealand. He was later made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Tasmania.\nTogether with most of his children from his first marriage, they sailed for New Zealand in the Jane, reaching Wellington in the summer of 1841. The trip was not without incident, as the boat suffered damage en route and was in such a poor state that there was legal action on arrival. Swainson purchased 1,100 acres (4 km2) in the Hutt Valley from the New Zealand Company, and established his estate of \"Hawkshead\". Not coincidentally, this name was shared by an ancestral home of the Swainson family in Hawkshead, Lancashire, which was the birthplace of Isaac Swainson. After a few months, the New Zealand estate was claimed by a Māori chief, Taringakuri, which led to years of uncertainty and threat. He was an officer in a militia against the Māoris in 1846. During these times he was largely dependent on his half-pay.\n\n\nBotanical studies in Australia\nIn 1851, Swainson sailed to Sydney and took the post of Botanical Surveyor with the Victoria Government in 1852, after being invited by Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe to study local trees. He finished his report in 1853 in which he claimed a grand total of 1,520 species and varieties of Eucalyptidae. He identified so many species of Casuarina that he ran out of names for them.\n\nWhile having quite some expertise in zoology, his untrained foray into botany was not well received. William Jackson Hooker wrote to Ferdinand von Mueller: In my life I think I never read such a series of trash and nonsense. There is a man who left this country with the character of a first rate naturalist (though with many eccentricities) and of a very first-rate Natural History artist and he goes to Australia and takes up the subject of Botany, of which he is as ignorant as a goose. Joseph Maiden described Swainson's efforts as \"an exhibition of reckless species-making that, as far as I know stands unparalleled in the annals of botanical literature.\" \nHe had studied the flora of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania before his return to New Zealand in 1854 to live at Fern Grove in the Hutt, where he died the following year.\nIn 1856, a poem was written by the New Zealand poet William Golder in his memory. His standard botanical abbreviation is Swainson.\n\n\nCommon confusions\nWilliam Swainson is frequently credited with having the plant genus Swainsona named after him, and specifically Sturt's desert pea, the official floral emblem of South Australia. Although he did botanical work in this region, Swainsona is named for his cousin Isaac Swainson (1746–1812), who never travelled to this region.\n\n\nCommon names of species\nMany birds retain a common name after Swainson, several of which were named by famous naturalists of the period. Many species or subspecies retain his name, although many of his own species were later discredited or merged with others.\n\nJohn James Audubon named Swainson's warbler Limnothlypis swainsonii\nCharles Lucien Bonaparte named Swainson's hawk Buteo swainsoni\nThomas Nuttall named Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus\nSwainson's francolin Francolinus swainsonii\nSwainson's sparrow Passer swainsonii\nSwainson's antcatcher Myrmeciza longipes\nSwainson's fire-eye Pyriglena atra\nSwainson's flycatcher Myiarchus swainsoni\nSwainson's toucan Ramphastos swainsonii\n\n\nTaxon described by him\nSee Category:Taxa named by William Swainson\n\n\nPartial bibliography\nMany of these works were reprinted, or present in serial publication.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nA very complete set of references of Swainson's life, and his work in malacology and conchology is maintained by The American Malacological Society under their review : 2,400 Years of Malacology (3rd edition)\nCalhoun, J.

    "text": "Gary L. Ginsberg (born August 30, 1962) is an American lawyer, political operative and corporate adviser, serving as a strategist in both the public and private sectors for more than 25 years. He was most recently Senior Vice President and Global Head of Communications at SoftBank Group Corp. before resigning in 2020. Before joining SoftBank, Ginsberg served as Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Communications at Time Warner and as Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs at News Corp.\n\n\nBiography\nGinsberg began his legal career as an attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. After that he served in the Clinton Administration at the White House’s Counsel office and the U.S. Department of Justice. In 1995, Ginsberg became Senior Editor and legal counsel of George, the magazine started by John F. Kennedy Jr.\nGinsberg spent eleven years at News Corporation, serving in several senior roles, including most recently as Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs. During this tenure, Ginsberg was a close confidant of Rupert Murdoch and Peter Chernin. In 2009, Ginsberg stepped down from his role at News Corp. following the departure of Chernin, who for years served as Murdoch’s top lieutenant. Ginsberg had been close to Chernin and was also closely associated with Democratic politics. Ginsberg was credited with brokering numerous relationships between Murdoch and prominent Democratic politicians. He arranged lunches with Bill Clinton and orchestrated a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2006. Ginsberg also arranged a meeting between Murdoch and Barack Obama in 2008.  Ginsberg was described as the “Murdoch Interpreter - the point man for all of the information going out of the company, as well as the information going into the company.” He was also \"a point man for News Corp.’s 2007 purchase of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal.\"\nGinsberg joined Time Warner in February 2010. His new job was described \"as a senior adviser to its CEO Jeff Bewkes..., executive vice president, ... [and] responsible for a range of corporate issues, including communications and marketing, and for evangelism across the media industry for Mr. Bewkes’s initiatives.”  Ginsberg again served as “the connection to Washington on multiple instances.” The Wall Street Journal reported in early 2017 that Ginsberg met with Jared Kushner at the White House. At the meeting Kushner “expressed the administration's deep concerns about CNN’s according to an administration official.\nGinsberg held a breakfast meeting in 2016 with his former colleague Peter Cherning in Martha’s Vineyard where Cherning first broached the possibility of AT&T acquiring Time Warner. Ginsberg was “in the middle of the fight to defend the company’s sale to AT&T.”  Two years later the deal was completed and Ginsberg left the company along with other senior colleagues from Time Warner.\nIn October 2018 Ginsberg was hired by Softbank as the company's Global Chief of Communications. While at Sofbank, Ginsberg worked on a number of initiatives including the launch a new global website and more sophisticated video content to sharpen the company messaging.\nGinsberg is the author of First Friends: The Powerful, Unsung (and Unelected) People Who Shaped our Presidents published in July 2021, which reached The New York Times Best Seller list.\n\n\nPersonal life\nGinsberg is chairman of the Board of New Visions for Public Schools; Director of The City, an online news service covering NYC, and Malaria No More; and serves as a member of the Advisory Board of the Genesis Prize Foundation Genesis Prize Foundation. Ginsberg is also an adjunct professor at the Columbia Business School and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nGinsberg holds an undergraduate degree from Brown University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and a J.D. from Columbia University School of Law, where was a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/16/gary-ginsberg-news-corp-e_n_359605.html",

Founded in 1975 under the name TV Imperatriz, since 1992, the station is owned by politician and businessman Francisco Pereira Lima, alias \"Chico do Rádio\".\n\n\nHistory\nThe station was founded on Christmas Day 1975 by Alberto Barateiro da Costa, then-mayor of the municipality, relaying programs from Rede Tupi. In 1978, a company formed by Raimundo Cabeludo, Francisco Ramos and Bayma Junior took control of the station, changing its name to TV Tropical and joining Rede Bandeirantes.\nIn 1992, Francisco Ramos, Bayma Junior and Raimundo Cabeludo sold their shares to rising politician and businessman Francisco Pereira Lima, better known under his nickname Chico do Rádio. after the acquisition, Chico changed the name of the station to TV CRC, the initials of the new legal name of the company: TV Chico do Rádio Comunicação Ltda.\nIn 2008, TV CRC was renamed Band Imperatriz, without changes to its local programming. That same year, it started airing TV Kamaleão, a program produced in São Luís, the state capital. In 2015, the station's name was reverted to TV CRC, adopting the slogan De Cara Nova. On January 7, 2019, TV CRC was rented for a five-year period to a group of businessmen led by Marcos Daniel, who became its new director-general, reverting its name to Band Imperatriz, for a short period. On February 16, it was simply renamed TV Imperatriz (TVI). The company's legal name changed on April 5.\nOn October 14, after a decision taken by Rede Bandeirantes not to continue with the station, in order to prioritize the unification of its signal with Band O&O Band Maranhão, TVI left the network after 41 years of affiliation — the title of Band's oldest affiliate was later taken by TV Tarobá Cascavel in the state of Paraná —, and joined Record News, which had no signal in Imperatriz since the shutdown of Record News Imperatriz, due to the end of analog TV in the city. A troca ocorreu às 19h30, com uma cerimônia especial transmitida pela TVI.\nIn 2020, Marcos Daniel left the group responsible for TVI's management, which was now presided by businessman Pedro Carlos Duarte. On April 18, 2021, the station changed its name again, this time to GTVI. At the same time, its local programming began to be mirrored on UHF channel 19, with Rede Meio Norte's programming. On May 10, 2021, the station ends its usage of the GTVI nomenclature and was renamed Record News Imperatriz.\nIn October 2021, the nomenclature is changed to Imperatriz TV. On December 3, it was announced that the station would change its affiliation to RedeTV!, effective December 13. RedeTV! was formerly on TV Liberdade. \nIn May 2023, the station changes its name to TV Liberdade.\nOn December 13, 2024, it adopted its current name, Imperial TV.\n\n\nTechnical information\n\nThe station shut down its analog signal on VHF channel 10 on December 17, 2018, following the official ANATEL roadmap.\n\n\nReferences",

The festival was first held in 1978 and is often host to an F1 ChampBoat Series race.  The F1 race, originally held in 1982, was the first F1 power boat race held in the United States. 2008 saw the return of F1 Power Boat racing at the Pittsburgh Regatta after a two-year hiatus following the 2005 festival. The festival had been scheduled to coincide with the  July 4th holiday, however 2016 saw a return to the Regatta being held prior in early August, as it traditionally was prior to 2004. The festival is the largest inland regatta in the United States, drawing tens of thousands of fans along the Allegheny River. The F1 race course consists of a 4-pin 1.25 (2 km) course.  In 2008, the Pittsburgh regatta F1 ChampBoat race was nationally broadcast on the Speed Channel.\nThe Regatta is the annual continuation of the original speed boat and paddle wheeler races of the \"Pittsburgh Welcome Week Regatta\" held annually starting on May 21, 1949, and through the mid-1950s.\n\n\nFestival\n\nThe race corresponds to a three-day festival in downtown Pittsburgh consisting of variety of events including free concerts, food vendors, aerial competitions, various water sports, dragon boat races, and the July Fourth fireworks display for the City of Pittsburgh. Over 1.5 million people are estimated to have attended some aspect of the regatta events every year.\n\n\n1988 Accident\nOn August 7, 1988, one of the Formula 1 boats went out of control and crashed into a crowd near Three Rivers Stadium. A 7-year-old boy was killed, and 24 were injured. The accident was captured on live TV during the broadcast of a Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets baseball game from a blimp above the stadium.\n\n\nThe Kinks\nOn August 7, 1993, The Kinks were playing in the nearby I.C.

    "title": "Bionic Commando Rearmed",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15307294",
    "text": "Bionic Commando Rearmed is an enhanced remake of the 1988 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Bionic Commando.  It was developed by Grin and published by Capcom for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade, and was released in August 2008. The BlackBerry version was developed and published by Beeline Interactive and released on April 23, 2009. The remake serves as a prelude to the 2009 video game Bionic Commando. \nRearmed follows Nathan \"Rad\" Spencer, a commando with a bionic left arm that can extend and be used as a weapon, or to swing from various objects.  Spencer is sent to destroy a weapon known as the Albatross project under construction by the Badds.  The game was developed using Grin's Diesel engine and features in-game art by Shinkiro.  Music for the game was composed by Simon Viklund and consists largely of remixed versions of the original music.  The soundtrack was released on May 27, 2008 by Sumthing Else Music Works.\nRearmed was well-received by critics, who praised the updated gameplay, graphics and faithfulness to the original, with some calling it one of the best downloadable games available on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. A sequel, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, was released in February 2011.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nBionic Commando Rearmed borrows its plot largely from the NES version of the game. In keeping with the North American release of that version, the references to the Nazi party found in the original Japanese title are not featured in Rearmed. However, as is the case in the original, the final boss of the game resembles Adolf Hitler, and is referred to as \"The Leader\".\nRearmed centers around two warring factions: the Federation and the Empire. It begins with the Imperial forces discovering classified documents regarding the development of a secret weapon known as the Albatross project, originally started by an organization known as the Badds, but never completed. Killt, Generalissimo of the Empire's forces, decides to complete the project himself. When the Federation learns of the Empire's plot, they send in their national hero, Super Joe to infiltrate the Empire. During his mission, Joe is captured by Imperial forces. The Federation sends in a second operative named Nathan Spencer to rescue Super Joe and assist him in completing his mission.\nSpencer traverses several areas, eliminating many Imperial leaders along his way.  As he progresses, he finds new technology and travels deeper behind enemy lines.  The plot culminates as Super Joe is rescued from the bionic Imperial soldier Gottfried Groeder, and both Spencer and Joe set out to destroy the Albatross project.  During the mission, Spencer encounters \"The Leader\", the resurrected head of the Imperial forces.  Spencer defeats The Leader, and together with Super Joe destroys the Albatross.  The game ends with both heroes hanging onto a helicopter, flying off as the Albatross explodes.\n\n\nGameplay\nIn Bionic Commando Rearmed, the player controls Nathan Spencer, a soldier who has been given a bionic arm.  The arm is equipped with several features including a grappling hook which can be used to reach distant objects. The player uses Spencer's bionic arm to swing across gaps or climb to higher ledges. Often, the player must make a series of grappling actions in a row to successfully traverse hazards such as a wide gap or an electrified floor.\nSpencer earns a variety of weaponry and items by defeating level bosses. Some items and weapons must be acquired before certain areas can be entered: for example, the player must locate flares that can then be used to illuminate dark areas. Levels are presented to the player as an overworld-style tactical map showing friendly and enemy areas. The player controls a helicopter to move between areas, and can then select to infiltrate that area on foot. While in the overworld view, enemy convoys will also move between areas. If the player's helicopter encounters a convoy, the player must fight through it on foot and destroy the enemy anti-air truck before the helicopter can proceed.  Such levels are presented from a top-down perspective.\nWhile Bionic Commando Rearmed remains mostly true to its NES counterpart, a number of gameplay enhancements were made.  A health bar replaces the game's original health system of a limited health pool which grows after collecting bullets from defeated foes.  Players collect health items from enemies to restore health, as opposed to the original system which involved earning more hit points. Defeating enemies with full health now awards players extra points, encouraging players to avoid being hit in order to obtain high scores. Players can extend Spencer's bionic arm to grab oil barrels and throw them at enemies, or use them as temporary shields. Weapons can now be changed instantly during gameplay, as opposed to being limited to one weapon per mission.  Boss battles have also been redesigned. Each battle now makes unique use of Spencer's weaponry and bionic arm.  In one example, the player must latch the arm to a screw on the boss character's vehicle, then pull back to expose a weak point in the armor.  Additionally, the final boss battle has been extended to a complete level as opposed to the ending sequence of one. Hacking into enemy communications now involves navigating a three-dimensional puzzle as opposed to simply choosing to hack.  New to the remake are Challenge rooms which involve using the bionic arm to traverse a course as quickly as possible.  Force feedback has been implemented when using the bionic arm, firing weapons, and other events.\n\n\nMultiplayer\nRearmed's campaign can be played locally with another player. Although the overall gameplay is identical, enemy AI adapts difficulty to accommodate the extra player. Character lives are shared between players, meaning that each player life lost hurts both players.  Once all extra lives are depleted and a player dies, the AI reverts to its single player configuration for the remaining player until that player completes the level or an extra life is found. Additionally the cooperative campaign is saved separately from the solo campaign, meaning that weapons, equipment, and powerups do not carry over from one campaign into the other. During play, the game's camera will zoom in and out to accommodate both players, and will split the screen dynamically should the camera not be able to zoom any further. Competitive multiplayer modes have also been added, and can be played locally.  Game modes include the standard versus and last man standing modes, and Don't Touch the Floor, in which characters attempt to knock other players to a hazard at the bottom of the level for points.\n\n\nDevelopment and marketing\nBionic Commando Rearmed developer Grin made it a priority to preserve as much of the original gameplay and visual stylings as possible.  Screenshots were taken as a reference, with designers keeping the same color schemes when creating the 3D worlds. Programmers had to reverse engineer the original gameplay to accurately reproduce it. They had to \"measure how fast the arm goes out, how fast you swing back and forth, how fast you run across the ground, at what speed you fall down and everything,\" said Simon Viklund, Creative Director for the game.  The level editor was integrated in the engine, which allowed developers to view creations in real time. Lead Gameplay Programmer Håkan Rasmussen expanded on this concept, stating \"Since BCR is built on the same engine as the next-gen BC we can also reuse the editor [which] lowers the time before we can start using levels.\"\nDevelopers found that adjusting the original gameplay to a 3D engine required dismissal of conventional physics. For example, the player cannot walk past a barrel placed in their way, however they are able to swing through the object. \"The swing mechanic [is] based on the original [and so is] totally physically incorrect,\" noted Gameplay Programmer Bertil Hörberg.  Hörberg stated that the character always swings at the same speed and releases at the same angle regardless of player input.  Weapons were also redesigned, with each weapon being rebalanced. \"In the original [players get] the rocket launcher and [use it] for the rest of the game\" stated Viklund.  All of the weapons were redesigned to be useful in some form, and can now all be taken into combat, whereas previously only one weapon could be selected per area.  Boss characters received not only a visual redesign, but the fights were redesigned as well to make use of Spencer's bionic abilities and weaponry.  Viklund noted players \"need to use the arm to beat the boss\".\nChallenge rooms were born of a desire to enhance the game's neutral zones. \"The neutral zones in the original game weren't that interesting, so I starting thinking we could add an obstacle course in each one\", Viklund said. \"The bionic arm is such an unconventional mechanic that we really wanted to explore everything that it could offer\", added Level Designer Viktor Viklund. Viktor Viklund cited inspiration from several NES games, including Solomon's Key, Wrecking Crew, and Ice Climber, adding that the concept was \"very basic, very short stages.\" The game's soundtrack consists of remix versions of the original NES tracks, arranged by Simon Viklund.  He described the arrangements as \"the same melodies and harmonies but with a more modern sound.\"\n\nIn redesigning the game's protagonist, Nathan Spencer, Grin cited the characters Iceman from the movie Top Gun and Marty McFly from the Back to the Future series as visual influences in the update. For the character Super Joe, designers looked to the cowboys of the American Old West, citing actor Sam Elliott as an additional source of inspiration.  3D artists noticed early in development that due to the far distance of the camera, certain details in textures would not be noticeable. \"We had to think 'less detail and more color [and] bigger shapes,'\" stated 3D Artists Wendy Young and Peter Stråhle. All of the 2D character art was designed by Shinkiro, an illustrator and conceptual artist, famous for his work with the Art of Fighting and The King of Fighters series.\nBionic Commando Rearmed - The Soundtrack is the soundtrack of video game music from Bionic Commando Rearmed. It was released on May 27, 2008 by Sumthing Else Music Works. The music was composed by Simon Viklund, who later provided the arranged soundtrack for Final Fight: Double Impact. The music is largely remixed from the original game. Viklund took the original tracks written by Junko Tamiya and rearranged them in Buzz, a freeware virtual studio program. A Japanese trailer for the game was revealed at San Diego Comic-con 2008, done in the style of an anime opening with a theme song sung by Ichirou Mizuki, titled \"Go Go Bionic\".\nOn February 19, 2008 the official Bionic Commando website ran a poll asking gamers to decide between two possible prices for Rearmed —ten or fifteen dollars. Producer Ben Judd stated, \"Personally, since the goal is to make this game for the fans and to get the world to see what makes Bionic Commando so special, I want to sell it for about US$10.\" However, more senior Capcom employees believed that the game had enough features and polish to sell well enough at US15 to warrant that price. Final pricing was settled on US10 for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network versions, and US15 for the Windows version. The PlayStation 3 version supports Remote Play on PlayStation Portable and trophies.\n\n\nSales\nRearmed sold over 130,000 copies across all three platforms during the first week of its release. As of year-end 2010, Bionic Commando Rearmed has sold over 113,000 copies on Xbox Live alone. That number rose to over 119,000 at year-end 2011.\n\n\nReception\n\nBionic Commando Rearmed received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nIn an October 2011 ranking, IGN listed Bionic Commando Rearmed fourth in their top twenty-five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time. Overall impressions of the game gleaned comments of praise. IGN's Hilary Goldstein called Rearmed \"the best downloadable game to date on XBLA and PSN\", and Cam Shea ranked it second on his top 10 list of Xbox Live Arcade games. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb called it \"terrific in almost every way\" and the reviewer from GameTrailers stated it was \"one of those games that feels organic to play.\" Reviewers praised the title's ability to remain true to the NES version but provide enhancements to update the title.\nThe game's graphics received high marks from reviews. Goldstein described as \"gorgeous\" and added that Rearmed is \"one of the prettiest downloadable games ever made.\" Gerstmann also lauded the visuals and praised the color palette, backgrounds and lighting.  He further noted the game's ability to remain loyal to the original visual presentation. \"[It] makes enough visual references to the old game to trigger that feeling of nostalgia, but it never uses the old stuff as a crutch,\" stated Gerstmann.  Similar praise was given in respect to the game's soundtrack, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish calling it \"exceptional\" and \"a mix good enough to enjoy outside the context of the game\". Stephen Woodward of GameZone also gave praise for the remixed music in the Xbox 360 version. He called it \"simultaneously retro and hip.\"\nReviewers were split on opinions of the game's AI, with IGN's Goldstein describing it as \"the best seen in a side-scrolling game\", but Tom McShea of GameSpot saying the enemies were \"simply too limited to pose much of a threat\". Multiple reviewers were disappointed in the game controls, citing the lack of updating to analog features and remaining too true to the original. Rearmed's multiplayer received generally high acclaim, with McShea calling it \"an unexpected treat\". Both the game's cooperative and competitive modes were lauded; however, some critics cited a lack of online functionality. Parish also praised the game's challenge maps and in-game database, stating \"Rearmed is a game that could easily sell for full retail price and seem like a good deal.\"\n\n\nSequel\n\nBionic Commando Rearmed 2 was revealed at Capcom's Captivate 2010 event. It was developed by Fatshark and released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on February 1, 2011 and February 2, 2011, respectively. The game adds new weapons and abilities, including the optional ability to jump, a maneuver absent in previous 2D titles. The sequel's plot revolves around a dictator named General Sabio and a missing commander from Spencer's organization, Colonel Brubaker. Spencer and a team of four other bionics are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them complete their mission of disarming Sabio's missiles. Rearmed 2 was not as well received as the original game. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was criticized for its DRM requirement to be signed into the PlayStation Network in order to play the game.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBionic Commando Rearmed at MobyGames",

    "title": "Trolltunga",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=6051947",
    "text": "Trolltunga (\"the troll tongue\") is a rock formation situated about 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) above sea level in Ullensvang Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The cliff juts horizontally out from the mountain, about 700 metres (2,300 ft) above the north side of the lake Ringedalsvatnet.\nPopularity of the hike to Trolltunga and rock formation itself has exploded in recent years. The increased popularity has turned Trolltunga into a national icon and a major tourist attraction for the region. Until 2010, fewer than 800 people hiked to Trolltunga each year. In 2016 more than 80,000 people hiked the 27-kilometre (17 mi) round-trip from the village of Skjeggedal, making it one of Norway's most popular hikes.\nThis is a very challenging hike, at least 10 hours on rough terrain. There are no shelters on the hike route and no places to buy supplies. However, there is a plan to build a lodge roughly halfway where hikers can rest. There are two emergency cabins along the trail.\n\n\nGeology\nThe cliff is part of the Precambrian bedrock and was formed during the last Ice Age, approximately 10,000 years ago, when the edges of the glacier reached the cliff. The water from the glacier froze in the crevices of the mountain and eventually broke off large, angular blocks, which were later carried away with the glacier. Along the cliff itself, a gneiss, there continues to be deep cracks. The trail to Trolltunga also passes through the bedrock and washed slippery hillsides in the background also containing gneiss.\n\n\nAccess\nTrolltunga is located 17 kilometres (11 mi) from the town of Odda. The city of Bergen, is about 190 kilometres (120 mi) from the site via main roads.\nThe trailhead is located by a small parking area with toilet facilities at Skjeggedal, about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from Norwegian National Road 13 in Tyssedalen, near the dam at the end of Ringedalsvatnet. Parking at Skjeggedal costs 500 kr per day for the lower car park (approx. 62 USD or 52 EUR).\nThe hike from the parking area to Trolltunga and back again is a 27-kilometre (17 mi) round-trip distance with a 1,100-metre (3,600 ft) gain in elevation, and it takes approximately 10–12 hours, including breaks.\n\n\nHiking trail\n\nNear the parking area at Skjeggedal there is a funicular called Mågelibanen (it is not in operation). The trail to Trolltunga begins here, on the left side of the funicular. It is marked with red Ts painted in the terrain, and signs along the route that marks the distance left to Trolltunga and to the starting point at Skjeggedal.\nFor the first 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi), up to the Måglitopp, the trail rises about 450 metres (1,480 ft). From here the track surfaces slightly out before it gets steep again, rising another 330 metres (1,080 ft) up from Gryteskaret to Trombåskåret. This section is the steepest part on this hike. But in recent years this section has been improved by Nepalese sherpas, making it easier to traverse.\nAfter this 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) steep climb from the parking area, the next section slopes down towards Store Floren. The trail continues over Hesteflåene and the dried out river Endåno, before it gets steeper up to Endanuten and crosses the dried river to Tyssestrengene. From here the trail goes on past glacial potholes, then continues past Tysshøl, and finally approaches Trolltunga, about 13.5 kilometres (8.4 mi) from the starting point at Skjeggedal.\n\n\nAlternative starting point\nIn 2017, a new toll road up the steep hillside to Mågelitopp opened to the public. It allows vehicles to access the plateau at Måglitopp. It does not require a 4x4 vehicle. Due to limited parking the maximum capacity here is 30 cars per day. The road opens each day during the season at 6:00 AM, and closes when the first 30 cars have entered the gate. Online reservations are possible and parking here costs 600 kr. The road is also open to hikers, as an alternative to the regular starting point at Skjeggedal.\nThere is a shuttle bus that carries hikers from Skjeggedal to Målelitopp. The price is 130 NOK for adults.\n\n\nTerrain\n\nThe route to Trolltunga goes through high mountain terrain with creeks, streams, boulders, mud puddles, marshes, and water at several spots on the hike.\nFrom late-September to June the terrain is normally covered with ice and snow. After a hard winter it can be snow at Trolltunga even during the summer season.\n\n\nSeasons and climate\nTrolltunga is accessible for experienced hikers and guided groups from mid-June to mid-September, depending on when the snow melts in the Spring. The season for guided trips with snowshoes or skis starts in March.\nTrolltunga is located in a region with a mild and humid coastal climate. During summer and autumn the weather conditions often change quickly – from blue sky to wind, rain and dense fog. Check the weather forecast and ask locals about what kind of weather to expect before you go hiking.\nDue to the long distance, hikers to Trolltunga need to start before 10:00 AM in the summer season[2]  to get home before it gets dark and cold. In September it is recommended to start 8:00 AM at latest, since it gets darker earlier in the evening.\n\n\nDegree of difficulty\nThe Norwegian Trekking Association classify the hike as \"challenging\", requiring good endurance as well as proper hiking boots and equipment.\n\n\nSafety\nThousands of tourists visit Trolltunga during the four summer months, a number which has greatly increased from 500 per year to 80,000 between 2009 and 2016. No safety railing has been constructed on the edge of the cliff so as not to harm the natural beauty of the cliff, although a few small metal hooks have been installed as footholds to climb down to the rock.\nOn 5 September 2015, a 24-year-old Australian woman fell to her death off Trolltunga. It is believed to be the first recorded death from a fall there.\nThere are widely publicised photos of people hanging off the cliff or doing a hand stand on it. Most often they are manipulated. The elite climber Magnus Midtbø suspended himself from Trolltunga wearing a safety harness, but a version where the rope was erased has been spread in media.\nThe approach to and retreat from Trolltunga is a demanding hike, and 10–12 hours are needed for the round trip. In later years there have been up to 40 rescue actions annually. Surprisingly not because of the dangerous cliff, but due to the demanding hike back to Tyssedal. People get lost in fog or get injured during the hike or do not have the endurance for such a demanding hike.\nThere are mountain guards that offer guidance to tourists on how to prepare and dress for the hike at Skjeggedal. They give advice and information, but are not able to actually prevent anyone from starting the hike. However, the number of rescue missions have drastically decreased after the addition of these mountain guards.\nIt is planned to build a lodge halfway between Trolltunga and Tyssedal, which will provide accommodation for hikers en route from Trolltunga.\n\n\nSurrounding landscape\nThe cliff overlooks the valleys of the Hardanger region. The mountains surrounding the cliff reach heights of up to 1500 meters. Some of the hilltops have plains which are interspersed with lakes. Patches of snow are present in some areas, even in the summer months. Due to heavy use by tourists, the trail to Trolltunga quickly turns to mud after a rain in the summer.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nA movie song called \"Amali thumali\" from the 2011 film Tamil language movie Ko (film) features the lead couples dancing on the top of the troll tongue rock formation at Trolltunga.\nA music video was filmed for Kygo's 2024 album named Kygo. The video features a grand piano helilifted to the top of the troll tongue rock formation, the Norwegian DJ controlling a digital mixer, electronic keyboard, and several featured artists singing atop the tongue.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\nBesseggen\nDe syv søstre\nInstagram tourism\nKjerag\nKjeragbolten\nList of waterfalls\nNational parks of Norway\nPreikestolen\nTrollgaren\nTrollpikken\nTrollveggen\nTrollstigen\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nTrolltunga.com Official site\nHiking Trolltunga from Odda Tourist Office\nAbout Trolltunga from Fjord Norway, the official tourist board of Western Norway\nTrolltunga Road Information about the toll road from Skjeggedal to Mågelitopp",

    "text": "Yurii Voronyi (also transliterated as Yurii Voronoy; 9 August 1895 – 13 May 1961) was a Ukrainian surgeon. He is known for having performed the first attempt to transplant an internal organ into a living person in 1933, although the recipient died soon after due to transplant rejection, and it took until Joseph E. Murray for a similar operation to be successful.\nBorn in Zhuravka, Voronyi was the son of mathematician Georgy Voronoy. In 1913, he entered the  Faculty of Medicine at the Kyiv Imperial University of St. Volodymyr, but interrupted his studies to work as a medic during World War I, and then was part of the Ukrainian People's Army. In 1921, he graduated from the re-named Kyiv Medical Institute, where he became a postgraduate student before going to Kharkiv in 1926 to study at Kharkiv National Medical University. This was the place where Voronyi likely became interested in blood transfusion and transplantation, after Serge Voronoff's experiments. In 1931, he moved to Kherson to work at the city hospital, where he performed the experiment in 1933. In 1936 he was transferred to Kharkiv, where he stayed at during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine until 1942, when he started worked as a medic and helping various Red Army units. He then settled in the Zhytomyr region in 1943, but was transferred again in 1950 to Kyiv, where he worked at until his death in 1961 at various institutes.\n\n\nEarly life\nVoronyi was born on 9 August 1895 in Zhuravka, which was located in the Poltava Governorate in the Russian Empire at the time of his birth. His parents were Olga Mytrofanivna (nee Krytska) and Georgy Voronoy, who was a mathematician who defined the Voronoi diagram. His grandfather, Feodosii Voronyi, was a philologist and professor at a Nizhyn lycée. Yurii also had three sisters and a brother, his brother Alexander was a surgeon who worked with the gastrointestinal tract.\nHe first studied at the Warsaw Gymnasium, learning German and Polish, but when his father died of kidney disease the family returned to the Russian Empire and he enrolled at the Pryluky Men's Gymnasium where he completed his studies.\n\n\nMedical career\nIn 1913, after graduating from the gymnasium, he entered the Faculty of Medicine of the Kyiv Imperial University of St. Volodymyr. However, soon after, his studies were interrupted by the First World War and he volunteered to work as a medic for the South-Western Regional Zemstvo Committee for sick and wounded soldiers and for the Red Cross. In 1917 he joined the Ukrainian People's Army. One of the battles he participated in, notably, during his time in the army was as part of a detachment of students during the Battle of Kruty on 16 January 1918, where he tried to stop incoming Russian forces led by Mikhail Artemyevich Muravyov, which was ultimately successful.\nIn 1921 after the war he graduated from St. Volodymyr, which was re-named to the Kyiv Medical Institute and became a postgraduate student in the institute's Department of Surgery. During his postgraduate years he did experimentation at a clinic, Kyiv City Clinical Hospital #18, under Oleksandr Chernyakhivsky in kidney transplantation. In 1923 he became an assistant at the Department of Surgey in Kyiv, and in 1926 he finished his postgraduate studies so he moved to Kharkiv to study under Volodymyr Shamov at the Kharkiv National Medical University. At the Kharkiv institute, he became interested in blood transfusion and testicular transplantation because of the department's interest in it due to a sudden uptake of interest after Serge Voronoff toured Europe stating that the transplantation of the testis from monkeys to humans was an anti-aging therapy. In 1930 at the All-Union Congress of Physiologists he demonstrated the work he had done at Kharkiv of a kidney transplant, which was attached to the right side of a dog's neck, and then later that key he demonstrated a kidney transplanted with a vascular structure under the skin of the neck.\nIn 1931 he then moved to Kherson to work as the chief physician at the hospital in the city, which allowed him to take on emergency surgical treatment. There he also became Director of the Kherson Evening Production Medical Institute where he trained doctors and was head of the Department of Topographic Anatomy.\n\n\nSurgery (1933)\nOn 3 April 1933 a 26-year-old woman came to the Kherson hospital with acute renal failure following the consumption of mercuric chloride after a suicide attempt. Previously, on 31 March 1933, a moribund patient had come to the hospital with a fracture in their skull's base.\nUnder the anesthetic procaine, Voronoy made an incision in the middle ventro-medial part of the right thigh of the 26-year-old, and prepared the blood vessels to connect them to the kidney. Vorony then removed the kidney from the donor, who had been dead for six hours at the time of removal, and kept the blood vessels intact and then his team placed the kidney into the thigh incision. He then connected the blood vessels of the kidney to the 26-year-old's thigh blood vessel using Carrel's method and routed the ureter through an opening in the thigh and was sutured. Capillary bleeding was observed in the visible part of the ureter, which demonstrated that the kidney was working, however urine production soon stopped after the end of the operation, although this was similar to what happened in his 1930 experiment with the dog. At first, Vorony noticed no particular signs of worry and some lucid urine came out of the ureter but two days after the end of the operation the patient started vomiting and convulsing and her condition significantly worsened. On 5 April 1933, at 9:40 p.m., the patient died 48 hours after the operation.\nThe attempt ended in failure because the kidney from a cadaver donor of B+ blood type was transplanted to the woman who had an O+ blood type, which violated the rules of tissue transfer and because at the time the donor had already been dead for six hours. However, this did made Voronyi the first person to have performed kidney allotransplantation, although his attempt was not successful and it took until Jean Hamburger for a similar attempt to be for a short time successful and until Joseph E. Murray for it to be long term.\n\n\nPost-1933\nIn 1934 he became a senior researcher of the All-Ukrainian Institute of Emergency Surgery and Blood Transfusion, and in 1935 was awarded with the degree Candidate of Medical Sciences. He was also elected to the Kherson City Council and became a delegate to the Odessa Regional Congress, but in 1936 was transferred by orders of the government to Kharkiv again. Upon moving to Kharkiv, he became head of the Department of Surgery of the Kharkiv Dental Institute until 1941.\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, in 1941 he was relieved from his position at the dental institute and was transferred to the Kharkiv City Health Department in occupied territory until it was burnt down in 1942. Afterward, from 1942 to 1943, he worked as the village doctor at Nova Vodolaha but was captured in February 1943 by the Germans after treating wounded soldiers from the 8th Guards Division. In December 1943, he escaped from captivity and went to help the 273rd Regiment in Yanushevichi in the Zhytomyr region and then was the Head of the Zhytomyr Regional hospital. He worked there until 1950 when he was transferred to be the Head of the Department of Experimental Surgery of the Institute of Experimental Biology and Pathology in Kyiv, and in 1952 was awarded with the degree of Doctor of Medical Sciences. From 1953 to 1961 he was then Head of the Department of Blood Substitutes at the Institute of Transfusion in Kyiv.\n\n\nPersonal life\nVoronyi was married to Vira Nechaivska (1895–1972), who was a member of the Central Rada from the Union of Ukrainian Women.\n\n\nDeath\nVoronyi died on 13 May 1961 in Kyiv, where he had been working. He was buried at Baikove Cemetery.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "Yurii Voronyi (also transliterated as Yurii Voronoy; 9 August 1895 – 13 May 1961) was a Ukrainian surgeon. He is known for having performed the first attempt to transplant an internal organ into a living person in 1933, although the recipient died soon after due to transplant rejection, and it took until Joseph E. Murray for a similar operation to be successful.\nBorn in Zhuravka, Voronyi was the son of mathematician Georgy Voronoy. In 1913, he entered the  Faculty of Medicine at the Kyiv Imperial University of St. Volodymyr, but interrupted his studies to work as a medic during World War I, and then was part of the Ukrainian People's Army. In 1921, he graduated from the re-named Kyiv Medical Institute, where he became a postgraduate student before going to Kharkiv in 1926 to study at Kharkiv National Medical University. This was the place where Voronyi likely became interested in blood transfusion and transplantation, after Serge Voronoff's experiments. In 1931, he moved to Kherson to work at the city hospital, where he performed the experiment in 1933. In 1936 he was transferred to Kharkiv, where he stayed at during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine until 1942, when he started worked as a medic and helping various Red Army units. He then settled in the Zhytomyr region in 1943, but was transferred again in 1950 to Kyiv, where he worked at until his death in 1961 at various institutes.",

    "text": "The Expanded Psionics Handbook is a sourcebook written by Bruce Cordell for the 3.5 edition of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game that contains rules and options for integrating psychic powers (also known as psionics) into the game. Along with its predecessor, the Psionics Handbook, the Expanded Psionics Handbook expands and adapts the psionics concept with a new emphasis on balance and playability.\n\n\nContents\nYour character’s mind is an infinite metaphorical plane, where all things are possible... A psionic character knows the mental pathways that lead to amazing edifices of thought and energy. Knowing the path, the psionic character walks it. Like a flare being thrown off a star, a power is manifested from a psionic character’s energy of consciousness.\nThe Expanded Psionics Handbook contains a system for adding psionics to Dungeons and Dragons. Psionics use a different system from traditional D&D spellcasting, using a point pool to track a character's power usage.\nThe Expanded Psionics Handbook introduces four Base Classes, several prestige classes alters some rules and includes a new system for becoming psionically focused.  The base classes are the psion and psychic warrior (both of which are reprints from the Psionics Handbook), the wilder, and the soulknife.  The prestige classes are the cerebremancer, elocater, fist of Zuoken, illithid slayer, metamind, psion uncarnate, pyrokineticist, thrallherd and the war mind.\nThe Handbook also contains four new psionic races—the dromites, elan, maenads, and xelphs—provides psionic versions of dwarves, githyanki, githzerai, and yuan-ti. It adds several new psionic monsters, including the intellect devourer and temporal filcher, and adds the phrenic template, which can make any Dungeons and Dragons creature a psionic creature.\n\n\nPublication history\nThe Expanded Psionics Handbook was published in 2004. Cover art was by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Brian Despain, Wayne England, Lars Grant-West, Heather Hudson, Jeremy Jarvis, Chuck Lukacs, David Martin, Monte Moore, Jim Pavelec, Wayne Reynolds, Arnie Swekel and Sam Wood.\nThis book is intended as a 3.5 adaptation and revision of the Psionics Handbook for 3rd Edition, which was released in 2001. It was adapted for several reasons, including changes to the core D20 system and balance concerns. Some players considered psions to be weaker than wizards and sorcerers.\n\n\nReception\nThe reviewer from Pyramid found the book's prestige classes \"more imaginative, with beings who leave their physical form behind for a life of mental existence, hunters who kill illithids, and the irresistibly heroic Fist of Zuoken\".\nOther reviewers, such as RPGnet, were less positive. Reviewer Jesse Heinig said, \"As an expansion for all manner of psionic-themed characters, the Complete Psionic book provides more depth and more unusual powers. Sadly, it lacks a little in breadth and some of its last-minute changes are evident around the frayed edges.\"\n\n\nReviews\nBackstab #48\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Operation Inherent Resolve",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=44120613",
    "text": "Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) is the United States military's operational name for the international war against the Islamic State (IS)—a group also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or its Arab acronym \"Daesh\"—including both a campaign in Iraq and a campaign in Syria, with a closely related campaign in Libya. Through 18 September 2018, the U.S. Army's III Armored Corps was responsible for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF—OIR) and were replaced by the XVIII Airborne Corps. The campaign is primarily waged by American and British forces in support of local allies, most prominently the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Combat ground troops, mostly special forces, infantry, and artillery have also been deployed, especially in Iraq. Of the airstrikes, 70% have been conducted by the military of the United States, 20% by the United Kingdom, and the remaining 10% being carried out by Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\nAccording to the Pentagon, by March 2019, the day of IS's territorial defeat in Syria, CJTF—OIR and its partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) of land and 7.7 million people from IS, the vast majority of the self-proclaimed caliphate's territory and subjects. By October 2017, around the time of IS's territorial defeat in Iraq, CJTF—OIR claimed that around 80,000 IS militants had been killed by it and its allies (excluding those targeted by Russian and Syrian air strikes). By the end of August 2019, it had conducted 34,573 strikes. Tens of thousands more were killed by partner forces on the ground (the SDF alone claimed to have killed 25,336 IS fighters by the end of 2017).\n\n\nBackground\nThe United States relied on a combination of legal frameworks to justify its use of force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, namely: military assistance on request, self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter, and the \"unwilling or unable\" doctrine. However, this legal reasoning was not unanimously accepted by other coalition members, resulting in differing geographic scopes of operation—some states restricted their involvement to Iraq, while others also conducted operations in Syria. Moreover, these justifications continue to be the subject of legal debate among scholars.\n\n\nLegal basis under international law\n\nInternational law prohibits the use of force against another state, as provided in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. However, there are two exceptions to 'violate' this legal prohibition, which is through authorisation of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as stated in Article 42 of the UN Charter, and in self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\n\nMilitary assistance on request\n\nMilitary assistance provided at the request of a state does not require UN authorisation nor the invocation of Article 51, as it falls within a state’s sovereign right under customary international law to request such assistance and does not necessarily entail the use of force. As such, it does not constitute a 'violation' of the prohibition on the use of force. However, in order to remain within the legal framework of military assistance—rather than constituting an intervention that breaches the prohibition on the use of force—the inviting state determines the scale and scope of the intervening force, as the operation's sole purpose is to provide assistance to the inviting sovereignty. Furthermore, the inviting state cannot legally authorise the use of force on foreign territory, as this would violate Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, therefore, military assistance on request is confined to the borders of the inviting state.\nIn 2014, the Iraqi government submitted two formal letters to the UNSC, requesting military assistance in response to the ongoing threat posed by ISIS along its borders. Several states participating in OIR acted solely on the basis of this request, thereby limiting their operations to Iraqi territory, as the Iraqi government had no legal authority to authorise military action on Syrian soil. By responding exclusively to Iraq’s request, the scale and scope of the foreign military presence was determined through agreements with the Iraqi authorities and remained confined within Iraq’s borders, despite ISIS maintaining a stronghold in eastern Syria. The Obama administration relied on this legal framework—military assistance upon request—to justify its operations within Iraq. However, as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had not granted consent for foreign military intervention, an alternative legal basis was required to justify military action against ISIS in Syria.\nAdditionally, scholars such as Ashley Deeks have argued that the U.S. tends to avoid relying on military assistance upon request as a legal framework, as such operations are entirely dependent on the level of consent granted by the inviting state and could require the U.S. to withdraw its forces should that state revoke its request.\n\n\nArticle 51: Individual or Collective Self-defence\n\nTo justify its operations within Syria, the United States invoked Article 51 of the UN Charter, citing the principle of collective self-defence on behalf of Iraq. This was based on the Iraqi government’s request for a U.S.-led international campaign against ISIS. Simultaneously, the United States also invoked the right of individual self-defence, referencing the threat posed by ISIS to its own national security.\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the \"inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations\". In 1986, during the Nicaraqua v. United States case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) spelled out several pre-conditions for the lawful invocation of Article 51:\n\nA state may only invoke individual self-defence if it has been the victim of an 'armed attack';\nCollective self-defence requires a victim state to declare itself as such and to formally request collective measures from other states;\nAny invocation of Article 51 must be reported to the UNSC.\nIn its letters to the UN Security Council, the Iraqi government formally requested military assistance in response to an armed attack against its sovereignty. Moreover, given that ISIS-controlled territory extended across a significant area spanning both Iraq and Syria, the Iraqi government argued that, in order to neutralise the threat posed by ISIS to Iraq, it was necessary to eradicate the group entirely—including through military operations on Syrian territory under ISIS control. Based on this request, in which Iraq declared itself a 'victim' of an armed attack, the Obama administration announced the invocation of collective self-defence on Iraq’s behalf against ISIS, via a letter submitted to the Security Council. By doing so, the necessary conditions for a lawful invocation of Article 51 were met.\nHowever, according to the ICJ, extraterritorial self-defensive operations against a non-state actor within the territory of a host state require the consent of that state’s government, unless the conduct of the non-state actor can be legally attributed to it. This condition was not fulfilled in the case of Syria, as President Assad was actively engaged in fighting ISIS and, moreover, had neither granted consent to the U.S. nor received any formal request to permit military operations on Syrian soil. Consequently, despite invoking Article 51, the Obama administration continued to face legal challenges in justifying its military actions against ISIS in Syria.\n\n\nUnwilling or unable doctrine\nTo address these legal challenges and justify its operations against ISIS in Syria, the United States, in its letter to the UNSC, also invoked the \"unwilling or unable\" doctrine. It accused the Syrian regime of both an inability and unwillingness to prevent ISIS from using Syrian territory to launch attacks against Iraq. According to the 'unwilling or unable' doctrine, a state has a responsibility to eliminate threats originating from within its borders. If it is deemed 'unable'—for instance, due to insufficient military capability—or 'unwilling', due to a lack of political will or action, the international community may assume the responsibility of neutralising the threat posed by non-state actors operating within the hosting state’s territory.\nHowever, although the 'unwilling or unable' doctrine was invoked by several states participating in OIR to justify their involvement, it remains without clear legal standing under international law. Moreover, some scholars have questioned the applicability of the term 'unwilling', noting that the Assad regime was actively engaged in combat against ISIS. Despite public expressions of willingness by the Syrian government to cooperate in efforts to defeat ISIS, the U.S. maintained that, due to the Assad regime’s failure to eliminate ISIS within Syrian territory, it was not obligated to seek permission for conducting military operations on Syrian soil.\nDespite these questions concerning its validity, the Obama administration used the ‘unwilling or unable’ doctrine to justify the military intervention against ISIS in Syria. By doing so, this doctrine became an extension of the invocation of self-defence by the U.S., to make self-defensive action in Syria justified as response to the armed attacks perpetrated by ISIS performed from Syrian soil.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n2014\n\nUnlike their coalition partners, and unlike previous combat operations, no name was initially given to the conflict against IS by the U.S. government. The decision to keep the conflict nameless drew considerable media criticism.\nThe U.S. decided in October 2014 to name its military efforts against IS as \"Operation Inherent Resolve\"; the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) news release announcing the name noted that:\n\nAccording to CENTCOM officials, the name INHERENT RESOLVE is intended to reflect the unwavering resolve and deep commitment of the U.S. and partner nations in the region and around the globe to eliminate the terrorist group ISIL and the threat they pose to Iraq, the region and the wider international community. It also symbolizes the willingness and dedication of coalition members to work closely with our friends in the region and apply all available dimensions of national power necessary—diplomatic, informational, military, economic—to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nThe US Defense Department announced at the end of October 2014 that troops operating in support of Operation Inherent Resolve after 15 June were eligible for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\nBy 4 December 2014, three U.S. service members had died from accidents or non-combat injuries.\n\n\n2015\nIn November 2015, Commodore Captain Augustus Bennett commanding the USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) Amphibious Ready Group entered the 5th Fleet AOR in conjunction with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit under the command of Colonel Robert Fulford, consisting of the, USS Arlington (LPD-24) and USS Oak Hill (LSD-51) to commence airstrikes on IS. Prior to this, the ARG rendezvoused with the Turkish Navy for Egemen 2015. They concluded their OIR mission on 10 March with a total of 130 sorties and 60 strikes.\n\nOn 22 October 2015, a U.S. Master Sergeant, Joshua Wheeler, was killed in action when he, with about 30 other U.S. special operations soldiers and a Peshmerga unit, conducted a prison break near Hawija in the disputed territories of Northern Iraq, in which about 70 hostages were rescued, five IS members were captured and \"a number\" were killed or wounded. Sergeant First Class Thomas Payne was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the operation. The Kurdistan Regional Government said after the raid that none of the 15 prisoners it was intended to rescue were found.\nFrom May, North American Rockwell OV-10 Broncos joined the operation, flying more than 120 combat sorties over 82 days. It is speculated they provided close air support for special forces missions. The experiment ended satisfactorily, but a US Air Force spokesman stated it remains unlikely they will invest in reactivating the OV-10 on a regular basis because of the overhead cost of operating an additional aircraft type.\n\n\n2016\n\nBy 9 March 2016, nearly 11,000 airstrikes had been launched on IS (and occasionally Al-Nusra), killing over 27,000 fighters and striking over 22,000 targets, including 139 tanks, 371 Humvees, and 1,216 pieces of oil infrastructure. Approximately 80% of these airstrikes have been conducted by American forces, with the remaining 20% being launched by other members of the coalition, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. 7,268 strikes hit targets in Iraq, while 3,602 hit targets in Syria. On 12 June 2016, it was reported that 120 IS leaders, commanders, propagandists, recruiters and other high-value individuals were killed so far this year.\nUntil March 2016, U.S. military members were ineligible for Campaign Medals and other service decorations due to the continuing ambiguous nature of the continuing U.S. involvement in Iraq. However, on 30 March 2016, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced the creation of a new medal, named \"Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal\".\nOn 3 June 2016, aircraft flying from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Mediterranean Sea began airstrikes on IS. On 16 June 2016, AV-8B II+ Harriers of the 13th MEU flying from the USS Boxer in the Persian Gulf also began airstrikes on IS, marking the first time the U.S. Navy used ship-based aircraft from both the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf at the same time during Operation Inherent Resolve.\nBy 27 July 2016, U.S. and coalition partners had conducted more than 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria: Nearly 11,000 of those strikes were from U.S. aircraft and the majority of the strikes (more than 9,000) were in Iraq. Of the 26,374 targets hit, nearly 8,000 were against IS fighting positions, while approximately 6,500 hit buildings; IS staging areas and oil infrastructure were each hit around 1,600 times. On 15 December 2016, the U.K. Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said that \"more than 25,000 Daesh fighters have now been killed,\" a number that was half of the United States' estimate. When asked about this discrepancy, the UK's Ministry of Defense said that it stood by his estimate.\nSince the first U.S. airstrikes on IS targets in Iraq on 8 August 2014, over two years, the U.S. military has spent over $8.4 billion fighting IS.\nBBC News reported in 2017 that according to the American think tank Council on Foreign Relations, in 2016 alone, the U.S. dropped 12,192 bombs in Syria and 12,095 in Iraq.\n\n\nOperation Odyssey Lightning\nFrom August to December 2016, the U.S. conducted another similar operation in Libya, code-named Operation Odyssey Lightning, during the battle to capture Sirte, which was the local capital of IS's Libyan branch. In September 2017, the US Africa Command announced that 495 precision airstrikes were carried out and 800 to 900 IS fighters were killed during the operation in Sirte between 1 August and 19 December 2016. On 18 January 2017, US B-2 bombers bombed two IS camps to the south of Sirte, killing ninety IS militants.\n\n\n2017\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Coalition airstrikes have killed 7,043 people across Syria, of which: 5,768 dead were IS fighters, 304 Al-Nusra Front militants and other rebels, 90 government soldiers and 881 civilians. The air strikes occurred in the period between 22 September 2014 and 23 January 2017.\nIn March 2017, various media outlets reported that conventional forces from the 11th MEU, as well as special operations forces in the form of the 75th Ranger Regiment deployed to Syria to support U.S.-backed forces in liberating Raqqa from IS occupation. The deployment marked an escalation in the U.S. intervention in Syria.\nBy 28 February, the Coalition had conducted 3,271 sorties in 2017, 2,129 of which resulted in at least one weapon released. In total, the coalition released 7,040 weapons in Iraq and Syria in this same time period in an effort to destroy IS.\nAs of 9 August 2017, coalition aircraft flew a total of 167,912 sorties, and conducted 13,331 strikes in Iraq and 11,235 strikes in Syria, for a total of 24,566 strikes.\n\n\n2018\n\nIn February 2018, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division was awarded a campaign streamer following its deployment to Iraq. In May 2016, the brigade deployed to advise and assist, train and equip Iraqi security forces to fight the Islamic State of Iraq. The 2nd Brigade also conducted precision surface-to-surface fires and supported a multitude of intelligence and logistical operations for coalition and Iraqi forces. They also provided base security throughout more than twelve areas of operations. The Brigade also aided in the clearance of IS from Fallujah, the near elimination of suicide attacks in Baghdad, and the introduction of improved tactics that liberated more than 100 towns and villages. The 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division also played a significant role in the liberation of Mosul.\n\n\n2019\n\nIn early 2019, the US-led coalition focused on the final assault on ISIS in the Euphrates pocket, including the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani in the first quarter of the year. Civilian human shields held by ISIS were among the victims, including in one reported massacre on 19 March in which up to 300 civilians, including 45 children, were alleged to have been killed by Coalition forces.\nFrom 8 August 2014, to 29 August 2019, coalition aircraft conducted a total of 34,573 strikes.\nOn 27 October 2019, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed during the Barisha raid in Idlib Governorate.\nOn 31 December 2019, the CJTF-OIR reported its forces were \"closely monitoring the current situation of the protests at the US Embassy in Baghdad\", adding that they were \"taking the appropriate force protection measures to ensure [US Embassy personnel] safety\".\n\n\n2020\n\nCJTF-OIR paused all training and anti-ISIS operations on 5 January 2020, to focus on protecting Iraqi bases hosting Coalition troops in the wake of several rocket attacks. This action was also linked to the anticipated response against Coalition forces in the wake of the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. In March 2020, the U.S. military started to withdraw from various bases in Iraq.\n\n\n2021\n\nOn 31 March 2021, Carrier Air Wing Three launched naval flight operations in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its carrier strike group were expected to lead Task Force 50, which oversees Operation Inherent Resolve's naval strike operations.\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2023\nOn 3 April, U.S. forces killed senior Islamic State leader Khalid 'Aydd Ahmad al-Jabouri, who was allegedly planning attacks in Europe during Easter, in an overnight drone strike on the outskirts of rebel-held town of Killi, Idlib in northwest Syria.\nOn 9 July, US Central Command announced that a U.S. MQ-9 drone which had been harassed by Russian aircraft for almost two hours had on 7 July killed an ISIS leader called Usamah al-Muhajir, who had been riding his motorcycle on the road linking al-Bab with Bizaah.\nOn 24 August, the U.S. Military stated that Major General Joel ‘JB’ Vowell had assumed command of anti-ISIS operation also known as Operation Inherent Resolve, from Major General Matthew McFarlane.\nOn 20 November, the United States Central Command has announced that, in the months of September and October, it has conducted, along with coalition and other partners, a total of 79 operations in Iraq and Syria resulting in 13 ISIS operatives killed and 78 detained.\n\n\n2024\nOn 30 August, United States Central Command reported that \"[U.S.] forces and Iraqi Security Forces conducted a partnered raid in Western Iraq in the early hours of Aug. 29, resulting in the death of 15 ISIS operatives.\" It was later confirmed that 7 U.S. troopers were injured during the operation.\nOn 31 December, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu reported that French forces had carried \"targeted strikes against Daech\" targets \"on Syrian soil\", dropping seven bombs on two targets on 29 December. Multiple planes and a drone executed the strike off from Prince Hassan Air Base in Jordania.\n\n\n2025\nOn 1 January 2025, an American man inspired by ISIS killed 15 people and injured 57 in a truck attack in New Orleans. On 9 January, the Islamic State, in the 477th issue of its weekly newsletter \"Al-Naba\", praised the attack and Jabbar himself, calling on other supporters to follow in his footsteps.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. ordered a consolidation of its forces in Syria under OIR, reducing troop numbers from about 2,000 to under 1,000 at selected bases, primarily in northeastern Syria.\nOn July 21, 2025, U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kevin C. Leahy officially transferred command of CJTF-OIR to Brig. Gen. Kevin J.

In addition, 200 U.S. soldiers would remain in eastern Syria near the oil fields, to prevent the Islamic State, Syrian government and Russian forces from advancing in the region. However, at least 600–900 U.S. Troops are expected to stay in Syria, in Al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor Governorates. In July 2020, the U.S. military built a new base including an airport, located between Um Kahif village and Tal Alu silos near Al-Yaarubiyah.\nOn 19 December 2024 the US government released a statement regarding the true size of the US presence to be 2000 troops.\n\n\nCasualties\n\nAccording to Airwars, in 2014 there were 63 incidents involving the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria in which there were civilian casualties, causing at least 160 civilian deaths. In 2015, there were 268 incidents and 708 deaths. In 2016, there were 483 incidents and 1,372 deaths. Civilian casualties peaked in 2017, with 1,841 incidents and at least 4,677 civilian deaths.\nAccording to Airwars, 1,472 civilians were killed by the U.S. air campaign in Iraq and Syria in March 2017 alone. On 17 March, a U.S.-led coalition airstrike in Mosul killed more than 200 civilians. Data compiled by Airwars shows that 229 strikes in Iraq and 878 strikes in Syria were carried out by Coalition forces in June 2017, killing an alleged total of 1,483 people. The reporting of 875 of those total alleged deaths is contested. In July 2017, Airwars recorded reports of an alleged 1,342 people were killed in Iraq and Syria by Coalition airstrikes. Of the allegations 812 were contested, and two were disproved.\nCasualty figures fell after the 2017 peak. According to Airwars, 2018 saw 192 incidents and 846 deaths; 2019 saw 72 incidents and 467 deaths. In 2019, the casualties were concentrated in the first quarter during the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani including an alleged massacre of civilian human shields on 19 March.\nBy 2020, Airwars had recorded a five-year total of 14,771 US-led Coalition strikes in Iraq and 19,829 in Syria and investigated 2,921 alleged civilian casualty incidents, estimating 8,259–13,135 civilian deaths, of whom around 2,000 were children, although the Coalition itself estimated just 1,377 or 1,417 civilian deaths.\nThe New York Times reported that efforts to minimize and count civilian deaths fell far short of the approach promised by the US military for its use of airstrikes in the war against IS. The newspaper reported that airstrikes against IS, as well as in the war in Afghanistan, was marked by \"flawed intelligence, poor targeting and thousands of civilian deaths.\" It also reported that efforts to minimize civilian casualties diminished after President Trump assumed office in 2017, stating \"... the authority to approve strikes was pushed further down the chain of command, even as an overwhelming majority of strikes were carried out in the heat of war, and not planned far in advance.\" Finally, the paper reported that the US military systematically under-reported casualties, providing a total death count of 1,417, when the actual count was significantly higher. The report states that the military made little effort to accurately determine civilian casualties after the airstrikes.  The military was also reluctant to divulge information about the casualties, in spite of promises of transparency, and news media were required to make numerous requests under the Freedom of Information Act, and had to repeatedly sue the US military to produce data.\n\n\nTalon Anvil\nDuring the years 2014 to 2019, an Air Force special operations group named Talon Anvil killed a significant number of non-combatant civilians, and often failed to follow US military protocols designed to minimize civilian casualties. In one particular strike, the March 2019 Baghuz airstrike, approximately 50 women and children were killed, and the Air Force subsequently covered the deaths up. The Talon Anvil group operated under the auspices of Task Force 9, which was the US military unit responsible for ground operations in the war against IS in Syria. The group consisted of about twenty plainclothes military personnel that operated out of anonymous office buildings in Iraq and Syria. In December 2021,  the US Secretary of Defense ordered an investigation into the civilian deaths caused by Talon Anvil's bombing strikes.\n\n\nSee also\nCombined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, commander headquarters of ongoing operations\nMilitary intervention against the Islamic State aerial order of battle\nGerman intervention against the Islamic State, also named Operation Counter Daesh, related German operations\nOpération Chammal, name for similar French operations\nOperation Impact, name for similar Canadian operations\nOperation Martyr Yalçın, name for similar Turkish operation against IS\nOperation Okra, name for similar Australian operations\nOperation Shader, name for similar British operations\nOperation Tidal Wave II, name of a suboperation against IS oil infrastructure\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBooks\n\nGordon, Michael R.

    "summary": "Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) is the United States military's operational name for the international war against the Islamic State (IS)—a group also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or its Arab acronym \"Daesh\"—including both a campaign in Iraq and a campaign in Syria, with a closely related campaign in Libya. Through 18 September 2018, the U.S. Army's III Armored Corps was responsible for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF—OIR) and were replaced by the XVIII Airborne Corps. The campaign is primarily waged by American and British forces in support of local allies, most prominently the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Combat ground troops, mostly special forces, infantry, and artillery have also been deployed, especially in Iraq. Of the airstrikes, 70% have been conducted by the military of the United States, 20% by the United Kingdom, and the remaining 10% being carried out by Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\nAccording to the Pentagon, by March 2019, the day of IS's territorial defeat in Syria, CJTF—OIR and its partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) of land and 7.7 million people from IS, the vast majority of the self-proclaimed caliphate's territory and subjects. By October 2017, around the time of IS's territorial defeat in Iraq, CJTF—OIR claimed that around 80,000 IS militants had been killed by it and its allies (excluding those targeted by Russian and Syrian air strikes). By the end of August 2019, it had conducted 34,573 strikes. Tens of thousands more were killed by partner forces on the ground (the SDF alone claimed to have killed 25,336 IS fighters by the end of 2017).",

    "title": "Great Plague of London",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=12286",
    "text": "The Great Plague of London, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was the most recent major epidemic of the bubonic plague to occur in England. It happened within the centuries-long Second Pandemic, a period of intermittent bubonic plague epidemics that originated in Central Asia in 1331 (the first year of the Black Death), and included related diseases such as pneumonic plague and septicemic plague, which lasted until 1750.\nThe Great Plague killed an estimated 100,000 people—almost a quarter of London's population—in 18 months. The plague was caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted to a human by the bite of a flea or louse.\nThe 1665–66 epidemic was on a much smaller scale than the earlier Black Death pandemic. It became known afterwards as the \"great\" plague mainly because it was the last widespread outbreak of bubonic plague in England during the 400-year Second Pandemic.\n\n\nLondon in 1665\n\nThe plague was endemic in 17th-century London, as it was in other European cities at the time. The disease periodically erupted into massive epidemics. There were 30,000 deaths due to the plague in 1603, 35,000 in 1625, 10,000 in 1636, and smaller numbers in other years.\nIn late 1664, a bright comet was seen in the sky, and the people of London became fearful, wondering what evil event it portended. London at that time was a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a city wall that had originally been built to keep out raiding bands, and, in the south, by the River Thames. There were gates in the wall at Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate, and the Thames was crossable at London Bridge. In the poorer parts of the city, filled with overcrowded tenements and garrets, hygiene was impossible to maintain. There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with animal droppings, rubbish and the slops thrown out of the houses; they were muddy and buzzing with flies in summer, and awash with sewage in winter. The City Corporation employed \"rakers\" to remove the worst of the filth, and it was transported to mounds outside the walls, where it accumulated and continued to decompose. The stench was overwhelming, and people walked around with handkerchiefs or nosegays pressed against their nostrils.\nSome of the city's necessities, such as coal, arrived by barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and pedestrians were crowded together, and the gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which it was difficult to progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. Those who were better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be drenched by water tossed up by wheeled vehicles, slops thrown into the street, or water pouring off overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from soap factories, breweries, iron smelters and about 15,000 households that were burning coal to heat their homes.\nOutside the city walls, shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation had sprung up, providing homes for the craftsmen and tradespeople who had flocked to the already overcrowded city. The government had tried to limit  the development of these \"suburbs\", but had failed: Over a quarter of a million people lived in them. When Royalists had fled the country during the Commonwealth, they had left many fine town houses vacant, and some immigrants to London had crowded into them, converting them into tenements that housed different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested.\nThe City of London proper was administered by the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen and the common councillors, but some parts of the greater metropolitan area were not legally part of the city. Some of these areas, both inside the City walls and outside its boundaries, had long been organised into districts of various sizes, called \"liberties\", that had historically been granted rights to self-government. (Many had originally been associated with the religious institutions that were abolished in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, whereupon their historic rights and property had been transferred to secular owners.)\nBy 1665, the walled City was surrounded by a ring of liberties which had come under its authority, and these had come to be referred to collectively as 'the City and Liberties'. However, this area was surrounded by additional suburbs with other independent administrations. For example, Westminster was an independent town with its own liberties, joined to London by urban development, and the Tower of London was an independent liberty. Areas that were not part of any of these various independent administrations came under the authority of the county of Middlesex if they were north of the river, and under the authority of Surrey if they were south of the river.\nAt that time, bubonic plague was a much feared disease, but its cause was not understood. Many mistakenly blamed emanations from the earth, \"pestilential effluvia\", unusual weather, sickness in livestock, abnormal behaviour of animals or an increase in the numbers of moles, frogs, mice or flies. It was not until 1894 that its causal agent, the bacterium Yersinia pestis, was identified by Alexandre Yersin, and its transmission by rat fleas became known. Although the Great Plague in London was long assumed to be bubonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, this was only confirmed (by DNA analysis) in 2016. It is now believed that human body lice also played a key role in causing infections, perhaps more so than rats.\n\n\nThe recording of deaths\n\nIn order to judge the severity of an epidemic, it is first necessary to know how big the population was in which it occurred.  There was no official census of the population to provide this figure, and the best contemporary count comes from the work of John Graunt (1620–1674), who was one of the earliest Fellows of the Royal Society and one of the first demographers, bringing a scientific approach to the collection of statistics. In 1662, he estimated that 384,000 people lived in the City of London, the Liberties, Westminster and the out-parishes, based on figures in the Bills of Mortality published each week in the capital. These different districts with different administrations constituted the officially recognized extent of London as a whole. In 1665, he revised his estimate to \"not above 460,000\". Other contemporaries put the figure higher (the French Ambassador, for example, suggested 600,000), but with no mathematical basis to support their estimates. The next largest city in the kingdom was Norwich, with a population of 30,000.\nThere was no duty to report a death to anyone in authority. Instead, each parish appointed two or more \"searchers of the dead\", whose duty was to inspect a corpse and determine the cause of death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might know little about identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty. Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as Quakers, Anabaptists, other non-Anglican Christians or Jews, frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart from the community, avoid other people and carry a white stick to warn of their occupation when outdoors, and stay indoors except when performing their duties, to avoid spreading the diseases. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern. The reported figures were used to compile the Bills of Mortality, which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by the plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.\nGraunt recorded the incompetence of the Searchers at identifying true causes of death, remarking on the frequent recording of 'consumption' rather than other diseases which were recognized then by physicians. He suggested a cup of ale and a doubling of their fee to two groats rather than one was sufficient for Searchers to change the cause of death to one more convenient for the householders. No one wished to be known as having had a death by plague in their household, and Parish Clerks, too, connived in covering up cases of plague in their official returns. Analysis of the Bills of Mortality during the months plague took hold shows a rise in deaths other than by plague well above the average death rate, a tell-tale sign of misrepresentation of the true cause of death. As plague spread, a system of quarantine was introduced, whereby any house where someone had died from plague would be locked up and no one allowed to enter or leave for 40 days. This frequently led to the deaths of the other inhabitants, by neglect if not from the plague, and provided ample incentive not to report the disease. The official returns record 68,596 cases of plague, but a reasonable estimate suggests this figure is 30,000 short of the true total. A plague house was marked with a red cross on the door with the words \"Lord have mercy upon us\", and a watchman stood guard outside.\n\n\nPreventive measures\nReports of plague around Europe began to reach England in the 1660s, causing the Privy Council to consider what steps might be taken to prevent it crossing to England. Quarantining (isolation) of ships had been used during previous outbreaks and was again introduced for ships coming to London in November 1663, following outbreaks in Amsterdam and Hamburg. Two naval ships were assigned to intercept any vessels entering the Thames estuary. Ships from infected ports were required to moor at Hole Haven on Canvey Island for a trentine – period of 30 days – before being allowed to travel up-river. Ships from ports free of plague or completing their isolation period were given a certificate of health and allowed to travel on. A second inspection line was established between the forts on opposite banks of the Thames at Tilbury and Gravesend with instructions to pass only ships with a certificate.\nThe isolation period was increased to forty days – a quarantine – in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to quarantine changed with the news of the spread of plague to include all of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland (all regions of the Dutch Republic); restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, starting with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it had been one of the last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days of quarantine.\n\n\nOutbreak\n\nPlague was one of the hazards of life in Britain from its dramatic appearance in 1348 with the Black Death. The Bills of Mortality began to be published regularly in 1603, in which year 33,347 deaths were recorded from plague. Between then and 1665, only four years had no recorded cases. In 1563, a thousand people were reportedly dying in London each week. In 1593, there were 15,003 deaths, 1625 saw 41,313 dead, between 1640 and 1646 came 11,000 deaths, culminating in 3,597 for 1647. The 1625 outbreak was recorded at the time as the 'Great Plague', until deaths from the plague of 1665 surpassed it. These official figures are likely to under-report actual numbers.\n\n\nEarly days\n\nPlague was sufficiently uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as doctors, to charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664–65, some of which were fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it may be that the cold weather held back its spread.\nThis outbreak of bubonic plague in England is thought to have spread from the Netherlands, where the disease had been occurring intermittently since 1599. It is unclear exactly where the disease first struck but the initial contagion may have arrived with Dutch trading ships carrying bales of cotton from Amsterdam, which was ravaged by the disease in 1663–64, with a mortality given of 50,000. The first areas to be struck are believed to be the dock areas just outside London, and the parish of St Giles. In both of these localities, poor workers were crowded into ill-kept structures. Two suspicious deaths were recorded in St Giles parish in 1664 and another in February 1665. These did not appear as plague deaths on the Bills of Mortality, so no control measures were taken by the authorities, but the total number of people dying in London during the first four months of 1665 showed a marked increase. By the end of April, only four plague deaths had been recorded, two in the parish of St. Giles, but total deaths per week had risen from around 290 to 398.\nThere had been three official cases in April, a level of plague which in earlier years had not induced any official response, but the Privy Council now acted to introduce household quarantine. Justices of the Peace in Middlesex were instructed to investigate any suspected cases and to shut up the house if it was confirmed. Shortly after, a similar order was issued by the King's Bench to the City and Liberties. A riot broke out in St. Giles when the first house was sealed up; the crowd broke down the door and released the inhabitants. Rioters caught were punished severely. Instructions were given to build pest-houses, which were essentially isolation hospitals built away from other people where the sick could be cared for (or stay until they died). This official activity suggests that despite the few recorded cases, the government was already aware that this was a serious outbreak of plague.\n\nWith the arrival of warmer weather, the disease began to take a firmer hold. In the week 2–9 May, there were three recorded deaths in the parish of St Giles, four in neighbouring St Clement Danes and one each in St Andrew Holborn and St Mary Woolchurch Haw. Only the last was actually inside the city walls. A Privy Council committee was formed to investigate methods to best prevent the spread of plague, and measures were introduced to close some of the ale houses in affected areas and limit the number of lodgers allowed in a household. In the city, the Lord Mayor issued a proclamation that all householders must diligently clean the streets outside their property, which was a householder's responsibility, not a state one (the city employed scavengers and rakers to remove the worst of the mess). Matters just became worse, and Aldermen were instructed to find and punish those failing their duty. As cases in St. Giles began to rise, an attempt was made to quarantine the area and constables were instructed to inspect everyone wishing to travel and contain inside vagrants or suspect persons.\nPeople began to be alarmed. Samuel Pepys, who had an important position at the Admiralty, stayed in London and provided a contemporary account of the plague through his diary. On 30 April he wrote: \"Great fears of the sickness here in the City it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!\" Another source of information on the time is A Journal of the Plague Year, which was  written by Daniel Defoe and published in 1722. He had been only five when the plague struck but made use of his family's recollections (his uncle was a saddler in East London and his father a butcher in Cripplegate), interviews with survivors and sight of such official records as were available.\n\nThe onset of the disease was recalled two years later by Puritan minister Thomas Vincent:It was in the month of May that the Plague was first taken notice of; our Bill of Mortality did let us know but of three which died of the disease in the whole year before; but in the beginning of May the bill tells us of nine...fear quickly begins to creep upon peoples hearts; great thoughts and discourse there is in Town about the Plague, and they cast in their minds whether they should go if the Plague should increase. Yet when the next weeks Bill signifieth to them the disease from nine to three their minds are something appeased; discourse of that subject cools; fears are hushed, and hopes take place, that the black cloud did but threaten, and give a few drops; but the wind would drive it away. But when in the next Bill the number of the dead by the Plague is mounted from three to fourteen, and in the next to seventeen, and in the next to forty-three, and the disease begins so much to increase, and disperse. Now secure sinners begin to be startled, and those who would have slept at quiet still in their nests, are unwillingly awakened.\n\n\nExodus from the city\n\nBy July 1665, plague was rampant in the City of London. The rich ran away, including King Charles II of England, his family and his court, who left the city for Salisbury, moving on to Oxford in September when some cases of plague occurred in Salisbury. The aldermen and most of the other city authorities opted to stay at their posts. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Lawrence, also decided to stay in the city. Businesses were closed when merchants and professionals fled. Defoe wrote \"Nothing was to be seen but wagons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, coaches filled with people of the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away\". As the plague raged throughout the summer, only a small number of clergymen, physicians and apothecaries remained to cope with an increasingly large number of victims. Ellen Cotes, author of London's Dreadful Visitation, expressed the hope that \"Neither the Physicians of our Souls or Bodies may hereafter in such great numbers forsake us\".\nThe poorer people were also alarmed by the contagion and some left the city, but it was not easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and dehydration in the hot summer that was to follow.\n\n\nHeight of the epidemic\n\nIn the last week of July, the London Bill of Mortality showed 3,014 deaths, of which 2,020 had died from the plague. The number of deaths as a result of plague may have been underestimated, as deaths in other years in the same period were much lower, at around 300. As the number of victims affected mounted up, burial grounds became overfull, and pits were dug to accommodate the dead. Drivers of dead-carts travelled the streets calling \"Bring out your dead\" and carted away piles of bodies. The authorities became concerned that the number of deaths might cause public alarm and ordered that body removal and interment should take place only at night. As time went on, there were too many victims, and too few drivers, to remove the bodies which began to be stacked up against the walls of houses. Daytime collection was resumed and the plague pits became mounds of decomposing corpses. In the parish of Aldgate, a great hole was dug near the churchyard, fifty feet long and twenty feet wide. Digging was continued by labourers at one end while the dead-carts tipped in corpses at the other. When there was no room for further extension it was dug deeper until ground water was reached at twenty feet. When finally covered with earth it housed 1,114 corpses.\nPlague doctors traversed the streets diagnosing victims, many of them without formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, bodies were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have extended the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in the hope that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.\n\nTrade and business had dried up, and the streets were empty of people except for the dead-carts and the dying victims, as witnessed and recorded by Samuel Pepys in his diary: \"Lord! How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets full of sores… in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead.\" That people did not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the Corporation of London who arranged for a commission of one farthing to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London. Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in a bucket of vinegar to \"disinfect\" the coins.\nRecords state that plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept up over the summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures are likely to be a considerable underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.\n\nVincent wrote:it was very dismal to behold the red crosses, and read in great letters \"LORD, HAVE MERCY UPON US\" on the doors, and watchmen standing before them with halberds...people passing by them so gingerly, and with such fearful looks as if they had been lined with enemies in ambush to destroy them...a man at the corner of Artillery-wall, that as I judge, through the dizziness of his head with the disease, which seized upon him there, had dasht his face against the wall; and when I came by, he lay hanging with his bloody face over the rails, and bleeding upon the ground...I went and spoke to him; he could make no answer, but rattled in the throat, and as I was informed, within half an hour died in the place. It would be endless to speak of what we have seen and heard, of some in their frenzy, rising out of their  beds, and leaping about their rooms; others crying and roaring at their windows; some coming forth almost naked, and running into the streets...scarcely a day passed over my head for, I think, a month or more together, but I should hear of the death of some one or more that I knew. The first day that they were smitten, the next day some hopes of recovery, and the third day, that they were dead.\nThe outbreak was concentrated in London, but it affected other areas as well. Perhaps the best known example occurred in the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas, but around 33% of the village's inhabitants died over a period of fourteen months. Other places hit hard included Derby and Norwich. In Bristol strenuous efforts by the City Council seems to have limited the death rate to c.0.6 per cent during an outbreak lasting from April to September 1666.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nBy late autumn, the death toll in London and the suburbs began to slow until, in February 1666, it was considered safe enough for the King and his entourage to come back to the city. With the return of the monarch, others began to return: The gentry returned in their carriages accompanied by carts piled high with their belongings. The judges moved back from Windsor to sit in Westminster Hall; Parliament, which had been prorogued in April 1665, did not reconvene until September 1666. Trade recommenced and businesses and workshops opened up. London was the goal of a new wave of people who flocked to the city in expectation of making their fortunes. Writing at the end of March 1666, Lord Clarendon, the Lord Chancellor, stated \"... the streets were as full, the Exchange as much crowded, the people in all places as numerous as they had ever been seen ...\".\nPlague cases continued to occur sporadically at a modest rate until mid-1666. That September, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire put an end to the epidemic. It is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. Most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London that was destroyed by the fire.\nAccording to the Bills of Mortality, there were in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon estimated that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. 1666 saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albemarle, both of whom had stayed in London for the whole of the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000. Among the more notable death victims were Samuel Fisher, John Godwin, John Lewger and George Starkey.\nThe Great Plague of 1665/1666 was the most recent major outbreak of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten per cent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the west of England and areas of the English Midlands escaped altogether.\nThe population of England in 1650 was approximately 5.25 million, which declined to about 4.9 million by 1680, recovering to just over 5 million by 1700. Other diseases, such as smallpox, took a high toll on the population without the contribution by plague. The higher death rate in cities, both generally and specifically from the plague, was made up by continuous immigration, from small towns to larger ones and from the countryside to the towns.\nThere were no contemporary censuses of London's population, but available records suggest that the population returned to its previous level within a couple of years.  Burials in 1667 had returned to 1663 levels, Hearth Tax returns had recovered, and John Graunt contemporarily analysed baptism records and concluded they represented a recovered population. Part of this could be accounted for by the return of wealthy households, merchants and manufacturing industries, all of which needed to replace losses among their staff and took steps to bring in necessary people. Colchester had suffered more severe depopulation, but manufacturing records for cloth suggested that production had recovered or even increased by 1669, and the total population had nearly returned to pre-plague levels by 1674. Other towns did less well: Ipswich was affected less than Colchester, but in 1674, its population had dropped by 18%, more than could be accounted for by the plague deaths alone.\nAs a proportion of the population who died, the London death toll was less severe than in some other towns. The total of deaths in London was greater than in any previous outbreak for 100 years, though as a proportion of the population, the epidemics in 1563, 1603 and 1625 were comparable or greater. Perhaps around 2.5% of the English population died.\n\n\nImpact\n\nThe plague in London largely affected the poor, as the rich were able to leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin in other parts of the country. The subsequent Great Fire of London ruined many city merchants and property owners. As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666. The street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, but some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became a healthier environment in which to live. Londoners had a greater sense of community after they had overcome the great adversities of 1665 and 1666.\nRebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. The architect Sir Christopher Wren was involved in the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral and more than fifty London churches. King Charles II did much to foster the rebuilding work. He was a patron of the arts and sciences and founded the Royal Observatory and supported the Royal Society, a scientific group whose early members included Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, out of the fire and pestilence flowed a renaissance in the arts and sciences in England.\nPlague pits have been archaeologically excavated during underground construction work. Between 2011 and 2015, 3,500 burials from the 'New Churchyard' or 'Bethlam burial ground' were discovered during the construction of the Crossrail railway at Liverpool Street.  Yersinia pestis DNA was found in the teeth of individuals found buried in pits at the site, confirming they had died of bubonic plague.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nArnold, Catherine (2006).

    "summary": "The Great Plague of London, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was the most recent major epidemic of the bubonic plague to occur in England. It happened within the centuries-long Second Pandemic, a period of intermittent bubonic plague epidemics that originated in Central Asia in 1331 (the first year of the Black Death), and included related diseases such as pneumonic plague and septicemic plague, which lasted until 1750.\nThe Great Plague killed an estimated 100,000 people—almost a quarter of London's population—in 18 months. The plague was caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted to a human by the bite of a flea or louse.\nThe 1665–66 epidemic was on a much smaller scale than the earlier Black Death pandemic. It became known afterwards as the \"great\" plague mainly because it was the last widespread outbreak of bubonic plague in England during the 400-year Second Pandemic.",

Editors at Pitchfork scored this release 7.0 out of 10 and critic Nick Nyland characterized it as \"a series of question marks and false trails, driven by music caught up in the divide between simple and complex gestures\" that \"takes introspection as a starting point and sees how many shades of black it can bash out of it\".

    "text": "George Botsford (February 24, 1874 – February 1, 1949) was an American composer of ragtime and other forms of music.\n\n\nEarly life and education\n\nBotsford was born in Sioux Falls, Dakota Territory. He grew up mostly in Clermont, Iowa. Botsford married singer Della Mae Wilson, and, in 1900, they began touring with the Hoyle Stock Company troupe. An ad promoting Botsford and his wife as musicians appeared in the New York Clipper in 1901, which may indicate the first time that Botsford visited New York City.\n\n\nCareer\nBotsford's first copyrighted number was \"The Katy Flyer\", published in 1899 in Centerville, Iowa. Other early numbers followed themes of relaxation and wide open space, with \"Dance of the Water Nymphs\", which was sold as Hawaiian mood music, and Western-themed \"In Dear Old Arizona\" and \"Pride of the Prairie\". This would change when Botsford moved to New York City, where he joined an assortment of Tin Pan Alley composers and began writing ragtime almost exclusively.\nBotsford secured his first songwriting contract with New York's J. H. Remick & Co. after selling them \"Pride of the Prairie\". It was while on that contract that he published \"Black and White Rag\", which stands as perhaps the most known work of his career. He was put in charge of vocal arrangements for Remick's \"harmony & quartet\" division in 1910. \nBotsford was a founding member of ASCAP in 1914. From 1914 to 1915, he experimented with miniature opera intended to be sung by three or four people, but the idea never gained momentum. \n\n\nLater life and death\nBy the 1920s, Botsford had largely stopped composing, and mostly made his living through organizing vaudeville performances. He produced a handful of musical shows for stage and radio. His last known public performance was at the Algonquin Hotel in 1934. After a long career involving many kinds of music, Botsford died in New York on February 1, 1949, twenty-three days before his 75th birthday.\n\n\nLegacy\n\n\"Pride of the Prairie\" is a prime example of Tin Pan Alley's response to the rising popularity of cowboy music. Many western-themed songs were being released by New York ragtime composers at the time, but Prairie would become a part of the era's folk music catalogue, eventually being recorded by numerous country and folk acts including Aaron Campbell's Mountaineers, Tex Owens, and Patsy Montana.\n\"Black and White Rag\" sold over 200,000 copies in 1908, and eventually topped one million copies sold. The song was recorded by numerous artists, but most notably by Winifred Atwell, whose 1953 recording became a gold record and was used as the theme of the long-running BBC2 snooker tournament show, \"Pot Black\". The song was also used as theme music for the 1985 video game Repton.\n\"Grizzly Bear Rag\" initially saw moderate success, but jumped in popularity when Irving Berlin composed lyrics for it. The song was recorded under titles including Dance of the Grizzly Bear and Doin' the Grizzly Bear, and helped spark a trend of naming dances after animals; the most notable example of this being the foxtrot.\n\"Sailing Down the Chesapeake Bay\" became very popular in its time, and was recorded later by Bing Crosby for his 1975 album, A Southern Memoir.\n\n\nCompositions\n\n\nSee also\nList of ragtime composers\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nFree scores by George Botsford at the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)\naudio recording of \"Eskimo Rag\" at the Library of Congress jukebox",

He is the founder and chairman of Panda Restaurant Group, based in Rosemead, California. He is the co-founder and co-chief executive officer (co-CEO) of Panda Express. The Cherngs invest out of their family office, the Cherng Family Trust. As of February 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$4 billion, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nCherng was born in April 1948 in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, Republic of China on the northern bank of the Yangtze River. His father was Ming-Tsai Cherng, a chef.\nHe and his family moved to Taiwan after the Kuomintang was defeated on mainland China at the end of the Chinese Civil War, and in 1963, his family moved to Yokohama, Japan, where his father had taken a job as a chef.\nIn 1966, at age 18, he immigrated to the United States to study at an American university. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1970 from Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas, and a master's degree in applied mathematics from the University of Missouri in 1972. At Baker, he had met his future wife, Peggy Tsiang, born in Burma and raised in Hong Kong, who went on to earn a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1971 and a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri.\n\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1972, he moved to the Los Angeles area to help his cousin run a restaurant called Ting Ho. After a few months, he found a restaurant in Pasadena to take over.\nIn June 1973, along with his father Ming-Tsai Cherng, they took over a restaurant and started a new Chinese restaurant called Panda Inn in Pasadena, California on Foothill Boulevard, using funds from the family and a Small Business Administration loan. It opened on June 8, 1973. The cuisine was more general Chinese than the Cantonese usually found in the area.\nIn 1983, Andrew Cherng opened the first Panda Express, a fast food restaurant, at the newly opened Glendale Galleria II mall in Glendale, California.  He had been prompted to start the spin off by the developer of the mall who had eaten at Panda Inn and invited Cherng to take a place at the food court.\nThe company had expanded to 100 restaurants by 1993, with the opening of an outlet at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nCherng has stated a preference for keeping the company closely held. However, in 2006 he told USA Today if the company could get a valuation close to that of Chipotle Mexican Grill, he might reconsider his stance. However, in an interview with The Seattle Times newspaper in 2008, he said he would not be interested in making the company public, saying they did not need the money and citing concerns with the trouble and expense of dealing with shareholders.\nThe Cherngs have since invested heavily in new restaurant concepts such as Just Salad, YakiYan, Ippudo, and Pieology.\nIn 2018, it was announced that the Cherng Family Trust purchased the former Mandarin Oriental hotel on the Las Vegas Strip and rebranded it as a Waldorf Astoria. The total acquisition price for the property was $214 million.\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn February 2011, the Cherngs donated $2.5 million to support the Collins College of Hospitality Management at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.\nIn March 2017, the California Institute of Technology announced that they were changing the name of its medical engineering department to the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering after receiving a $30 million gift from Andrew and Peggy Cherng. In the following month, the University of Missouri announced receiving a $1.5 million gift from the Cherngs which would benefit its Honors College.\nThe Cherngs donated $100 million to City of Hope in 2023 to advance cancer care that integrates Eastern and Western healing methods. It was the \"single largest gift for cancer care\" received by the Duarte-based center.\nIn February 2025, the Cherngs donated $17 million through the Cherng Family Trust to St. Rose Dominican Hospital – Siena Campus in Henderson, Nevada. This contribution, the largest single gift in the hospital's 87‑year history, enabled the institution to acquire an 88,000‑square‑foot building originally constructed in 2000 and previously managed by a real estate investment trust. Renamed the Cherng Family Medical Building, the facility is set to house ancillary services and medical offices, as part of an expansion initiative aimed at enhancing cancer, trauma, and pediatric care services. This donation forms part of a broader philanthropic portfolio, with the Cherng family having contributed approximately $400 million to healthcare initiatives over several decades.\n\n\nPersonal life\nCherng married Peggy Tsiang in 1975. They have three daughters. Two of their daughters, Andrea and Nicole, work for the Panda company in its corporate headquarters in Rosemead.\nIn 2015, it was reported that he and his wife had invested $15.2 million in a beachfront property and home in Honolulu. In 2018, the couple purchased a mansion in Henderson, Nevada.\n\n\nHonors\nSince 2010, Cherng has been a member of the Committee of 100, an international, non-profit, non-partisan membership organization that brings a Chinese American perspective to issues concerning Asian Americans and U.S.-China relations.\nIn 2008, Cherng was listed in Forbes' Twenty-Five Notable Chinese-Americans.\nIn 2008, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona conferred Cherng with an honorary doctorate.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCommittee of 100 Member Roster",

    "text": "Juan Francisco Secada Ramírez (born October 4, 1961), better known as Jon Secada, is a Cuban-born American singer. He has won two Grammy Awards and sold 15 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. His music fuses funk, soul music, pop, and Latin percussion.\nSecada has written songs for Gloria Estefan, Ricky Martin, and Jennifer Lopez. He has toured with Luciano Pavarotti and recorded duets with Jim Brickman, Olivia Newton-John, and Frank Sinatra.\nSecada has performed several times at A Capitol Fourth, an annual Independence Day concert from the United States Capitol.\n\n\nEarly life\nSecada was born in 1961 in Havana, Cuba. Secada's father, José, was incarcerated for three years as a political prisoner by the communist Cuban government. In 1971, the Secadas received permission to emigrate and moved to Miami. His parents opened a coffee shop. Secada was raised in Hialeah, Florida.\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1979, Secada graduated from Hialeah Senior High School in Hialeah, Florida. During his performance of A Christmas Carol in 11th grade, he says he realized his musical potential and was encouraged by teachers to pursue music as a career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Secada attended the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, where he received a Bachelor of Music in 1983 and a Master of Music in jazz vocal performance in 1986. He graduated cum laude and was later inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest honor bestowed by the University of Miami.\n\n\nCareer\n\nFrom 1986 to 1991, Secada was a teacher at Miami Dade College. \nIn 1986, Secada's University of Miami acquaintances introduced him to Emilio Estefan, a musician in Miami Sound Machine and husband of Gloria Estefan. Estefan listened to one of Secada's demos and then became Secada's mentor and manager. This led to Secada becoming a backup singer for Miami Sound Machine.\nIn 1991, Secada co-wrote and was a backup singer for \"Coming Out of the Dark\", a number-one hit song inspired by a tour-bus accident involving Gloria Estefan in 1990, in which her back was broken. In 1992, he released his self-titled debut album, which sold 7 million copies. In 1994, he performed a duet with Frank Sinatra, a re-recording of \"The Best Is Yet to Come\", released on Sinatra's album Duets II. He also performed at the awards for Miss Venezuela 1994. In 1995, he performed on Broadway in Grease, and he also presented at the 49th Tony Awards. He also recorded \"If I Never Knew You\", a duet with Shanice for Pocahontas. In 1999, he co-wrote and co-produced \"She's All I Ever Had\" for Ricky Martin.\nIn 2003, he performed in Cabaret. He also co-wrote \"Juramento\" for Ricky Martin. From 2006 to 2009, Secada was a judge on Latin American Idol. In 2007, he co-wrote three songs, and performed in one, on Lilian Garcia's album ¡Quiero Vivir!.\nIn 2017, he released a tribute album with cover versions of songs by Benny Moré.\nIn January 2025, Secada began teaching at the Wertheim School of Music of Florida International University.\n\n\nPersonal life\nFrom 1988 to 1993, Secada was married to Jo Pat Cafro. In May 1995, he started dating Maritere Vilar. They were married in February 1997 and have two children.\nSecada resides in a 7,284 square-foot house, with a tennis court and pool, a few blocks west of the University of Miami, his alma mater, in Coral Gables, Florida.\nSecada has created the Jon Secada Music Scholarship at the University of Miami, raised funds for The Recording Academy's effort \"Keeping Music in Schools\", and supports many initiatives including the Pediatric AIDS Unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nJon Secada (1992)\nOtro Día Más Sin Verte (1992)\nHeart, Soul & a Voice (1994)\nSi Te Vas (1994)\nAmor (1995)\nSecada (1997)\nBetter Part of Me (2000)\nThe Gift (2001)\nAmanecer (2002)\nSame Dream (2005)\nA Christmas Fiesta/Una Fiesta Navideña (2007)\nExpressions (2009)\nClassics/Clasicos (2010)\nOtra Vez (2011)\nTo Beny Moré with Love (2017)\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nTelevision series\nAlice's Wonderland Bakery as King of Hearts\n\n\nSee also\nList of best-selling Latin music artists\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nJon Secada at IMDb",

    "text": "Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (  SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio album, OnlySee, in Australia. Sia moved to London and provided vocals for the British duo Zero 7. She released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, in 2001 and her third, Colour the Small One, in 2004.\nSia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, she took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"Titanium\" (with David Guetta), \"Diamonds\" (for Rihanna), \"Wild Ones\" (with Flo Rida) and \"Pretty Hurts\" (for Beyoncé).\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten single \"Chandelier\" and a trilogy of music videos she co-directed, starring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy. Her seventh studio album, This Is Acting (2016), included her first Billboard Hot 100 number one single, \"Cheap Thrills\". In 2016 she also began her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Sia's eighth studio album, Everyday Is Christmas, was released in 2017. In 2019, Labrinth, Sia and Diplo released an album, LSD. Sia has written many songs for films. She released her feature film directorial debut, Music, in 2021 to generally negative reviews, alongside an album, Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture. Her tenth album, Reasonable Woman, was released in May 2024.\nSia is an advocate for animal rights. Among her accolades are ten ARIA Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and nine Grammy Award nominations.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in Adelaide, South Australia. Her father, Phil Colson, is a guitarist, and her mother, Loene Furler, is an art lecturer. She is the niece of actor Kevin Colson. At age 12, Sia stayed with family friend Colin Hay in New York City for a month, during which Hay attended the Grammy Awards. She cites watching the ceremony from his limousine as inspiration to pursue a music career. As a child, Sia imitated the performing style of Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Sting, and has cited them, in addition to Hay, as early influences. She attended Adelaide High School.\n\n\nCareer\nIn the mid-1990s, Sia started a career as a singer in the local acid jazz band Crisp. Sia collaborated with the band and contributed vocals to their album Word and the Deal (1996) and EP Delirium (1997).\nIn 1997 Crisp disbanded, and Sia released her debut studio album, OnlySee, on Flavoured Records, in Australia, on 23 December. The album sold about 1,200 copies. Unlike her later albums, OnlySee was marketed under her full name, \"Sia Furler\". It was produced, and the songs were mostly written, by Jesse Flavell, with Sia co-writing or writing six tracks.\n\n\n1997–2006: Zero 7, Healing Is Difficult and Colour the Small One\n\nAfter Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London, where she performed as a background vocalist for British band Jamiroquai. She also provided vocals for English downtempo group Zero 7 on their first three studio albums and toured with the group. On Zero 7's 2001 album Simple Things, Sia contributed vocals to two tracks including the single \"Destiny\", which peaked at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, she provided vocals for Zero 7 on \"Somersault\" and \"Speed Dial No. 2\" (from the album When It Falls). In 2006, Sia collaborated with Zero 7 for their third album, The Garden.\nIn 2000, Sia signed a recording contract with Sony Music's sub-label DancePool and released a single, \"Taken for Granted\", which peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2001, she released her second solo album, Healing Is Difficult, which blends retro jazz and soul music and lyrically discusses Sia's dealing with the death of her first love affair. Displeased with the promotion of the album, Sia fired her manager, left Sony Music and signed with Go! Beat, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group (UMG). At the APRA Awards of 2002, Sia won the Breakthrough Songwriter category alongside Brisbane pop duo Aneiki's Jennifer Waite and Grant Wallis.\nIn 2004, Sia released her third studio album, Colour the Small One. The album employs a mixture of acoustic instruments and electronic backing to her material. The album spawned four singles, including \"Don't Bring Me Down\" and \"Breathe Me\", the latter of which charted in the United Kingdom, Denmark and France.\nDissatisfied with Colour the Small One's poor marketing and the album's struggle to connect with a mainstream audience, Sia relocated to New York City in 2005. During that time, \"Breathe Me\" appeared in the final scene of the U.S. HBO television series Six Feet Under, which helped increase Sia's fame in the United States. Consequently, Sia's manager, David Enthoven, set up a tour across the country to maintain her career.\n\n\n2007–2010: Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born\n\nIn 2007, Sia released a live album, Lady Croissant, which included eight live songs from her April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York and one new studio recording—\"Pictures\". A year later, she left Zero 7 on friendly terms, replaced by Eska Mtungwazi as the band's frontwoman. Sia released her fourth studio album, Some People Have Real Problems on 8 January 2008. The album peaked at No. 41 in Australia and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\nIt charted at No. 26 on the US Billboard 200, becoming Sia's first to chart in the United States. Some People Have Real Problems yielded four singles, including \"The Girl You Lost to Cocaine\". It peaked at No. 11 in the Netherlands and No. 12 in Spain; it additionally reached No. 8 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs. Another single from the album was \"Soon We'll Be Found\".\nIn May 2009, Sia released TV Is My Parent on DVD, which includes a live concert at New York's Hiro Ballroom, four music videos and behind-the-scene footage. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, Sia won the Best Music DVD category for TV Is My Parent. She also received a nomination for Best Breakthrough Artist Album for Some People Have Real Problems.\nIn 2009, American singer Christina Aguilera approached Sia about writing ballads for Aguilera's sixth studio album. The final product, Bionic, includes four songs co-written by Sia. Later in 2010, Sia also co-wrote \"Bound to You\" for the soundtrack of the film Burlesque, which starred Aguilera and Cher. The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. In May 2011, Sia appeared on the inaugural season of the U.S. version of The Voice as an adviser for Aguilera, who served as a vocal coach and judge.\nIn June 2010, Sia released her fifth studio album, We Are Born. The release peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The release of the album was preceded by three singles: the lead single, \"You've Changed\", was released in December 2009 and charted at No. 31 in Australia. The follow-up single, \"Clap Your Hands\", peaked at No. 17 in Australia, No. 10 in the Netherlands and No. 27 in Switzerland. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010, We Are Born earned Sia two categories won: Best Independent Release and Best Pop Release. Meanwhile, at the 2011 APRA Music Awards, Sia received a nomination for Song of the Year for \"Clap Your Hands\". To promote We Are Born, Sia gave the We Meaning You Tour, which visited North America and Europe in April–May 2010. The We Are Born Tour followed with stops in Australia in February 2011 and North America in July–August 2011.\n\n\n2010–2013: Songwriting career and mainstream recognition\n\nFollowing the success of We Are Born, Sia became uncomfortable with her growing fame. She later told The New York Times: \"I just wanted to have a private life. Once, as my friend was telling me they had cancer, someone came up and asked, in the middle of the conversation, if they could take a photograph with me. You get me? That's enough, right?\" She refused to do promos for her tours, began to wear a mask on stage and became increasingly dependent on drugs and alcohol on the road; she considered suicide. Sia fired Enthoven and hired Jonathan Daniel, who suggested that she write songs for other artists.\nSia retired as a recording artist and began a career as a songwriter. She wrote the song \"Titanium\" for American singer Alicia Keys, but it was later sent to David Guetta, who included Sia's original demo vocals on the song and released it as a single in 2011. \"Titanium\" peaked within the top ten of record charts in the United States, Australia and numerous European regions. However, Sia recalled: \"I never even knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I was trying to be a pop songwriter, not an artist.\"\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Sia also co-wrote songs for many recording artists, including Beyoncé, Kylie Minogue, Flo Rida and Rihanna. Her collaboration with Flo Rida, \"Wild Ones\", peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the tenth best-selling song of 2012 globally. In March 2012, Sia released a greatest hits album, Best Of..., in Australia.\n\n\n2013–2014: Breakthrough with 1000 Forms of Fear\nIn October 2013, Sia released \"Elastic Heart\" featuring the Weeknd and Diplo for the soundtrack of the American film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). She executive-produced Brooke Candy's debut EP, Opulence, released in May 2014, and co-wrote 3 songs on the EP. In July 2014, Sia released her own sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear. She again collaborated with Greg Kurstin. The album debuted at No. 1 in the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 52,000 copies. By October 2015, it was certified gold by the RIAA denoting 500,000 equivalent-album units sold in the United States. The record peaked at No. 1 in Australia and reached the top ten of charts in numerous European regions. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\nBy early 2016, the album had sold 1 million copies worldwide.\n1000 Forms of Fear's lead single, \"Chandelier\" was released in March 2014. The song peaked at No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Sia's first entry on that chart as a lead artist. Elsewhere, the song experienced similar commercial success, ranking in the top ten of the record charts in Australia and numerous European regions. As of January 2015, the single had sold 2 million copies in the United States. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards (2015), Sia received four nominations for \"Chandelier\": Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Music Video.\nFor performances of songs from 1000 Forms of Fear, Sia chose not to show her face, either facing away from audiences or hiding it behind oversized platinum blonde wigs. In videos for the singles \"Chandelier\", \"Elastic Heart\" and \"Big Girls Cry\", choreographed by Ryan Heffington and co-directed by Sia and Daniel Askill, and in many of the promotional live performances, child dancer Maddie Ziegler performed as a proxy for Sia in bobbed blonde wigs similar to Sia's familiar hairstyle. The three videos have received a total of more than 4 billion views on Vevo. In an interview with Kristen Wiig in Interview magazine, she said she decided to conceal her face to avoid a celebrity lifestyle and maintain some privacy: \"I'm trying to have some control over my image. And I'm allowed to maintain some modicum of privacy. But also I would like not to be picked apart or for people to observe when I put on ten pounds or take off ten pounds or I have a hair extension out of place or my fake tan is botched. Most people don't have to be under that pressure, and I'd like to be one of them.\" The video for Elastic Heart \"courted controversy and plaudits in equal measure\", with some commentators perceiving it to have paedophilic undertones due to the relative ages of the dancers. Sia explained that the two dancers represented \"warring 'Sia' self states\", but she nevertheless apologised on Twitter to anyone who was \"triggered\". Gia Kourlas wrote in The New York Times in 2016 that Sia's collaborations with Heffington have \"done more to raise the standards of dance in pop music than nearly any current artist integrating the forms\". The \"Chandelier\" video was ranked as the 10th \"greatest music video\" of the 2010s by Billboard.\nIn 2014, Sia contributed to the soundtrack to the 2014 film adaptation of the Broadway musical Annie. She and producer Greg Kurstin wrote three new songs for the film as well as re-working songs from the musical. Sia, Kurstin and the film's director Will Gluck were nominated for Best Original Song at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards for \"Opportunity\".\n\n\n2015–2019: This Is Acting and Everyday is Christmas\nIn an interview with NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that she had completed the follow-up to 1000 Forms of Fear, titled This Is Acting. The album was another collaboration with producer and co-writer Greg Kurstin. She said she released 1000 Forms of Fear to free herself from her record deal and had planned simply to write for other artists, but the album's success spurred her to continue writing her own music. Also in February 2015, alongside the digital deluxe release of 1000 Forms of Fear, she released a mobile game, Bob Job. \"Alive\" from This Is Acting was co-written by Adele and had originally been intended for her third album, 25.\nIn November, Sia collaborated with composer J. Ralph on the soundtrack of the environmental documentary Racing Extinction, co-writing and singing the song \"One Candle\". She released two more songs from the album, \"Bird Set Free\" and \"One Million Bullets\". The single \"Cheap Thrills\", featuring Sean Paul, reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Sia released two videos for the song. One features Ziegler and two male dancers, while the other, featuring Sean Paul, shows a 1950s style teen dance party; it has accumulated more than 1.7 billion views.\n\nIn April 2016, Sia's performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival went viral online. Her performance received an effusively positive critical reception as \"one of the greatest moments in Coachella's 17-year history\", and it was consistently called one of the best performances of the 2016 festival. The performance was her first full concert since 2011. Sia is an avid fan of the television reality series Survivor; in 2016, she made a surprise appearance on the live reunion of Survivor: Kaôh Rōng, where she donated $50,000 to contestant Tai Trang and another $50,000 to an animal charity of his choice, noting that the two share a mutual love of animals. After that she regularly awarded prizes to her favourite Survivor contestants.\nIn June 2016, Sia gave a concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado, featuring Ziegler. From May to August, Sia performed in nearly a dozen festivals and other concerts in America and European and Middle Eastern countries, including Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Poland, the United Kingdom, Russia, Lebanon and Israel. In September 2016, she released a single, \"The Greatest\", with vocals from American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar. A video was released the same day featuring Ziegler – the dancer's fifth video collaboration with Sia and Heffington. The two performed the song with several other dancers, and also performed \"Chandelier\" live the next day at the Apple annual fall event, drawing media attention. Her YouTube videos have accumulated a total of more than 12 billion views, and the channel has more than 24 million subscribers.\nSia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in North America from September to November 2016, featuring Ziegler. As at Coachella and subsequent live performances, Sia appeared at the back of the stage with her familiar wig covering her face, while her dancers performed Heffington's choreography synchronised with pre-recorded videos played on big screens. The tour received a warm reaction: \"She let her dancers own center stage, carrying out one skit/performance after another as Sia [sang]. It defied all the regular rules of pop concerts, which are usually designed to focus ... on the star of the show. Yet, Sia's bold gamble paid off, resulting in one of the most daringly original and wholly satisfying shows of 2016.\" Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic described the show as \"part performance art, part interpretive dance. ... [Sia] sounded amazing. ... There's so much raw emotion in her songs. And you can definitely hear that in her voice, but it becomes more visceral when you can also read it in the faces of her dancers, especially Ziegler. ... The entire performance was brilliantly staged\". Sia was nominated for three 2017 Grammy Awards. She co-wrote and performed on a platinum-selling single, \"Dusk Till Dawn\", by Zayn. Sia performed in concert at the close of the Dubai World Cup in March 2017, together with her dancers, led by Ziegler. The second leg of the Nostalgic for the Present Tour was her first stadium tour in Australasia, in late 2017.\nIn 2017, Sia moved from RCA to Atlantic Records. She released the album Everyday Is Christmas on Atlantic and Monkey Puzzle in November 2017. The album features original songs co-written and co-produced with Kurstin.She performed the single \"Snowman\" on the finale of the 13th season of The Voice and on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Ziegler dancing. \"Snowman\" has also since become a modern-day Christmas classic, and is one of the most-streamed Christmas songs of all time.\nIn 2018, Sia collaborated with English musician Labrinth and American DJ/record producer Diplo to form the supergroup LSD. They released five singles: \"Genius\", \"Audio\", \"Thunderclouds\", \"Mountains\", and \"No New Friends\", before releasing an album, Labrinth, Sia & Diplo Present... LSD, in April 2019. Also in 2018, Sia was one of the narrators of Australian animal rights documentary, Dominion, and shared in a 2018 Award of Excellence from the Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards.\n\n\n2020–present: Music and Reasonable Woman\n\nHer ninth album, Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture, was released in February 2021 in connection with the release of her film, Music. The album peaked at number 8 on the US Billboard soundtrack album chart, and number 12 on the ARIA charts.\nHer tenth studio album, Reasonable Woman, was released on 3 May 2024. Mark Kennedy wrote, for the Associated Press, \"Sia hasn't lost a step [in her] ability to switch from hurt and broken (\"I Forgive You\") to ecstatic lover (\"Towards the Sun\") to vengeful, hell-releasing angel, like on \"I Had a Heart\". ... But on this outing, the ... forever catchy Sia is most interesting with others. In addition to the Khan duet, the best songs are \"Dance Alone\" with Kylie Minogue, \"Incredible\" with Labrinth and \"Fame Won't Love You\" with Paris Hilton\"; he says, however, that Sia \"rarely shift[s] out of third gear\" on the album.  Sia executive produced Paris Hilton's 2024 album, Infinite Icon.\nA musical theatre adaptation of the film Saturday Church is set to premiere off-Broadway in late 2025. It has a book by Damon Cardasis and James Ijames and music and lyrics by Sia with additional music by Honey Dijon.\n\n\nArtistry and musical style\nAt the start of her career, with the band Crisp, Sia performed acid jazz in Australia and later in London. With her first solo single, \"Taken for Granted\", she experimented with trip hop. When she joined Zero 7, she sang downtempo numbers. With Colour the Small One (2004) and Some People Have Real Problems (2007) she moved into jazz and folktronica, although the album's biggest hit, \"Breathe Me\", is described as alternative rock and a power ballad. Some People Have Real Problems expanded her connection with indie pop. Sia stated, \"Colour the Small One ... couldn't be more derivative of Kings of Convenience and James Taylor and the things that Zero 7 were playing on the [tour] bus. I'm very easily influenced.\"\nIn 2009, after leaving Zero 7, Sia dedicated herself entirely to her solo career. We Are Born (2010), incorporated various pop styles, including synthpop and R&B, with introspective themes accompanied by more insistent and livelier rhythms. 1000 Forms of Fear (2014) consolidated her connection with pop (with traces of electropop, reggae and hip-hop), while This Is Acting (2016) is mostly composed of songs written by Sia with other female pop artists in mind, but the artists did not include the songs on their albums. Sia described songwriting for others as \"play-acting\". The Guardian's Kitty Empire commented that the latter album \"provides an obvious counterpoint to Sia's more personal album of 2014, 1000 Forms of Fear, whose stonking single, 'Chandelier', tackled her intoxicated past. This Is Acting makes plain the fact of manufacture – a process akin to bespoke tailoring.\" The record also alternates reggae and electropop with more introspective themes.\nSia's music blends pop, folk and electronica. Her voice has been described as \"deep, playful, and powerful\". In Sia's 2016 live performances, her music was part of performance-art-like shows that involved dance and theatrical effects. An MTV News writer opined that \"Sia's throaty, slurred vocals are her norm\", while a contributor to The Fader noted that \"in the Billboard Hot 100 landscape, Sia's songwriting voice, which deals with depression and addiction, is singular – her actual voice even more so.\" Everyday Is Christmas (2017), Sia's first release of Christmas music, is a pop album that gives old-fashioned holiday music \"some 21st century pop gloss\" and is made for those who grow tired of the classics. Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture (2021) further developed Sia's pop music catalogue, with the album incorporating more electropop and reggae, alongside R&B and EDM. National Public Radio called Sia \"the 21st century's most resilient songwriter\".\n\n\nAccolades and recognition\n\nSia has received an array of accolades, including ARIA Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and nine nominations for Grammy Awards.\nIn March 2021, a laneway in Adelaide city centre was renamed Sia Furler Lane, and a mural titled She Imagined Buttons was painted on a wall nearby to commemorate Sia's 2011 performance in Adelaide. As of October 2022, Sia has 15 entries on the APRA billion streams list, the most of any artist.\n\n\nOther ventures\nIn the 2014 South Park episode \"The Cissy\", Sia provided the vocals for the fictional Lorde track \"Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)\". In 2016 Sia covered \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles for the Netflix original series Beat Bugs. She appeared in the 2017 animated film My Little Pony: The Movie as the voice of pop star Songbird Serenade. She also contributed an original song, \"Rainbow\", to the film's soundtrack. Sia wrote the songs for the soundtrack to the 2018 musical film Vox Lux, with a score by Scott Walker.\nShe wrote a screenplay, based on a story that she had written in 2007, for the 2021 musical film, Music, which starred Ziegler, Kate Hudson and Leslie Odom Jr. Sia also directed the film and wrote its soundtrack. The film was released in Australia in January 2021 and in select IMAX theatres in the US for one night on 10 February 2021, followed by an on-demand release. It received negative reviews from critics and generated controversy for its depiction of autism. Sia said after the release of the film and subsequent backlash that she was diagnosed with autism. It was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. As director of Music, Sia later won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director.\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nSia has been noted for her philanthropic gestures over the years. Prior to Thanksgiving in 2019, at a Palm Springs, California, Walmart and TJ Maxx, Sia paid for people's groceries and shopping in disguise. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sia pledged to donate $1 million to CORE Response; she also donated the proceeds from her single \"Saved My Life\" to CORE Response's and AmeriCares' relief efforts. The same year she donated $100,000 to Australians in need in collaboration with Nova FM DJs Fitzy & Wippa and another $100,000 to community bail funds in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nSince 2016, Sia has given money to her favourite contestants in the reality television series Survivor; the tradition has been billed the \"Sia Award\". At the end of the 45th season, she had given a total of $1 million to contestants over the years.\n\n\nAnimal activism\nSia is a vegetarian and an \"animal lover\". She has been an advocate for animals throughout her career. In 2010, she participated in a PETA campaign to tackle animal overpopulation and encourage people to spay or neuter their pets. She performed her song \"I'm in Here\" at the Beagle Freedom Project Gala in 2013, and, in 2015, \"Free the Animal\" was used for PETA public service announcements supporting cruelty-free fashion. During her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in 2016, Sia partnered with various animal rescue organisations to set up dog adoption fairs at each of the shows. In 2017, she released another public service announcement, in collaboration with the ASPCA, using her song \"Puppies Are Forever\", to encourage pet adoption. Sia co-narrated the 2018 animal rights documentary Dominion.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n\nRelationships and family\nAfter Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London to be with her boyfriend Dan Pontifex. While on her way to England, she received the news that Pontifex had been hit by a car and died in hospital. She returned to Australia but received a call from one of Pontifex's former housemates, who invited her to stay in London. Her 2001 album Healing Is Difficult lyrically deals with Pontifex's death: \"I was pretty fucked up after Dan died. I couldn't really feel anything\", Sia recalled in a 2007 interview for The Sunday Times: \"We ... got shit-faced on drugs and Special Brew. Unfortunately, that bender lasted six years for me.\"\nSia married documentary filmmaker Erik Anders Lang at her home in Palm Springs, California, in August 2014. The couple divorced in 2016. During a 2014 appearance on The Howard Stern Show, when asked if she was religious she responded, \"I believe in a higher power and it's called 'Whatever Dude' and he's a queer, surfing Santa that's a bit like my grandpa, so yes.\" In the same interview, she stated that she is a feminist and that Whatever Dude divinely inspired the lyrics she wrote for Rihanna's song \"Diamonds\". One of Sia's tattoos on her hand reads \"Whatever Dude\". Sia is a cousin of Australian Christian rock musician Peter Furler.\nIn 2019, Sia adopted two black American boys who were ageing out of the foster care system. In 2020, she announced that she had become a grandmother when one of her two 19-year-old sons had fathered twins. In December 2022, she married Dan Bernad, followed by a ceremony in Portofino, Italy, in May 2023. She gave birth to their child on 27 March 2024. In March 2025 she separated from Bernad and filed for divorce.\n\n\nSexuality\nIn 2008, Sia discussed her sexual orientation in interviews and revealed her relationship with JD Samson; they broke up in 2011. When asked about her sexuality in 2009, she said, \"I've always dated boys and girls and anything in between. I don't care what gender you are, it's about people. ... I've always been... well, flexible is the word I would use.\" Sia identified as queer on Twitter in 2013.\n\n\nHealth\nSia has experienced depression and addictions to painkillers and alcohol. In 2010, she wrote a suicide note, planning to overdose; a friend phoned her and, unintentionally, saved her life. Afterwards, Sia joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Sia cancelled various promotional events and shows due to her poor health in 2010. She mentioned having extreme lethargy and panic attacks, and considered retiring permanently from performing and touring. Sia also discussed being diagnosed with Graves' disease. Later that year, she said her health was improving after rest and thyroid suppression therapy.\nIn 2019, Sia stated that she has Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. She has also said that she was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from childhood traumas including being sexually abused at the age of nine. Sia said that due to the backlash she received regarding her 2021 film Music, she relapsed, became suicidal again and returned to rehabilitation.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nOnlySee (1997)\nHealing Is Difficult (2001)\nColour the Small One (2004)\nSome People Have Real Problems (2008)\nWe Are Born (2010)\n1000 Forms of Fear (2014)\nThis Is Acting (2016)\nEveryday Is Christmas (2017)\nMusic (2021)\nReasonable Woman (2024)\n\n\nTours\nWe Meaning You Tour (2010–2011)\nWe Are Born Tour (2011)\nNostalgic for the Present Tour (2016–2017)\n\n\nFilmography\n\nSia wrote or performed songs on the following film soundtracks:\n\n\nFilm roles\n\n\nTelevision roles\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of artists who reached number one in the United States\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nSia at IMDb",
    "summary": "Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (  SEE-ə; born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Adelaide, she started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut studio album, OnlySee, in Australia. Sia moved to London and provided vocals for the British duo Zero 7. She released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, in 2001 and her third, Colour the Small One, in 2004.\nSia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, she took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"Titanium\" (with David Guetta), \"Diamonds\" (for Rihanna), \"Wild Ones\" (with Flo Rida) and \"Pretty Hurts\" (for Beyoncé).\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten single \"Chandelier\" and a trilogy of music videos she co-directed, starring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy. Her seventh studio album, This Is Acting (2016), included her first Billboard Hot 100 number one single, \"Cheap Thrills\". In 2016 she also began her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Sia's eighth studio album, Everyday Is Christmas, was released in 2017. In 2019, Labrinth, Sia and Diplo released an album, LSD. Sia has written many songs for films. She released her feature film directorial debut, Music, in 2021 to generally negative reviews, alongside an album, Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture. Her tenth album, Reasonable Woman, was released in May 2024.\nSia is an advocate for animal rights.

    "text": "Naminohana Kazutaka  (born 19 March 1969 as Kazuhiro Kudo) is a former sumo wrestler from Namioka, Aomori, Japan. He was active from 1984 until 1997 and his highest rank was komusubi. He fought for Futagoyama stable and won one special prize for Fighting Spirit. After retiring at age 28 because of injury he went into the restaurant business.\n\n\nCareer\nHe was born in Namioka, Aomori, the third son of a farmer. He won a sumo competition at Namioka Tachi Nozawa Elementary School and fought for the fourth grade sumo club even when still in the third grade. At junior high he moved away from sumo and was thinking of becoming a physical education teacher. However he was recruited by the former yokozuna Wakanohana Kanji I and joined his Futagoyama stable upon graduation from junior high school. Initially fighting under his own surname of Kudo, he made his professional debut in May 1984. Weighing less than 100 kilograms (220 lb) early in his career he rose rather slowly up the ranks, but he compensated for his lack of physique by hard training. He was promoted to the second highest juryo division in November 1990 and reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in September 1992. After falling back to juryo in 1994 he won two yusho or tournament championships in that division. Upon his return to makuuchi in November 1994 he scored 10–5 and won his first and only sansho, for Fighting Spirit. He was nominated for the prize on the condition that he win on the final day, and had he failed to do so, there would have been no sansho at all awarded in a tournament for the first time since they were introduced in 1947. His highest rank was komusubi, which he held for one tournament in March 1995 after a 9–6 record at maegashira 7 in the previous tournament saw him somewhat fortuitously promoted to the sanyaku ranks. He scored only 6–9 and never made komusubi again. He injured his elbow in a match with Kaio in March 1996, which restricted his performances and led to six consecutive losing records and demotion to the makushita division.\nHe is the only wrestler in modern sumo to reach a sanyaku rank but never defeat any yokozuna or ozeki in his career. He was only eligible to face Akebono and Musashimaru during his 18 tournament stay in the top division as the other yokozuna and ozeki were all fellow members of Futagoyama stable, and sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same stable meeting in competition.\n\n\nRetirement from sumo\nHe retired in March 1997 at the age of 28. He had no elder stock in the Japan Sumo Association and so was unable to stay in sumo. He ran a restaurant in Nishi-Azabu, Tokyo and has appeared on J Sports ESPN's Genshiko Ozumu sumo program.\n\n\nFighting style\nNaminohana was an oshi-sumo specialist who preferred to push and thrust rather than go for a grip on the mawashi or belt. His  most common winning kimarite or techniques were oshi-dashi (push out), yori-kiri (force out), hataki-komi (slap down) and tsuki-otoshi (thrust over).\nHe was known for trying to tempt his opponent to begin the bout early, a practice known as jikanmae.\n\n\nCareer record\n\n\nSee also\nList of sumo tournament second division champions\nGlossary of sumo terms\nList of past sumo wrestlers\nList of komusubi\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial biography of Naminohana Kazutaka at the Grand Sumo Homepage",

    "text": "Portuguese is the official language of Angola. Over 46 other languages are spoken in the country, mostly Bantu languages.\n\n\nEuropean languages\n\nPortuguese is the sole official language. Due to cultural, social and political mechanisms which date back to the colonial history, the number of native Portuguese speakers is large and growing. A 2012 study by the Angolan National Institute for Statistics found that Portuguese is the mother tongue of 39% of the population. It is spoken as a second language by many more throughout the country, and younger urban generations are moving towards the dominant or exclusive use of Portuguese. The 2014 population census found that about 71% of the nearly 25.8 million inhabitants of Angola speak Portuguese at home.\nIn urban areas, 85% of the population declared to speak Portuguese at home in the 2014 census, against 49% in rural areas. Portuguese was adopted by Angolans in the mid-twentieth century as a lingua franca among the various ethnic groups. After the Angolan Civil War, many people moved to the cities where they learned Portuguese. When they returned to the countryside, more people were speaking Portuguese as a first language. The variant of the Portuguese language used in Angola is known as Angolan Portuguese. Phonetically, this variant is very similar to the Mozambican variant with some exceptions. Some believe that Angolan Portuguese resembles a pidgin in some aspects.\nHowever, in Cabinda, wedged between two French-speaking countries — the DRC and the Congo — many people speak French as well as, or better than, Portuguese. In fact, of the literate population, 90 percent speak French while 10 percent speak Portuguese.  Also, the Angolan Bakongo who were exiled in the Democratic Republic of the Congo usually speak better French and Lingala than Portuguese and Kikongo.\n\n\nAfrican languages\n\nAll native languages of Angola are considered to be national languages. After independence, the government said it would choose six to be developed as literary languages. The six languages vary between government pronouncements, but commonly included are \nUmbundu, Kimbundu, Kikongo (presumably the Fiote of Cabinda), Chokwe, Kwanyama (Ovambo), and Mbunda (never clearly defined; may be Nyemba, Luchazi, or indeterminate). Angolan radio transmits in fourteen of the \"main\" national languages: Bangala ('Mbangala'), Chokwe, Fiote, Herero ('Helelo'), Kikongo, Kimbundu, Kwanyama, Lunda, Ngangela, Ngoya, Nyaneka, Ovambo ('Oxiwambo'), Songo, Umbundu. Some of the national languages are used in Angolan schools, including the provision of teaching materials such as books, but there is a shortage of teachers.\nUmbundu is the most widely spoken Bantu language, spoken natively by about 23 percent of the population, about 5.9 million. It is mainly spoken in the center and south of the country. Kimbundu is spoken in Luanda Province and adjacent provinces. Kikongo is spoken in the northwest, including the exclave of Cabinda. About 8.24% of Angolans use Kikongo. Fiote is spoken by about 2.9%, mainly in Cabinda. Lingala is also spoken in Angola.\nThe San people speak languages from two families, the !Kung and Khoe, though only a few hundred speak the latter. The majority of San fled to South Africa after the end of the civil war. The extinct Kwadi language may have been distantly related to Khoe, and Kwisi is entirely unknown; their speakers were neither Khoisan nor Bantu.\n\n\nAsian languages\nA (very small) number of Angolans of Lebanese descent speak Arabic and/or French. Due to increasing Angola-China relations, there is now a sinophone community of about 300,000.\n\n\nList of Languages of Angola\nListed below are the languages of Angola.\n\n\nForeign languages\nThe foreign languages most taught at school are English and French. The Angolan Government has planned to make English a compulsory subject in the future.\n\n\nSee also\nAngolan Portuguese\nConstitution of Angola\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nTola Akindipe, Geofrey Kakaula & Alcino Joné, Largest Chokwe language resource on the internet (Mofeko)\nTola Akindipe, André Tati.

    "text": "The Jeffers Petroglyphs site is an outcrop in southwestern Minnesota with pre-contact Native American petroglyphs. The petroglyphs are pecked into rock of the Red Rock Ridge, a 23-mile (37 km)-long Sioux quartzite outcrop that extends from Watonwan County, Minnesota to Brown County, Minnesota. The exposed surface is approximately 150 by 650 feet (50 by 200 m) and surrounded by virgin prairie. \"The site lies in an area inhabited in the early historic period by the Dakota Indians, and both the style and form of some of the carvings are identical with motifs that appear on Dakota hide paintings and their quill designs and beadwork. Others are foreign to this Plains Indian tradition and seem to be much earlier in origin.\" Several old wagon trail ruts traverse the site, one of which is believed to be the old stage coach route from New Ulm, Minnesota to Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nThe exact age of the petroglyphs is not known, but the earliest petroglyphs are estimated to be from 9000 to 7000 years ago (7000 to 5000 BCE). but some atlatl symbols at Jeffers are a close match with similar symbols at Indian Knoll in Kentucky, which have been dated to 3000 BCE during the Late Archaic Period.  Another clue to the age comes from the projectile point carvings, which show a projectile point design used by hunters in the Late Archaic Period.  Other carvings, such as thunderbirds, dragonflies, turtles, and shamans, indicate symbols used by later tribes such as the Otoe tribe, Sioux, and Iowa tribe.  These are believed to date between 900 CE and 1750 CE. There are over 4000 American Indian images preserved in the bedrock. The bedrock was flattened and smoothed over by glaciers 14000 years ago.\nSeveral archaeologists have hypothesized theories about the purpose of the carvings. Some hypotheses include the practice of hunting magic, performance of sacred ceremonies, or recording historical events in the lives of warriors, shamans, and chiefs. The exact age and purpose of the carvings is only speculation, not established fact. Meanwhile, some Native Americans view the Jeffers site as sacred ground and a very spiritual place, not merely a site to be studied and speculated upon. Jerry Flute, a Dakota elder, was quoted as saying, \"To the contemporary Native Americans who reside in and around the state, [Jeffers Petroglyphs] is a very spiritual place. It is a place where Grandmother Earth speaks of the past, present and future.\"\nThe Minnesota Historical Society purchased the site from W. R. Jeffers, Jr. in 1966 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. It is maintained by the Minnesota Historical Society and is open to the public between May and September. The site is bracketed by two important tracts of tallgrass prairie: Rock Ridge Prairie Scientific and Natural Area to the northwest and Red Rock Prairie, a preserve of The Nature Conservancy, to the east. Here federally threatened prairie bush clover is found, as well as big bluestem, Indian grass, gray-headed coneflower, Maximilian's sunflower, cordgrass and coreopsis. The upland sandpiper, regal fritillary and Poweshiek skipper can be found on these prairies.\nThe visitor center is open from May through September and features hands-on exhibits and a multimedia presentation about the site. Daily natural and cultural history programs are offered about such topics as archaeology, how Native Americans made and used the atlatl, a travois and cordage, and prairie wildlife and plants.\n\n\nAstronomy at Jeffers Petroglyphs\n\nThe Starry Night, Prairie Night event is held annually in the park.  During this time the park manager allows amateur astronomers to use the park and facilities. Many amateur astronomers attend this event and several members bring their telescopes and allow, and often encourage, others to share their views of the night sky.  This site is valued not only because of its historic nature but also because of its dark night skies. The site is much darker than most populated areas in Minnesota and is rated green by the Clear Sky Chart.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nGardner, Denis P. (2004).

In 1734, it was still only lined with few buildings.

It stood at the current location of no. 117 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis, in the 10th arrondissement.\nA ministerial decision of 12 Fructidor V (29 August 1797) set the minimum width of the street at 10 metres (33 ft). This width was increased to 11 metres (36 ft) by a royal decree of 3 August 1838. An order of 3 September 1843 declared the public utility of expansion to 20 metres (66 ft) to the right of the properties at nos. 115–121 to create the Cour du Havre.\nThe Gare Saint-Lazare was built in 1837. An alley, the Impasse Bony, created in 1826 and located at the site of the Hotel Terminus, was used for unloading luggage. The Cour de Rome, in front of the station on the west side, encompassed the old Impasse d’Argenteuil, which opened onto the Rue du Rocher.\n\n\nNotable buildings\nNos. 27–29 (and nos. 32–34, Rue de Châteaudun): Two notable buildings, decorated in the style of 16th-century French architecture, built around 1840.

The album was produced primarily by Furtado with other contributions made by James Bryan, Lester Mendez, Salaam Remi, The Demolition Crew, Julieta Venegas and Brian West. Furtado described the songs on the album to be \"simple love songs\".\nMi Plan was generally well received by music critics, most applauding Furtado's vocals. The album reached number one on the US Latin Billboard chart, and was later certified platinum (Latin field) album by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album in 2010. The lead single from the album, \"Manos al Aire\" was released in June 2009. The song became Furtado's first solo number one single on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart. She also became the first North American artist to top the chart with an original Spanish song. Two further singles came from the album, \"Más\", released in December 2009, and \"Bajo Otra Luz\", released in June 2010. The album was further supported by her 2010 Mi Plan Tour, her first tour reaching Latin America. Mi Plan Remixes, a remix album, followed in October 2010, featuring remixes of the singles.\n\n\nBackground\nFurtado began working with guitarist and producer James Bryan on My Plan, as a possible English-language album. She said she would try to write songs in English and then in Portuguese but that she did not feel inspired. She mentioned that fellow Canadian singer-songwriter Alex Cuba suggested that they try writing the lyrics in Spanish and then he would go on to write the melodies. After approving of the idea, she said that she, Cuba and Bryan started \"really organically writing songs\" in Spanish. Cuba then helped them pen more songs, including the title track, \"Mi Plan\", and \"Manos al Aire\". \"Mi Plan\" features Cuba on vocals. According to Cuba, the three got together five times between September 2008 and February 2009 and wrote nine songs, six of which made it onto the album. Furtado also worked with Julieta Venegas, who wrote the song \"Bajo Otra Luz\" and also contributed to another song called \"Vacación\", playing the accordion. Altogether, Furtado wrote 24 Spanish-language songs, 12 of which made the final track list.\n\n\nContent\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Furtado said that the album was a personal statement and that the central theme was love. She noted that her previous albums had songs that \"explored certain aspects of love, but they're not really direct love songs\" and the songs on Mi Plan were more simple. She also claimed that she \"wanted to abandon the dance-pop vibe of her last record and try a different sound\". Furtado explained that she decided she wanted to perform in Spanish because she did not follow commercial or sales trends and that the album was \"the next phase\". She said that writing songs in Spanish felt \"very liberating\" allowing her to \"express other emotions\" singing in Spanish because, as she put it, \"In English, especially as a woman, the moment you start to be angry, you get labelled bad-tempered like Alanis Morissette, or if you're too sad, you get written off as fragile and sappy.\"\nThe album contains influences of Latin jazz, flamenco pop, techno-pop, reggae pop, cumbia, electro, bachata pop and alternative rock. The first track on the album is \"Manos al Aire\", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about \"having a heated argument\" with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the \"white flag\" and \"surrenders\" to him. Another song from the album entitled, \"Bajo Otra Luz\", Furtado proclaimed, is about \"when you are in a relationship and you are under a light. You feel like something is glowing on you and there is something different about the world. You can't put your finger on it.\" The seventh track, \"Suficiente Tiempo\", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is \"trying to make time for a date night\". Furtado said that the album was \"purposefully collaboration-heavy\" because she \"want[ed] it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience\" She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, \"Silencio\" and called the collaboration a \"huge blessing\". She felt it was important to feature \"an artist that people know more for their English recordings\" because she wanted to demonstrate that \"language isn't a barrier when it comes to music.\"\n\n\nPromotion\nPrior to the album's release, three promotional singles were released exclusively on Apple's iTunes Store as a \"Countdown to Mi Plan.\" \"Más\" was the first promotional single released on 21 July 2009. The next month, \"Mi Plan\" was released, followed by \"Bajo Otra Luz\" in early September. \"Silencio\"  was digitally released as a promotional single only for U.S. from Rhapsody on 1 September 2009. On 26 October 2010, a 12-track album titled Mi Plan Remixes was released, featuring singles released from Mi Plan. An English version of \"Fuerte\" was released as a promotional single from Mi Plan and Mi Plan Remixes on 26 October 2010. Before she began touring, Furtado appeared at various award shows and small venues, performing in places such as the 2009 ALMA Awards. Furtado also appeared at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2010, performing a medley of \"Fuerte\" and \"Bajo Otra Luz\", alongside La Mala Rodríguez and The JabbaWockeeZ. The album was also supported by the Mi Plan Tour, which began on 16 March 2010, in Mexico and Venezuela and continued further into Latin America, with six more venues in Ecuador, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Furtado performed at Yas Arena in Abu Dhabi, supported by Taio Cruz and Tinchy Stryder.\n\n\nSingles\n\"Manos al Aire\" was released on 30 June 2009 as the lead single from the album, sent to worldwide radio with digital and mobile retail availability the next day. It was Furtado's first single to top the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Tracks. With the song, Furtado made history by becoming the first North American artist to reach number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart with an original Spanish song that was not translated from another language. It achieved international success, peaking at number two in Germany, Czech Republic, and Italy while it reached the top twenty in various other countries such as Switzerland, France and Spain.\n\"Más\" was the second single released from the album. It was released as a download single on 18 December 2009, in Germany. It did not perform as well as \"Manos al Aire\", peaking at number 25 on the Billboard Latin Pop Airplay chart. An Italian version of the song was digitally released on 22 January 2010.\n\"Bajo Otra Luz\" was digitally released from iTunes in Canada and Mexico on 31 August 2009. It premiered as the final single from the album on US radio in early May 2010 with digital downloading available on 15 June 2010. It was the least successful single from the album, not charting anywhere.\nAll singles had proper official music videos released to promote them. In addition to these, Furtado made three promotional black and white videos of the recording sessions of the album tracks \"Sueños\" (featuring Alejandro Fernández), \"Silencio\" (featuring Josh Groban) and \"Como Lluvia\" (featuring Juan Luis Guerra). These can be viewed through her official Argentina fan club YouTube channel.\n\n\nMi Plan Tour\n\nThe tour was announced on 5 January 2010 via Furtado's official website. For the tour, Furtado asked her fans for help choosing the setlist, asking which songs should be on the show. The concert in Santiago was one of the firsts after the 2010 Chile earthquake that happened 3 weeks before. Nelly Furtado donated 5% of the revenues to the people affected by the catastrophe. To promote the tour in Brazil, on 24 March 2010, Furtado made a \"VIP Pocket Show\" appeared in the reality show program Big Brother Brasil 10 from Rede Globo, the country's leading channel. She performed 5 songs from the tour in acoustic versions (\"Maneater\", \"I'm Like a Bird\", \"Try\", \"Say It Right\" and \"Turn Off The Light\").\n\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe album was generally well received by critics: it scored 71/100 among professional music critics cited by Metacritic. In a positive review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album is \"assured and cohesive\" and claimed that it is her \"strongest album yet\". Billboard described the album as \"straightforward songs that appeal to melodic sensibilities rather than rhythmic contraptions, the set is a mix of vulnerability and earnestness\". The Boston Globe said \"Furtado bridges pop sensibilities with Latin music\" and also mentioned the songs, \"Sueños\" and \"Silencio\", saying that they \"bring out the purity in Furtado's vocals\".\nDigital Spy writer, Mayor Nissim, asserted that \"aside from the vocals and lyrics, much of the music here wouldn't sound out of place in the UK or US charts, which is both a good and bad thing.\" He also went on to say that \"the fact Manos and several other songs feature rather Americanised production can prevent them from completely hitting the mark\" because, as he put it, \"Furtado's tunes don't always get the Spanish wallop her vocals deserve.\" MusicOMH said in its review that \"For the most part, the album is a pretty good listen\" and claimed that songs from the album are \"pleasant but never overly diverting\". Paul Lester, a writer for BBC, gave the album a mixed review and said the music is \"equally inoffensive\". The writer compared it to her previous release, Loose and claimed that \"Timbaland's inventive approach to dance motion is much missed\". Entertainment Weekly also stated, \"Without the Midas touch of studio magician Timbaland, Furtado has only her nasal, pleasant-enough vocals and a distinctly middlebrow musicality.\" Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine was very critical, writing, \"[it] manifests itself here in a labored and predictable fashion\" and also said it is \"heartless, with forced sincerity\".\n\n\nCommercial performance\nMi Plan debuted at number 39 on the Billboard 200, including number 1 on the Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts selling nearly 13,000 copies in its first week. On 6 November 2009, the album received a platinum certification (Latin field) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over 100,000 copies. According to Nielson SoundScan, the album was the highest selling Latin pop album in 2009.\nIn Switzerland, Mi Plan entered the charts at number three and stayed in the top ten for five weeks. There, the album was certified gold for shipping over 15,000 units.\nAt the 11th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Furtado won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nNotes\n^a  signifies a co-producer.\n^b  signifies an additional producer.\n\n\nPersonnel\nCredits below are adapted from the Mi Plan liner notes.\n\n\nProduction\nAndrés Recio – executive producer, A&R\nNelly Furtado – executive producer, producer, mixing\nChris Smith – executive producer\nJames Bryan – producer, guitar, drums, keyboards, engineer\nJulieta Venegas – producer, accordion\nLester Méndez – producer, percussion, guitar, keyboards, mixing, engineer, string arrangements\nBrian West – producer\nThe Demolition Crew – producer\nSalaam Remi – producer, drums, keyboards\nVanessa Freebairn-Smith, Alex Grant – cello\nAlex Grant – cello\nDaniel Stone, Raphael Padilla, Roger Travassos – percussion\nDan Warner – guitar, bass guitar\nDan Turco, Vincent Henry – guitar\nStayBent Krunk-a-Delic – guitar, keyboards\nRamón Stagnaro – guitar, cuatro\nMatt Scannell – guitar, bass guitar\nMichael Anthony Turco – producer, drums\nLee Levin – drums\nJulio Hernandez, Alex Cuba – bass guitar\nChris Gehringer – general mastering\nDemacio Castellón – mixing\nFranklin Emmanuel Socorro – mixing, engineer\nJason \"Metal\" Donkersgoed – mixing, engineer\nJoel Numa – mixing, engineer\nRon Taylor – digital editing\nJorge Vivo – engineer\nAntonio Resendiz – engineer\nJulian Vazquez – engineer\nAllan Leschhorn – engineer\nRyan Evans – engineer\nEnrique Larreal – engineer\nCarlos Alvarez – engineer\nAureo Baqueiro – vocal producer\nMarc Rogers – double bass\nJavier Limón – flamenco guitar\nTyler Armes – piano\nNick Banns – string arrangements\nSonus Quartet – strings\nMark Lidell – cover photo\nJoachim Johnson – photography\n\n\nGuest appearances\nAlex Cuba appears courtesy of Caracol Records\nAlejandro Fernández appears courtesy of Universal Music Latino\nJulieta Venegas appears courtesy of Sony Music\nLa Mala Rodríguez appears courtesy of Universal Music Spain\nConcha Buika appears courtesy of Warner Bros. and casalimon.tv\nJavier Limón appears courtesy of casalimon.tv\nJosh Groban appears courtesy of Warner Bros.

This scale is also used by Japanese model kit manufacturer Bandai, Nichimo Company Ltd. and Fujimi Mokei for ship and science fiction model kits.\n\n\nShip models for the military\nDuring World War II, Comet metal Products of Richmond Hill, NY, South Salem Studios of South Salem, NY and H.A. Framburg and Company of Chicago were the major manufacturers of naval recognition ship models for the US Navy.  They were commissioned by United States Navy to make ship models used to instruct sailors and airmen to identify ships from various navies.  This \"friend or foe\" recognition was critical in reducing friendly fire incidents. In addition to 1:1200 scale models, these companies also made models in the 1:500 \"Teacher Scale.\"  These ships were wither made of wooden hulls with lead superstructures, or die cast of zinc alloy and painted gray.  The 1:500 ships were usually arranged in sets and contained fewer models than the 1:1200 scale sets.\n\n\nPlastic model kit (ships)\nIn the 1960s, Renwal released fourteen 1:500 scale ship models from World War II or postwar United States Navy, and Frog also released six models from Royal Navy. Both makers had failed in the late 1970s, but some makers such as Chematic rereleased ex Frog 1:500 scale ship models until the 2000s.\nIn the 1970s, Nichimo released a series of 1:500 plastic scale ship models. The series only comprises a small number of ships, with most of them being ships from World War II Japanese Navy. These models are still under production and widely available in the market. In mid-1970s, Monogram also released models of USS Chicago (CG-11) and USS Columbus in 1:500 scale (actually, 16 in. length box scale). In the late 1990s, Trumpeter released 1:500 scale models of Nimitz class aircraft carrier.\nIn November 2009, Fujimi released an all-new tooling model of the Japanese battleship Yamato in 1:500 scale. Fujimi then follows on the series by releasing Japanese battleship Nagato and Design A-150 battleship (a Japanese plan for a class of battleship following the Yamato Class, also known as the Super Yamato class) in the same scale.\nThere are also resin kits available in this scale, such as the USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73) by Aki.\n\n\nPlastic model kit (building/structure)\nDoyusha released a limited number of Japanese castle models in 1/500 scale. These are Himeji Castle, Matsue Castle and Kōchi Castle. They are also available in another version that features gold colour plated parts.\n\n\nPlastic model kit (science fiction)\n1:500 scale is also used in Sci-Fiction plastic model kit by some model manufacturers. AMT released a futuristic spaceship model in the 1960s. Bandai released a model of the Space Battleship Yamato in the 1980s, and an all-new tooling model of the same ship was released in early 2010. Fine Molds began to release spaceship models designed by well known anime and manga artist Leiji Matsumoto in October 2011.\n\n\nCollectables (aircraft)\nHerpa launched a Wings series of airplane collection models in the 1:500 scale in 1992. The series also includes model diorama airports and airport accessories.\nF-toys also released 1/500 scale pre-painted and mostly pre-assembled plastic \"trading kits\" on JAL and ANA commercial aircraft.\nOther manufacturers like Aeroclassics, Inflight500, etc. also offer 1:500 scale model aircraft.\n\n\nUnit conversion\nReality – Scale model\n\n0.1 m – 0.2 mm\n0.2 m – 0.4 mm\n0.4 m – 0.8 mm\n0.5 m – 1 mm\n1 m – 2 mm\n2 m – 4 mm\n3 m – 6 mm\n20 m – 40 mm\n100 m – 200 mm\n1 km – 2000 mm\n2 km – 4000 mm\n\n\nSee also\nScale model\nShip model\nList of scale model sizes\n\n\nReferences",

It is her 9th novel.\n\n\nPlot\nIn the fictional island chain of the Myriad, the inhabitants worshiped and revered enormous sea creatures referred to as 'gods' that fed on human fear from a source below the sea known as the Undersea. 30 years before the events of the book, the gods all turned on each other and tore each other apart in a disaster known as the Cataclysm, and the remnants of their bodies are now used as high durability material called 'godware' for various purposes. Our protagonist, Hark, lives on the island Lady's Crave with his best friend Jelt. In an accident involving a stolen bathysphere, Jelt seemingly drowns but comes back to life when a submerged ball of godware reanimates his body and heals his wounds. They decide to use the ball to heal people as a way to pay their debts for stealing the bathysphere. However, Hark soon discovers that prolonged exposure to the ball affects your body in strange ways, and is worried about its effect on Jelt, who never leaves its presence. Discovering that the ball is actually the heart of one of the gods, Hark tries to warn Jelt but is too late, as he is already too far gone, having been molded by the heart into something barely resembling a human. In a clash between the two, Hark steals the heart but is captured by the Leaguers, a group who wish to bring back the age of the gods. They transport the heart to the undersea to awaken their own god-construct, made of godware, but Jelt appears and merges with the heart and the god-construct, empowered by the fear in the undersea. In a final altercation, Hark reconcile that Jelt drowned in the bathysphere accident, being only kept alive since by the power of the god's heart. Hark crushes the heart, killing what was left of Jelt.\n\n\nReception\nDeeplight has received positive reviews from The Guardian, Readings, Common Sense Media, and Booklist, including starred reviews from Kirkus and Publishers Weekly.

The book was published on 17 September 2020, after two delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nBackground\nLove Frankie is Wilson's 111th published work, and the second to feature a gay love story, (the first being Kiss (2007)). In an interview with Lisa Allardice of The Guardian, Wilson stated that Love Frankie is \"jam-packed [with issues]: a sick mum, separation, stepfamilies, sibling rivalry, bullying, falling in love\". She also stated that she \"put her heart and soul into the book\", and \"felt it was important to include characters from diverse backgrounds in her stories.\" Love Frankie was originally scheduled for release on 16 April 2020, but due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the release was pushed back to 20 August 2020. The publish date was then delayed for a second time to 17 September 2020. \n\n\nPremise\nThe book centers around almost-14-year-old tomboy Frankie, whose mother has multiple sclerosis (MS). Frankie feels she is growing up too quickly, and bullies at school are tormenting her. However, when Frankie begins spending time with Sally, the leader of the bullies, the pair strike up a friendship. Frankie becomes confused when she wonders whether she wants Sally to be her friend or girlfriend.\n\n\nReferences",

A stream rising a short distance to the west is one of the source streams of the Ey Burn, which also drains into the North Sea via the River Dee. For the first three kilometers the Baddoch Burn flows primarily in an easterly direction before turning northeast. During its approximately 9.5 kilometer long course, the Baddoch Burn takes in various streams, including the Allt Loch Vrotachan, which flows out of Loch Vrotachan and flows in from the right. Around eight kilometers south of Braemar, the Baddoch Burn flows from the left into Clunie Water, which flows into the Dee at Braemar.\nThe Baddoch Burn catchment area covers 2260 hectares. The main rocks are quartzite and slate. There is a water measuring station at a weir a short distance from the mouth at an altitude of 415 meters. The banks of the Baddoch Burn are now uninhabited. However, on the right bank of the lower reaches there are remains of an agricultural settlement consisting of longhouses typical of the region.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Baddoch Burn at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "Dragon Hunters (French: Chasseurs de dragons) is an animated fantasy comedy television series created by Arthur Qwak and produced by the French company Futurikon in co-production with France 3, Super RTL, RTL-TVI (season 1) and Your Family Entertainment (formerly known as RTV Family Entertainment for season 1) with the participation of Canal J, VRT (season 1) and GA&A (season 2) in association with Carrimages (season 1). It follows the adventures of two hunters for hire through a medieval world of floating land masses that is terrorized by a widely varying menace of monsters known collectively as dragons. A 3-D feature film and a videogame based on the same creative universe have also been released.\n\n\nPlot\nSet in a Medieval world made of Floating Land Masses, two men, Gwizdo and Lian-Chu, are professional dragon hunters who have known each other since they were children. Perpetually flat broke, they are forced to continually stay at the Snoring Dragon Inn until they can get another dragon-hunting contract to pay their rent. The proprietress of the inn is Jeanneline, a three-time divorcee with two daughters, one of whom is also a professional dragon hunter who doesn't see her mother much.\n\n\nCast and characters\n\n\nMain characters\nLian-Chu is a sword-wielding, muscle-bound warrior who actually deals out the dragon slaying. In contrast to Gwizdo, he is more kindhearted and honorable.  He is also an avid knitter. In the episode \"The Conjunction of the Three Moons\", it is revealed that his parents were killed by a dragon, and in \"Farewell Lian-Chu\" it's revealed that they were killed because his uncle did not give notice to the people when the dragon was on his way to the village. He only knows how to count to 10 and can not read and thus depends on Gwizdo for this.\n\nFrench voice: Alexis Victor (season 1), Thierry Desroses (season 2), Vincent Lindon (movie)\nEnglish voice: Harry Standjofski (season 1), Forest Whitaker (movie)\nGwizdo is the brains of the group, and negotiates their contracts with the helpless people terrorized by dragons. He is a small, gangly young man who speaks with a New York or New Jersey accent. He and Lian-Chu have known each other since childhood, and were raised together in an orphanage called Mother Hubbard's Farm.  He is avaricious, cowardly, egotistical, cynical and unsympathetic, and abuses Hector  constantly with violence and insults. However, he has a heart of gold hidden deep inside, which is elicited by Lian-Chu, Zaza or anyone else he considers a close friend. Furthermore, he is charismatic, and therefore something of a lovable rogue. In \"The Orphan Farm\" it's revealed that his egotism stems from his miserable childhood at Mother Hubbard's Orphan Farm, where he was bullied, abused and called names for being scared all the time. He is the one who can read, write and count at the inn, therefore Lian-Chu and Jeanneline depend on him for business and contracts. He also flies their airship, the St. George, and wears a pilot's cap (which he very rarely takes off) and goggles. A good deal of the time his attempts to exploit others' predicaments leads to failure, either because of some oversight or because his better nature prevails.\n\nFrench voice: Ludovic Pinette (series), Patrick Timsit (movie)\nEnglish voice: Rick Jones (season 1), Rob Paulsen (movie)\nHector is their pet dog-like-dragon who does not possess the evil nature or the great size of the ones they hunt and acts like a dog. With his fur and ears he seems to be based on a variation of the Asian dragon (similar to Falkor the Luck Dragon in The Neverending Story). His hobbies are eating and picking on other animals such as chickens or sheep. While Gwizdo is the pilot of the St. George, Hector is required to pedal for the propeller, a task he is not fond of.  He speaks with a mixture of grunts and pidgin English.\n\nFrench voice: Frédéric Sanchez (series), Jeremy Prevost (movie)\nEnglish voice: Rick Jones (season 1), Dave Wittenberg (movie)\n\n\nOther characters\nJennyline runs the Snoring Dragon Inn, where Lian-Chu and Gwizdo live. Lian-Chu and Gwizdo owe her an ever-growing debt for room and board. She is a heavyset woman who is short-tempered, strict, irascible and cynical.  She has had three past marriages, which have resulted in Zoria, Zaza and possibly other children. She's in love with Gwizdo and wants to marry him, but he's too scared to commit to a relationship. Her name is given as Jennyline on the DVDs and Janelynn on the official website. The French and German variations of her name are Jeanneline.\n\nFrench voice: Murielle Naigeon\nEnglish voice: Sonja Ball (season 1)\nZoe is Jennyline's oldest daughter, and is an accomplished dragon hunter in her own right.  Like Zaza, she was inspired by Lian-Chu and Gwizdo at a young age, and trained with them to learn the moves and arts of the business.  She is not a resident of the inn and makes few appearances, but is well known by the main characters.  A victim of sexism, she has donned a male disguise in some parts to get more bounties, and goes by the name Zoria.\n\nFrench voice: Marie Drion (movie)\nEnglish voice: Mary Mouser (movie)\nZaza is Jennyline's youngest daughter.  She resides at the Snoring Dragon Inn as an assistant.  She idolizes Lian-Chu and has dreams of becoming a dragon hunter when she grows up, of which Jennyline disapproves.  She spends most of her time at the inn, but occasionally joins the hunters on quests, often through her own means.\n\nFrench voice: Audrey Pic (season 1), Catherine Desplaces (season 2)\nEnglish voice: Annie Bovaird (season 1)\nNoble Kayo is an elderly doctor whom the hunters sometimes turn to for advice regarding strange conditions, such as poison and paralysis.  While intelligent, he is almost completely blind and a bit absent-minded, which makes having a straightforward conversation with him very difficult. In the French version his name is \"Kao\", which is pronounced the same as the French word for \"chaos\".\nGeorge and Gilbert Forrestal are a two-brother hunter duo, who know Lian-Chu and Gwizdo from growing up alongside them in the orphanage.  They look down on Gwizdo and refer to him as a pipsqueak, and often bring up embarrassing childhood events of his.  They see no room for competition, and often try to get the hunters' bounties themselves.\nPrince Granion de Bismuth is the youngest son of Queen Clothilda. He is a selfless, noble, and somewhat naive hunter who hunts the dragons for free. His two older brothers were killed in dragon battles.\n\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nSeason 1\n\n\nSeason 2\n\n\nBroadcast\nThe program was featured in the United States on Cartoon Network for a few weeks around January 2006, but, after having its time slot moved, vanished from the line-up. It returned in September 2006, only to disappear again in October 2006. Up until June 2007, it was available for viewing on Cartoon Network Video. In 2011, it was airing in the U.S. on Starz Kids & Family; all 52 episodes were available for purchase and streaming on Amazon Video via Starz, broken down into six 'seasons'; 6eps, 10eps + 10eps of season 1 and 6eps, 10eps + 10eps of season 2, respectively. 50 of the 52 episodes were available in English on Netflix through their partnership with Starz though the episodes were released out of order.\nA second season of 26 episodes began airing in France in August 2007. International releases of both seasons have occurred in over 70 countries. A fanbase was formed in Arabic speaking countries, due to being broadcast on MBC 3. In October 2017, the series premiered in Bangladesh on Duronto TV, dubbed in Bengali.\n\n\nHome media\nGeneon has released five DVDs (containing episodes 1 - 17) in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nDragon Hunters Vol. 1: \"It's A Dragon's Life\" containing episodes 1 - 4\nDragon Hunters Vol. 2: \"Dead Dragon Walking\" containing episodes 5 - 8\nDragon Hunters Vol. 3: \"There's No Place Like Home!\" containing episodes 9 - 11\nDragon Hunters Vol. 4: \"Don't Look Now\" containing episodes 12 - 14\nDragon Hunters Vol. 5: \"Unwelcome Guests\" containing episodes 15 - 17\n\n\nOther media\n\n\nCollectors game\nThe Die Drachenjäger (Dragon Hunters) collectors' game was created and distributed by Dracco Company Ltd, which was a new addition to the Dracco Company's merchandise. The game, released in Belgium, featured forty collectible figurines that resembled the monsters, dragons, and the heads of the main characters, Lian Chu, Gwizdo, Zaza, Hector, and Jennyline. The game plays identically to Dracco Heads.\nA collection of figurines has also been featured by Revell.\n\n\nJunior novelizations\nA series of junior novelizations of the episodes were published in France.\n\n\nComics\nThe comic series Chasseurs de Dragons was published by Delcourt in France and co-edited in the US by Peace Arch.\n\n\nMovie\n\nDirected by Guillaume Ivernel (who also art directed the film) and Arthur Qwak, and produced by Futurikon co-founder Philippe Delarue, a full-length computer-animated 3D movie was made by Mac Guff Ligne Paris, Futurikon and Trixter Film GmbH. The film is a prequel to the series, with Lian Chu, Gwizdo and Hector as roving travelers, and a young Zoria, then known as Princess Zoe.\nA four-minute teaser was shown in both the Annecy Animation Festival and the Marché du Film in 2007.\nIt premiered on March 19, 2008 in Russia, and on March 26 in Belgium and France, and premiered 2010 in Mexico. It premiered on April 5, 2008 in the United States as part of the Sarasota Film Festival. Rob Paulsen confirmed at a convention interview that he and Forest Whitaker were respectively voicing Gwizdo and Lian Chu.\n\n\nCovers\nThe show's theme, \"The Dragon Hunters Song\", is performed by the English rock band The Cure. The Cure took their song : 'Taking off' and changed it up for the show's theme. This track was available as a single and a track on the German compilation CD Toggo Music 11 in 2005, both now out of print.\n\n\nReferences to popular culture\nThe air vehicle that Lian-chu, Gwizdo and Hector ride on is named after St. George.\nThe floating landscapes featured in the series are inspired by the fantasy artwork of Roger Dean, traditional Chinese Shan shui paintings as well as the landscapes of German painter Caspar David Friedrich.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nChasseurs de dragons at IMDb\nDragon Hunters at IMDb",
