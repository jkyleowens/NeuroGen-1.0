    "text": "Inosperma erubescens (formerly Inocybe erubescens, also formerly named I. patouillardii), and also commonly known as the deadly fibrecap, brick-red tear mushroom or red-staining Inocybe, is a poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the original genus Inocybe and one of the few known to have caused death. It is found growing in small groups on leaf litter in association with beech. All mushroom guidebooks as well as mushroom hunters advise that the entire Inocybaceae should be avoided for consumption. The fruit bodies (i.e., the mushrooms) appear in spring and summer; the bell-shaped caps are generally pale pinkish in colour with red stains, which can also be seen on the stipe and gills.\n\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nThe red-staining inocybe was first described by Norwegian naturalist Axel Gudbrand Blytt in 1904 as Inocybe erubescens. However, it was widely known for many years as I. patouillardii, as named by Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola in 1905 in honour of the French botanist Narcisse Théophile Patouillard. However, the former name takes priority due to age.\nA 2019 multigene phylogenetic study by Matheny and colleagues found that I. erubescens and its relatives in the subgenus Inosperma were only distantly related to the other members of the genus Inocybe. Inosperma was raised to genus rank and the species became Inosperma erubescens.\n\n\nDescription\nThe cap is hemispherical before flattening out and can reach 8 cm (3.4 in) in diameter. It is variable in colour, initially white though becoming yellow or brownish with age, and stained with pink-white and red marks or lines. The edge of the cap is often irregular with split edges and rough texture. The adnexed gills are reddish-pink. The stipe, dark red-pink, is thin with no ring. The flesh is initially yellowish, later dark pink. The colour tends to fade in direct sunlight. It may be mistaken for Calocybe gambosa, though the latter does not stain red, Agaricus species or Cortinarius caperatus.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nIt is commonest in beech woods and chalky soils, but grows in other broad-leaved woodland as well. It mainly grows on leaf litter usually during the spring and summer seasons. It is found in southern Europe and has been recorded from eastern Anatolia in Turkey. In Israel, I. erubescens grows under Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos) and pines, with mushrooms still appearing in periods of little or no rain as they are mycorrhizal.\n\n\nToxicity\nInocybe erubescens contains a possibly fatal dose of the toxin muscarine. One fatality was recorded in Surrey in southern England in 1937. In Israel, it is confused with edible mushrooms of the genus Tricholoma, particularly Tricholoma terreum which grows in similar habitat.\nHigh dose intramuscular injections of atropine or diphenhydramine serve as an antidote to Inocybe poisoning.\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of Inocybe species\nList of deadly fungi\n\n\nReferences\n\nNorth, Pamela (1967).

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=36507921",
    "text": "The men's ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol event at the 2012 Olympic Games was held on 2 and 3 August 2012 at the Royal Artillery Barracks. There were 18 competitors from 13 nations. The event was won by Leuris Pupo of Cuba. Silver went to Vijay Kumar of India, while Ding Feng of China took bronze. It was the first medal in the event for all three nations. Ralf Schumann missed the final for the first time; he had reached the final in the previous six Games (winning five medals, three gold and two silver).\n\n\nBackground\nThis was the 24th appearance of what had been standardised in 1948 as the men's ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol event, the only event on the 2020 programme that traces back to 1896. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1928 (when no shooting events were held) and 1908; it was nominally open to women from 1968 to 1980, although very few women participated these years. There is no women's equivalent on the Olympic programme, as of 2021. The first five events were quite different, with some level of consistency finally beginning with the 1932 event—which, though it had differences from the 1924 competition, was roughly similar. The 1936 competition followed the 1932 one quite closely. The post-World War II event substantially altered the competition once again. The 1984 Games introduced women's-only shooting events, including the ISSF 25 meter pistol (though this is more similar to the non-Olympic men's ISSF 25 meter center-fire pistol than the rapid fire pistol).\nFive of the six finalists from 2008 returned: silver medalist (and 1992, 1996, and 2004 gold and 1988 silver medalist) Ralf Schumann of Germany, bronze medalist Christian Reitz of Germany, fourth-place finisher Leonid Yekimov of Russia, fifth-place finisher Keith Sanderson of the United States, and sixth-place finisher Roman Bondaruk of Ukraine. The 2010 world champion and runner-up were Alexei Klimov of Russia and Zhang Jian of China, respectively. Klimov held the world record for the qualifying round and shared the world record with Reitz for the new final round format.\nThis was the third Games in which no nation made its debut in the event. The United States made its 20th appearance, most of any nation.\n\n\nQualification\n\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to two shooters if the NOC earned enough quota sports or had enough crossover-qualified shooters. To compete, a shooter needed a quota spot and to achieve a Minimum Qualification Score (MQS). Once a shooter was using a quota spot in any shooting event, they could enter any other shooting event for which they had achieved the MQS as well (a crossover qualification). There were 16 quota spots available for the rapid fire pistol: 2 at the 2010 World Championship, 8 at the 2011 World Cup events (2 spots at each of 4 events), and 6 for continental champions (2 each for Europe and Asia, 1 each for Americas and Oceania). There was also 1 re-allocated place. In 2012, one crossover qualification was used in the rapid fire pistol: Jakkrit Panichpatikum of Thailand had qualified and used a quota spot in the 50 metre pistol and also achieved the rapid fire pistol MQS; he competed in both events (as well as the 10 metre air pistol).\n\n\nCompetition format\nThe competition format continued to use the two-round (qualifying round and final) format, as in 1988 and since 1996, with the third final format in as many Games. The 2005 rules changes also required the pistols used to be sport pistols, banning .22 Short cartridges.\nThe qualifying round from 1988 onward was essentially the same as the full competition format from 1948–1984. Each shooter fired 60 shots. These were done in two courses of 30; each course consisted of two stages of 15; each stage consisted of three series of 5. In each stage, the time limit for each series was 8 seconds for the first, 6 seconds for the second, and 4 seconds for the third. \nThe 1988 tournament had added a two-series final for the top eight shooters; the 1992 competition broke that down to a four-series semifinal for the top eight and two-series final for the top four. In 1996 and 2000, the top eight once again advanced to the final. The 2004 version had reduced the number of finalists to six, where it stayed in 2008 and 2012.\nPrior to 2008, the final involved two series of 5 shots at 4 seconds. In 2008, that was expanded to four series. The 2012 competition used an entirely different format, however. The competition switched to a \"hit-or-miss\" system, where a 9.7 or better scores as a \"hit\" for 1 point and anything lower scores as a \"miss\" for 0 points. The final featured 8 series of 5 shots each (5 points maximum per series, 40 points maximum total). However, starting with the fourth series, the remaining shooter with the lowest total was eliminated after each series (5 shooters remaining in the fifth series, 4 in the sixth, 3 in the seventh, and only 2 in the eighth and final series).\nThe 1992 competition had introduced round targets rather than the silhouettes used from 1948 to 1988 as well as many pre-World War II versions of the event. Score, rather than hits, had been used as the primary ranking method since 1960.\n\n\nRecords\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nResults\n\n\nQualifying\n\n\nFinal\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Sweden's location made it an ideal base of operations for both the Soviet Union and the United States.

The system consisted of coastal artillery, submarines, battleships and aircraft. No less than 90 heavy cannons (typically 7.5 cm cannons) with large underground facilities were strategically located along the coast, together with a large number of bunkers and pillboxes.\n\n\nNavy\nThe Swedish navy possessed a total of 129 ships between 1945 and 1991.\n\n\nSeaplane cruisers\n\n\nCruisers\nSweden possessed four cruisers throughout the Cold War.\n\n\nDestroyers\nSweden had a total of 35 destroyer-class vessels throughout the Cold War, most of them World War II models. As time went on, Sweden begun to put less effort in keeping large surface combatants and instead increasingly relied on patrol boats, fast attack craft, coastal artillery and air superiority. However this approach (especially the overreliance on lighter surface combatants) was somewhat discredited by the early 1980s. Attempts were then made to move back towards heavier more capable surface combatants (e.g. the Ytstridsfartyg Större [Surface Combatant Large] program), but this was ultimately curtailed by the sudden end to the Cold War.\nDestroyers in 1945: 28\nDestroyers in 1950: 21\nDestroyers in 1960: 24\nDestroyers in 1970: 17\nDestroyers in 1980: 13\nDestroyers in 1991: 0\n\n\nCoastal defense ships\nThe Swedish navy maintained 7 coastal defense ships after World War II, though some were taken out of service shortly after.\n\nOscar II-class coastal defense ship (1)\nHSwMS Oscar II (1905-1950)\nSverige-class coastal defence ship (3)\nHSwMS Drottning Victoria (1921-1957)\nHSwMS Gustav V (1922-1957)\nHSwMS Sverige (1915-1953)\nÄran-class coastal defence ship (3)\nHSwMS Manligheten (1904-1950)\nHSwMS Tapperheten (1903-1947)\nHSwMS Äran (1902-1947)\n\n\nCorvettes\nThe Swedish navy had as few as six corvettes in service during the Cold War, relying on larger vessels during this time.\n\nGöteborg-class corvette (4)\nHSwMS Gävle (1990–present)\nHSwMS Göteborg (1990–present)\nHSwMS Kalmar (1990–present)\nHSwMS Sundsvall (1991–present)\nStockholm-class corvette (2)\nHSwMS Malmö (1985–present)\nHSwMS Stockholm (1984–present)\n\n\nMine warfare vessels\nSweden possessed 19 mine warfare vessels throughout the time period 1945–1991.\n\nHSwMS Alnösund minelayer\nHSwMS Arkösund minelayer\nHSwMS Barösund minelayer\nHSwMS Grundsund minelayer\nHSwMS Furusund minelayer\nHSwMS Fårösund minelayer\nHSwMS Kalmarsund minelayer\nHSwMS Kalvsund minelayer\nHSwMS Skramsösund minelayer\nHSwMS Älvsborg minelayer\nHSwMS Älvsnabben minelayer\nHSwMS Öresund minelayer\nLandsort-class mine countermeasures vessel (7)\nHSwMS Arholma (1984-2010)\nHSwMS Koster (1986–present)\nHSwMS Kullen (1986–present)\nHSwMS Landsort (1982–present)\nHSwMS Ulvön (1980s-present)\nHSwMS Ven (1980s-present)\nHSwMS Vinga (1980s-present)\n\n\nPatrol boats\nSeventeen patrol boats were in service in the Royal Swedish Navy between 1945 and 1991.\n\nHSwMS Hugin\nHSwMS Jägaren\nHSwMS Kaparen\nHSwMS Magne\nHSwMS Mjölner\nHSwMS Mode\nHSwMS Munin\nHSwMS Mysing\nHSwMS Snapphanen\nHSwMS Spejaren\nHSwMS Starkodder\nHSwMS Styrbjörn\nHSwMS Tirfing\nHSwMS Tordön\nHSwMS Vale\nHSwMS Vidar\nHSwMS Väktaren\n\n\nTorpedo boats\nSweden had 12 torpedo boats during the Cold War.\n\nPerseus-class torpedo boat (1)\nHSwMS Perseus\nPlejad-class torpedo boat (11)\nHSwMS Alderbaran\nHSwMS Altair\nHSwMS Antares\nHSwMS Arcturus\nHSwMS Argo\nHSwMS Astrea\nHSwMS Plejad\nHSwMS Polaris\nHSwMS Pollux\nHSwMS Regulus\nHSwMS Rigel\n\n\nSubmarines\nSweden had a total of 26 submarines throughout the Cold War.\n\nDraken-class submarine (5)\nHajen class (6)\nHSwMS Bävern\nHSwMS Hajen\nHSwMS Illern\nHSwMS Sälen\nHSwMS Uttern\nHSwMS Valen\nNeptun-class submarine (3)\nNäcken-class submarine (3)\nHSwMS Najad\nHSwMS Neptun\nHSwMS Näcken\nSjöormen-class submarine (5)\nHSwMS Sjöbjörnen\nHSwMS Sjöhunden\nHSwMS Sjöhästen\nHSwMS Sjölejonet\nHSwMS Sjöormen\nVästergötland-class submarine (4)\nHSwMS Helsingland\nHSwMS Södermanland\nHSwMS Västergötland\nHSwMS Östergötland\n\n\nAuxiliary vessels\nHSwMS Arkösund minelayer\nHSwMS Belos submarine salvage vessel\nHSwMS Carlskrona minelayer\nHSwMS Trossö ice-strengthened patrol craft\nHSwMS Visborg command/auxiliary ship\nLanding Craft L-50 mechanized landing craft (5)\n\n\nAir force\nSweden had a huge air force - the fourth largest in the world - throughout the Cold War, consisting of more than 4,000 aircraft.

    "title": "Moses Lake, Washington",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=137928",
    "text": "Moses Lake is a city in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 25,146 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 26,969 in 2024. Moses Lake is the most populous city in Grant County. The city anchors the Moses Lake Micropolitan area, which includes all of Grant County and is part of the Moses Lake–Othello combined statistical area.\nMoses Lake, on which the city lies, is made up of three main arms over 18 miles (29 km) long and up to one mile (1.6 km) wide. It is the largest natural body of fresh water in Grant County and has over 120 miles (190 km) of shoreline covering 6,500 acres (2,600 ha). Before it was dammed in the early 1900s and then incorporated into the Columbia Basin Project, Moses Lake was a smaller shallow lake. To the south of the town is the Potholes Reservoir and the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge that has a number of seep lakes and vast amounts of migratory birds and other fauna natural to the area.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the construction of Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in 1941 and Moses Lake Army Air Base in 1942 the area was largely barren. Native Americans knew the area as Houaph, which meant willow. Chief Moses was leader of the Sinkiuse tribe from 1859 to 1899, and was forced to negotiate with white settlers who began to settle in the area in the 1880s. Under pressure from the government, Chief Moses traded the Columbia Basin land for a reservation that stretched from Lake Chelan north to the Canada–US border. The government later traded again for what is now the Colville Indian Reservation.\nThe new settlers named the lake in honor of Chief Moses. The city was originally named Neppel. The first settlers established fisheries and farms — some of the first exported items were carp, jackrabbits and fruit — but irrigation attempts failed and settlers left at about the same rate as they came. When the town was incorporated and renamed Moses Lake in 1938, the population was estimated at 302 people.\nThe arrival of the air base in 1942 and irrigation water pumped from Grand Coulee Dam in 1955 offered newcomers a reason and a way to settle in an area that previously had little to offer other than good fishing and a place to water sheep and cattle. Moses Lake was quickly transformed into a hub for a vast region where transportation, agriculture and recreation came together.\nThe air base was built to train World War II pilots to fly the P-38 Lightning and B-17 Flying Fortress, two planes that were essential to the war effort. The base was closed after the war ended, but reopened in 1948 as a U.S. Air Force base and test area for Boeing's B-47 Stratojet and B-50 Superfortress.\nThe B-47 tests led to development of modern commercial jetliners still used today. Fighter jets were stationed there to protect Grand Coulee Dam to the north and the Hanford site to the south. Boeing still uses the airport as a test and evaluation facility for its aircraft. Japan Airlines used the airport as a training area from November 1968 until March 2009. The old air base is now owned by the Port of Moses Lake and is home to Grant County International Airport, Big Bend Community College and several businesses.\nFarmers, meanwhile, had developed new methods to irrigate water from the lake and from the Columbia River and began planting expansive irrigated acreage. When the Columbia Basin Project began to deliver water to the area in the mid-1950s, farms expanded by thousands of acres, growing potatoes, corn, onions, carrots and sugar beets.\nIn little more than a decade, Moses Lake's population grew from 300 to 2,679 in 1950. A town on the west side of Moses Lake, named Westlake, was platted in 1945 and incorporated in 1958. The town's population peaked at 500 but later declined to 250 by 1970 as properties in its southern half were acquired by the Bureau of Land Reclamation to address seepage issues created by the raising of the Potholes Reservoir. Westlake was annexed into Moses Lake in 1972 due to the high cost to maintain existing municipal operations and low tax revenue.\n\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 21.098 square miles (54.64 km2), of which 18.136 square miles (46.97 km2) is land and 2.962 square miles (7.67 km2) (14.04%) is water.\n\n\nLandscape\n\n\nDemographics\n\nThe city currently ranks #44 out of 281 municipalities in the State for population.\nAccording to realtor website Zillow, the average price of a home as of May 31, 2025, in Moses Lake is $371,473.\nAs of the 2023 American Community Survey, there are 9,756 estimated households in Moses Lake with an average of 2.59 persons per household.

The warmest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of 88.20 °F (31.22 °C). The coldest month is January, with an average minimum temperature of 21.70 °F (−5.72 °C).\nTemperature variations between night and day are greater during summer (27 °F (15 °C)), and less during winter (14 °F (7.8 °C)).\nThe annual average precipitation at Moses Lake is 7.69 inches (195 mm). Although rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, it is not unusual in mid-summer for a month or six weeks to pass without any measurable rainfall. The wettest month is December with an average rainfall of 1.19 inches (30 mm).\n\n\nEconomy\n\nMoses Lake's historic economic base has been agriculture, but now includes considerable manufacturing and technology. Several companies have moved to the area, including REC Silicon (one of the world's largest manufacturers of polysilicon, used in solar panels). Moses Lake has also attracted some alternative fuel companies, such as Washington Ethanol & Washington Biodiesel.\nBMW, in partnership with the SGL Group, began construction in July 2010 on a $100 million carbon-fiber manufacturing plant. The plant was designed to produce 300 tons of carbon fiber per year from a single production building, and began operations in 2011. In 2013, ground was broken for a second 300-ton building, bringing projected production to 600 tons per year. In 2014, a third 300-ton building was started. When the third building is completed, SGL Moses Lake will be the largest producer of carbon fiber in the world. Mitsubishi in 2016 announced that the company would use the port of Moses Lake for its new regional jet (MRJ) FAA flight testing. The testing will be completed by the end of 2018.\nSeveral manufacturers of electric vehicle batteries have factories or research facilities in Moses Lake due to its proximity to hydroelectricity and silane processors for silicon. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded grants to fund the construction of plants for Group14 and Sila Nanotechnologies that are expected to open in 2024. Sila plans to expand from an initial workforce of 100 employees to 500 within a few years of operation at the factory, which will generate 20 gigawatts of battery capacity by 2026.\nOther major corporations that have facilities in (or are based in) Moses Lake include:\n\nBoeing\nDell\nSabey\nTerex/AWP (Genie Industries)\nGuardian Industries\nConAgra Foods\nBasic American Foods\nMoses Lake Industries\nJ.R. Simplot Co.\nInternational Paper\nTwelve\n\n\nMedia\nColumbia Basin Herald, the local daily newspaper\nSource One News (formerly iFiber One News), a local internet services provider\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\nRoad\nMoses Lake is bisected by two major highways that bypass the city center: Interstate 90 and State Route 17. State Route 171 and Interstate 90 Business serve the city's downtown, connecting to the two highways.\n\n\nRail\nThe Columbia Basin Railroad is headquartered in Moses Lake and operates the city's railroad. It is the busiest shortline railroad in Eastern Washington.\nDuring the 1990s, a high-speed rail line between Seattle and Moses Lake was proposed, primarily to use Grant County International Airport as a satellite airport for the Seattle metropolitan area.\n\n\nPublic transportation\nMoses Lake and Grant County are served by the Grant Transit Authority, which runs several bus routes within the city and intercity bus service to nearby Ephrata and other towns.\n\n\nAirport\nLarson Air Force Base, five miles from the city of Moses Lake, originally was named Moses Lake Army Air Base. It was activated on 24 November 1942 as a World War II training center. Major Donald A. Larson, for whom the base was later renamed, was from Yakima, Washington.\nThe Secretary of Defense announced on November 19, 1965, that Larson was to be closed by June of the following year. Larson Air Force Base, since renamed Grant County International Airport, is now a world-class heavy jet training and testing facility used by the Boeing Company, the U.S. military and NASA. The airport had hosted Japan's national carrier, Japan Airlines, from 1968 to 2008 for the training of its pilots, co-pilots, and flight engineers due to lack of runway space at airports in Japan to do touch and goes with jumbo jets. Columbia Pacific Aviation now handles charter passenger service to and from Moses Lake. With 4,700 acres (1,900 ha) and a main runway 13,500 feet (4,110 m) long, it is one of the largest airports in the United States.\nMoses Lake is also served by the much smaller municipal airport, which has one runway.\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nSchools\n\n\nElementary schools\nGarden Heights Elementary\nGroff Elementary\nKnolls Vista Elementary\nLakeview Terrace Elementary\nLarson Heights Elementary\nLongview Elementary\nMidway Elementary\nNorth Elementary\nPeninsula Elementary\nPark Orchard Elementary\nSage Point Elementary\nGroff Elementary\n\n\nMiddle schools\nFrontier Middle School\nColumbia Middle School (formerly Chief Moses Middle School)\nEndeavor Middle School (formerly Columbia Basin Secondary School)\n\n\nPrivate schools\nAIM School and Gymnastics (Kindergarten and 1st Grade)\nGlenn J.

The high school football team opened the completed stadium on September 12, 2008.\nThe Moses Lake Sand Dunes are open year-round to 4x4 and ORV enthusiasts.\n\n\nSister cities\nMoses Lake has one sister city: Yonezawa, Japan. On August 7, 1978, the mayor of Moses Lake, Bob Hill, wrote a letter to Mayor Toshihide Cho of Yonezawa City, inviting Yonezawa to become a \"Sister City\" to Moses Lake. The 1981 group to visit Yonezawa City in May became the \"Official Delegation\" since it was during this visit that the \"Sister City Agreement\" between Yonezawa City and Moses Lake was signed by Mayor Bob Hill and Mayor Toshihide Cho on May 1, 1981. As part of the program, a small group of high school students from both cities are invited to take part in a cultural exchange. Since its inception, over 200 students and their family members from these two communities have taken part in this exchange. The two cities continue to exchange students every summer since 1981 and marked the 40th anniversary of this program on May 1, 2021.\nThere is a street named after Yonezawa in Moses Lake and a street named after Moses Lake in Yonezawa. The large hawk statue located on the west end of Yonezawa Boulevard is called an Otaka Poppo. These wood carvings, known as sasano bori, are special wood carvings unique to Yonezawa. These wooden dolls have been given as gifts to Moses Lake residents can be found on display around the city and on the campus of Big Bend Community College. Japanese lanterns, some which are gifts from citizens of Yonezawa, can be found around Moses Lake on Yonezawa Boulevard and inside the Japanese Garden.\n\n\nNotable people\nT. R.

    "summary": "Moses Lake is a city in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 25,146 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 26,969 in 2024. Moses Lake is the most populous city in Grant County. The city anchors the Moses Lake Micropolitan area, which includes all of Grant County and is part of the Moses Lake–Othello combined statistical area.\nMoses Lake, on which the city lies, is made up of three main arms over 18 miles (29 km) long and up to one mile (1.6 km) wide. It is the largest natural body of fresh water in Grant County and has over 120 miles (190 km) of shoreline covering 6,500 acres (2,600 ha). Before it was dammed in the early 1900s and then incorporated into the Columbia Basin Project, Moses Lake was a smaller shallow lake. To the south of the town is the Potholes Reservoir and the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge that has a number of seep lakes and vast amounts of migratory birds and other fauna natural to the area.",

    "text": "The history of the Hungary national football team dates back to their first international appearance in 1912.\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough Austria and Hungary were constituent countries of the dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they formed separate football associations and teams around the start of the 20th century.\n\n\n1910s\n\nThe Hungary national football team first appeared at the Summer Olympic Games in 1912 in Stockholm, Sweden. The team had to ask for donations in order to be able to go to the games. Hungary played with England and lost 7–0 and thus were eliminated.\nAfter the Olympic Games Hungary played two matches against Russia in Moscow. The first match was won by 9–0 while the second 12–0 which is still a record of the national side. The top scorer of the two matches was Imre Schlosser who scored seven goals. The beginning of World War I had a deep impact on the thriving Hungarian football. Not only was the country suffering financial problems but the clubs were too. During World War I Hungary played Austria 16 times. In 1919 England claimed the exclusion of the Central Powers (including Hungary) from FIFA. Since FIFA refused England's plea, the British and the Irish associations (English, Scottish, Welsh) decided to resign from FIFA.\n\n\n1920s\n\nBudapest was denied the opportunity to host the Summer Olympics in 1920, therefore it was held in Belgium. Moreover, the countries of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria) were excluded from the Olympics. During this period the Fogl brothers (József Fogl and Károly Fogl) played in the national team. The formation the Hungarians used was 2–3–5 which was unique at that time. In 1924 the national team played at the Summer Olympics in Paris, France. In the first match Hungary beat Poland but in the second round they lost to Egypt. As a consequence, both the head coach and the head of the Hungarian Football Federation resigned.\nBetween 1927 and 1930 Hungary participated in the Europa Cup, which is considered as the first international tournament, with Austria, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Italy and Yugoslavia. Hungary finished fourth although they had chance to win the tournament before the last game but they lost against Italy who went on to actually win it. On 12 June 1927 Hungary beat France by 13–1 which is still a record. József Takács scored six goals against France.fourth\n\n\n1930s\n\nThe first World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930. Hungary did not take part in the tournament since they were not invited and there were no qualification matches. Therefore, Hungary first appeared in the World Cup in Italy where the 1934 FIFA World Cup was held. Hungary's first World Cup match was played against Egypt on 27 May 1934, in the end the match was won 4–2. The goals were scored by Teleki, Toldi (2) and Vincze. In the quarter-finals Hungary faced neighbouring arch-rivals Austria and lost 2–1. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Sárosi.\nHungary entered the 1936 Olympics. In the first round they were eliminated by Poland 0 – 3.\nThe 1938 FIFA World Cup was held in France. The first match was played against Dutch East Indies and Hungary won 6–0. Sárosi and Zsengellér scored twice while Kohut and Toldi also scored a goal each. In the quarter-finals Hungary played with Switzerland and the match was won 2–0 thanks to a goal by Sárosi and Zsengellér each. The semi-finals at the Parc des Princes in Paris Hungary played against Sweden and won 5–1. Sas, Sárosi and Zsengellér's hat-trick sent them to the 1938 FIFA World Cup final. In the final Hungary faced Italy at the Stade Olympique de Colombes in Paris. The final result was 4–2 to Italy. The Hungarian goals were scored by Titkos and Sárosi.\n\n\n1950s\n\nThis Hungarian team was best known for being one of the most formidable and influential sides in football history, which revolutionized the play of the game. Centred around the dynamic and potent quartet of strikers Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis, attacking half-back József Bozsik and withdrawn striker Nándor Hidegkuti, the \"Aranycsapat\" (\"Golden Team\") of the \"Magnificent Magyars\", captivated the football world with an exciting brand of play drawn from new tactical nuances and amassed, barring the 1954 World Cup Final, a remarkable record of 43 victories, 6 ties, and no defeats from 14 May 1950 until they lost 3–1 to Turkey on 19 February 1956.\n\nIn the 1952 Summer Olympics that was held in Helsinki, Hungary beat Romania 2 – 1 thanks to a goal each from Czibor and Kocsis in the preliminary round. In the first round Hungary won 3 – 0 against Italy. In the quarter-finals Hungary beat Turkey easily 7 – 1. In the semi-finals Hungary faced Sweden, the 1948 Olympics champions and Hungary won 6 – 0. In the final Hungary beat Yugoslavia 2 – 0 by a goal each from Puskás and Czibor and thus won the Olympic title for the first time.\n\nOn 25 November 1953 a match took place between England and Hungary at the Wembley Stadium, London, England, which would later be dubbed \"the match of the century\". The English team were unbeaten for 90 years at home. In front of 105,000 spectators Nándor Hidegkuti scored the first Hungarian goal in the first minute. In the first half the result was 4–2 to Hungary. The Hungarian goals were scored by Nándor Hidegkúti (1st, 22nd) and Ferenc Puskás (25th 29th). In the second half the Hungarians scored twice (Hidegkúti and József Bozsik) which resulted in the most important victory of the Hungarians in the twentieth century. The final result was 6–3.\nOn 23 May 1954 the Hungarian national team beat England by 7–1, which remains their worst defeat to date, at the Puskás Ferenc Stadium. At that time in Hungary there was a saying about the match which is the following: Az angolok egy hétre jöttek és 7:1-re mentek in English: The English came for a (one) week (seven days) and went home with seven (7) one (1) (the result of the match).\nThe 1954 FIFA World Cup was held in Switzerland. The first match was played against South Korea and Hungary won by 9–0 at the Hardturm in Zürich. In the second group match Hungary played against West Germany and won the match by 8–3 at the St. Jakob Stadium in Basel. In the quarter-finals Hungary beat Brazil 4–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern. In the semi-finals Hungary played with the two-times World Cup winner Uruguay in Lausanne. Hungary won by 4–2 after extra time. In the final Hungary faced with West Germany again. Although Hungary won the group match against the Germans, they lost 3–2 in the final in Bern at the Wankdorf Stadium. The Golden Team, built around the legendary Ferenc Puskás, led early 2–0, but ended up 2–3 in a game the Germans subsequently christened \"The Miracle of Bern\".\nIn 2010 Journalist Erik Eggers speculates in a study that the Germany team may have used drugs to beat the Hungarian team, which were considered invincible at that time.\n\nAlthough Hungary is qualified as the defending champions for 1956 Olympics, they did not enter the tournament.\nHungary qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup which was held in Sweden. Hungary played their first match against Wales at the Jarnvallen stadium in Sandviken and the final result was 1–1. The second group match was played against the host country, Sweden. Hungary lost 2–1 in the Råsunda Stadium, Solna. Although Hungary won their last group match against Mexico at the Jarnvallen stadium in Sandvinken, they were eliminated from the World Cup after losing a play-off to Wales, who they had drawn level with on points. The Welsh had managed to draw all the group games and then beat the once-mighty Hungarians in a play-off match to decide which nation should follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Had goal difference been the decider, Hungary would have gone through, as the Hungarians had a goal ratio 6–3 compared to 2–2 of Wales. As it was, Wales instead meet Brazil in the quarterfinals and became the recipient of young Pelé's first World Cup goal.\n\n\n1960s\n\nIn 1960 Hungary again entered the Olympics held in Italy and was drawn into Group D with France, Peru and India. Hungary finished top of the group with all wins and a goal difference of +12. In the semi-finals they lost to Denmark 0 – 2, but beat Italy in the Bronze medal match 2 – 1 thanks to a goal each from Orosz and Dunai and thus won a bronze medal.\nHungary qualified for the 1962 FIFA World Cup which was held in Chile. On 31 May 1962 in the first group match Hungary beat England by 2–1 thanks to the goals of Tichy and Albert at the El Teniente stadium in Rancagua in front of 7938 spectators. The second match on 3 June 1962 was even more convincing against the Bulgarian national side. The match was won by 6–1 in Rancagua. The last group match was against Argentina on 6 June 1962 and the final result was a goalless draw in front of 7945 spectators in Rancagua. Hungary qualified for the quarter-finals by gaining 5 points and winning the group. In the quarter-finals of the World Cup Hungary was eliminated by Czechoslovakia by 1–0 at the El Teniente stadium in Rancagua in front of 11690 spectators.\nIn 1964 Hungary again qualified for the 1964 Olympics held in Tokyo and was drawn into Group B with defending champions Yugoslavia, Morocco and North Korea, who withdrew. In their first match against Morocco Hungary won 6 – 0 with all 6 goals scored by Ferenc Bene. In their second match Hungary won narrowly with a 6 – 5 against Yugoslavia and advanced into the next round along with runners-up Yugoslavia. In the quarter-finals Hungary beat Romania 2 – 0 with goals from Csernai. In the semi-finals Hungary beat United Arab Republic (Egypt) 6 – 0 with 4 goals from Bene and 2 from Komora. In the finals Hungary beat Czechoslovakia 2 – 1 thanks from an own goal by Weiss and a goal by Bene, thus won their second gold medal.\n\nHungary qualified for the 1964 European Nations' Cup which was organised in Spain. Hungary played against Spain in the semi-finals of the tournament. The final result was 2–1 after extra time. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Ferenc Bene. In the third place play-off Hungary beat Denmark 3–1 after extra time. Dezső Novák scored twice in the extra time.\nHungary also managed to qualify for the 1966 FIFA World Cup which was held in the home of football, England. On 13 July 1966 Hungary lost their first group match against Eusébio's Portugal by 3–1 at the Old Trafford Stadium in Manchester. Two days later in the second group match Hungary beat Brazil thanks to the goals of Bene, Farkas and Mészöly in the Goodison Park in Liverpool. In the last round of the group matches on 20 July 1966 Hungary beat Bulgaria by 3–1. The goals were scored by Mészöly and Bene. Hungary finished second in the group and qualified for the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals Hungary were eliminated by the Soviet Union on 23 July 1966 by 2–1 at the Roker Park in Sunderland in front of 26844 spectators.\nIn 1968 Olympics Hungary qualified as defending champions to defend their title and was drawn into Group C with Israel, Ghana and El Salvador. Hungary finished top and advanced into the next round with Israel. In Quarter-finals Hungary beat Guatemala narrowly with 1 – 0 from a goal by Szűcs. In the semi-finals they beat Japan 5 – 0 thanks to Szűcs with 3 goals and 2 from Novák. In the finals they beat Bulgaria 4 – 1 and won their third title, being the most successful team at the Olympics in football (Great Britain also won 3 titles but their first title is in 1904, and football became an official event in 1908).\nFlórián Albert was named European Footballer of the Year in 1967. He was the most successful footballer of Ferencváros since the formation of the club, scoring 255 goals in 351 matches from 1958 to 1974.\n\n\n1970s\nHungary came back again as long-time defending champions in the 1972 Olympics in Munich and was drawn into Group C with Denmark, Iran and Brazil. They finished top and advanced into the next round with Denmark. In their Second group round they were drawn into Group 1 with East Germany, West Germany and Mexico. They again finished top undefeated and advanced into the finals with East Germany. In the finals they faced Poland and lost 1 – 2. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Varady.\nHungary qualified for the finals of the UEFA Euro 1972 which was held in Belgium. In the semi-finals Hungary played with the Soviet Union and lost 1–0. In the third place play-off Hungary lost to Belgium 2–1. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Lajos Kű. Hungary finished fourth in the 1972 UEFA Euro.\nHungary participated in the 1978 FIFA World Cup which was held in Argentina. On 2 June 1978 at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires Hungary played with Argentina. Although Károly Csapó scored an early goal, the home side won the match by 2–1. Hungary played their second group match against Italy and the Azzurri won by 3–1. Hungary's third match was played against Michel Platini's France and Hungary lost 3–1 which resulted the farewell of the national side.\n\n\n1980s\nDuring the 1980s Hungary qualified for the FIFA World Cup twice.\n\n\n1982 World Cup\nThe first group match of the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain was played against El Salvador and Hungary won by 10–1 at Estadio Nuevo in Elche. The goals were scored by Nyilasi (2), Pölöskei, Fazekas (2), Tóth, Kiss (3) and Szentes. In spite of the big victory, Hungary lost to 4–1 to Maradona's Argentina in the second match of the group stages. Maradona scored twice, while the only Hungarian goal was scored by Pölöskei at the Estadio José Rico Pérez in Alicante. Although Hungary drew in the last match against Belgium, they were eliminated from the World Cup. However, Hungary was leading in the first half thanks to a goal by Varga.\n\n\n1986 World Cup\nHungary's last World Cup appearance was the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. In the first match of the group Hungary lost 6–0 to the Soviet Union. Football experts date the crisis of the Hungarian football from this match. Although Hungary won their second match against Canada by 2–0 (the goals were scored by Esterházy and Détári), they lost to Platini's France 3–0 in the last group match. This has been the last World Cup appearance of the Hungarian national team.\n\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the 1990s Hungary were not able to qualify for any international tournaments except for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, the United States. The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996 Hungary reached its lowest FIFA ranking (87). The fall of the Communist regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like Ferencváros and Újpest faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This had a profound effect on the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencváros, Újpest, Honvéd and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the Bosman ruling. Since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they were not able to compete with the richer Western European clubs. The crisis in the Hungarian club football affected the performance of the national team.\nThe Hungarian legend Puskás was appointed as the head coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. However, he led the team during only four matches. Consequently, the coaching of the former Honvéd and Real Madrid legend could not change anything. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of the Hungarian national team for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Dunai's team played its first group match against Nigeria and lost to 1–0 in Orlando, in the United States. In the second group match Hungary played with Brazil and lost to 3–1. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Madar. The last group match was played against Japan. Hungary lost to 3–2. The Hungarian goals were scored by Madar and Sándor. Although the Olympic qualification of the young team was a big surprise and people thought that Hungary would have a better future in football history, the team never reached any similar success later.\nIn the 1990s Hungary were the closest to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup but they were eliminated in the play-offs by FR Yugoslavia.\n\n\n2000s\n\nThe most talented players of the 2000s were Gera and Dárdai. Both played abroad (Gera in the Premier League for West Bromwich Albion F.C. and Fulham F.C., while Dárdai in the Bundesliga for Hertha BSC). However, other significant players did not emerge in order to form a strong national team which resulted the consecutive failures of the qualification for the international competitions in the 2000s. Hungary were unable to qualify for the UEFA Euro 2000, 2004, 2008 and for FIFA World Cup 2002, 2006, and 2010. Moreover, during the UEFA Euro 2008 qualification Hungary finished sixth in their group reaching their nadir in their football history. They even lost to Malta which resulted the resignation of Bozsik. Couple of days later Várhidi was appointed who was famous for his appearances in the Sport 1, Hungarian sport television, and analysing the Italian Serie A clubs. He proved his talent by beating the 2006 FIFA World Champions Italy by 3–1 at the Ferenc Puskás Stadium in a friendly tie. However, neither Bozsik nor Várhidi could do well in the official matches which resulted their removal.\nThe Hungarian Football Federation even tried out foreign coaches. Both Matthäus and Koeman failed to qualify for any tournaments.\nIn the 2000s only the Hungary U-20 team could bring back the emotions of the early years. Hungary won a bronze medal in the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt. The new talents of the U-20 team were immediately signed by foreign clubs. Koman to Sampdoria, Németh to Liverpool, Simon to Palermo. However, the big question was whether they can develop enough to be able to play in the senior team.\n\n\n2010s\n\n\nEuro 2012 qualifying\nIn the Euro 2012 qualifying Hungary was drawn into Group E. On 3 September Hungary lost 2–0 to Sweden at the Råsunda Stadium, in Solna. In the second match Hungary beat Moldova by 2–1 at the Szusza Ferenc Stadium, Budapest. In the 50th Rudolf and in the 66th Koman scored. On 8 October 2010, Hungary scored eight goals against San Marino at the Pukás Ferenc Stadium. Szalai scored a hat-trick. On 12 October, after many years Hungary was able to win away against a team which was ranked ahead. Hungary beat Finland by 2–1 at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki. Szalai's and Dzsudzsák's goal resulted the success. In the spring of 2011 Hungary played with World Cup 2010 finalist the Netherlands. At home Hungary was beaten by 4–0, while away 5–3. Although Gera scored twice and Rudolf once, Hungary was unable to win or draw at the Amsterdam Arena. On 7 June 2011 Hungary beat San Marino away by 3–0. On 2 September 2011, Egervári had to leave out the key people (Dzsudzsák, Juhász and Gera) from the national side due to injuries and suspension. In spite of the difficulties Hungary beat Sweden at home. Szabics scored against Sweden at the Puskás Ferenc Stadium in the last minutes of the first half. However, Sweden equalized in the second half. A late goal by Rudolf resulted the celebration of 25,000 spectators after beating Sweden by 2–1 at the Puskás Ferenc Stadium. On 6 September 2011, Hungary beat Moldova 2–0 at the Zimbru Stadium in Chişinău. An early goal by Vanczák in the 7th minute calmed down the national side and in the second half a goal by Rudolf secured the victory away in order to stay in the hunt for the play-offs of the Euro 2012 qualifiers. Since Hungary won the two matches in September 2011 there was still hope for the play-offs of the Euro 2012 qualifiers. In September 2011 Hungary reached its highest FIFA ranking in the team's history with the 27th position due to the victories over Sweden and Moldova in the qualifiers. In the penultimate round of the Euro 2012 qualifiers Sweden beat Finland away (2–1), as a consequence the last match was without any stake for the Hungary national side which left its mark on it. Hungary drew with Finland at home (0–0).\nIn the last two matches of the year 2011 Hungary played with Liechtenstein at home (the match was aimed as a commemoration of the recently deceased football legend Flórián Albert who was the only Hungarian football player who won the prize Ballon d'Or) and the Euro 2012 hosts Poland away. On 1 June 2012 in a friendly tier Hungary beat the Czech Republic by 2–1. Egervári invited Szakály, Mészáros and Gyurcsó for the first time. Gyurcsó was the first player from the Puskás Ferenc Academy and he contributed to the success by a late goal. Three days later Hungary drew with Ireland.\n\n\nFIFA 2014 qualifying\n\nHungary started the FIFA world cup 2014 qualifying campaign in group D along with the Netherlands, Turkey, Romania, Estonia and Andorra. Egervári, head coach of the national team, said in an interview with the FIFA that Netherlands are the favourites and the battle for the second place will be between Romania, Turkey and Hungary. On 7 September, Hungary started the FIFA world cup 2014 qualifying campaign with a 5–0 win over Andorra. Just four days later Hungary lost to the Netherlands at home 4–1. On 12 October Tamás Hajnal celebrated his 50th appearance in the national team with a goal against Estonia which resulted the 1–0 victory over the Baltic linguistic relatives in the FIFA world cup 2014 qualifiers. Four days later, on 16 October 2012 Hungary battle back to beat Turkey at home 3–1. In March 2013 Hungary played two crucial matches in their group. On 22 March 2013 Hungary drew with Romania at the empty Puskás Ferenc Stadium. Vanczák's header was equalized by Mutu's penalty, while Dzsudzsák's penalty was equalized by Chipciu's late goal finishing the match 2-2. and on 26 March 2013 Turkey hosted Hungary at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul. Böde's equalizer secured a 1–1 draw in Turkey. Hungary prepared for their crucial autumnal FIFA qualifiers with a 1–1 draw against the Czech Republic at home and on 6 September 2013 Hungary lost 3–0 to Romania in Bucharest. Four days later Hungary beat Estonia 5–1 at home, On 11 October 2013 Hungary suffered an 8–1 record defeat at the Amsterdam Arena against the Netherlands, which resulted the resignation of Egervári. Therefore, on 14 October 2013 Csábi, caretaker, led the team against Andorra in a 2–0 victory.\n\n\nEuro 2016 qualifying\n\n Hungary were drawn in Group D in their FIFA World Cup 2014 qualifying, along with the Netherlands, Turkey, Romania, Estonia and Andorra. They had 14 points going into the penultimate round of games, but suffered a joint national record defeat 8–1 to the Netherlands, which resulted in the resignation of head coach Egervári. For their final group game, a 2–0 win against Andorra, Hungary were led by caretaker manager József Csábi. They finished in third place in the group, on seventeen points, missing out on qualification. After the match, striker Ádám Szalai gave a press conference delivering a poignant scathing monologue about his perception of \"continuously lying to our supporters\" when it came to suggesting that the team had a chance against current leading teams of the world. Similar sentiments have been expressed before by midfielder Szabolcs Huszti. During this period, a film crew began filming the team during both their preparations and matches; the film, Még 50 perc was eventually released in 2016 just before the European Championships.\nPintér was appointed as the head coach of the national team in December 2013. Some had seen this decision as controversial, given Pintér's low popularity with fans and players alike. The team played their first game at the newly constructed Groupama Arena on 7 September 2014, a 2–1 defeat to Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. Pintér was subsequently dismissed, with Dárdai appointed as a temporary replacement for three matches. He turned down an offer to manage the team on a permanent basis, but was kept on. Subsequently, Pál Dardai was at Hertha BSC, where he had been passing youth coach, was promoted to manager of the first team, but he remained still coach. In the summer of 2015 he resigned as coach of the Hungarian national team to devote himself to his work as manager of Hertha BSC. He was eventually replaced by the German sports director of the Hungarian Football Association, Storck, in July 2015. Storck exercised incidentally continue from the post of Sports Director of the Association. On 15 November 2015, Storck-led Hungary qualified for the UEFA Euro 2016 after 44 years when Hungary was qualified for the UEFA Euro 1972. Hungary beat Norway in the first leg of the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying play-offs 1–0. The only goal was scored by Kleinheisler. On the return match, Hungary beat Norway 2–1 and qualified for the UEFA Euro 2016 finals.\n\n\nEuro 2016\nOn 14 June 2016, Hungary won the first group match in a 2–0 victory over Austria at the UEFA Euro 2016 Group F match at Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. Three days later on 18 June 2016 Hungary drew (1–1) with Iceland at the Stade Vélodrome, Marseille. Hungary drew (3–3) with Portugal at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, Lyon on 22 June 2016.

Leekens was replaced by Honvéd's former manager Marco Rossi. Marco Rossi debuted as the new coach of Hungary on 8 September 2018 against Finland in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League series. In the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League edition, Hungary finished second in their group; thus, they were promoted to the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League B.

In the last two rounds, Hungary beat Estonia 2–0 at home, and Finland 2–0 at home. Since Greece lost to Estonia at home, Hungary finished second in their group and their chances to qualify for the UEFA Euro 2020 remained alive.\n\n\n2020s\n\n\nEuro 2020 qualification\nIn the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, Hungary finished fourth in their group. On 21 March 2019, Hungary lost to Slovakia 2–0 at the Anton Malatinský Stadium, Trnava, Slovakia.

In the first match, Hungary beat Bulgaria 3–1 on 8 October 2020 at the Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia, Bulgaria. Since Romania lost to Iceland at the Laugardalsvöllur, Reykjavík, Iceland, Hungary could play at the newly-built Puskás Aréna in Budapest. One day before the national team's decisive Euro 2020 qualifiers play-off match against Iceland, Rossi was tested positive for COVID-19. On 12 November 2020, Hungary qualified for the UEFA Euro 2020 by beating Iceland 2–1 at home.\n\n\nEuro 2020\nThe UEFA Euro 2020 was held in 11 different cities in Europe among which there was Budapest. However, during the drawing procedure Germany was also drawn into the same group; therefore, Hungary could play only two matches in Budapest and the final match against Germany was played in Munich. The competition was originally scheduled for 2020; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was organised only in 2021. There were severe restrictions for the number of spectators in almost all stadiums, except for the Puskás Aréna.\nThe first match of the group was played against title holders Portugal.

On 14 October 2023, Hungary beat Serbia 2–1 at the Puskás Aréna in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match.\nBefore the match against Bulgaria, there were several problems for Rossi to solve. First, there were several players who were injured such as Orbán, Sallai, Fiola, and Varga. Rossi invited Németh to team and told him to leave Hamburg to have more chances for him to play regularly. Second, the Bulgarian Football Union asked the UEFA to hold the last home qualifiers behind closed doors to avoid any possibilities for the Bulgarian fans to protest. The location of the match was also changed from Sofia to Plovdiv. A week before the match it turned out that the match cannot be played in Plovdiv, because the stadium was being renovated. On 14 November 2023, the Bulgarian Football Union changed the location for a second time from Polvdiv to Sofia. In an interview with Nemzeti Sport, Cosimo Inguscio, the second coach of Hungary, said that Hungary should not aim to play a draw against Bulgaria because that approach always leads to a defeat. Hungary needed 1 point to qualify for the   UEFA Euro 2024 before the match against Bulgaria. On 16 November 2023, Hungary drew with Bulgaria and qualified for the finals. The first goal was scored by Ádám; however, Bulgaria could equalize and take the lead. In the 97th minute Aleks Petkov scored an own goal, thus, equalizing the result 2–2.

    "text": "Expenditures by Canadian universities on scientific research and development accounted for about 40% of all spending on scientific research and development in Canada in 2006.\nResearch in the natural and social sciences in Canada, with a few important exceptions, is almost exclusively funded by the Canadian taxpayer and is distributed to universities by five important federal funding agencies, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Additional monies are also provided by the Canada Research Chairs organization, which provides financing for the staffing of research personnel at Canadian universities and the Canada Foundation for Innovation, which supports the acquisition of scientific research infrastructure by Canadian universities, colleges, research hospitals, and non-profit research institutions.\nIn 2006, total spending on scientific and industrial research in Canada amounted to C$28.067 billion or about 2 percent of GDP. In 2006, Canadian universities spent C$10.890 billion on research and development, representing about 40 percent of all R&D spending in Canada and about .66 percent of Canada's GDP.\nBelow are the names of those university institutions that carry out both natural and social science research, although the emphasis here is on the former. The largest part of funding from NSERC, is received by 15 universities, not surprisingly the largest in the country, which have formed an association named the U15. The list below ranks the members of this group in order of NSERC grant size. A number of thematically specialized virtual university research organizations, the Networks of Excellence, have been established and are listed here.

    "summary": "Expenditures by Canadian universities on scientific research and development accounted for about 40% of all spending on scientific research and development in Canada in 2006.\nResearch in the natural and social sciences in Canada, with a few important exceptions, is almost exclusively funded by the Canadian taxpayer and is distributed to universities by five important federal funding agencies, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Additional monies are also provided by the Canada Research Chairs organization, which provides financing for the staffing of research personnel at Canadian universities and the Canada Foundation for Innovation, which supports the acquisition of scientific research infrastructure by Canadian universities, colleges, research hospitals, and non-profit research institutions.\nIn 2006, total spending on scientific and industrial research in Canada amounted to C$28.067 billion or about 2 percent of GDP. In 2006, Canadian universities spent C$10.890 billion on research and development, representing about 40 percent of all R&D spending in Canada and about .66 percent of Canada's GDP.\nBelow are the names of those university institutions that carry out both natural and social science research, although the emphasis here is on the former. The largest part of funding from NSERC, is received by 15 universities, not surprisingly the largest in the country, which have formed an association named the U15. The list below ranks the members of this group in order of NSERC grant size. A number of thematically specialized virtual university research organizations, the Networks of Excellence, have been established and are listed here. Also included are the names of some particular research organizations and projects notable for their large size or for other characteristics. This is followed by a brief description of the expenditures on scientific research and development by sector. Finally the list includes those support organizations that fund scientific research at the university level or contribute to its success in other ways.",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=16661050",
    "text": "Spaced learning is a learning method in which highly condensed learning content is repeated three times, with two 10-minute breaks during which distractor activities such as physical activities are performed by the students.  It is based on the temporal pattern of stimuli for creating long-term memories reported by R. Douglas Fields in Scientific American in 2005.  This 'temporal code' Fields used in his experiments was developed into a learning method for creating long-term memories by Paul Kelley, who led a team of teachers and scientists as reported in Making Minds in 2008.\nA paper on the method has been published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.  This makes a substantial scientific case for this approach to learning based on research over many years in different species.  The distinctive features of the approach are made clear: the speed of instruction being minutes (as opposed to hours, days or months), the spaces and their function, and why content is repeated three times. Spaced learning has been reported in other species as being required for long-term memory creation, a finding that gives considerable weight to its use in education.\n\n\nBackground\nSpaced Learning had been developed by Kelley and his team over years and rather confusingly was not called 'Spaced Learning' at first. \nEarlier descriptions of Spaced Learning often led to its being misunderstood, and the scientific origins of the approach ignored. When the initial reports of outcomes were made public, media seized upon the condensed learning content as the key element in the approach used and the BBC national television news, The Sunday Times, The Independent, and The Economist reported the approach largely in those terms ('8 minute lessons'). This emphasis was misplaced, since Spaced Learning as a method depends on the length and number of the spaces (Fields' 'temporal code'), not the content presentation (which can vary).  However, this misunderstanding was also included in reports in the educational press, notably The Times Educational Supplement.\nThe description of the approach as 'Spaced Learning', clarifying the importance of the spaces, only appeared later.  Additional research reported in The Times Educational Supplement, The Guardian, The Times, and The Daily Telegraph on 30 January 2009 reported that Spaced Learning successfully prepared students for a national examination in less than two hours with no traditional teaching at all.\nThe use of the term 'spaced' reflects the distinction in other research between 'spaced training' and 'massed training' where there have been conflicting results reported (for example, see spaced repetition). Spaced retrieval practice – trying to recover long-term memories quickly and accurately – is the subject of a different line of research but also shows that spaced practice (for example, taking a practice test every month) is more effective than massed practice.\nThe significance of Spaced Learning may prove important in different ways:\n\nas a demonstration that neuroscience is now producing outcomes that can be directly implemented in education – as asserted by Kelley.  This seems established now through the academic paper in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience\nas a demonstration that primary neuroscientific research can demonstrate processes that have not been used in formal education, yet are of fundamental importance in the learning process\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nEich, Eric. \"The Cognitive Science of Learning Enhancement: Optimizing Long-Term Retention\".

    "text": "Masonic myths occupy a central place in Freemasonry. Derived from founding texts or various biblical legends, they are present in all Masonic rites and ranks. Using conceptual parables, they can serve Freemasons as sources of knowledge and reflection, where history often vies with fiction. They revolve mainly around the legendary stories of the construction of Solomon's temple, the death of its architect Hiram, and chivalry. Some of the original mythical themes are still part, to a greater or lesser extent and explicitly, of the symbols that make up the corpus and history of speculative Freemasonry. Some myths, however, have had no real posterity, but can still be found in some high grades, or in the symbolism of some rituals. Others borrow from the medieval imagination or from religious mysticism, and do not bother with historical truths to create legendary filiations with vanished guilds or orders.\n\n\nMyths and Freemasonry\nMyths in Freemasonry appear to be fundamental elements in the construction of ideas and feelings that are transmitted within the corpus of Masonic lodges and Freemasons. They contribute to their expression and ensure continuity for each Freemason, between the rite, practices and Masonic culture. As with other mythologies, the importance and quality of the combination of story elements is greater than the facts themselves. As a result, there is no one true or official version of Masonic myths, their richness often deriving from the multitude of possible interpretations.\nThey follow a certain chronological narrative, which is completed with more or less marked variations, the fundamental principles repeating themselves regularly. Three great myths make up the main corpus of speculative Freemasonry: that of the construction of the temple, which, without assuming a primordial place, offers continuity and centrality; that of the legend of Hiram, which stems from the possibility for Freemasonry to reach an anthropological universal and remains the main legend of Freemasonry; and that of medieval chivalry, with its human values of solidarity, loyalty and virtue.\nThe main point to emerge from all the Masonic myths is that the legends make use of targeted psychological research \"tools\" that revolve mainly around moral and spiritual self-improvement, self-building, brotherhood and death. The myths are linked, as they evolve, by a heroic figure who is never mentioned at first, and who unfolds in Masonic rituals. This heroic figure is portrayed and staged by the recipient at the first grade initiation ceremony, and the other degrees deepen this process by bringing out biblical heroes who link the degrees together, energizing and fertilizing the imagination and personal research.\n\n\nMain myths\n\n\nThe construction myth\nThe myth of construction is consubstantial with Freemasonry; it draws part of its symbolism from the history of various constructions, real or legendary, such as the pyramids, the Tower of Babel, the Temple of Jerusalem or cathedrals. While the model of Solomon's temple is the one adopted by Masonic mythology, the construction practiced by speculative Freemasons is part of a broader movement that historian Yves Hivert-Messeca described in 2017 as \"Masonic constructivism\". This constructivism is based on the principles of building, deconstructing and freely rebuilding a man or woman, a spiritual edifice and a better world, all at the same time. The myth thus takes two complementary directions, one epistemological, philosophical and spiritual, the other cultural, philanthropic and critical. This myth, with its multiple and adaptable interpretative force, proposes a set of interpretations to be patiently worked out, alone or with others.\nThe construction myth does not appear in the anciens devoirs (old charges) of the Regius manuscript (1390), where King Solomon is mentioned only once. The Cooke manuscript (1410), on the other hand, offers a mythological account that became the basis of the operative legend of Solomon's temple. This vulgate is taken up almost identically by the Grand Lodge n°1 manuscript (1583) and the Watson manuscript (1687). The Drumfries manuscript (1710) and the Graham manuscript (1726) follow the same pattern, adding details to emphasize the Christian character and religiosity of the mythical tale.\nIn the first edition of Anderson's constitutions in 1723, the myth appropriates biblical elements, but proposes the purpose of the construction as the building of a \"place of prayer for all nations\", giving a dimension of universality to the temple that tends to join Masonic universalism. In the 1738 edition, the Masonic character of the myth and construction is accentuated by making Solomon the Grand Master Mason in Jerusalem, and the construction and its protagonists are showered with numerous virtues. The 1738 edition recovers biblical writings without concern for historical veracity, with the aim of glorification, anteriority and legitimization.\nIn the 18th century, the myth of construction around the Masonic temple was used to create a space for inter-denominational exchange and debate. The constitutions evoke the idea of a building site where the search for the supposed vestiges of Masonry and the transmission of a distant Masonic tradition by the Freemasons of the premier Grand Lodge of England served to invent a language made up of signs and words of recognition, as well as a word that enabled the protagonists of the building site to recognize each other, to work and to continue the work in harmony.\n\n\nThe myth of Hiram\n\nA fundamental myth of Freemasonry and the guiding thread of the Master's grade, it appeared in the 1730s. The Hiram myth completely transformed early Masonry, which knew only two grades, by adding a new legend that greatly changed the meaning of initiation. Quickly erasing that of Noah, it became universally established in speculative Freemasonry.\nThe character of Hiram and the myth that would accompany his legend do not appear in the original or first-generation manuscripts, Régius and Cook, of operative masonry in the 14th century. The mention of an architect \"master of geometry and chief of all masons\" does appear in the second-generation manuscripts in Grand Lodge n°. 1, but his identity is not clearly established. Hypotheses have been put forward to explain these variations, ranging from a simple spelling error by the texts' reproducers, to the corruption of a primitive Hiram legend and its reinstatement during the eighteenth century.\nIn 1723, the first version of Anderson's constitutions refers to \"a prince of architects\" by the name of Hiram Abiff. This appointment was made in conjunction with the appearance of a Master's grade based on the figure of Hiram in the manuscripts of the old charges of the Spencer family, notably between 1725 and 1729.\nWhile the legend's sources remain difficult to establish, 21st-century historians generally opt for a composite myth, made up of several stories based on the Bible: a story about Noah's sons who sought to relieve their father in order to learn his secret; a story about Bezalel and the teaching of the art of building, the secrets surrounding it and which he lavished on the two sons of a king; finally, a story about King Solomon and the building of the temple, in which the architect Hiram appears as the son of a Tyrian and a widow from the tribe of Naphtali. The first story comes from the Graham manuscript, which was the first text to mention the recovery of a body and a secret lost through the death of the holder; the second recounts the marvellous talents and qualities of Bezalel and his secrets of the art, which were to be \"kept in the heart\"; and finally, the third evokes Hiram as the wisest overseer and transmitter of the signs giving rights to masons. The superimposition of these three myths almost gives the full account of the Hiram legend given in Samuel Prichard's 1730 book La Maçonnerie disseéquée.\nThe myth and the legend of Hiram that derive from it differ greatly from other Masonic myths or legends of the builder's trade, which evolve over time and are adapted as times and transmissions change. It appears to be a deliberate construction designed to structure another grade and encourage a more aristocratic type of Masonry, but also to develop a new and different vision of Freemasonry. The Hiram myth revealed a work of scholarship in its constitution that was also, in its time and according to historian Roger Dachez, a political instrument of the young and premier Grand Lodge of England. It brought to the rituals the same innovations and literary qualities as Anderson's constitutions when they were first published for the birth of obediential Freemasonry, both creations stemming from the same movement.\n\n\nThe myth of chivalry\nAlthough the chivalric myth developed mainly in France, it made its first appearance in the first constitutions in 1723: in a short passage, Anderson established a link between chivalry and Freemasonry.\nFollowing a process of integration that historians trace back the development of the old chivalry to the speech given by the Scottish chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay in 1736, the ancient chivalry became a founding Masonic myth. Sword, cordon and the initiation ceremony are a direct descendant of chivalry, where fraternity of arms reflects fraternity in the lodge. The number of chivalrous ranks multiplied from 1740 onwards. The chivalric myth, through this legendary filiation, anchors the nascent Freemasonry in a form of immemorial legitimacy, with masonry and chivalry attributed ancient origins. The myth also offers a way forward for Freemasons wishing to combine action and spirituality.\nFrom the second half of the eighteenth century onwards, it took on crucial importance in Freemasonry, particularly in its high ranks. At the height of the Age of Enlightenment, when rationalism was slowly gaining ground, it was seen as a movement to re-sacralize the faith, tinged with various currents of mysticism, Christianity and occultism. The appropriation of chivalric myths was facilitated by original rituals, such as the medieval ritual of initiation, which has been fully adopted by some chivalric Masonic grades. In France, the oldest attested grade to use chivalric myth is that of \"Chevalier de l'Orient\", dating from 1748. The legendary plot revolves around the rebuilding of the Second Temple, with a terminal vocation in the eighteenth century as part of a Freemason's journey.\nThis myth also makes the knight mason a worker who claims a filiation with the stonemasons and cathedral builders, proposing that he now works \"with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other\", in the image of the 3rd Order of the French Rite. In this dual role, he asserts himself as a fighter concerned with the fate of the world, but also in search of spirituality. He anchors himself in the ideal of a sublimated past and towards a better future, summing up his action in a dialectic between tradition and progress. Nevertheless, his evolution away from the original operative and workers' references is certainly less rewarding. It is closer to a model where the rules and pomp of a religious and military order give additional prestige and grounds for flattery, sometimes vanity, to a few aristocrats and notables who easily gain access to the ranks that symbolize it.\n\n\nOriginal myths\n\n\nThe Euclid myth\n\nThe importance of Euclid in the manuscripts of the Old Charges of English operative masonry is apparent from the very first lines, in the opening formula, \"Here begin the statutes of the art of geometry according to Euclid\". Through the mythical narrative evoked by the Regius manuscript, Euclid instituted the seven liberal arts, another name for the seven sciences, and the primary reference of the myth. In his writings, Euclid is the most learned of all the crafts, and the one who taught them in Egypt and other countries, where he spread geometry and the various trades. The Cook manuscript takes up the myth, but integrates it into the biblical story that makes Euclid one of Abraham's pupils, and where he is the first to designate geometry under his name. The second-generation manuscripts of the Old Charges from 1583 onwards retain Euclid as the main myth of their moral regulation: in 1710, manuscript Dumfries n°. 4, without much difference to the preceding writings, grants him the additional gift of prophecy, thus taking a further step in the construction of the myth, with the divinatory arts entering into the idea of transcendence, whether religious or not. The myth of Euclid thus serves the praise heaped in these founding texts on geometry, considered a superior science and the principal instrument of economic, artisanal and political management.\nThe gradual disappearance of references to Euclid began in the last manuscripts of the old charges, which no longer evoked him as the inventor and disseminator of the liberal sciences, while retaining the central function of geometry in the myth of the operatives. The first edition of Anderson's Constitutions in 1723 of so-called speculative Freemasonry, retained the liberal arts, but gave only a more restricted place to Euclid, described as \"admirable\". It removed him from the fundamental role conferred on him by operative masonry, in favor of the biblical figure of Adam. The Greek geometer and his myth gradually disappeared from the mythology of Freemasonry, as the rationalist spirit, based on reasoning and measurement, seemed to clash with the biblical and religious component that came to the fore in the first constitutions governing the organization of the Premier Grand Lodge of England.\n\n\nThe myth of Noah\n\nThe first-generation manuscripts of the old charges, between 1390 and 1420, mention Noah only briefly, with the evocations focusing more clearly on the great Flood, which serves as a historical time reference for the construction of the myth. The second-generation manuscript Grand Lodge no. 1 (1583) completes the positioning of the Flood to evoke the before and after of the event. Speculative Freemasonry evokes it briefly in the historical section and in the first two chants of Anderson's constitutions, in the first version in 1723. In this evocation, Noah and his three sons are recognized as \"authentic Masons\", who continue the dissemination and transmission of antediluvian arts and traditions.\nIn 1738, the second edition of the Constitutions gave greater prominence to the figure of Noah, presenting him for the first time as the father of Masonry. Masons are expected to act as \"true sons of Noah\", who built the ark with the help of his three sons. The myth proposed by the constitutions in this version is that of a world whose origin is Masonic, and whose first Masons are called \"Noachides\". Chevalier Ramsay, in his speech in 1736, exalts the same myth, describing the patriarch as the order's first Grand Master and inventor of naval architecture. These founding texts of Freemasonry reinforce and attempt to establish Noachism in Masonic legend, which is now based on a universal myth that predates all religious dogma.\nIn a founding text from 1726, the Graham manuscript, the characters of Noah and his three sons are portrayed in substituted forms, positions and words, clearly foreshadowing the scenes described in the legend of Hiram, which eventually took precedence over the legend of the Master Mason grade. The myth of Noah lives on, however, through adopted masonry, whose ceremonial focus is on access to Noah's ark. The myth can also be found in the 20th degree of the Order of the Royal Secret, under the name of \"Grand Patriarch\", precursor of the 21st degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, under the name of \"Prussian Chevalier or Noachite\".\n\n\nThe myth of Babel\n\nThe myth of the Tower of Babel has several interpretations in Masonic texts. A moralistic biblical version, an opposing one that proposes a positive vision of the tower's construction, and Anderson's constitutions, which synthesize both. The Régius manuscript of operative masonry includes the story of the Tower of Babel in its religious prescriptions. The meaning remains close to that of the biblical texts: a manifestation of man's pride in God, which is undone by the confusion of languages. A few centuries later, this more guilt-ridden version is found in the legend of a high grade of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the 21st degree. The myth is also to be found in adopted Masonry, in the form of a fault committed by the \"children of the earth\".\nOther founding texts, while taking up the myth of the tower, do not retain the fault as the main element, but give a more positive interpretation. This is already the case in the Cooke manuscript (1420), as well as in the old second-generation charges, from 1580 onwards, which exalt the craft and the desire to build, retaining neither pride nor fault in the behavior of men who loyally pass on the rules of the craft to one another.\nAnderson's version of the constitutions is a synthesis of the old charges and the Old Testament version. In the legendary account of the constitutions, the name of the Tower of Babel is not explicitly mentioned, but the myth is clearly evident. While the punishment remains the same, it is merely a consequence of the fact that, in spite of it all, mankind acquired exceptional skills in the art of building, and the fault led to great progress. In this version, it's an accepted idea, but it doesn't constrain the progress of the human race around Freemasonry, bringing out the idea that the Babel myth symbolizes excessive disorder, whereas the construction of the temple, which prevails in the Freemasonry legend, represents a symbolic building site of unity and universality.\n\n\nThe myth of Eve\n\nWhile Anderson's constitutions, in their 1723 version, trace the first Masonic lodge back to the Earthly Paradise, where Adam and his two sons are present, Eve is not mentioned in this evocation. This exclusion was not effective in Europe throughout the eighteenth century, where many aristocratic women were received as \"freemasons\", through adopted Masonry, where the rite of adoption incorporated the myth of Eve. Ritualized in various forms, the myth of Eve is most often used for the second grade, and is linked to the apple and the serpent. The first woman appears alongside Adam on tracing boards, where the tree of knowledge appears in the heart of the terrestrial Paradise. In the second grade, recipients are invited to experience the story of Eve in a different symbolic way, by biting into the apple that gives them the knowledge of good and evil. This myth suggests that women of this century should use their reason and will to make choices with knowledge of the first state, and thus be capable of practicing the virtues. What it proposes is, in this symbolism, a gesture that is no longer a fault but a desire for knowledge and the possibility of choice. In this way, the myth of Eve brings women into Freemasonry from its earliest manifestations.\n\n\nRomanesque myths\n\n\nThe operative myth\nThe operative myth has long been alive in the imagination of Freemasonry, making speculative Masons the heirs of the cathedral builders. According to a fairly simple hypothesis, speculative Freemasons, while no longer using the tools of the operative Masons in a practical way, have inherited them and the symbols, rules and secrets that go with them. Historical documentation from the seventeenth century and into the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries provides several records of \"freemasons\" and \"lodges\" in England and Scotland on major medieval building sites. The similarity of the semantics employed suggests a continuity. Until the 20th century, this mythical legacy enjoyed a tenacious success, being explained by the theory of transition, which, in the space of a few years, would have transformed disaffected operative lodges into speculative lodges where the construction of cathedrals was replaced by that of intellectual edifices, thanks to the acceptance of gentleman masons as protectors and donors.\nHowever, the proven non-existence of operative lodges, which disappeared as early as the end of the 15th century for political reasons during the Tudor period in England, and the first accepted Freemasons (\"gentlemen masons\"), who are only attested to at the beginning of the 17th century in Scotland and England, render this transition and the myth of Freemasons as heirs to the builders of cathedrals ineffective. In Scotland, these admissions of non-operational notables, which are rare but clearly documented, are mainly symbolic receptions of notables in operative lodges governed by Schaw statutes, who never or very rarely set foot in their reception lodge again. Without taking part in the work of lodges that generally meet only once a year, no transformation or mutation is possible. The operative myth, with its use of signs, symbols and coded languages provided by the ancient Masonic brotherhoods, was nevertheless used to develop speculative Freemasonry, borrowing some of its codes. The nobility of the architecture and possible philosophical evolutions, supported by the vast and abundant literature of the Renaissance, were to bring together notables and intellectuals who wished, above all, to live in harmony, in an era of religious confrontation.\n\n\nThe Templar myth\n\nThe myth of the founding Order of the Temple surviving through Freemasonry was to become an autonomous part of the Masonic heritage, late in the middle of the eighteenth century, by which time Freemasonry had established clear practices and structures of its own. The myth of the Templars was first established in response to an aristocratic public which, apart from the chivalric myth of Ramsay's speech, from which the Templars were absent, showed a renewed interest in the history of chivalric orders in general, and the Order of the Temple in particular, on which various authors produced works from the end of the 17th century, such as Pierre Dupuy's Histoire de la condamnation des Templiers, published in 1654 and reprinted several times until 1751.\nIn the 1740s, a Masonic system was established in Germany, which took the name of Templar Strict Observance and enjoyed considerable success for almost twenty years. This system took the Templar myth to its logical conclusion, teaching and asserting that Freemasonry, under the guise of a peaceful fraternity, was none other than the concealed Order of the Temple, which had survived persecution by taking refuge in the operative lodges of Scotland. This \"neo-Templar\" system later became one of the founding components of the Rectified Scottish Rite, whose structure is partly based on it. The Freemasonry heir to the Templar chevaliers is also rooted in a terminal grade of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Knight Kadosh. In the Francken manuscripts of 1764, the legendary story of the Templars is used extensively in the ritual of the grade.\nHowever, 20th- and 21st-century scholars and masonologists have been unanimous in their refutation of the idea of a Templar origin, even a remote one, as this is a matter for the fictional history of Freemasonry, and the claim that this chivalric order survived within Masonry is considered a fabrication.\n\n\nThe alchemist and Rosicrucian myth\nAlchemists and Rosicrucians are also part of the romanesque myths of Freemasonry, sometimes cited as hidden founders. The seventeenth century saw the appearance of three manifestos known as the \"Order of the Rosicrucian\", mainly written by members of the Tübingen Cenacle, all Lutheran theology students. These young idealists imagined and hoped for the advent of a more tolerant, more peaceful world, reconciling faith and emerging science, and expressed this hope in the form of allegorical tales. Kabbalistic doctrines, moral emblems, alchemical and Hermetic symbols were integrated into these manifestos. Later, the existence of a number of symbols in Masonic initiation rituals, such as mercury and sulfur in the chamber of reflection, or the air, water and fire tests of first-degree initiation in certain rituals, enabled comparisons to be made without historicity. These approximations, which appear in the latter half of the 18th century, add a romanesque myth to the story of the creation of Freemasonry, a myth that is not part of its original legends. Rosicrucian mysticism, successful in a period of intellectual effervescence, was nevertheless to influence the young Freemasonry, which borrowed several symbols from its corpus and imbued this new legend with a Masonic grade whose first rituals appeared around 1760, that of Sovereign Rosicrucian Prince or Knight Rosicrucian.\n\n\nSee also\n\nMyth\nMasonic manuscripts\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nLa Chaîne d'Union, HS n°6, 2017:\n\nFrançois Cavaignac, Les Mythes maçonniques revisités (in French), 2016:\n\nRoger Dachez et Alain Bauer, La Franc-maçonnerie (in French), 2016:\n\nPierre Mollier, La Chevalerie maçonnique (in French), 2005:\n\n\nBibliography\nHabbas, Christophe (2017). \"Ces mythes qui nourrissent la franc-maçonnerie\".

A London branch formed in 1977. They describe themselves as a political organisation campaigning for Jewish rights and the rights of all oppressed minorities in building a socialist future.\nThe JSG supported the original Anti-Nazi League and was active in street-level militant anti-fascism. It participated in the  Beyond the Fragments conference which sought to renew democratic socialism.\nIn the early 1980s, it was active in campaigning for peace in Israel/Palestine.\nIt developed a perspective via drawing on the tradition of the Bund, stressing Yiddishism, cultural pluralism and a commitment to the vitality of the diaspora.\nIn the mid-1980s, it became associated with the Greater London Council's municipal socialism and multiculturalism, receiving funding to launch Jewish Cultural and Anti-Racist Project (JCARP). Additionally, it was frequently in conflict with the Jewish communal leadership and in particular, the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women (AJEX).\n\nThe JSG has been critical of allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, stating in April 2016: Accusations of anti-Semitism are currently being weaponised to attack the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party with claims that Labour has a 'problem' of anti-Semitism... This is despite Corbyn's longstanding record of actively opposing fascism and all forms of racism, and being a firm a supporter of the rights of refugees and of human rights globally.In 2021, when the owners of the Pink Peacock were charged with a breach of the peace in response to them displaying tote bags with the phrase \"Fuck the Police/Daloy Politsey\" on them, the JSG sent a message of solidarity:The Jewish Socialists' Group sends solidarity to comrades of the Pink Peacock Queer Yiddish Anarchist café after the recent attacks you have experienced against your premises... Daloy Politsey (Down With the Police) was sung on demonstrations by our political forebears as part of their courageous collective struggle against antisemitism and state repression in Tsarist Russia. At the Jewish Socialists' Group's annual secular socialist Seder Nights we continue this tradition and sing the chorus with the modern colloquial translation popularised by Geoff Berner.Since the start of the Gaza war, the JSG has called for an unlimited ceasefire. In a statement the JSG said:The Jewish Socialists' Group stands for a future of peace and coexistence for the people in Israel and Palestine that can only be based on equality, justice, freedom and an end to occupation, colonisation and apartheid practices that reflect racist and fascist values of supremacy... We stand fully behind the right to resist occupation and oppression and the siege of Gaza. We stand also against the targeting of civilians, and our opposition to acts of terror against civilians applies equally whether they are carried out by individuals, resistance movements or state armies... The attack on Israeli civilians was a war crime and a crime against humanity... The same can be said of the massive, continuing Israeli attacks on Gaza. Both are despicable.It has also been engaged with protesting with groups such as Jewish Voice for Labour, Na'amod, Jewdas, Jewish Solidarity Action, Black Jewish Alliance, and Jews for Justice for Palestinians in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\n\nPublications\nA magazine, Jewish Socialist, was launched in spring 1985 and continues publication today. The paper was conceived of in 1984 after a demonstration members of the JSG had attended.\n\n\nSee also\nJewish Labour Movement\nJewish Voice for Labour\nJewdas\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "No Safe Spaces is a 2019 American documentary film directed by Justin Folk that features commentator Dennis Prager and comedian Adam Carolla talking to college students and faculty about university safe spaces. The documentary also covers free speech controversies occasioned when conservatives are invited to speak in university settings.\nThe film was released in Arizona theaters on October 25, 2019, and was successful enough to have a national release on December 6, 2019. It has received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\nContent\nWith production beginning in 2017, the filmmakers were on hand for commentator Ben Shapiro's September 14, 2017, speech at the University of California, Berkeley, a site of civic protests and unrest. The film focuses on such speech disruptions in the United States of America, but also examines similar incidents in Canada with Jordan Peterson. In particular, it shows the case of Lindsay Shepherd who was disciplined at Wilfrid Laurier University for using a recording of a debate with Peterson in class. It also \"denounce[s] censorship in China\". \"Carolla said, 'We'd be hypocrites if we did a movie about the suppression of free speech but didn't mention China.'\"\nIn a scene filmed at the Laugh Factory, comedians complain that audiences on college campuses are too easily offended now. Among these comedians are Adam Carolla with Karith Foster, and Tim Allen.\nThe film discusses the story of Bret Weinstein, a biology professor at the Evergreen State College in Washington state, who resigned after he was criticized for attending the university during a \"Day of Absence\" that was a long-standing tradition. Each year ethnic minorities would voluntarily stay home from campus to highlight their contributions to the college. In 2017, students attempted to compel white staff and students to stay away from the school, which Weinstein refused to do. Compulsion was also an issue discussed in the segments with Jordan Peterson, who gained international attention when he refused to adopt gender-neutral language, calling it an unwelcome form of compelled speech.\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, the filmmakers worked to include \"left-leaning\" views in their movie. CNN's Van Jones complains that too many young people have not learned how to defend their views. Attorney Alan Dershowitz criticizes many college leaders and \"the hard left\" for not standing up for free speech. Commentator Dave Rubin argues that liberals should also fear \"the mob\". The film shows former U.S. President Barack Obama saying \"Anybody who comes to speak to you... you shouldn't silence them.\"\nAlso in the film are Sharyl Attkisson, Candace Owens, Ann Coulter, and Cornel West.\nThe filmmakers have disputed its PG-13 rating.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nBox office\nAs of March 2020, the movie had taken in $1.3 million at the box office. On its opening night, the film earned an estimated $45,000 on one screen in Phoenix, the production team said, adding that the only documentary that earned more from one screen on an opening weekend was Michael Moore's Sicko in 2007. The per-screen average was $3,542. No Safe Spaces, which opened in limited release on October 25, 2019, came close to topping Terminator: Dark Fate in Denver and San Diego theater complexes over the weekend, and ended up finishing a close second to the Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster in those venues after final figures came in.\nAfter its theatrical release, Salem Media Group made the film available as a video on demand. This is the first time Salem distributed a film. Prager criticized Netflix for rejecting the film, but paying $10 million for Knock Down the House, which did not have a theatrical release.\n\n\nCritical response\nNo Safe Spaces has received mixed reviews from professional critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 47%, based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. Metacritic reports a 31 out of 100 score, based on five reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\nSeveral critics panned the film as biased. For The A.V. Club, Vadim Rizov gave the film an F, summing up, \"This isn't an argument for free speech, it's just paranoid whining, complete with a roundtable of comics sympathetically agreeing how sad and scary this all is, plus images of the Statue of Liberty with tape over its mouth.\" John Wenzel of The Denver Post gave the film two stars and noted \"Frequently, the film asserts that words have power – why else would you want to make sure colleges are hosting conservative speakers? – but then hedges the assertion by saying people are too readily offended these days. Which is it?\" The Los Angeles Times review also panned it as one-sided and \"disappointing agitprop\".\nSeveral critics reviewed the movie positively. Alan Ng of Film Threat gave the film a 90 and wrote in his review, \"When it's all said and done, this film is offensive only to those who don't want to watch it.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the movie's defense of free speech, stating \"the most head-turning point made by No Safe Spaces is that today's anti-free-speech radicals, who on many college campuses dominate the discourse, are going to be tomorrow's leaders.\" Nathanial Bell of LA Weekly gave a positive review, saying: \"While somewhat loose and undisciplined in its structure, the film builds a case that academia is the primary battleground in a war to eliminate ideological diversity in the United States\" Bell observed that, \"the movie doesn’t bother to extrapolate on why people would want to boycott people like Ben Shapiro in the first place.\"\n\n\nOther responses\nAccording to a column in National Review by John Fund, the film was widely praised by conservative commentators. John Kass called the film \"profoundly important\" in a Chicago Tribune column.\n\n\nSee also\nAcademic freedom\nChicago principles\nIntellectual dark web\nHeterodox Academy\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nNo Safe Spaces at IMDb\nNo Safe Spaces at Rotten Tomatoes\nNo Safe Spaces at Metacritic",

    "text": "Mary Galway Houston (27 July 1871 – 24 April 1962) was an Irish craftswoman, teacher, and author. She was known for her leather work and repoussé metalwork, and for her writings on the history of costume and costume design.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMary Galway Houston was born 27 July 1871 at Coleraine Academical Institution, Coleraine, County Londonderry. She was the daughter of Thomas Galway Houston, headmaster of Coleraine Academical Institution, and Maud Steen Houston (née Millar). She attended the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, winning a number of prizes in final year. She exhibited leather work, repoussé metalwork, lace and crochet designs as well as drawings at the Royal Dublin Society (1894-1896) and at the first exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1895. She entered the Royal College of Art in London in 1896, regularly exhibiting with the English Arts and Crafts Society and the Royal Academy of Arts from 1901. During this time, she entered numerous national competitions, with her submissions often used as illustrations in art magazines. Houston was a gold medallist for the 1898 competition to design the modelled leather cover for the Kelmscott Chaucer.\n\n\nArtistic career\nHouston became increasingly lauded for the leather work, exhibiting leather bookbindings and embossed-and-modelled leather panels from 1898 to 1903. She wrote an article on embossed and chased leatherwork in the Art Workers' Quarterly (1903) which was illustrated with her set of four relief panels scenes from Homer. Houston also undertook work in other media including needlework, and working silver, copper, and tin in repoussé metalwork. At the 1899 English Arts and Crafts Society exhibition she exhibited an art-nouveau silver mirror-back, and at the 1900 Paris exhibition with a three-piece toilet in beaten silver. All of her early work is predominantly in Art Nouveau, with her moving to a more Celtic style from around 1900. These Celtic designs drew on Irish myth and legend, drawing on ancient Celtic and medieval Irish prototypes.\nIn 1900 The Studio magazine commissioned her to create two silver cups to accompany an article calling for the improvement of the design of sporting trophies and sups. This was her first attempt at metal working in the round, and she drew inspiration from the Dunvegan Cup and Methers, an ancient three-handled vessel. Though she was based in London, Houston continued to exhibit at the RDS and the annual exhibitions of the Irish Decorative Art Association. In 1903, she designed a tapestry panel of A voyage to Tir-na-noge for the Dun Emer Guild, and in 1904 created a tooled leather album cover which was presented to James Brenan upon his retirement. From 1903, Houston taught at the Camberwell School of Art in London.\n\n\nWriting\nHouston developed an interest in the history of dress and costume design and went on to publish A technical history of costume in three volumes: Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920, co-authored with Florence S. Hornblower), Ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine costume and decoration, including Cretan costume (1931), and Medieval costume in England and France: the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries (1939).\n\n\nPublished books\nAncient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations  (1920)\nAncient Greek, Roman and Byzantine costume and decoration (1931)\nMedieval costume in England & France, the 13th, and 14th and 15th centuries (1939)\nAncient Egyptian, Mesopotamian & Persian costume and decoration  (1954)\n\n\nLater life\nTowards the end of her life, Houston rarely exhibited. Her final publication was in 1954, with a second edition of the revised and retitled Ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Persian costume. It is believed she moved back to Ireland some time after this point. Houston's exact death date and place of death are generally stated to be unknown, but she appears to have died in Coleraine on 24 April 1962.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Flett Exchange is an environmental commodity exchange and brokerage firm based in Hoboken, New Jersey.  The company is specialized in trading of Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) in the United States.\n\n\nHistory\nMichael Flett, who has been a member of the New York Mercantile Exchange since 1996, began his career as an energy broker. He was subject to a disciplinary action concerned an allegation that in October, 2004 and November, 2004 he traded ahead of customer Market on Close orders. He submitted a Joint Offer of Settlement without admitting or denying the allegations against him. The Offer, consisting of a fine of $25,000, restitution in the amount of $74,700, and an order to cease and desist from future similar rule violations, was accepted by the Exchange’s Board of Directors at its meeting held on September 19, 2007.  He founded his own company, Flett Futures, Inc., as a broker on the exchange and transitioned it into a proprietary trading firm in 2000. In 2006, Flett founded Flett Exchange to provide price discovery, and liquidity to environmental markets.\n\n\nSolar Renewable Energy Certificates\n\n\nExchange\nFlett Exchange operates an all-electronic exchange to allow participants to buy and sell SRECs online as 24/7 service. The exchange trades SRECs in the states which are in the area of PJM Interconnection which include New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Washington, DC, Delaware and Pennsylvania. Flett Exchange is one of the three major auction and exchange platforms in PJM area beside SREC Marketplace and SRECTrade. As of November 2010, a report to the Prince George’s County Solar Water Heating Task Force indicated that Flett Exchange is the only exchange-based marketplace for Maryland SRECs. However, the value had still been limited due to low transaction levels.\n\n\nSpot Market\nFlett Exchanges' most active market for the sale of SRECs is the Spot Market. Flett Exchange customers utilize its online exchange in which its solar owners log on and sell their SRECs in a transparent and competitive manner. Sales are immediate. Sellers lock in prices and transfer SRECs from their GATs account to the Flett Exchange, LLC GATS account. The Exchange software provides the seller with a contract immediately and the seller is paid via check or electronic bank transfer the same day. Over 7,000 solar owners utilize the Flett Exchange Spot Market to sell their SRECs on a monthly basis.\n\n\nAuctions\nIn the SREC market, there are a couple of methods to conduct SREC auctions.\nOne method is for electric utility companies which are the buyers of SRECs to conduct auctions and solicit sellers. An example is the \"SREC Based Financing Program\" which requires some utility companies in New Jersey to conduct quarterly SREC auctions from new solar projects.\nAnother method is to conduct auctions once a month on specific dates to allow sellers and buyers to get together to transact.\nFlett Exchange provides an auction for its public entity clients. The company facilitates the sales directly by conducting public auctions based on the date scheduled in each contract for each seller. This is a format used by government agencies, municipalities, townships, universities, and school districts to sell their SRECs.\n\n\nLong-term contracts\nThe company also acts as a broker to bring counterparties together to negotiate long-term SREC contracts.\n\n\nPrice transparency\nIn 2009, National Renewable Energy Laboratory reviewed the status of green power marketing in the United States. A concern on price transparency was discussed in the report. Flett Exchange is one of the participants that publicly disclose pricing data to provide market transparency. The company posts results from its Renewable Energy Certificate auctions on its web site and monthly newsletter. It also posts price and volume information on its voluntary transactions. The publicly disclosed prices voluntarily by the participants have allowed analysis into the status of the markets. Flett Exchange provides daily SREC settlement prices to the public on its website for New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington DC and Ohio SRECs.\n\n\nOther markets\nFlett Exchange launched physical markets to bring price transparency to seafood, precious metals and New York City Taxi Medallions but had its most success in environmental commodities. \nIn 2007, Flett Exchange filed an application with the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission to become an Exempt Commercial Markets with a plan to trade in energy products and uranium. It maintained the status of Exempt Commercial Markets between 2007 and 2009 but did not continue after 2009. \nIn 2008, the company launched a platform to get into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap and trade market. However, RGGI trading activities on Flett Exchange had lasted only less than two years. The last trading was in January 2010.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

He was killed in Florida during the Seminole Wars after volunteering to be a combat medic.\n\nFrederick Leitner was born in Stuttgart on February 4, 1812 to Johann Friedrich Leitner and Karoline Friedericke Bühler. His father was a gardener in the court of King Frederick I of Württemberg. At the age of four, his family moved to Schorndorf after the death of his father. Following studies of botany at the University of Tübingen, he moved to the United States after receiving a subsidy from the Society of Natural Sciences in Württemberg.  \nIn 1831, Leitner began taking classes at the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. In 1832, he befriended the famous naturalist John James Audubon while he was visiting Charleston. In 1833, he began to travel to Florida and collect botanical and zoological specimens in the Everglades. During his travels he eventually reached the Florida Keys, during which, he paid a visit to the Dry Tortugas.In 1834, he graduated from medical college with a dissertation on Hippomane mancinella, subsequently working as a lecturer at the South Carolina Medical Society. \nThe Seminole War that began in December 1835 obstructed Leitner's research in Florida, as the region had become a dangerous war zone. Leitner planned to join a U.S. Military unit, as it was the only way he could still travel through Florida and continue his research. In 1836, he traveled to Key West, where he joined Navy officer Levin M. Powell's unit as a guide and surgeon. On 15 January 1838, he was killed by Seminole warriors at the First Battle of the Loxahatchee. It was reported in a newspaper that he was likely targeted by the Seminoles because of his role as a combat medic. His body was never recovered after the battle. \nAt the time of Leitner's death, he was considered one of the world's leading experts on Florida's nature. After his death, 800 of his specimens eventually came into the possession of Jean Louis Cabanis in Germany, however these specimens were completely destroyed during the Bombing of Berlin in 1943. The genus Leitneria is named in his honor, as is the family Leitneriaceae, the latter taxa being circumscribed by George Bentham.\n\n\nPublications associated with Leitner\n\"Edward Frederick Leitner (1812-1838), Physician-botanist\", by George Edmund Gifford (1972).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nEdward Frederick Leitner (1812-1838), Physician-botanist Archived 2015-07-13 at the Wayback Machine Bulletin of the History of Medicine.

    "text": "Witchcraft is a horror film series, that as of March 2018, has 16 direct to video installments, making it one of the horror genre's longest-running interconnected series. It began in 1988, and most films focus, at least partially, on the character of William Spanner, who is a powerful warlock who fights for good despite having an evil lineage.\nIn June 2025, it was announced that Dustin Ferguson would be directing a 17th installment.\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nMythology\nThe series begins when Grace Churchill discovers her husband and mother-in-law's plan to use her newborn child, William, as a means to bring about the end of the world. The husband and mother-in-law are evil witches, who worship Satan. While Grace prevents this from happening, it is thought that only William and his mother  survives the first film. In the second movie, 18 year old William, unaware of his heritage, and having been adopted by the Adams family, finds that his next door neighbor, the witch who survived from the first film, attempts to seduce him to use his powers for darkness. The Adams are white witches who had rejected the evil of the coven from the first film and stole William away.\nWilliam (with Spanner as his last name) resists the temptation, and in between the second and third movie, becomes a lawyer, getting a job in the district attorney's office. After being fired from the district attorney's office (a move which later movies reveal was caused by his black magic roots being discovered) he opens his own law office. Spanner resists his heritage, preferring a normal life, but events conspire to force him to use his powers, often with the fate of the world at stake. Spanner later becomes more comfortable with his powers and his role in protecting the world against the dark powers. Beginning in Witchcraft VI, Spanner often serves as an unofficial consultant for the Los Angeles Police Department, usually working with Detective Lutz and/or Garner.\nWhile Spanner is the main character of the series, he is not in movies 8 and 10, and is only an infant in the first film. He dies at the end of the seventh movie, and remains dead during the eighth movie, but is resurrected in the ninth movie. He does not appear during the tenth movie, which is set in London, England and follows Lt. Lutz as she assist Interpol with a case, although he is referenced.\nKeli is Spanner's Girlfriend in many of the movies, and they are engaged sometime between the tenth and the eleventh movie, but she disappears and is not referred to after the 11th movie.\nThe 14th–16th movies form a connected trilogy. The 16th film takes place in the \"real\" world, pokes fun of the film series recasting of the leads and the low budget nature of the series, using the actors from the 14th and 15th movie. The 16th movie explains that the entire series, and its oft recasting of the leads, is part of a careful plot by Satan to control the world.\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nCast and crew\n\n\nPrincipal cast\nList indicator\n\nA dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n\n\nCrew\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nDevelopment\nAll movies have been produced by Vista Street Entertainment. Troma Studios released films 1–9. The series maintains an official YouTube channel with behind the scenes information  and a Facebook page.\n\n\nReception\nDespite its longevity, the series is not well regarded, and the AV Club notes that the series \"Witchcraft continually relies on the same stock story lines, most often involving a good warlock struggling against trashy temptresses sent by evil warlocks to seduce him to the dark side.\" Crave's series project states the series is \"trashy .... straight-to-video schlock \" and finds little use for the series other than as \"notorious video store staples\". \"The first four movies had the pretense of a supernatural plot and an interconnected mythology, but after that, the series began to slump (or improve, depending on your point of view) in to blatant softcore pornography.\nIn Creature Feature, a review of the first six movies found much of the same, with the third movie being the best of the first six.\nTV Guide states \"It's hard to fathom why this cheap-looking, uninspired series has run so long. Perhaps video store buyers and their customers figure that any series with this many installments has to have something going for it. But they'd be wrong.\" In many of the movies in the series the acting is quite poor by reasonable standards, with the actors sometimes even stumbling over their lines. The sex scenes are often unrealistic and extremely - laughably - fake looking (intercourse movements will be taking place in scenes but in numerous shots you can plainly see the male actor wearing underwear and his genitals well over a foot away from those of the female).\nVideo Reviewer 22 Shots found that the first 4 movies has a small amount of low budget, cheesy charm, the rest of the series \" went more exploitative and sleazy\" and were only recommended for fans of ultra-low budget films.\n\n\nReferences",

As Michael Cox, he had a top-ten hit on the UK singles chart in 1960 with \"Angela Jones\", produced by Joe Meek. He later worked as an actor, and in TV in New Zealand, using both his full name and the name Michael James.\n\n\nLife and career\nHe was born in Huyton, Liverpool. After his four younger sisters wrote to ABC TV demanding that he be given a chance to audition for the pop show Oh Boy!, he was quickly signed up by producer Jack Good, and made his first appearance on the show in April 1959 singing Ricky Nelson's \"Never Be Anyone Else But You\". Good won him a recording deal with Decca Records, and his first single, \"Teenage Love\", was written by Marty Wilde and featured Joe Brown on guitar. However, neither it nor its follow-up \"Too Hot To Handle\" were hits.\nCox continued to appear on TV, in Good's new show Boy Meets Girls, and Good recommended him to record producer Joe Meek, who at the time was setting up his own label, Triumph. His first record for Triumph was \"Angela Jones\", a song written by John D. Loudermilk which was a hit in the US for Johnny Ferguson. Cox's version of the song, produced by Meek, rose to number 7 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1960. The Triumph label collapsed, and Cox's follow-up, the similar-sounding \"Along Came Caroline\", also produced by Meek and co-written by Geoff Stephens and Cox under the pseudonym Michael Steel, was released by the His Master's Voice label; it reached number 41 on the chart and was Cox's only other hit.\nCox was more successful in Scandinavia. His Stand up topped the Swedish best-selling charts for four weeks in January/February 1963. Cox successfully toured in Denmark and Sweden with a backing band, as well as in the UK, and continued to record under Meek's direction for several years. He released singles on the His Master's Voice, Pye and Parlophone labels, many of which featured leading session musicians such as guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. However, his later recordings were not hits and he gave up his recording career to attend drama school in the mid-1960s. In 1966, credited as Michael James Cox, he appeared in the movie Where the Bullets Fly, and he also acted in TV plays and commercials. In 1976, he appeared in the filmed version of the musical written by Roger Glover, The Butterfly Ball.\nIn the late 1970s, he began working on cruise ships, where he met his New Zealand-born wife. He started making appearances in the US, eventually emigrating there, before moving on to live in New Zealand. There, he continued to work on TV, credited as Michael James.\nCompilations of Cox's recordings were issued on CD by Zircon Records in 1999, and Sequel Records in 2003.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDiscography at 45cat.com",

    "text": "Casper Mountain,  an anticline, is located at the north end of the Laramie Mountains overlooking Casper, Wyoming along the North Platte River. At a top elevation of 8,130 feet (2,478 m), the geological feature rises approximately 3,000 feet (914 m) above Casper.\n\n\nGeology\nCasper Mountain is composed of precambrian, paleozoic, and mesozoic rocks. The topography of the mountain has remained the same since the Laramide time period. However, erosion has stripped away the top sedimentary soil, exposing older rocks. Casper Mountain features quartzite, biotite schist, gneiss as well as amphibolite. The Casper Mountain fault line lies on the north side.\nThe rocks on Casper Mountain are significantly older than those found in the city of Casper, predominantly because of the anticline nature of the mountain. Archeologists studying the mountain believe Native Americans were in the area around 11,000 years ago. Stone artifacts found on the mountain date to between 4500 and 2500 B.C.. Campsites of these natives were found near quartzite outcroppings, and it is believed they used this rock for tools, arrowheads, knives, and other items. Casper Mountain has an archeological site operated by the University of Wyoming.\nThe mountain is part of the \"Casper formation\" so named for limestones and sandstones constituting the greater part of the sedimentary rocks in the region, including the Laramie Mountains.\n\n\nRecreation\nCasper Mountain is largely privately owned; however, there are several miles of trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding.\nThere are many recreation opportunities on the mountain. Hogadon Ski Area is one of very few ski areas with a parking/entry point located above the resort. Although small, the ski area provides a large source of winter entertainment on the mountain.  Other winter activities include cross country skiing, snowshoeing, fatbiking, and snowmobiling. A small part of the cross country ski trails are lit at night, providing night skiing.\nThe southern side of the mountain is bordered by Muddy Mountain, which itself has many recreation opportunities.\nSummer activities on Casper Mountain include camping, hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and picnicking. The Braille Trail is a short scenic hike meant for those who are blind, but catering to everyone.  The trail celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2010, and was visited by about 2,000 people. The area around the trail has picnic sites, and is popular during the summer. The trail is accessible on a road near the base of Tower Hill. Along with the Braille Trail, Casper Mountain has many other hiking trails. At the base of the mountain's north side lies Garden Creek Falls. The Casper Rotary Club manages the trails around the area and, beginning in December 2010, started to renovate some of the trails in order to make them safer for hikers. The club planned to install low intensity lighting in the parking lot, powered by solar panels. Given concerns by residents near the parking lot, the project was discontinued.\nThe mountain is also host to an annual summer-solstice gathering at Crimson Dawn. This event, based upon children's stories told by a local woman to her children in the 1930s and 1940s, has grown into a local tradition, with hundreds of families migrating up the mountain to see actors re-enact tales of witches and warlocks.\nCasper Mountain is also home to Beartrap Meadow, a large open space at the base of the road leading to the far east side of the mountain. Large parties have and continue to be held in the meadow. Beartrap Meadow also houses several campsites. Since 1994 Beartrap Meadow has hosted the Beartrap Summer Festival in late July or early August. It features bluegrass music and has included bands such as Ricky Skaggs, Earl Scruggs, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\n\nWildlife\nWildlife on the mountain includes wild grouse, mule deer, and elk, among other species native to Wyoming. Mountain lions have also been spotted on the mountain. On the west flank of the mountain in Jackson canyon, one of the largest migratory populations of bald eagles in the world take shelter during certain times of year.\n\n\nClimate\n\n\nBroadcasting\nAll of Casper's high powered television stations originate from towers on the mountain, as do a vast majority of the area's FM radio signals. A cross country ski area cuts right through an area known as Tower Hill (see pictures), where many of the towers are located. \nLocal, State and Federal agencies - BLM, Sheriff, Fire, EMS and Casper PD - operate sites on Casper mountain providing both analog and digital support for traditional radio systems as well as the WyoLink statewide trunking system. There are other commercial sites on the mountain as well, providing such services as wireless ISP and cell phones.\nLocal amateur radio operators also take advantage of the mountain. One of the more heavily used amateur repeaters is operated by the Casper Amateur Radio Club - W7VNJ.\n\n\nFires\nAlthough the mountain has seen its fair share of fires, in August 2006 a large wildfire known as the Jackson Canyon Fire burned 11,496 acres (40 km2) on the western end of Casper Mountain,\nIn September 2012, the Sheep Herder Complex fire burned 15,887 acres and consumed 37 residences and 23 outbuildings, according to InciWeb. The fire was 100 percent contained by September 16, 2012. The cause of the fire remains unknown, although it has been speculated to be human-caused.\n\n\nPopular culture\nIn 2025, Casper Mountain was featured in a two-part season premiere episode of Ghost Adventures,  season 30. Several locations on the mountain were featured in the episode including UFO sightings near Garden Creek Falls, and Crimson Dawn. The crew of the show spent six days in and around Casper and contributed about $50,000 to the local economy. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCasper Mountain Adventure Group\nHogadon Ski Area official website\nCasper Mountain Radio Tower Information",

    "text": "Phillips Petroleum Company was an American oil company incorporated in 1917, that expanded into petroleum refining, marketing and transportation, natural gas gathering and the chemicals sectors. It was Phillips Petroleum that first found oil in the North Sea on December 23, 1969, at a position that was later named Ekofisk.\nOn August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. merged with Phillips Petroleum to form ConocoPhillips, becoming the third largest integrated energy company and second-largest refining company in the United States. The company moved its headquarters to Houston.\nIn 2012, ConocoPhillips split into two separate companies. The legacy company kept its name, and spun off the midstream and downstream portions of its business. The new company, which owns the refinery, chemical and pipeline assets formerly held in ConocoPhillips, is named Phillips 66, the brand name and trademark used by the original Phillips Petroleum from 1930 until the 2002 ConocoPhillips merger.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Phillips Petroleum Company was incorporated on June 13, 1917, by brothers Lee Eldas (\"L.E.\") Phillips and Frank Phillips, of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, United States. Their younger brother, Waite Phillips, was the benefactor of Philmont Scout Ranch. The company was headquartered in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.\nPhillips Petroleum rapidly became a fully integrated oil company that included oil and gas production, crude oil pipelines and refineries, and marketing of petroleum products.\nPhillips Petroleum became heavily involved in the natural gas industry immediately after the discovery of the Panhandle gas field of Texas and the Hugoton field in Kansas. By 1925, it was the largest producer of natural gas liquids (NGL) in the United States.\nIn 1927, Phillips started up its first petroleum refinery in Borger, Texas, designed to produce gasoline as an automotive fuel. The refinery also produced other petroleum fractions (e.g., kerosene, fuel oils). It opened its first service station, to sell gasoline, in Wichita, Kansas on 19 November 1927. In 1930, the company developed its \"Phillips 66\" trademark: according to company lore, a Phillips official was road-testing the company's newest gasoline, commented that the car was going \"like 60\" when his driver replied \"Sixty nothing ... we're doing 66!\", all while driving on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma near Tulsa, resulting in the number 66 superimposed on the U.S. Highway symbol for Route 66.\nFrank Phillips served as president of the company until 1938. He then turned over the presidency to Kenneth S. \"Boots\" Adams, but continued as chairman of the board until 1949, when he was 76 years old.\nIn 1942, the company bought more than 250,000 acres in the Hugoton-Panhandle gas fields and a 25 percent interest in the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Phillips Petroleum vs. State of Wisconsin which held that under the Natural Gas Act, the federal government should regulate the prices which natural gas producers charge when selling gas at the wellhead. Phillips then divested itself of the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Interest, but remained a major supplier of natural gas.\nWorld War II greatly stimulated the demand for petroleum products, especially high-octane aviation fuel and jet fuel. Phillips turned to technology to increase the octane rating of fuels for use in advanced engines. The company invented an HF alkylation process in 1940. The American petrochemical industry took off, first making such as styrene, ethylene, propylene and butadiene. After the war, it formed a subsidiary, Phillips Chemical Co., which entered the fertilizer business by producing anhydrous ammonia from natural gas. The company then built a complex on the Houston Ship Channel devoted to making petrochemicals and polymers.\nDuring the 1960s, Phillips expanded its international operations, particularly with exploration in Canada, Venezuela, and Colombia. It discovered the Ekofisk gas field in the North Sea in 1969.\nIn 1966, Phillips Petroleum bought Tidewater Oil Co.'s West Coast operations and rebranded its \"Flying A\" outlets to Phillips 66.\nIn 1983, Phillips Petroleum bought \"General American Oil Company\", a Delaware  company that was headquartered in Dallas. The company was originally built by Algur H. Meadows in 1936 through a merger with oilman J. W. Gilliland and General American Finance System, a company Meadows formed with Ralph Trippett and Henry W. Peters in the early 1930s. General American Oil Company was \"one of the largest independent oil companies in the nation, with worldwide operations and interests.\"\nGeneral American was founded in 1928 as a loan company, the General Finance Company, by Meadows, Trippett, and Henry W. Peters, and renamed the General American Oil Company in 1930. The company acquired over 170 oil wells, several refineries and the assets of the General American Finance System and its subsidiaries. By 1959 the company had 2,990 oil wells in fifteen states and Canada and was drilling for oil in Spain. Richard Rainwater became a partner in the company in 1969, as did Howard Hughes. In 1971, Peters acquired a minority stake in Howard Hughes' Hughes Tool Company, to which was later sold in 1972. In 1967 the General American Oil Company merged with its affiliate Premier Petrochemical of Pasadena, Texas.\nIn late 1984, Mesa Power LP Co., led by T. Boone Pickens Jr., attempted a hostile takeover of Phillips Petroleum. After Mesa failed, Carl Icahn attempted a separate hostile takeover. Phillips remained an independent company but recapitalized with greater debt. This large debt caused Phillips Petroleum to begin selling many of its assets, including refineries, and led to the 2002 merger with Conoco.\nPhillips Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp. combined their worldwide chemical businesses in 2000 to form a new company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Corp., LLC. This excluded Chevron's oronite additives, which remained with its former parent. Chevron Phillips is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\n1980 North Sea accident\nThe Alexander L. Kielland, a drilling rig operating in the Ekofisk gas field of the North Sea, capsized on 27 March 1980. The incident killed 123 people. The rig was owned by a Norwegian firm, Stavanger Drilling, and was chartered by Phillips Norway, a subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum Co. Survivors and relatives of the deceased sued Phillips Petroleum Co. for damages in federal court in Ohio, but the trial court dismissed the case, and on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the appellate court agreed that Ohio courts had no jurisdiction in the case, even though the defendant did business in the state. The verdict was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.\n\n\nPhillips explosion of 1989\n\nThe Pasadena site was home to the 1989 Phillips Explosion, which killed 23 employees and contractors and injured 314 after cost-cutting efforts by the company. The initial explosion was equivalent to 2.4 tons of TNT exploding, damaging the homes of residents within a six-mile radius of the refinery. The initial explosion mushroom cloud was visible to area residents within a 15-mile radius of the site.\n\n\nPhillips explosion of 1999\n\nTwo contractors were killed and three men were injured in an explosion on the morning of Wednesday, 23 June 1999, at Phillips Petroleum Co.'s K-Resin (styrene butadiene copolymer) plant in its chemical complex in Pasadena, Texas.  An alarm sounded at 11:30 am when the blast occurred and a fire erupted. It took more than an hour for Phillips' onsite fire department to extinguish the blaze.\nThose killed were 24-year-old Juan Martinez and his uncle Jose Inez Rangel, who were performing a hydrostatic test on a pipe until they were burned to death by 500 °F molten plastic.  Both Martinez and Rangel were employed by Zachry Construction Corp.\n\n\nPhillips explosion of 2000\n\nThe Pasadena facility exploded again in 2000, resulting in one fatality. The explosion was again located in K-Resin plant. Phillips eventually sold off the K-Resin brand to INEOS Styrolution in 2016. Today, the Pasadena  facility only manufactures high-density polyethylene (HDPE)\n  This complex employs 750 workers for the production of specialty chemicals, including 150 operations and maintenance personnel.\n\n\nLeadership\n\n\nPresidents\nFrank F.

    "text": "William \"Duff\" Armstrong (c. 1833–1899) was an American Union Army soldier and the defendant in an 1858 murder prosecution in which he was defended by Abraham Lincoln, two years before Lincoln was elected President of the United States. The case would later be loosely portrayed in the 1939 film Young Mr. Lincoln.\n\n\nEarly life\nArmstrong was born to Jack and Hannah Armstrong. Jack died in 1857. Abraham Lincoln was a friend of the Armstrongs and regularly visited and would cradle baby William.\n\n\nMurder trial\nArmstrong was charged with the August 29, 1857, murder of James Preston Metzker in Mason County, Illinois. It was alleged that Armstrong and another man had argued with Metzker and killed him with several blows to the head. Armstrong's father, Jack Armstrong, had been a friend of Lincoln while he was studying law in New Salem, Illinois. When Lincoln heard of the murder charge, he wrote to Jack's widow, Hannah, and volunteered his legal services pro bono. The trial was moved to Cass County and held at the courthouse at Beardstown, Illinois.\n\nI have just heard of your deep affliction, and the arrest of your son for murder. I can hardly believe he can be capable of the crime alleged against him. It does not seem possible. I am anxious that he should be given a fair trial at any rate; and gratitude for your long-continued kindness to me in adverse circumstances prompts me to offer my humble services gratuitously in his behalf. It will afford me an opportunity to requite, in a small degree, the favors I received at your hand, and that of your lamented husband, when your roof afforded me a grateful shelter, without money and without price.\nArmstrong's co-accused, a Mr. Norris, was tried separately from him. He was found guilty of Metzker's murder and sentenced to eight years in a state prison. Armstrong's trial began on May 8, 1858.\nWitness Charles Allen testified that he saw Duff Armstrong strike Metzker with a slungshot. Under cross-examination, Lincoln pushed for further detail and Charles Allen testified that he was at a distance of 150 feet, but could clearly see the act by the light of the moon. Abraham Lincoln used judicial notice, then a very uncommon tactic, to show Allen lied on the stand when he claimed he had witnessed the crime in the moonlight. Lincoln produced an almanac to show that the moon on that date would not have provided enough light for the witness to see anything clearly. Lincoln also presented evidence to show that the injuries to Metzker's head could have been inflicted by Norris alone. Based on this evidence, the jury acquitted Armstrong after only one ballot.\nA story arose many years later that Lincoln had modified the almanac, but this was refuted by Abram Bergen, who had witnessed the trial as a young attorney, and later served as a justice of the New Mexico territorial supreme court. From Bergen's recollection, the prosecution had objected upon Lincoln's demonstration from the almanac, and compared it to an almanac in their own possession, only to find that Lincoln's was genuine.\nEdward Eggleston would use the murder and trial as the basis for his 1887 novel The Graysons.\n\n\nService in the Civil War\nArmstrong went on to join the Union forces in the American Civil War. He became ill in 1863 and, at his mother's request, Lincoln arranged for Armstrong's discharge.\n\n\nDeath and burial\nArmstrong lived long after the war; his death was reported in The New York Times on May 14, 1899.\nWilliam Duff Armstrong is buried in the New Hope Cemetery in Mason County, IL. A small informational plaque is erected at his gravesite which reads, \"WILLIAM DUFF ARMSTRONG accused slayer of Preston Metzker, May 7, 1858 freed by Lincoln in Almanac Trial\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nUS Naval Observatory: Phases of the moon for CY 1857 Archived July 23, 2011, at the Wayback Machine\nBioData\nWilliam Duff Armstrong at Find a Grave",

Dave Peters (member of Throwdown) is the guest vocalist, and helped Max Cavalera write lyrics prior to the recording.\n\n\nCavalera's wishful thoughts\nMax Cavalera quoted on the Roadrunner website about his appreciation with Dave Peters, \"To work with David was a trip. The song's a full assault, and it feels really natural. It's got that uncompromising attitude.\" He also had wishful thoughts about this song, \"It's the closest thing I've done to Pantera. Dave put some killer lyrics to the music. The fast part at the end is my favorite part on the album.\"\n\n\nLyrics and composition\nThe song is about unleashing war multiple times to make the war progressively more devastating. As a result, 'unleash' is said sixteen times in the lyrics, twelve are used in verb phrases per line three times each: 'unleash war', 'unleash my wrath', 'unleash revenge', and 'unleash my hell'; the remaining four is as the lone word per line, sung right before the song ends. The lyric also features eight consecutive idioms in order: 'war after war', 'hell after hell', 'scum after scum', 'hill after hills', 'pig after pig', 'stone after stone', 'doom after doom' and 'hate after hate'.\nThis song utilises breakdowns, relatively uncommon in Soulfly's later work, with a lighter world music section in the middle of the song.\n\n\nMusic video\nThe music video shows the members performing inside El Castillo, Chichen Itza, a Mayan pyramid. Later, tribes show up and chug to the song. In the end, a tribe picks up a bloody tissue. It was directed by Robert J.

    "text": "Stephen Vaughan (c. 1962 – July 2025) was an English businessman and convicted criminal. Through his ownership of Vaughan Promotions, originally a boxing promotion and management company, he owned the Barrow and Chester City football clubs, serving as chairman of both. During his time as chairman of the two clubs, both clubs initially saw success on the pitch, but his tenure at both ended due to Vaughan's involvement in criminal investigations. Vaughan was also involved with Droylsden, and was chairman of the Widnes Vikings rugby league team.\n\n\nBarrow\nVaughan contested 77 amateur boxing bouts. He formed Vaughan Promotions in 1990 to promote professional boxing promotions in the United Kingdom. His company purchased Barrow in 1995, and Vaughan invested heavily in the club, building a new 1200 seat grandstand.  His investments led to Barrow winning the Unibond Premier League title in the 1997–98 season. However, during that season Vaughan resigned as chairman due to a money laundering investigation by HM Customs and Excise. Vaughan's links to gangster Curtis Warren also became public; in Warren's biography, he relates an incident where he flew over Barrow's Holker Street field and commented, \"I own that\". Nothing came of the Customs and Excise investigation, and Vaughan reinstated himself as chairman.\nVaughan had been using his own money to fund the club; when he left Barrow permanently in November 1998, his departure resulted in financial difficulties for the club. Furthermore, it was discovered that Vaughan had transferred Holker Street to his company, Vaughan Promotions, in return for his investment. Barrow were removed from the Football Conference for improper administration. A lengthy dispute over the ownership of Holker Street followed, during which time Barrow were readmitted to play in the Northern Premier League in September 1999. Vaughan remained the major shareholder in the old company, but day-to-day running of the club had been taken over by the newly formed Barrow AFC (1999). Eventually, it was ruled that the club legally owned Holker Street, and was allowed to sell the asset to pay off the first charge on the stadium to Cherrytree Finance.\n\n\nChester City\nIn the ensuing years, Vaughan was linked with attempts to buy a number of clubs, finally purchasing a majority share of Chester City in 2001. However, shortly after Vaughan's purchase, Chester were drawn to play Barrow in the FA Cup. Under Football Association (FA) rules, Vaughan could not own shares in both teams. Using a loophole in those rules, a few days prior to the match he transferred his Barrow shares to a local painter and decorator for a nominal sum. After the game, the shares were transferred back. A few days later, new Barrow chairman Brian Keen completed the purchase of Vaughan's shares.\nAt Chester, Vaughan again invested heavily, improving the club's facilities (Deva Stadium), and during his tenure, the team won the Football Conference in 2004. In February 2002, Vaughan also bought shares in a rugby league club, the Widnes Vikings, eventually owning enough shares to have a majority control by 2006. Difficulties in securing a ground in Chester led to discussions about moving the football club to Widnes, but nothing came of this and Vaughan quit as the Widnes Vikings chairman in April 2007. A few months later, he also stood down as chairman of Chester, following a controversy in which he arranged for the club to hold a minute's silence following the death of Colin Smith, a murdered Liverpool gangster, and associate of Curtis Warren. Vaughan remained the majority shareholder in the club, which began to run into financial problems. A sale was announced to Gary Metcalf, a Liverpool-based businessman, which came to nothing, so ownership of the club was eventually transferred to Stephen Vaughan Jr., Vaughan's son, in April 2009. Chester went into voluntary administration, and were bought by Chester City Ltd., a company entirely owned by members of the Vaughan family, including the senior Vaughan.\n\n\nFinancial difficulties VAT fraud\nThese financial difficulties coincided with on-the-pitch struggles. Chester were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2008–09 season. They were initially barred from competing in the 2009–10 season due to HM Revenue and Customs revoking the proposed CVA (company voluntary arrangement), but the club was eventually given FA affiliation. This came, however, with a 25-point penalty at the start of the 2009–10 season. This left the club struggling in the Football Conference. Chester continued to experience financial difficulties. In November 2009, Vaughan was disqualified from acting as a director of any company for a period of 11 years, following his involvement in a £500,000 VAT fraud whilst a director of the Widnes Vikings. As a result, he became the first owner of a professional football club to fail the FA's fit-and-proper-person test, and was forced to reduce his shareholding in Chester City. Control of the club passed back to Stephen Vaughan Jr., with Vaughan Sr. continuing to inject loans into the club, as fans stayed away. By February 2010 Vaughan had stopped any injection of capital into the club so they were unable to fulfill their financial obligations, and the club was suspended from the Football Conference, pending a vote on their ejection to be held on 26 February. The decision was made to expel Chester City from the Football Conference and, following a court order on 10 March, it was confirmed that the club were to be wound up.\n\n\nMove to Malta\nOn 4 April 2010, Vaughan Sr. and his son, along with a 29-year-old man from Neston, were arrested on suspicion of affray and the serious assault of a police officer. Both were convicted, with Vaughan Sr. sentenced to fifteen months in jail, and his son given community service. Vaughan remained in jail until his release in September 2011, by which time Vaughan Jr. had begun to rebuild the Vaughan Boxing promotion business.\nVaughan attempted a return to football in 2012, when he tried to launch a new club in Widnes, but failed due to being refused permission to use Halton Stadium. In April 2012, Vaughan purchased Floriana FC of Malta. Stephen Vaughan Jr. was subsequently appointed Chairman/ President of the club in January 2013. With this move, the Vaughan Boxing Promotions company also shifted toward boxing promotion in Malta. In February 2014, the Vaughan family sold their investment in Floriana FC to Riccardo Gaucci, joining Mosta FC as main shirt sponsors, and then in the summer of 2014 signed a two-year sponsorship with Hibernians FC.\n\n\nReturn to the UK\nIn 2016, Vaughan helped create a company called VSM ('Vaughan Sports Management), which became the main shirt sponsors of Bangor City when new organizers purchased the club. Although Vaughan Sr was present at the launch of the new ownership, the new chairman Ivor Jenkins insisted that Vaughan, who had been banned since 2010 from being a company director in the UK, was not involved with running the club. Stephen Vaughan Jr. was later appointed Director of Football and a coach at the club.\n\n\nDeath\nVaughan Sr. died in July 2025, at the age of 62, with his son confirming the news on 3 July.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Mariko Yashida",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1968455",
    "text": "Mariko Yashida is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as Wolverine's romantic interest.\nShe was portrayed by Tao Okamoto in the 2013 film The Wolverine.\n\n\nPublication history\nCreated by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the character first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #118 (Feb 1979). In an interview published in Back Issue! magazine #4, Byrne claims Mariko was based on Lady Toda Mariko, a character in the 1975 novel Shōgun: \"I had just read Shogun, which Chris had not read at that point. I just absolutely wanted to steal that character, just shamelessly steal the character. And as you probably know, she was created to die.”\n\n\nFictional character biography\nMariko was the daughter of Shingen Yashida, the half-sister of Kenuichio Harada, and cousin of Sunfire and Sunpyre and the aunt of Shingen \"Shin\" Harada.\nShe first met the X-Men when they returned from a sojourn in the Savage Land and were asked to help Japan, which was being blackmailed by the terrorist Moses Magnum. At that time, she encountered Wolverine in a private moment, which developed into a mutual attraction. Afterward, Mariko would frequently visit the United States to see Wolverine.\nSome time later, however, Mariko was married by Shingen to yakuza gang leader Noburu-Hideki to solidify her father's connections to the Japanese underworld, and was subjected to brutal domestic abuse by her husband. She was later used by him to maneuver Wolverine into participating in an assassination of a rival by having the superhero inadvertently provide a distraction while protecting his true love/girlfriend from the rival's own assassins. This also had the intended effect of deepening Mariko's disgust for Logan upon witnessing Logan going berserk in battle. However, Mariko soon realized that her father was evil and was shaming her family with sinister schemes. To stop Shingen, Mariko planned to kill her father and then commit seppuku in recompense, but Logan, learning the truth about this manipulation and inspired by a personal epiphany about humanity, attacked and slew her father in a fair battle of honor before she could act. In doing so, Logan was convinced that Mariko would be honorbound to kill him for that and was prepared to die at her hands rather than harm her in self-defense. However, Mariko explained her opinion of her father and presented the family katana to Logan as a token of her approval as an honorable warrior who is properly entitled to it.\nUpon her father's death, she became head (Oyabun) of the yakuza crime family Clan Yashida.\nMariko happily became Logan's fiancée, but their wedding was halted by the supervillain Mastermind who used a mind control device to change Mariko's mind. When the control was lifted, Wolverine and Mariko resumed their romantic relationship after a period of separation, but have not reconsidered marriage. Mariko also refused any closer engagement with Logan until she had dealt with her father's criminal legacy, which she felt honor-bound to rectify.\nThe X-Men returned from the first Secret Wars and, accidentally ending up in Japan, fighting a dragon their companion Lockheed had brought along. During the chaos, the young girl Amiko Kobayashi loses her mother when a collapsing building crushes her. Dying, the woman begs Wolverine to take care of her daughter. Since Wolverine could not take care of the girl himself, Wolverine chose to place Amiko in Mariko's care, whom the girl soon adopted as a surrogate mother. Amiko and Mariko were at one point targeted by Ogun (one of Wolverine's old enemies), but the attack was averted by Wolverine and Kitty Pryde.\nMariko was poisoned with tetrodotoxin from a blowfish by the assassin Reiko in the employ of her rival Matsu'o Tsurayaba. She asked Wolverine to kill her to avoid a painful death and preserve her honor. Wolverine killed her and vowed to avenge Mariko by severing parts of Matsu'o's body every year on the anniversary of her death.\nPhaedra, an agent of the Hand, resurrected Shingen and stole a piece of Wolverine's soul to torture. Wolverine made a deal with Azrael (the Angel of Death) to kill Phaedra to stop resurrecting the dead if Azrael would heal Wolverine's soul. Phaedra attempted to convince Wolverine to spare her by offering to resurrect Mariko, but Wolverine refused. Wolverine stated that he would pay any price to bring Mariko back, but Logan deeply loved Mariko because she was a better person than himself in every way, and he knew that Mariko would never accept life if it meant that someone as evil as Phaedra was allowed to live as well.\nMany years later, Wolverine was captured by Marduk Kurios and taken to Hell. In order to have Wolverine comply with his demands, the lord of Hell had Mariko's soul (who had been condemned to Hell for her leadership of the Yashida clan's criminal activities) brought to torture Wolverine into submission; Wolverine, however, was eventually rescued by Puck and Thomas Logan. When Logan finally prepared to flee Hell, he intended to take Mariko alongside but (feeling remorse) she asked to be left behind and return to Earth and reclaim his own life, a request Logan reluctantly acquiesced to.\nOld Man Logan faced off against the Hand during their Regenix operation, facing their latest member called the Scarlet Samurai. Logan later discovered that Scarlet Samurai is Mariko resurrected by the Hand to serve as their weapon. With help from Logan, nanites were used to free Mariko from the Hand's control while Gorgon escaped.\nWhen Logan prepared to return to his own time, he asked Mariko to keep an eye on the young girl who would have been his wife in his own timeline, feeling that asking the other X-Men to keep an eye on her would have risked bringing her too close to his own life, whereas Mariko understood the consequences of loving Logan and would be able to keep the girl safe while keeping her distant.\n\n\nOther versions\n\n\nAge of Apocalypse\nIn the Age of Apocalypse timeline, Mariko Yashida was a member of the Human High Council, a group of humans who opposed Apocalypse's tyrannical rule. While not engaged to Logan, Mariko was his former lover and she birthed a daughter, Kirika, an amalgam of X-23 and Amiko Kobayashi. Mariko participates in an attempt to bomb forces of Apocalypse based in North America, though she knows this would mean extensive civilian deaths.\n\n\nDemon Days\nAn alternate version of Mariko Yashida appears as the protagonist of the miniseries Demon Days, written and illustrated by Peach Momoko. In this universe, which blends elements from Marvel comics with Japanese folklore, Mariko discovers she is the daughter of an oni, and is pursued by her sister Ogin (a character with traits of Marvel characters Silver Samurai and Ogun), who seeks revenge on Mariko for mysterious reasons. In the follow-up miniseries Demon Wars, also by Momoko, Mariko is tasked with resolving a civil war between two sects of yokai.\n\n\nExiles\n\nIn an alternate universe (Earth-2109), Mariko Yashida was Sunfire and a member of the Exiles from Exiles #2 (September, 2001) until her death in Exiles #37 (January, 2004) of their ongoing series. In the 2109 alternate universe, she had the same powers as her 616 Marvel Universe counterpart Sunfire and Sunpyre. This version was created by Judd Winick and Mike McKone. A Japanese citizen and a member of the X-Men in her reality, she was one of Marvel's few openly homosexual characters. She has a relationship with one reality's version of Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson).\n\n\nReception\nSunfire's open homosexuality has attracted some interest after coming out in Exiles #11. Her death has also garnered some attention. Perry Moore includes her as an example of the poor treatment of gay superheroes, paralleling the earlier Women in Refrigerators.\nJudd Winick states he has been accused of pursuing a broader social agenda, despite only writing a few stories with socially-relevant themes, as he explains in an interview with Comic Book Resources:\n\nI've done a smattering of stories that are socially relevant and I'm considered the soap-box guy. I've done one story arc in Green Lantern featuring a gay character who was a survivor of a hate crime. Sunfire was gay in Exiles.  And there's other stuff sort of there that people like to hang their hat on, saying I'm just this big commie out there pushing an agenda. It's only a handful of stories.\n\n\nWhat If?\nIn the What If story \"If Wolverine Had Married Mariko\", their marriage is not hindered by Mastermind, and Wolverine becomes head of the Shingen clan. However, they soon have to contend with the yakuza, all united by the Kingpin. Although they appear to prevail with the aid of the Silver Samurai and Sunfire, Mariko is eventually assassinated by the Silver Samurai himself, who had turned traitor, leaving Wolverine to return to the X-Men.\n\n\nWolverine Noir\nMariko Yashida appears in Wolverine Noir as a businesswoman looking to expand her father's interests into 1937's New York City and recruits Jim and Dog Logan.\n\n\nWolverine MAX\nMariko Yashida appears in Wolverine MAX as a member of the Yashida clan during the early 1900s. She met and fell in love with Logan, but their relationship ended after he killed her father. In the present, Logan is shown in a relationship with a woman named Yami Yashida, until she is killed in a plane crash. She is also much older in this continuity having been born in the 1860s, but died sometime in the 1910s.\n\n\nIn other media\n\n\nTelevision\nMariko Yashida appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Gwendoline Yeo. This depiction is Wolverine's former sweetheart/lover and Kenuichio Harada's reluctant wife. She strongly fell romantically in love with Logan, despite her father wanting her to marry Harada due to yakuza connections. In the episode \"Code of Conduct\", Mariko is at the Japanese Embassy looking for her power-hungry husband when Silver Samurai had abducted the X-Men. She's present at the recent duel between Logan and Silver Samurai. After Harada acted dishonorably (using mutant abilities when not allowed) which annulled the duel and was taken away for dishonoring the yakuza clan who agreed to release the X-Men, Mariko told Logan that her husband will be driven from the yakuza in shame and will not be admitted again. When she's asked why she had chosen Harada over Logan, she said that her father and the yakuza would have killed them both had she not chosen Harada, awaiting her decision with drawn swords. She said that marrying Harada was the only honorable thing she could do, even if it meant keeping her and Logan forever apart from one another. Mariko and Logan then went their separate ways.\nMariko Yashida appears in Marvel Anime: Wolverine, voiced by Fumiko Orikasa in the original Japanese version and reprised by Gwendoline Yeo in the English dub. This version is arranged by Shingen Yashida to be married to Madripoor's current leader Hideki Kurohagi, the anime's version of Noburu-Hideki. Logan spends the entire series on a quest to free her from this engagement so they can be together again. In the twelfth and last episode, Mariko is accidentally shot in the chest by Hideki but not before confessing the strong and enduring romantic feelings she has always had for Logan, assuring Logan that she will always be together in spirit as she peacefully bleeds to death in Logan's arms after sharing one last kiss.\n\n\nFilm\nMariko Yashida appears in The Wolverine, portrayed by Tao Okamoto. This version is Ichirō Yashida's granddaughter, Shingen Yashida's daughter, Yukio's foster sister and Logan's love interest. At her grandfather's funeral, she is kidnapped by the yakuza crime syndicate but saved by Logan. As they hide in Yashida's house, they start to fall for each other. Mariko is kidnapped and taken to Yashida Corporation's headquarters where it's revealed that her father was the one who ordered the yakuza to kidnap and ultimately assassinate her because Ichirō had left the family empire to her instead of Shingen. She is saved by Kenuichio Harada with the Black Ninja clan and taken to a research center based where Ichirō was born. When it's revealed that Ichirō's alive and used Mariko as bait to capture and extract Wolverine's immortality using a robotic adamantium armor, she manages to free Wolverine by directing the machine Wolverine is in into the sword strike, breaking her grandfather's focus and freeing Wolverine. Mariko also hits Ichirō with Wolverine's discarded claws, allowing Wolverine to finish her grandfather off. Later Mariko is Yashida Corporation's new CEO and says goodbye to Logan, hoping to see him again.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Women of Marvel Comics Mariko Page\nSunfire (Earth–2109) Marvel Comics Database entry\nSunfire (Earth–2109) Marvel Comics biography\nSunfire (Earth–2109) Marvel Directory\nSunfire (Earth–2109) at Reality Check: The Exiles Resource Center\nUncannyXmen.net Character Profile On Mariko Yashida",

    "text": "Camp Mulla was an alternative hip hop group originating from and based in Nairobi, Kenya. The group rose to prominence with the release of their single \"Party Don't Stop\" on 31 August 2010, with that and their subsequent works earning them a nomination for Best International Act (Africa) at the 2012 BET Awards. Following the release of their debut studio album, Funky Town, the group's lead singer Karun and rapper Taio both left the group to pursue higher education and solo careers. In September 2017 the main four members announced their reunion at The Wave performance at the Waterfront, Ng'ong racecourse, but soon after disbanded again. The group's musical style, fashion sense and origins have drawn comparisons to The Black Eyed Peas, while they have also been criticised for making \"bubblegum music\".\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n2009–2012: Beginnings, rise to fame and Funky Town\nAfter releasing a series of experimental projects, manager Mykie Tooni and rappers Shappaman (then known as Young Kass) and Taio (then known as Taio Tripper) co-founded the group in mid-2009, with Karun (then Miss Karun) and Kus Ma (then K'Cous) joining later. Initially distributing their music online via ReverbNation, SoundCloud and SoundClick for digital download, their song \"Low\" was the first to gain radio airplay, having been introduced by radio presenter Eve D'Souza on Capital FM when it debuted on radio in 2009.\nOn 31 August 2010, Camp Mulla released their first single, \"Party Don't Stop\", to generally positive critical acclaim, peaking at number 2 on Capital FM's \"Hits Not Homework\" playlist and number 13 on Homeboyz Radio's \"HitList\". This and other songs that followed earned them several awards, including the \"Teeniez' Group or Collabo\" and \"Teeniez' Nu Artist\" awards at the 2012 Chaguo La Teeniez Awards held on 20 April 2012. Camp Mulla made their first public appearance on 12 February 2011 at Collo's Valentine's Day concert, where he revealed the music video for his new song \"Chini ya Maji\". They then served as the opening act for Nigerian R&B duo P-Square at a live performance at The Carnivore on 26 February 2011, and opened for Nigerian acts such as Naeto C and Flavour at Naija 9te (or Naija Nite) in October 2011. The group was billed to perform at the Big Brother Africa 7 opening ceremony alongside J. Cole, Davido, Aemo E'Face, P-Square, Naeto C and Flavour on 6 May 2012, but did not make the show due to delays in their travelling documentation. However, they went on to perform on the program's first eviction show on 13 May 2012. Camp Mulla also performed at the grand finale of the fifth season of Tusker Project Fame in 2012.\nCamp Mulla was nominated for Best International Act (Africa) at the 2012 BET Awards—becoming the first Kenyans ever to be nominated for a BET award in the process—alongside Lira, Mokobé and Ice Prince, but lost out to eventual winners Sarkodie and Wizkid. On 29 September 2012, the group released their debut studio album, Funky Town.\n\n\n2013–2016: Departures and solo projects\nIn May 2013, Sub Sahara announced that lead singer Karun was leaving to pursue a solo career and further studies in the United States, with rapper Thee MC Africa also leaving to pursue a solo career. Tiri Murai (known mononymously as Tiri), another Kenyan singer and Kus Ma's girlfriend, was brought in to replace Karun in June 2013 after performing live with the group at the MTV Africa All Stars concert in Durban, South Africa the previous month. On 22 August 2013, Kus Ma released a solo mixtape entitled J's and Purple, while Tiri followed up with a mixtape of her own, Nefertiri, on 8 March 2014. On 20 April 2015, coinciding with the 4/20 celebrations, Shappaman released an extended play entitled Wild Life on Tape. He followed that up with a mixtape entitled Love Wild on 2 March 2016.\n\n\n2017–present: Reunion and second album\nOn 10 September 2017, Camp Mulla announced their return from hiatus with a performance featuring t at The Wave concert at the Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi. The group is reportedly set to release their second studio album, with a date yet to be officially confirmed.\n\n\nMusical style\nA majority of Camp Mulla's songs incorporate hip hop and contemporary R&B. They call their musical style \"2-5-Flow\" or \"254Low\" (pronounced \"two five flow\"), which is a play on Kenya's calling code +254.\n\n\nMembers\nCurrent members\nKus Ma (born Marcus Kibukosya; formerly K'Cous) – Record producer, songwriter, rapper\nShappaman (born Benoît Kanema; formerly Young Ka$$) – Rapper, record producer, songwriter\nKarun (born Karungari Mungai; formerly Miss Karun) – Lead singer, songwriter, Music Producer\nTaio (born Matthew Wakhungu; formerly Taio Tripper) – Rapper, singer, lyricist\nMykie Tooni (born Michael Mutooni) – Manager\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nSolo discography\nKus Ma\nJ's and Purple (2013)\nShappaman\nWild Life on Tape (2015)\nLove Wild (2016)\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",
    "summary": "Camp Mulla was an alternative hip hop group originating from and based in Nairobi, Kenya. The group rose to prominence with the release of their single \"Party Don't Stop\" on 31 August 2010, with that and their subsequent works earning them a nomination for Best International Act (Africa) at the 2012 BET Awards. Following the release of their debut studio album, Funky Town, the group's lead singer Karun and rapper Taio both left the group to pursue higher education and solo careers. In September 2017 the main four members announced their reunion at The Wave performance at the Waterfront, Ng'ong racecourse, but soon after disbanded again. The group's musical style, fashion sense and origins have drawn comparisons to The Black Eyed Peas, while they have also been criticised for making \"bubblegum music\".",

It is endemic to the United States and classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe blotchside darter was formerly described as a subspecies of Percina caprodes. It was first formally described as P. c. burtoni in 1945 by the American ichthyologist Henry Weed Fowler (1878–1961) with the type locality given as The Swannanoa River near Oteen in Buncombe County, North Carolina. The specific name honors the eminent naturalist who collected the type, Edward Milby Burton (1898–1977), formerly of the Charleston Museum.\n\n\nDescription\nThe blotchside darter is mostly covered with blotches on the midlateral row of the body. It has prepectoral scales and an orange submarginal band in the first dorsal fin. There are 15–18 dorsal spines, 14–15 dorsal rays, 14–15 pectoral rays, 2 anal spines, 10–12 anal rays, and 6 branchiostegal rays.\nThe species is olive in color dorsally, cream-colored ventrally, and has a lateral series of 8–10 dark green to black round or oval blotches. There is a distinct black spot at the base of the tail. The head is dark above and white below. In the first dorsal fin is a thin black margin. There is a thin orange submarginal band and a wide diffuse black basal band. The second dorsal and caudal fins have several narrow black bands; other fins are clear or yellow in color.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe blotchside darter is endemic to the United States. It can occasionally be found in the Tennessee River system in Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina. It formerly occurred in the Cumberland River system in Kentucky and Tennessee and may still persist in what is known as Little South Fork in Kentucky.\nThe species lives in swift streams and is usually found over gravel in water 0.5–1 m in depth. It has been observed in clear, moderately large streams in which a variety of fishes occur, indicating that it requires high water quality and ecosystem health. It appears intolerant of reservoir conditions.\n\n\nConservation\nThe blotchside darter is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It is known from several dozen localities, but total population size is unknown. It is likely to be detrimentally affected by siltation, turbidity, chemical pollution, and impoundment.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Smart & Final is a chain of warehouse-style food and supply stores based in Commerce, California, which developed through a series of mergers and expansions. The oldest of the combined companies, Hellman, Haas & Co., was founded in 1871 in Los Angeles. The company operates over 250 stores in the Western United States and 15 in northwestern Mexico.\nWhile Smart & Final stores target both the food-service and household markets, the company also formerly operated Smart Foodservice Warehouse Stores (formerly known as Cash & Carry), which market to food service professionals.\nThe stores in Mexico are operated under a joint venture with Calimax. Since 2008, Smart & Final Extra! operates in some parts of the United States. These stores contain a slightly larger footprint and larger assortment of goods.\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to company information, Smart & Final traces its beginnings to 1871, when partners Herman W. Hellman, Jacob Haas (who later became Mayor of Los Angeles), and Bernard Cohn started Hellman-Haas Grocery Company on then-rural Los Angeles Street. By 1900 the company had changed its name to Haas, Baruch & Co., which decades later would be merged into what had become Smart & Final.\nA separate company, Santa Ana Grocery Company, formed in 1912, mainly supplying feed and grain to local farmers. J. S. \"Jim\" Smart, a banker from Saginaw, Michigan, and H. D. \"Hildane\" Final bought the company in 1914 and changed the name to Smart & Final Wholesale Grocers. From 1876 to 1913, Jim Smart had been involved with several wholesale grocers in the greater Saginaw area, including Lee, Cady & Smart and Smart & Symons with his brother-in-law, J. W. Symons of Symons Brothers.\nBy 1919, annual sales for Smart & Final had reached $10 million. During the fierce competition among expanding grocers in the 1920s, the company introduced a self-serve concept to replace reliance on clerks to fetch goods. This was called \"cash and carry.\"\nIn 1953, Smart & Final merged with Haas, Baruch & Co.\nIn 1984, it was acquired by Thriftimart.\nIn 1991, it was reorganized via a corporate spin-off and initial public offering.\nIn 1992, it announced a joint venture with Calimax to open stores in Mexico.\nIn 1994, it opened its first store in Mexico.\nIn 1998, it acquired Portland, Oregon-based United Grocers Cash & Carry, which was renamed Cash & Carry. These stores are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest.\nIn 2007, Smart & Final acquired 35 Henry's Farmers Markets in California and Sun Harvest Markets in Texas for about $166 million.\nIn 2007, the company was acquired by Apollo Global Management.\nIn March 2010, Smart & Final announced it would expand into the Colorado market under the SmartCo Foods brand, taking over five former Albertsons locations in the Denver metro area with plans for dozens more stores in the coming years. SmartCo stores differed from typical Smart & Final locations in that they were significantly larger and included produce, meat, and bakery departments, as well as a large selection of natural and organic foods. In June 2010, the first SmartCo Foods store opened on Parker Road in Denver, and was said to be tailored for the Colorado market.\nIn November 2010, only five months after the chain's grand opening, SmartCo Foods announced that it was exiting the Denver market and closing all five of its stores. SmartCo Foods attributed its hasty exit from Denver to poor performance chain-wide without any hope for improvement. However, the withdrawal may have also been partially due to negotiations resulting in the February 2011 acquisition of the Sprouts Farmers Market which had 9 locations in Colorado.\nIn 2012, Apollo sold its stake in Smart & Final to Ares Management for $975 million. Smart & Final went public in 2014.\nIn 2015, Smart & Final purchased the leases on 32 locations previously operated by Haggen.\nIn 2019, Apollo once again acquired the chain, for $1.1 billion. Deutsche Bank had financed the previous buyout and took a loss.\nOn October 30, 2019, Smart & Final introduced two redesigned online shopping portals for consumers and business clients. Shoppers can see weekly specials, create grocery lists, shop by recipes, and create profiles that reflect dietary allergies or preferences. Business clients can complete online orders and apply for tax exemptions.\nOn May 24, 2021, Mexican supermarket operator Chedraui (via its California-based Bodega Latina subsidiary) announced its intent to acquire Smart & Final from Apollo. Subsequently, Bodega Latina changed its name to Chedraui USA.\n\n\nBrands\nSmart & Final sells products under three of its own brands:\n\nFirst Street branded items are primarily grocery products.\nSun Harvest includes natural and organic items.\nSimply Value is a brand used for household products.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

(In other words, a perfect set is a closed set without isolated point.)\nThe notion of dense set is distinct from dense-in-itself.  This can sometimes be confusing, as \"X is dense in X\" (always true) is not the same as \"X is dense-in-itself\" (no isolated point).\n\n\nExamples\nA simple example of a set that is dense-in-itself but not closed (and hence not a perfect set) is the set of irrational numbers (considered as a subset of the real numbers). This set is dense-in-itself because every neighborhood of an irrational number \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n contains at least one other irrational number \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        ≠\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y\\neq x}\n  \n. On the other hand, the set of irrationals is not closed because every rational number lies in its closure. Similarly, the set of rational numbers is also dense-in-itself but not closed in the space of real numbers.\nThe above examples, the irrationals and the rationals, are also dense sets in their topological space, namely \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n. As an example that is dense-in-itself but not dense in its topological space, consider \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n        \n        ∩\n        [\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} \\cap [0,1]}\n  \n. This set is not dense in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n but is dense-in-itself.\n\n\nProperties\nA singleton subset of a space \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n can never be dense-in-itself, because its unique point is isolated in it.\nThe dense-in-itself subsets of any space are closed under unions. In a dense-in-itself space, they include all open sets. In a dense-in-itself T1 space they include all dense sets. However, spaces that are not T1 may have dense subsets that are not dense-in-itself: for example in the dense-in-itself space \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        =\n        {\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X=\\{a,b\\}}\n  \n with the indiscrete topology, the set \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        {\n        a\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=\\{a\\}}\n  \n is dense, but is not dense-in-itself.\nThe closure of any dense-in-itself set is a perfect set.\nIn general, the intersection of two dense-in-itself sets is not dense-in-itself.  But the intersection of a dense-in-itself set and an open set is dense-in-itself.\n\n\nSee also\nNowhere dense set\nGlossary of topology\nDense order\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nEngelking, Ryszard (1989).

    "text": "Antillanité is a literary and political movement developed in the 1960s that stresses the creation of a specific West Indian identity out of a multiplicity of ethnic and cultural elements.\n\n\nBackground\nFrom the early 1960s, a new way of envisaging French West Indian identity began to be articulated by a number of Martinican thinkers, which, in contrast to Négritude's stress on the retention of African cultural forms in the Caribbean, dwelt rather on the creation, out of a multiplicity of constituent elements, of a specifically West Indian cultural configuration to which, in time, the name \"Antillanité\" came to be given.\nIt seems to have been René Ménil, a former collaborator of Aimé Césaire, one of the principal champions of the Négritude movement, who, in an article entitled \"Problèmes d'une culture antillaise\" first clearly formulated the idea of a West Indian specificity (spécificité antillaise) that would enjoy such success in the years that followed. \nFrench West Indian culture, according to Ménil, is: \"neither African nor Chinese, nor Indian, nor even French, but ultimately West Indian.  Our culture is West Indian since, in the course of history, it has brought together and combined in an original syncretism all these elements derived from the four corners of the earth, without being any one of those elements in particular.\"\n\n\nTheoretical principles\nOriginally intended as a counter to the doctrine of Négritude, and its stress on an African rather than Caribbean identity, Antillanité was positively received by a number of prominent Martinican intellectuals, in particular the Groupe de Recherches de l'Institut Martiniquais d'Etudes headed by Édouard Glissant, which published the results of its discussions on Caribbean identity in the short-lived journal Acoma (1971–73).\nLike its predecessor, Négritude, Antillanité is, at its base, an assertion of the difference in the face of the encroachments of the same.  The whole of Glissant's theoretical work may be seen as a sustained polemic, conducted in the name of \"le Divers,\" (the different) against the claims of the universal, to which a succession of derogatory epithets are attached in a more or less routine fashion.\nFor Glissant, \"the preoccupation with the universal is the alienated reverse side of the uniquely western pretension to exercise universal control\", and it therefore follows that proponents of Antillanité must adopt a \"firm opposition to any ideology of universal culture.\"  Where Antillanité differs most markedly from Négritude is in its conception of the constitution of the different.  For Négritude, the different was monolithic, being essentially African in character; however, in the view of Glissant, the different is, itself, diverse, complex, and heterogeneous, made up of a multiplicity of relations held in place by a complex process of attraction and repulsion.  Thus, it could be said that while Négritude looked inwards, to African heritage, for its models and values Antillanité looked both inwards, and outwards, towards the Caribbean and Meso-America as a whole, in its quest for self-invention from which proponents conceived identity as an archipelago of signifiers, none of which enjoys primacy over the others and whose unity lies not in the fact of possessing a single source but, rather, in the complex amalgamation of these myriad forces which hold themselves in relation to each other.  One of the major advances made by Antillanité is that it has, in large measure, shed the regressive, matricentric orientation common to both assimilationism and Négritude.\n\n\nSee also\nCréolité\nSuzanne Césaire\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nGuy Numa, Antillanité, Paris, Azur communications, 2005, 288 p.",

    "text": "Daniel Rutledge Vining Jr. (born January 12, 1944, Fayetteville, Arkansas) is an American demographer who has been an emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania since 2010.\n\n\nEducation and career\nHe was the son of Daniel Rutledge Vining, who was economics professor at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Vining received his B.A. degree from Yale University in 1966, his M.P.A. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1971, and his Ph.D. from the Carnegie Mellon University School of Urban and Public Affairs in 1975. In 1974, he was named a lecturer in the Regional Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where he became an assistant professor in 1975 and a tenured associate professor in 1980. In 1981, he was named an associate professor of public and urban policy for three years retroactive to July 1, 1980. He remained an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania until 1993, and became an emeritus professor there in 2010.\n\n\nResearch\nVining has argued that the average IQ of Americans has decreased by about 5 points since IQ tests became widely used in the early 20th century.  He has also argued that wealthy families tend to have as many, or fewer, children than do low-income families, which he has argued occurs because human reproductive behavior is learned, not heritable.\n\n\nControversial views and affiliations\nVining has previously been an editorial board member of the scientific racist journal Mankind Quarterly, and he has argued that America is undergoing a \"dysgenesis\" because more intelligent people in America are not reproducing as often. He has also asserted that this \"dysgenesis\" is especially harmful to African Americans. His work was cited in the prominent 1994 book the Bell Curve, and he has received $197,750 in grants from the Pioneer Fund, for which he has been criticized as a \"race scientist\". Vining has responded to these criticisms by saying that the media has unfairly characterized him and the Pioneer Fund. \n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Shelton is a village in Buffalo and Hall counties, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Kearney, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,059 at the 2010 census. It is located west of Grand Island along both the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 30. Nebraska Link 10-D connects Shelton with Interstate 80.\n\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.73 square miles (1.89 km2), all land.\nThe downtown business district is situated near the banks of the Wood River and the historic Lincoln Highway (now U.S. Highway 30) passes through Shelton.\n\n\nHistory\nShelton, evolving from Wood River Centre, is one of the older communities in Nebraska.  The first European settler to live in the area was a Mormon by the name of Joseph Johnson in 1858.  His store, blacksmithery, wagon repair shop, tintype gallery, bakery, place where meals could be obtained, and printing office served early pioneers.  The \"Huntsman's Echo\", his publication, was the first newspaper west of Omaha and was established in April 1860.  His establishment (Johnson's Ranche) found itself as an important point of supply serving Mormons and other travelers on the Council Bluffs Road.\nPrior to service by the railroad, The Great Western Stage Company established a stage station at Wood River Center in 1860 to serve its Fort Kearny route.  The Union Pacific Railroad came to the area in 1866; with additional settlers, the need to establish government was realized.  Patrick Walsh, Martin Slattery, and a Sergeant Cody petitioned the governor to organize Buffalo County in 1869.  Wood River Centre (Shelton) was selected through election to be the county seat.   Within a year, the seat was moved to Gibbon.\nPatrick Walsh, the community postman, wrote the Postmaster General in 1873 with the plea to change the name of Wood River Centre to Shelton to avoid confusion with Wood River, a community to the east.  The post office name was changed from Wood River Center to Shelton on February 3, 1873.  Shelton held the name of Wood River Center from 1860 to about 1873.  No further correspondence about the naming of Shelton is recorded.  The name, Shelton, is derived from the name of an auditor for the Union Pacific Railroad, Nathan Shelton.\n\n  The original townsite was surveyed from the homestead farm of Patrick Walsh, followed by a survey from the Union Pacific Railway Company.  It was 1876 before the Union Pacific established a station.  With incorporation in 1882, the community grew and was home to \"The Shelton Clipper\" formerly \"The Shelton Clarion\", several banks, and a community school.  As early as 1866, people of the Shelton area organized together to form the first schoolhouse in Buffalo County.  By 1876, a new school district was organized; it was legally known as No. 19 in Buffalo County.  In January 1908, the community library was officially organized as the Shelton Public Library with a village tax being levied for its support.  A Carnegie Library building was funded on April 7, 1913.\nThe population of Shelton has been relatively consistent since its early years, always maintaining a population around 1,000 individuals.  The population of Shelton in 1910 was 1,005.\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 1,059 people, 391 households, and 283 families living in the village.

The family produced merchants, government officials, (vice-)consuls, judges, and bankers, among others.\n\n\nHistory\nThe family starts with a certain Dircx, whose name can be deduced from the patronymic of his son Cornelis Dircxzoon Zwager (1485 - 1557), the first known member of the Dirkzwager family. Whether he too already carried the surname or addition ‘Zwager’ or whether only his son was referred to with it (by virtue of a family relationship) has - in the absence of further data - never been able to be determined.\nCornelis is found in the ‘Cohier van de Xe penning van Zegwaard Ao_ 1544\"’ where he is mentioned as owner of a residence and 11 morgen of land. It is also known that both sons of Cornelis settled in neighbouring Bleiswijk in the first half of the 16th century, where the family name Dirkzwager originated. This Cornelis of course has more descendants than are described here on this page but belonging to the patrician branch are only the descendants and direct ancestors of Maarten Dirkzwager (1767-1847).\nIn Bleiswijk, the first five generations of descendants of Cornelis were engaged in the peat trade until Pieter Arienszoon Dirkzwager († 1750) as a trader in salt and soap heralded the rise of the Dirkzwagers as traders and merchants. \nHis great-grandson Maarten Dirkzwager (1767-1847) is the common ancestor to whom the Dirkzwager coat of arms - the herring buss - applies and is the progenitor of the patrician family. This Maarten has three sons, including Gijsbert (1796-1873) and Cornelis (1809-1863). Gijsbert stays in Maassluis and Cornelis settles in Schiedam and forms the beginning of the Schiedam branch there.\nGijsbert has four sons of whom only Maarten (1825-1895) stays in Maassluis and forms the Maassluis branch. Nicolaas (1823-1887) settles in Moordrecht and forms the Moordrecht branch, Abraham (1830-1895) settles in Oud-Beijerland and forms the Oud-Beijerland branch and Jacob (1832-1915) settles in Rozenburg and forms the Rozenburg branch (†). \nThe Dirkzwager family has been included in genealogical reference work Nederland's Patriciaat in editions 29, 64 and 87, in 1943, 1978/1979 and 2006 respectively.\n\n\nBibliography\nNederland's Patriciaat 29 (1943), pp. 101-143.\nNederland's Patriciaat 64 (1978/1979), pp. 38-98.\nNederland's Patriciaat 87 (2006), pp. 128-229.\nVürtheim, J.J.

    "text": "The next German federal election to elect the members of the 22nd Bundestag, following the recent 23 February 2025 election, will be held before 26 March 2029.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nDate assignment\nThe Basic Law and the Federal Election Act provide that regular federal elections must be held on a Sunday or on a national holiday no earlier than 46 and no later than 48 months after the start of a legislative session. The 21st Bundestag was constituted on March 25, 2025 and has therefore been in session for 7 months. Accordingly, a scheduled federal election would have to take place on one of the following dates:\n\n28 January 2029\n4, 11, 18, 25 February 2029 or\n4, 11, 18, 25 March 2029\nThe exact date will be determined by the president of Germany in due course. \nFederal elections can be held earlier, if the President of Germany dissolves the Bundestag and schedules a snap election, which is however only possible under two scenarios described by the Basic Law: \n\nFailed election of chancellor: If the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor with an absolute majority of its members by the 15th day after the first ballot, the president is free to either appoint the candidate who received a plurality of votes on the last ballot as chancellor or to dissolve the Bundestag (in accordance with Article 63, Section 4 of the Basic Law).\nLost motion of confidence by the chancellor: The chancellor has the right to submit a motion to the Bundestag for a vote of confidence in him. If this motion fails, the Chancellor has various options for action, including requesting the President to dissolve the Bundestag. The President is free to accept or reject this request (in accordance with Article 68 of the Basic Law).\nIn both cases, federal snap elections would have to take place on a Sunday or national holiday no later than 60 days after the dissolution. \nNo elections can be held during a state of defense; if this prolongs a legislative period, new elections must be held no later than six months after the end of the state of defense.\n\n\nElectoral system\n\n Germany uses the mixed-member proportional representation system, a system of proportional representation combined with elements of first-past-the-post voting. Every elector has two votes: a constituency vote (first vote) and a party list vote (second vote). Based solely on the first votes, 299 members are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. The proportional distribution of seats among the parties is calculated on the basis of the second votes. The seats won by a party through the second votes are then distributed internally among the states, depending on how many second votes the party received in the individual states (the Sainte-Laguë method is used both for the distribution of seats between the parties and for the internal distribution of a party's seats among the states). In most cases, the number of constituencies won by a party in a given state does not exactly correspond to the number of seats to which the party is entitled in that state proportionally. This is balanced in two different ways: \nIf a party wins fewer constituencies in a state than it is entitled to based on the second-vote result, the highest-placed candidates from the state list are elected accordingly to the additional seats.\nIf a party wins more constituency seats in a state than its second votes would entitle it to, the principle of second vote coverage (Zweitstimmendeckung) applies. This means that only the correspondent number of constituency winners with the highest percentage of first votes receive a seat. Constituency winners who have not won a seat in this case are given priority over the candidates on the respective state list in the event that a member leaves parliament prematurely during the legislative session.\nTo qualify for any seats, however, a party must either win three single-member constituencies via first votes (basic mandate clause) or exceed a threshold of 5% of the second votes nationwide. This does not apply to independent constituency candidates, however: these always enter the Bundestag if they win their constituency, which hardly ever happens. There were three in 1949, with candidates that were related to parties.\nParties representing recognized national minorities (currently Danes, Frisians, Sorbs, and Romani people) are exempt from both the 5% national threshold and the basic mandate clause, but must still meet state-level qualifications. The only party that so far has been willing and able to benefit from this provision on the federal level is the South Schleswig Voters' Association, which represents the minorities of Danes and Frisians in Schleswig-Holstein and managed to win a seat in 1949, 2021, and 2025.\nThe electoral law described here was adopted in 2023 and was used for the first time in the 2025 election. At the time, the CDU/CSU-faction criticized in particular the new aspect of so-called second vote coverage, and intends to reform electoral law again so that all constituency winners are once again guaranteed a seat, as had been the case before 2023. It is therefore possible that this electoral law will be changed before the next election.\n\n\nPolitical parties and leaders\n\nSingle party governments are unusual in Germany, a recent exception was the First Söder cabinet (CSU) until 2018 in Bavaria, and since 2022 is the Rehlinger cabinet (SPD) in the Saarland. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is considered far-right by all other major parties; they have joined a \"firewall\" policy that rejects cooperation and tries to get AfD declared as illegal. Thus, for the time being, two-party or three-party government coalitions on federal and state levels are formed by CDU/CSU and SPD with various degree of support from Greens, Left, FDP, BSW, and FW. \nThe table below lists the parties represented in the 21st Bundestag.\n\n\nOpinion polls\n  \n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Willy \"Clipper\" Cahill (born November 21, 1935) is an American Kudan (ninth degree) Black belt in Kodokan Judo, US Olympic and Paralympic Judo Coach, a Co-Founder of the US Blind Judo Foundation and a Judan (tenth degree) Black belt in Kodenkan Jujitsu.\n\n\nBiography\nWilly \"Clipper\" Cahill was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on November 21, 1935, to Abbie and John Cahill. When Willy was born, his father saw a Clipper airplane fly overhead and nicknamed him \"Clipper\". Willy’s father John Cahill was an instructor studying and working with Danzan Ryu Jujitsu founder Henry Seishiro Okazaki. When Willy was diagnosed with polio at age 7, professor Seishiro Okazaki, who served as a masseur and a therapist for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, came to help and, in less than a year, put Willy back on his feet. After John Cahill received his black belt in 1938, he opened his own dojo named Hui Miki Miki which means “lots of pep” in Hawaiian. John taught judo and jujitsu to American servicemen stationed on the Islands throughout World War II. The family moved to California in 1947 and John Cahill opened the Hui Miki Miki Judo dojo in Daly City, California in 1948. Shortly after, he moved the school to South San Francisco where he taught for nearly fifteen years. After his father died in 1962, Willy Cahill opened his own Judo Academy in San Bruno in 1963 in his father's honor. On July 19, 2013, USA Judo presented Cahill with a lifetime achievement award.\n\n\nCareer\nCahill is a Judo Professor and a South San Francisco High alumnus. He has been teaching and coaching Judo and Jujitsu for the better part of five decades. His pupils have captured more than 1200 national and international titles.  A former judo coach at Stanford and San Francisco State Universities, Cahill was the U.S. Olympic Judo assistant Coach at 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and at 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.  He was offered a U.S. Olympic Judo Head Coach position for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but passed the opportunity, as he thought there were better candidates. He also coached the U.S. National Judo team from 1980 to 1990.  Cahill became a Northern CA Youth Champion at the age of 16.  As a coach, his San Bruno Judo Academy won nine straight California championships in the 1970's. Willy's teams competed in the Olympics, Goodwill Games, World Judo Championships, the Pacific Rim Championships and the Junior Pan American Championships. Professor Cahill mentored and trained athletes such as a 1987 World Judo Championships Silver medalist Lynn Roethke, a 1984 Olympian Brett Barron, a 1984 Olympic Bronze medalist Edward Liddie and a Silver medalist Robert Berland, a 1988 Olympic Silver medalist Kevin Asano and a Bronze medalist and a 1987 World Champion Mike Swain.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=23464409",
    "text": "A service voucher is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.\nA voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the market nor by the public sector. These might include for example home care, household repairs, ironing, or bicycle hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with trade unions and employers' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of unfair competition.\nPotential providers of these services are identified, often from among the long-term unemployed.\n\n\nOperations\nVouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including social insurance cover, holiday pay etc.). \nAn example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in Belgium, where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with a National Register Number is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers with their own business who have just given birth are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers. \nThis initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each service voucher, the company employing a domestic servant receives the amount of 23.02 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to the first 163 service vouchers purchased yearly, creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.\n\n\nAnalysis of benefits\nVouchers can be defined as subsidies granting limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of services. In the field of personal and household services, their use has been growing in recent years, following successful experiences in some European countries. Vouchers can be seen as tools that would lie between in kind provision of services and cash distribution of income to be used (or not) for these services. Very basically, vouchers are simple means of payment. The payment can be integrally made by the user, or by a public financer, and mixed forms of payment with other actors can be imagined (e.g. companies paying for part of the cost or insurance companies providing some services through this means).\nIn the field of care policies, the increasing use of vouchers has sometimes been analysed as an element of a current commodification trend that corresponds to an increase in what can be labelled a “social market” logic. Social markets mainly rely on demand-side measures, the aim being to ensure that users or consumers of services are offered more choice and are, financially speaking, able to purchase personal services. The market logic involves developing the demand side with the aim of transforming “latent” demand into effective demand. These social markets thus involve competition between different modes of provision, with the user receiving direct or indirect assistance from public authorities to make their choice.\nIn the field of “non-care” services, vouchers are being used mostly for the same reasons as those in the care sector, that is for a series of supposed advantages in particular regarding efficiency of public spending, expected impact on undeclared labour but also quality issues (quality of services and quality of jobs). \n\nA first advantage is freedom of choice. Under the logic of social markets, vouchers are supposed to allow for user choice between different types of providers (sometimes including public providers) or simply between providers of one single type (e.g. domestic workers).\nA second advantage is efficiency. Vouchers offer less freedom of choice than pure money but their efficiency is linked to the fact that the demand is \"channelled\", i.e. that it is oriented towards certain types of services or activities; moreover there is an efficiency for public finances as if not used, the voucher does not represent a cost for authorities. As well it is possible to imagine public policies targeting people with special needs.\nA third advantage is reduction of undeclared labour. Vouchers are meant to simplify the administrative procedures when employing someone to outsource housework tasks or care activities. In some cases, the purchase of a voucher does not entail the duty to sign a labour contract between the parties (as in France under specific conditions), which might have a negative impact on working conditions.\nFurther, social security contributions are calculated automatically and directly paid. Because they considerably reduce administrative burden, vouchers are supposed to be a significant incentive for the use of declared labour rather than undeclared labour.\nFifth, and finally, vouchers might foster quality of services. The partisans of the market-oriented and purchaser-provider model consider that it encourages innovation, flexibility and quality, as the market should eliminate the bad quality suppliers and encourage a user-oriented approach. As a Eurofound report notes: \"The more actively involved service users are in determining the content of care, the more likely it is that care services will be greater suited to the individual’s values, culture, attitudes and circumstances. Empowerment of care recipients enables them to purchase their own care and have the security assurance of contractual rights. This can potentially influence the quality of care, as low standard care services would simply not be 'bought'. At the same time, care recipients could tailor a care programme to their specific needs, again raising quality and improving delivery.\" Voucher schemes could be steered in this direction, according to this report and to certain authors.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n360° review of service vouchers.

The length of the shell measures 2 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which half of the tilted edge of the last volution only projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded and feebly shouldered at the summit.

In addition to these axial ribs, the whorls are marked by low, feebly rounded, rather broad spiral cords, of which 6 occur between the sutures, on the second, and 7 upon the third and fourth whorl. The spaces separating the spiral cords are narrow, impressed lines. The intersections of the axial ribs and spiral cords form weak tubercles, while the spaces enclosed between them are roundish pits. The sutures are moderately constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by a cord equaling the one posterior to it in width, and separated from that by a line as wide as those on the spire. The base is moderately prolonged and well rounded. It is marked with 12 low, rounded spiral cords, which decrease successively in width from the periphery, anteriorly. The spaces separating these cords are also narrow impressed lines. The oval aperture is moderately large. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is strongly curved showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip is slightly curved, oblique, reflected over and adnate to the base. It is provided with a slender fold at its insertion.

Stjepan pod borovima) on the peninsula of Sustipan, near Split. The formal reason for life in the monastery is an alleged illness, so in his charter from 1078, Stephen writes:I, Stephen, once glittering Prince of the Croats, devastated by a bad illness, call upon the honorable priests of the Croatian kingdom to find a remedy for my sins. Of their advice I took heed, and let myself be brought to the monastery of St Stephen. Here I was relieved of all my honours and had chosen the grabe, recommending the monastery's leader to mention me in his prayers.King Demetrius Zvonimir was a member of the junior Svetoslavić branch of the House of Trpimirović (descendants of Svetoslav Suronja). By the time Demetrius Zvonimir died in 1089, Stephen was old and seriously affected by ill health. Nevertheless, he assumed the throne after being persuaded by the aristocracy and clergy.\nStephen's rule was relatively ineffectual and lasted less than two years. He spent most of this time in the tranquility of the monastery near Split, where he stayed before becoming king. Zvonimir's widow, Queen Jelena, reportedly plotted the inheritance of the Croatian Crown for her brother, King Ladislaus I of Hungary.\nStephen II died peacefully in December 1090, or at the beginning of 1091, without leaving an heir. War and unrest broke out in Croatia shortly afterward, with the southern nobility electing Petar Snačić as King of Croatia in 1093, immediately entering into conflict with the Hungarian king Ladislaus. The war culminated in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain in 1097 leading to a personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, ruled by Coloman.\n\n\nSee also\nList of rulers of Croatia\n\n\nReferences",

Coalition forces and was a prisoner of war during the First Gulf War.\n\n\nCareer\nBellini enlisted in the Italian Air Force in 1977 and attended the Italian Accademia Aeronautica (Air Force Academy). He was then trained as a pilot at Laughlin Air Force Base in the United States. He has a degree in political science from the Federico II University in Naples,  and a master's degree in strategic studies from the Air War College at Air University, based at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, United States.\n\n\nGulf War\nOn the eve of the Operation Desert Storm the Italian government deployed eight Tornado Fighter-bombers on the Gulf Theatre of Operations. On 16 January 1991, coalition forces began concentrated air strikes on Iraqi military targets in Iraq and Kuwait.\nOn 18 January 1991, an Italian Tornado piloted by Major Gianmarco Bellini with Captain Maurizio Cocciolone as his navigator took off as part of a multi-national 48 planes squadron. Bellini and Cocciolone were the only members of the flight able to execute in-flight refuelling, while the other 47 aircraft failed and had to abort the mission. The mission profile dictated that the operation could be performed even by a single plane, so Bellini and Cocciolone went on. Right after dropping five bombs on the target at high speed and low altitude (thanks to the terrain following radar), they dropped the external fuel tanks to get out of the area as soon as possible, but their plane was hit by Iraqi anti aircraft fire. In an interview, Bellini said that multiple ZSU-23-4 \"Shilka\" locked them with the radar, and one shot hit the right rolleron and tore away almost 60% of the area. This caused at first an uncontrolled roll of one spin per second, then the pilot managed to reduce that to one speed every three seconds, but they were already close to the ground, and they had to eject. In that interview, Bellini said that when he ejected the plane was at 30 ft from the ground. They were captured by the Iraqi Republican Guard, even though their status was unknown at the time.\nWhile Cocciolone was shown on Iraqi television on 20 January 1991, in a propaganda video,  no news of Bellini was given initially, and he was feared to be a casualty. The two were kept separate for the whole time of their captivity. On 3 March 1991, both officers were released.  Bellini holds numerous military decorations including the Silver Medal for Military Valor for his actions during the Operation Desert Storm.\nBellini and Cocciolone were the only Italian Prisoners of War of the entire war.\n\n\nLater career\nBellini was appointed commanding officer of the Ghedi air base in 2001.\nIn 2023 Gianmarco Bellini became the subject of the award-winning short documentary Gianmarco Bellini: Gulf War POW directed by Italian filmmaker Maria Luisa Forenza and produced by filmmaker Daniel L.

    "text": "The Battle of Okhmativ or Battle of Ochmatów (Polish: Ochmatów) of 30 January 1644 refers to the engagement between the Polish forces under hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski and the horde of Crimean Tatars under Tugay Bey. Koniecpolski dealt a crushing defeat to Tugay Bey's forces near Okhmativ. This was the greatest Polish victory over the Tatars in the first half of the 17th century, and brought international fame and recognition to Koniecpolski.\n\n\nBackground\nAfter several years of relative quiet, the Crimean Tatars, united after a civil war, began raiding the Polish border in strength in the early 1640s. Provoked by a Cossack raid, a large Tatar raiding force began assembling in late 1643 near Ochakiv. In response, Polish military commander, Grand Crown Hetman, Stanisław Koniecpolski, ordered his forces to concentrate near Vinnytsia for 27 December. With the Tatars evading scouts, he split his forces around the possible incursion points. In early January Koniecpolski became aware of the horde movement.\n\n\nOpposing forces\nEstimates of the Tatar army, commanded by Tugay Bey, supported by Murtaza aga, Ahmed murza, Temir aga and Omer aga, are between 10,000 and 20,000; Leszek Podhorodecki notes that the 20,000 to 40,000 estimates are exaggerated.\nKoniecposki had an army of some 19,130 soldiers (60% of them, magnates' private armies; Koniecpolski's own forces numbered 2,200), divided into two main groups; one under his own command, and the other, under Jeremi Wiśniowiecki. According to Frost, Jeremi had a permanent force of 1,500-3,000, and could quickly raise 2,000 more, 6,000 in an emergency; of the 19,130 troops present at the battle, there were 3,500 regulars, 4,000 Registered Cossacks and 11,530 private troops. Other notable Polish participants in the battle included Marcin Kalinowski, Samuel Korecki, Stefan Czarniecki, Stanisław Potocki, Jan Zamoyski, and Krzysztof Grodzicki.\n\n\nBattle\nKoniecpolski's intelligence on the enemy was better, and Tugay Bey mistakenly believed he had a much larger numerical advantage than he really had. At first, he had only his own corps of about 10,000, that began the fighting defensively. The battle was slowed down by heavy mists, during which Wiśniowiecki arrived, giving the Poles a numerical parity, if not superiority. After the Polish attack, Tugay Bey ordered a retreat, which turned into a rout. The pursuit continued for a day, and many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice gave way. The Tatars lost over 4,000 people, mostly during the retreat; the Polish casualties were \"minimal\".\n\n\nAftermath\nThe battle was the Commonwealth's greatest victory over the Tatars in the first half of the 17th century, and it brought international fame to Koniecpolski, who had not only predicted the time and place of the Tatar attack but had destroyed their forces before they could deploy their usual tactic of splitting their main forces into multiple highly-mobile units (czambuls).\nThe victory led King Władysław IV to consider an offensive war against the Tatars. Koniecpolski supported a limited war against the Crimean Khanate but opposed the King's plan to wage war on the entire Ottoman Empire as an unrealistic folly.

Koniecpolski also strongly urged a coalition with Moscow for such a campaign. King Władysław IV continued to push for a crusade against Turkey, but it had little internal support and failed to achieve anything except to spread false hopes among the Cossacks, to whom he promised privileges and money in exchange for their participation in his crusade.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\nWinged Hussars, Radoslaw Sikora, Bartosz Musialowicz, BUM Magazine, 2016.",

He was an advocate of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy's United Bengal proposal.\n\n\nEarly life\nChowdhury was born in 1894, into a well-reputed Bengali Muslim family of zamindars in Batagram, Tipperah District, Bengal Presidency (now Comilla District, Bangladesh). He was a son of Tofazzal Ahmad Chowdhury, alias Anu Mia, an influential zamindar of that time. Chowdhury moved to Calcutta for his education, where he studied at the Hare School and then at the St. Xavier's Collegiate School. He completed his bachelor's degree from Rajshahi College in North Bengal and then completed law school at the Calcutta University in 1919.\nHe married Razia Khatoon in 1913. They had a son and three daughters.\n\n\nCareer\nChowdhury was a prominent leader in the anti-British Indian independence movement. He was involved in the Khilafat Movement and Non-cooperation movement as an activist and the leader of the All India National Congress's Bengal branch. He became a leader of the Tippera Krishak Samiti's moderate side. He was arrested numerous times and served several terms of imprisonment, including in 1925 for six months, in 1927 for a year, and in 1939 for six years. His wife died in 1935.\nFrom 1937 to 1941, he was the general secretary of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee during the presidency of Subhash Chandra Bose. He was one of the closest allies of Bose and played an instrumental role in organising Bengal Congress at that time. Chowdhury also played a vital role in formation of Forward Bloc with Bose and was a vital member in the founding Working Committee of All India Forward Bloc, which was the party's highest forum for whole India. He supported Indian nationalism and Hindu-Muslim unity. He was also the first non-British chairman of the District Board of Tipperah (Comilla) and was a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly.\nIn the 1940s, he joined the Nikhil Banga Jamiat-i-Ulama-i-Hind. Chowdhury stood as a candidate of the Nizam-e-Islam Party as part of the United Front alliance during the 1954 East Bengal Legislative Assembly elections, in which he gained a seat in his home constituency of Comilla. In 1954, he became the minister of education during the cabinet of A. K. Fazlul Huq, he became education minister again during the cabinet of Abu Hussain Sarkar.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nChowdhury died on 25 March 1976 in Bangladesh. One of his daughters, Rabeya Chowdhury, is a prominent politician of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "A people mover or automated people mover (APM) is a type of small-scale automated guideway transit system. The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks.\nThe term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964. The second, alternately called the People Mover and Minirail, opened in Montreal at Expo 67. Finally the last, called PeopleMover or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and that opened at Disneyland in 1967.\nThe term \"people mover\" currently describes technologies such as monorail, rail tracks and maglev. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, linear motors or cable traction.\nGenerally speaking, larger APMs are referred to by other names. The most generic is \"automated guideway transit\", which encompasses any automated system regardless of size. Some complex APMs deploy fleets of small vehicles over a track network with off-line stations, and supply near non-stop service to passengers. These taxi-like systems are more usually referred to as personal rapid transit (PRT). Larger systems, with vehicles with 20 to 40 passengers, are sometimes referred to as \"group rapid transit\" (GRT), although this term is not particularly common. Other complex APMs have similar characteristics to rapid transit systems, and there is no clear-cut distinction between a complex APM of this type and an automated mass transit system. Another term \"light metro\" is also applied to describe the system worldwide.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nNever-Stop Railway\n\nOne of the first automated systems for human transportation was the screw-driven 'Never-Stop-Railway', constructed for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, London in 1924. This railway consisted of 88 unmanned carriages, on a continuous double track along the northern and eastern sides of the exhibition, with reversing loops at either end.\nThe carriages ran on two parallel concrete beams and were guided by pulleys running on the inner side of these concrete beams, and were propelled by gripping a revolving screw thread running between the tracks in a pit; by adjusting the pitch of this thread at different points, the carriages could be sped up, or slowed down to a walking pace at stations, to allow passengers to join and leave. The railway ran reliably for the two years of the exhibition, and was then dismantled.\n\n\nGoodyear and Stephens-Adamson\n\nIn late 1949, Mike Kendall, chief engineer and Chairman of the Board of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Company, an Illinois-based manufacturer of conveyor belts and systems, asked Al Neilson, an engineer in the Industrial Products Division of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., if Goodyear had ever considered working on People Movers. He felt that with Goodyear's ability to move materials in large quantities on conveyor belts they should consider moving batches of people.\nFour years of engineering design, development and testing led to a joint patent being issued for three types of people movers, named Speedwalk, Speedramp, and Carveyor.\nGoodyear would sell the concept and Stephens-Adamson would manufacture and install the components.\nA Speedwalk consisted of a flat conveyor belt riding on a series of rollers, or a flat slippery surface, moving at 1.5 mph (2.4 km/h) (approximately half the speed of walking). The passengers would walk onto the belt and could stand or walk to the exit point. They were supported by a moving handrail. Customers were expected to include airport terminals, ballparks, train stations, etc. Today, several manufacturers produce similar units called moving walkways.\nA Speedramp was very similar to a Speedwalk but it was used to change elevations; up or down a floor level. This could have been accomplished by an escalator, but the Speedramp would allow wheeled luggage, small handcarts etc. to ride the belt at an operating cost predicted to be much lower than escalators or elevators. The first successful installation of a Speedramp was in the spring of 1954 at the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Station in Jersey City, New Jersey, to connect the Erie Railroad to the Hudson and Manhattan Tubes. This unit was 227 feet (69 m) long with a rise of 22 feet (6.7 m) on a 15 degree grade, and only cost $75,000.\nA Carveyor consisted of many small cubicles or cars carrying ten people riding on a flat conveyor belt from point A to point B. The belt rode on a series of motorized rollers. The purpose of the motorized rollers was to facilitate the gradual acceleration and deceleration speeds on the conveyor belt and overcome the tendency of all belts to stretch at start up and during shutdown. At point \"A\" passengers would enter a Speedwalk running parallel to the belts and cars of the Carveyor. The cars would be moving at the same speed as the Speedwalk; the passengers would enter the cars and be seated, while the motorized rollers would increase the speed of the cars up to the traveling speed (which would be preset depending on the distance to be covered). At point B Passengers could disembark and by means of a series of flat slower belts (Speedwalks) go to other Carveyors to other destinations or out to the street. The cars at point B would continue on rollers around a semicircle and then reverse the process carrying passengers back to point A. The initial installation was to be the 42nd Street Shuttle in New York City between Times Square and Grand Central station.\nThe first mention of the Carveyor in a hardback book was in There's Adventure in Civil Engineering by Neil P. Ruzic (1958), one of a series of books published by Popular Mechanics in the 1950s in their \"Career\" series. In the book the Carveyor was already installed and operational in downtown Los Angeles.\nColonel Sydney H. Bingham, Chairman of the New York City Board of Transportation, had several meetings with a group of architects who were trying to revamp the whole New York City Subway system in the heart of town to connect Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Grand Central and several new office complexes together. Several of these architects were involved in other programs, and in later years many variations of the Carveyor people movers were developed.\nIn November 1954 the New York City Transit Authority issued an order to Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson to build a complete Carveyor system between Times Square and Grand Central. A brief summary and confirmation can be found in Time magazine on November 15, 1954. under the heading \"Subway of the Future\". The cost was to be under $4 million, but the order was never fulfilled due to political difficulties.\nChocolate World in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Disneyland in California, and Walt Disney World in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept.\n\n\nOther developments\n\nThe term 'people mover' was used by Walt Disney, when he and his Imagineers were working on the new 1967 Tomorrowland at Disneyland. The name was used as a working title for a new attraction, the PeopleMover. According to Imagineer Bob Gurr, \"the name got stuck,\" and it was no longer a working title.\nStarting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, people movers were the topic of intense development around the world. Worried about the growing congestion and pollution in downtown areas due to the spread of cars, many countries started studying mass transit systems that would lower capital costs to the point where any city could afford to deploy them. Most of these systems used elevated guideways, which were much less expensive to deploy than tunnels. However, elevating the track causes problems with noise, so traditional steel-wheel-on-rail solutions were rare as they squealed when rounding bends in the rails. Rubber tired solutions were common, but some systems used hovercraft techniques or various magnetic levitation systems.\nTwo major government funded APM projects are notable. In Germany, Mannesmann Demag and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm developed a system known as Cabinentaxi during the 1970s. Cabinentaxi featured small cars with from four to eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were \"offline\", allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted from one to the other), allowing dual-track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter.\nIn the U.S., a 1966 federal bill provided funding that led to the development of APM systems under the Downtown People Mover Program. Four systems were developed, Rohr's ROMAG, LTV's AirTrans, Ford's APT and Otis Elevator's hovercraft design. A major presentation of the systems was organized as TRANSPO'72 at Dulles International Airport, where the various systems were presented to delegations from numerous cities in the US. Prototype systems and test tracks were built during the 1970s.\nOne notable example was Pittsburgh's Skybus, which was proposed by the Port Authority of Allegheny County to replace its streetcar system, which, having large stretches of private right of way, was not suited for bus conversion. A short demonstration line was set up in South Park and large tracts of land were secured for its facilities. However, opposition arose to the notion that it would replace the streetcar system. This, combined with the immaturity of the technology and other factors, led the Port Authority to abandon the project and pursue alternatives. By the start of the 1980s most politicians had lost interest in the concept and the project was repeatedly de-funded in the early 1980s. Only two APMs were developed as a part of the People Mover Program in the U.S., the Metromover in Miami, and the Detroit People Mover. The Jacksonville Skyway was built in the late 1980s.\n\n\nFrom development to implementation\nAlthough many systems were generally considered failures, several APM systems developed by other groups have been much more successful. Lighter systems with shorter tracks are widely deployed at airports; the world's first airport people movers, the Tampa International Airport People Movers, were installed in 1971 at Tampa International Airport in the United States. APMs have now become common at large airports and hospitals in the United States.\nDriverless metros have become common in Europe and parts of Asia. The economics of automated trains tend to reduce the scale so tied to \"mass\" transit (the largest operating expense is the driver's salary, which is only affordable if very large numbers of passengers are paying fares), so that small-scale installations are feasible. Thus cities normally thought of as too small to build a metro (e.g. Rennes, Lausanne, Brescia, etc.) are now doing so.\nOn September 30, 2006, the Peachliner in Komaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, became that nation's first people mover to cease operations.\n\n\nManufacturers\n\n\nHeavy APMs\nHitachi Rail STS\nBombardier Innovia Metro\nBombardier Innovia Monorail\nKawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company\nMitsubishi Heavy Industry\nVéhicule Automatique Léger (now part of Siemens Mobility)\nHyundai Rotem\n\n\nLight APMs\nHitachi Rail STS\nBombardier Innovia APM (now part of Alstom)\nDoppelmayr Cable Car\nHTI Group (Leitner Ropeways/Poma)\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover\nParry People Movers (PPM)\nHyundai Rotem\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nAirports\n\nMany large international airports around the world feature people mover systems to transport passengers between terminals or within a terminal itself.

    "text": "The president of Sri Lanka (Sinhala: ශ්‍රී ලංකා ජනාධිපති Śrī Laṅkā Janādhipati; Tamil: இலங்கை ஜனாதிபதி Ilaṇkai janātipati) is the head of state and head of government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The president is the chief executive of the union government and the commander-in-chief of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, in addition to their relation with the Prime minister and Government of Sri Lanka, have over time differed with the various constitutional documents since the creation of the office. The president appoints the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka who can command the confidence of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.  \nAnura Kumara Dissanayake is the 10th and current president, having assumed office on 23 September 2024, after being declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election.  \n\n\nHistory\nUnder the Soulbury Constitution which consisted of the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947 and The Ceylon (Constitution and Independence) Orders in Council 1947, Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known then) became a constitutional monarchy with a Westminster parliamentary form of government. The monarch of Ceylon served as the head of state, represented by the governor-general with the prime minister serving as the head of government. The governor-general replaced the position of the Governor of British Ceylon, who had previously exercised executive control over the entire island since 1815.\nIn 1972, the new Republican Constitution declared Sri Lanka a parliamentary republic with a president as head of state. The president was a largely ceremonial figure; real power remained vested in the prime minister.\nIn 1978, the second amendment to the Constitution replaced the Westminster system with a more semi-presidential system. The presidency became an executive post based closely on the French model, and was now both head of state and head of government, with a longer term and independent from Parliament. The president was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, head of the cabinet of ministers, and has the power to dissolve and call a parliament. The prime minister would serve as both an assistant and the deputy to the president and also the president's successor.\nThe 17th Constitutional Amendment introduced in 2001 reduced certain powers of the president, in particular in regard to the appointment of the upper judiciary and independent commissions such as the election commission or the bribery and corruption commission.\nIn 2010, the highly controversial 18th Amendment to the constitution was introduced in order to remove the two-term limit for the presidency. The 18th amendment allowed the incumbent president to serve multiple terms as well as increase their power by replacing the broader constitutional council with a limited parliamentary council. This amendment was introduced by president Mahinda Rajapaksa and he later went on to run for a third term of presidency in 2015, wherein he was defeated by Maithripala Sirisena. \nThe 19th Constitutional Amendment undid much of the changes done by the 18th Amendment. The two-term limit was restored by president Maithripala Sirisena. The amendment required the president to consult the prime minister on ministerial appointments. It curtailed any president's immunity by making them liable to fundamental rights litigation on any official act.\nIn 2022, the country caved into a severe economic crisis, and as result, mass anti-government protests erupted across Sri Lanka. The protesters demanded for then-incumbent president Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government step down. The protestors also demanded amendments to the Constitution of Sri Lanka and to reduce the powers of the President. After Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected president by the parliament. \nIn October 2022, the 21st Constitutional Amendment was introduced as a plan to empower the parliament over the executive president and curbs some of the powers of the president. Under the 21st Amendment, the President, Cabinet of Ministers and National Council are all held accountable to the parliament. Fifteen Committees and Oversight Committees are also accountable to parliament. One of the key provisions in 21st Amendment is disqualifying dual-citizens from contesting in elections in Sri Lanka.\n\n\nSelection process\n\n\nEligibility\nThe article 31 Constitution of Sri Lanka sets the following qualifications for holding the presidency:\n\n\"The person is a citizen having been nominated as a candidate for such office by a recognized political party or elected member of the legislature.\"\n\"No person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the People, shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the People.\"\nThe person can only hold the citizenship of Sri Lanka.\n\n\nElection\nThe president is elected to office in a presidential election held nationwide for a five-year term. An elected president can serve for a maximum of two terms, with each term taking effect from the date of taking a public oath of office for the elected term.\nThe President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limited ranked voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency. If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority. \nArticle 31 (3A)(a)(i) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, states that, the \"President may, at any time after the expiration of four years from the commencement of his first term of office, by Proclamation, declare his intention of appealing to the People for a mandate to hold office, by election, for a second term.” But \"A person succeeding to the office of the President under the provisions of article 40 of the constitution shall not be entitled to exercise the right conferred above.\"\n\n\nSuccession or vacancy\n\nSuccession to or vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death or incapacity, resignation, or removal from office. In the case when the president is unable to perform their duties, their powers are temporarily transferred to the prime minister until confirmed by Parliament.\nAccording to the Article 40 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, \"If the office of President shall become vacant prior to the expiration of his term of office, Parliament shall elect as President one of its Members who is qualified to be elected to the office of President. Any person so succeeding to the office of President shall hold office only for the unexpired period of the term of office of the President vacating office. Until the election of a successor, the powers and functions of the office of the President will discharged by the Prime Minister in his capacity as Acting president.\"\nThroughout the history, Office of the President has fallen vacant two times; first in 1993, after the Assassination of then President Premadasa and again in 2022, after the resignation of President Rajapaksa. In both times, they were succeeded by then Prime Ministers; D. B. Wijetunga in 1993 and Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022.\n\n\nTerm length\nAt the time of the Creation of office in 1972, the term of the office of the President was a term of six years. After the Introduction of the Executive Presidency in 1978, The President is elected by Popular vote and shall hold the office for 6 years and is eligible to serve two terms.\nAccording to the Article 31 (3A) of the Constitution, The Term of office starts from the Date of the Inauguration of the President and he can call an early Presidential election after expiration of 4 years of his first term. If the elected President did not call can early Presidential election, the next Presidential election shall take place not more than two months and not less than one month before the expiration of the term of the incumbent President.\n19th Amendment to the Constitution reduced the term of office to Five years and the Incumbent President can call an early Presidential election after the expiration of four years of his first term. \nFurthermore, Article 31 (3A) of the Constitution states that an any person succeeding to the office of President under the provisions of Article 40 shall not be entitled to exercise the right to call an early Presidential election and will hold the office till expiration of the term of his Predecessor.\n\n\nPowers and duties\n\n\nDuties\nDuties of the president as described in the constitution are to:\n\nEnsure that the Constitution is respected and upheld;\nPromote national reconciliation and integration;\nEnsure and facilitate the proper functioning of the Constitutional Council and other institutions;\nOn the advice of the Election Commission, ensure the creation of proper conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections and referendums.\n\n\nConstitutional powers\nPresidents have little constraints on their power. The president shall be responsible to Parliament and can be impeached and removed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The president may declare war and peace. They can place the country or any part under a state of emergency, under which they can override any law passed and promulgate any regulation without needing legislative approval. However, to prolong the state of emergency for more than 6 months, parliamentary approval is needed. In case of external invasion, a state of national defense can be proclaimed, which allows the government extraordinary powers. Martial law can be declared in provinces under extraordinary conditions. Further, the President can dismiss both the national and state governments from power in 3 situations: corruption, treason, and inability to govern.\n\n\nParliamentary powers\nThe president has the right to attend Parliament once in every three months, but is not entitled to vote. They have the right to address or send messages to Parliament and to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.\n\n\nAdministrative powers\nThe president makes numerous appointments which include the prime minister, cabinet and non-cabinet ministers, provincial governors, public officers, ambassadors and commissioned officers of the armed forces. The president may also appoint secretaries, officers, and staff.\n\n\nJudicial powers\nThe president would have the power to appoint and remove, the chief justice, justices of the Supreme Court, justices of the Court of Appeal and judges of the High Court. The president may grant a pardon. The president has immunity from both civil and criminal proceedings. The president has the power to commission public inquires by appointing a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate any issue.\n\n\nDiplomatic powers\nPresident of Sri Lanka is the nation's Chief Diplomat. Through this role, they are responsible for carrying out negotiations with foreign leaders and their governments and appoint diplomatic agents.\n\n\nCeremonial duties\nThe president has an important ceremonial role in terms of state ceremonies, functions, and awarding state awards. Most notable would be the traditional throne speech delivered by the president to the parliament outlining the official policy statement of the new government to the parliament. The president would lead the independence day celebrations as well as other national ceremonies such as remembrance day, Wap Magul (ceremonial ploughing) and receive the Perahera Sandeshaya. National honours would be awarded by the president on behalf of the government of Sri Lanka. The president would receive letter of credence from foreign ambassadors.\n\n\nAppointments\nThe president may appoint provincial governors to head the provincial council and serve as their representative in the province. The president may also appoint any number of advisers as presidential advisers and coordinate secretaries to assist them.\nThe president has the power to appoint senior attorneys-at-law to the position of President's Counsel. The president may appoint officers from the armed forces to serve as their aide-de-camp as well as extra-aide-de-camp. Additionally, the president may appoint medical officers of the armed forces as Honorary Physician to the President and Honorary Surgeon to the President.\n\n\nPrivileges\n\n\nSalary\nThe president receives a monthly salary (as of 2016) of LKR 100,000 (≈ $1,000) paid from the consolidated fund. It was increased from LKR 25,000 (≈ $500) to LKR 100,000 in 2006.\n\n\nTax benefits\nBy tradition, the president and past presidents are not subjected to income tax. This practice dates back to the pre-republic era when the crown was not subject to tax. In 2018, this practice was changed with the Inland Revenue Bill which removed the tax exemption given to the President.\n\n\nLegal immunity\nThe president has immunity from both civil or criminal proceedings, during the tenure of office and acts carried out during this period.\n\n\nResidence\n\nThe official residence of the president in Colombo is the President's House (formerly the Queen's House as the residence of the governor-general). The government pays for meals and staff. Other presidential residences include:\n\nthe President's Pavilion, is the president's second official residence in Kandy;\nthe Queen's Cottage is the official presidential vacationing residence in the holiday-town of Nuwara Eliya.\nIn recent years from time to time Prime Minister's House, commonly referred to as Temple Trees, which has been the traditional residence of the prime minister since 1948, has been used by some presidents such as Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa. Other presidents, such as Jayewardene and Sirisena, have refused to use the President's House, with the former preferring to stay at his personal residence in Braemar, and the latter at his former ministerial residence at Wijayarama Mawatha.\n\n\nTravel\nFor ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which is an armored black Mercedes-Benz S-Class (S600) Pullman Guard.

During President Mahinda Rajapakse's time in office the specialized Army unit the 'President's Guard' was formed for Presidential Security. Prior to the formation of the President's Guard, army personnel served as a squadron under the President's Security Division since 1996 and focused on key tasks including the perimeter security of the presidential residence, Temple Trees. 5th Regiment Sri Lanka Armored Corps was the first army unit chosen to be in the dedicated security of the president of Sri Lanka during the presidency of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. However, in April 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved the President's Guard. Currently the president's security is provided by the elite Special Task Force (STF) of the Sri Lanka Police.\n\n\nPresidential flag (1972−2022)\nAfter the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, a presidential flag was adopted by the president as the insignia of their office. Each president had a unique standard, incorporating traditional symbols associated with the president or their home region. This was the case until Acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe abolished the presidential flag.\n\n\nPresidential Dispatch Bag\nThe 'Attaché Case', Presidential Dispatch Bag carries important and secret documents wherever president is traveling.

President will hand over the Dispatch Bag from one President to the next in line.\n\n\nPresidential staff\n\n\nPresidential Secretariat\n\nThe Presidential Secretariat is the government ministry that functions as the office and staff of the president, supporting the administrative functions of the presidency and other ministerial portfolios that are held by the president. Initially located at President's House, the staff of the office of the president grew with the establishment of the executive presidency and moved into the former Parliament building in Colombo in the 1980s which now hosts the Presidential Secretariat. The Presidential Secretariat is headed by the secretary to the president (also known as the president's secretary), who is the most senior civil servant in the country.\n\n\nPresidential advisers\nThe president has the ability to appoint any number of advisers as presidential advisers.

The primary lines of business include retail banking, deposit-taking and lending.\nEstablished in 1982, by June 2020, the credit union had over 31,300 members and 3,600 junior members.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Credit Union was originally established for a London-based local authority staff in 1982, (known as Southwark Council Employees Credit Union) by a small group of volunteers. It was formed to address the economic hardship among low paid manual workers and the local Caribbean community. Like other British credit unions at the time, it was a small savings and loans co-operative which offered its members a limited range of financial products and services. Despite being the first credit union in the UK to operate a payroll deduction scheme, Southwark Council Employees Credit Union only recruited between 200 and 300 members from a workforce of over 12,000 in the first nine years of its existence.\nFrom 1991 onwards, Southwark Council Employees Credit Union implemented a range of reforms, including the introduction of improved IT systems and staff development. In 1997, it opened membership to employees of King's College Hospital, under the name Southwark and Kings Employees Credit Union and, in 1999, as Southwark Credit Union, to anyone living or working in the borough.\n\n\nMergers\nThroughout its early years, the credit union absorbed a number of smaller credit unions in Southwark. The first of these, in 1997, was Camberwell Health Authority Credit Union (established in 1991), followed, in 2001, by the Camberwell Credit Union (established 1980). In 2010, members of Lambeth Savings and Credit Union (established 2006) voted to transfer engagements to Southwark Credit Union, which adopted the present name, extending its common bond to take in the London Borough of Lambeth.\nIn 2012, LMCU absorbed the Pimlico Credit Union (established 1980), enlarging its south London base to the City of Westminster. In 2013, it absorbed Camden Plus Credit Union (established 2006), expanding its area of operation to include London Borough of Camden.\n\n\nProducts\nIn 2012, London Mutual Credit Union became the first British credit union to offer payday loans. The initial 12 months trial for short-term payday loans was completed in 2013. The scheme was funded by the Friends Provident Foundation and the Barclays Community Finance Fund, with project support from the Financial Inclusion Centre. The pilot payday loan received 6,087 applications for an average loan of £238. In the 12-month pilot, 2,923 short-term loans with a value of £687,757 were provided to 1,219 different borrowers. Under the scheme, borrowers could take out a payday loan or spread out repayment over a longer period. 29% of applicants repaid their loan in one month, while 59% of applicants opted to repay their loan over three months. However, in a survey, 66% of applicants said their main reason for taking out a loan with London Mutual was the low cost of borrowing compared to other payday lenders. Only 10% said that the option to repay over a longer period of time was their main reason for choosing the credit union.\nAccording to LMCU, the payday loan pilot saved 1,219 borrowers collectively saved £145,000, or £119 each, compared to borrowing from a high-cost payday lender. The credit union developed its payday and short-term loan products in response to increased use of payday lenders in the London boroughs it serves. Following the completion of the pilot London Mutual Credit Union made its payday loan facility available to anyone living or working in the London boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, City of Westminster and Camden. Like high-cost payday lenders the credit union allows borrowers to take out a CUOK payday loan online.\n\n\nRegulation\nRegistered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, London Mutual Credit Union is a member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited.\nAs a financial institution, it is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and PRA, who also regulate banks, building societies and insurance companies. London Mutual is also a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme can pay compensation to depositors if a credit union is unable to meet its financial obligations. Most depositors – including most individuals and small businesses – are covered.\n\n\nSee also\nCredit unions in the United Kingdom\nBritish co-operative movement\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nLondon Mutual Credit Union\nAssociation of British Credit Unions\nCan payday loan alternatives be affordable and viable?

    "text": "The early life of Hugo Chávez spans the first twenty-one years (1954–1975) of the former President of Venezuela's life. Leader of the \"Bolivarian Revolution\", Hugo Chávez is known for his socialist governance, his promotion of Latin American integration, and his radical critique of neoliberal globalization and United States foreign policy.\nBorn on 28 July 1954 in rural Sabaneta, Chávez was raised in a poor family in the rural llanos (plains) region of the Venezuelan interior. Chávez later lived with his grandmother and rose through school to obtain entry into the Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences as a cadet. In his college years, Chávez began associating with leftists and gained exposure to various Latin American populist leaders—including Juan Velasco Alvarado and Omar Torrijos. Meanwhile, he developed a critical perspective on Latin America's socio-political context. These influences led Chávez to incorporate both nationalist and socialist elements in a new political ideology that he would dub \"Bolivarianism\". These would all come to bear upon Chávez's thinking, eventually stoking plans for a 1992 coup d'état, seeking the overthrow of Venezuela's government.\n\n\nFamily and ancestry\nThe second son of Hugo de los Reyes Chávez (1932-2024) and Elena Frías de Chávez (born 1934), Chávez was born in the town of Sabaneta, Barinas on 28 July 1954. Sabaneta is situated in Venezuela's Andean lowlands, with the Andes Mountains to the west and south. Both Chávez's mother and father were local schoolteachers there. His father, Hugo Sr., had dropped out of school after completing the sixth grade. However, he later qualified to teach primary school. His brothers are: Adán (born 11 April 1952), Narciso (born 6 January 1956), Aníbal (31 December 1956-16 July 2016), Argenis (born 3 January 1958), Enzo (December 1958-1960) and Adelis (born 1960).\nThe ancestry of the Chávez family has roots in central Venezuela's llanos. Chávez was the great-grandson of rebel Pedro Pérez Delgado, better known as \"Maisanta\". Maisanta was a lifelong rebel leader who helped spur an uprising that, before his capture in 1922, left dead both a Venezuelan ex-president and a state governor.\n\n\nChildhood (1954–1971)\n\nChávez grew up in a small house composed of large palm leaves constructed over a bare dirt floor. His family lived in a small village just outside Sabaneta. Chávez and his siblings were urged by his parents to embrace education as a way of escaping their rural surroundings and attain better lives in the more prosperous cities. Chávez's mother wanted him to become a Catholic priest, and so he was made to serve as an altar boy for one year. One of his duties was to clean and polish figurines depicting the saints and Jesus; Chávez developed a dislike of Jesus' depiction as a simple figurine. Specifically, Chávez was offended by what he saw as his church's portrayal of Jesus as \"an idiot\" and not, as Chávez considered Jesus to be, \"a rebel\". These experiences resulted in Chávez's lifelong distrust of religious hierarchies.\nLater, Chávez's parents sent him and his older brother Adán to live with their paternal grandmother, Rosa Inés Chávez, who lived in Sabaneta proper. This resulted in Chávez developing a stronger relationship with his grandmother than with his own mother. Later, Chávez's own parents and his siblings moved to a nearby house, Chávez recounts the odd situation of his parents' move to a different house (than that where he and his paternal grandmother lived) in Sabaneta:\n\n\"[They moved to Sabaneta] and my father built a little house... diagonally across from my grandmother's house, which was made of thatch. My parents lived there with the other children as they came along .... [Theirs] was a little house made of [cement blocks], a rural house, but it had an asbestos roof and a cement floor.\"\nThus, Chávez and Adán remained with their grandmother. Yet Chávez did have regular contact with his parents. Although the majority of children in the region where he grew up never pursued higher studies, Chávez proved to be one of the exceptions. He began by attending elementary school at Julián Pino School. Meanwhile, he pursued such hobbies as painting and singing. At the ages of twelve and thirteen, Chávez was a very thin child with unusually large feet, and Chávez's peers dubbed him \"Tribilin\", the Spanish name for the Disney character Goofy. After school, Chávez worked as a street vendor, selling the caramelized fruit sweets that his grandmother made.\nChávez would later recall developing an appreciation for nature; this stemmed from his family's proximity to the Guanare River. There, he would take fishing trips with his father; on days such as Easter, his family held picnics on the riverbank. However, Chávez was most interested in baseball. One of his childhood dreams was to become a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Venezuelan pitcher Néstor \"Látigo\" Chávez (no relation). When Látigo died at age 23 on 16 March 1969 in Zulia State, in the second worst airplane crash in Venezuela's history, Chávez was saddened to the extent that he refused to go to school for two days. Five years later, Chávez was still writing about Látigo in his personal diary, and Chávez would continue to play and enjoy baseball throughout his life. Chávez also played baseball and softball with the Criollitos de Venezuela, who played in the 1969 Venezuelan National Baseball Championships. He also wrote poems, stories, and dramas.\nFrom his early childhood on, Hugo Chávez was also interested in the life, ideology, and writings of Simón Bolívar. Bolívar is widely respected both in Venezuela and the rest of South America as a Venezuelan revolutionary and freedom fighter. He is particularly well-remembered for his central role in the Spanish American wars of independence. Indeed, from his childhood onwards, Chávez would tie key dates in his own life with important anniversaries relating to Bolívar's actions.\nChávez later moved to the larger town of Barinas, where he attended high school at the Daniel Florencio O'Leary School. Throughout his high school years, Chávez's best friends were two brothers who were the sons of Jose Ruiz, a communist who had been incarcerated by the government of military dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez. In the library of the Ruiz family, Chávez first began to read books dealing with communism and socialism. Later, at the age of seventeen, Chávez joined the Venezuelan armed forces. He later recalled that he joined so that he would be eligible to play in the military baseball leagues. He subsequently enrolled in 1971 as a fourth class cadet of the then Military Academy of Venezuela.\n\n\nLife as a cadet (1971–1975)\nAside from his regular studies in college, Chávez also read history books and debated politics with fellow cadets. Between 1971 and 1973, a group of Panamanian military cadets came to Chávez's academy. From them, Chávez first learned of Panama's leader, Omar Torrijos, and the recent leftist Panamanian revolution. Chávez's curiosity was piqued by Torrijos' efforts to regain control of both the Panama Canal and the Panama Canal Zone from its traditional owner, the United States government. Thereafter, Chávez looked at Torrijos as a model leader.\nIn 1974, Chávez and around one dozen fellow cadets and soldiers—all youths—traveled to Ayacucho, Peru to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the eponymous Battle of Ayacucho. There, they were personally greeted by radical leftist Juan Velasco Alvarado, the President of Peru between 1968 and 1975. Velasco gave each of them a miniature pocket edition of La Revolución Nacional Peruana (\"The Peruvian National Revolution\"). The cadets also noted Velasco's perceived close relationship with both the Peruvian masses and the rank and file of the Peruvian military. Chávez became attached to this book, and would both study its contents and constantly carry it on his person. However, Chávez later lost it after his arrest for leading the 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt. Twenty-five years later, as president, Chávez ordered the printing of millions of copies of his government's new Bolivarian Constitution—only in the form of miniature blue booklets, a partial tribute to Velasco's gift.\nWhile studying at the military academy, Chávez generally avoided all discussion of politics with his family, especially whenever he stayed with them during holidays. He particularly disliked political discussion with his father, who was then a member of the COPEI political party—indeed, his father would eventually rise to the position of education director of Barinas during the COPEI administration of Luis Herrera Campins. However, Chávez did enjoy such talk during his regular visits to the Ruiz family household. For several months during 1974, Chávez maintained a personal diary; in it, he was careful in his usage of proper Spanish language. Chávez also expressed a leftist political orientation; writing of his dislike of U.S. foreign policy and Venezuela's perceived lack of a distinct national or cultural identity. As an example, he noted that both Venezuela's national sport (baseball) and Venezuela's popular music ultimately were American in origin.\nAs a so-called provinciano (\"provincial person\", that is, an implication of backwardness regarding the social graces of urban life), Chávez was prima facie regarded by his peers as both polite and shy. However, by the time he had graduated, Chávez had emceed a beauty contest as well as taken charge of his own obscure radio program. As a young man, Chávez had two girlfriends, who were considered by other students as unattractive. Chávez too was widely considered unattractive, and these girlfriends were more interested in two of Chávez's best friends, the Ruiz brothers, than in Chávez himself. Chávez also had his share of social upsets; for example, when a young woman whom he considered attractive refused to pay any attention to him, Chávez found a rotting donkey head on the side of the road and left it in front of her door. Later, Chávez found another girlfriend, Herma Marksman, who helped draft a capstone thesis required of him prior to graduation. Chávez would—after his marriage at age 23. to Nancy Colmenares— later commit adultery with Marksman. His relationship with Marksman lasted nine years.\nChávez graduated eighth in his class on 5 July 1975 as a sub-lieutenant with a degree in military arts and science. After receiving his sword of command personally from the hands of President Carlos Andrés Pérez during an annual parade, Chávez entered military service.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Look to the East policy",

    "text": "Look to the East (Persian: نگاه به شرق, Negâh be sharq) is a foreign policy strategy in the Islamic Republic of Iran that has been proposed since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency in 2005. However, there is no consensus among experts as to which countries are among the goals of this policy, and from which point of view this policy should be viewed. There are at least three different views.\nThis policy falls within the theoretical framework of constructivism.\n\n\nConcept\nThe Look to the East policy evokes three states:\n\ndevelopment of relations with the East and the limitation of relations with the West;\nsymmetric balance in relations with the East and the West;\nasymmetric balance in relations with the East and the West, with priority for the East.\nThe goals of Look to the East aligns itself most closely with the third clause, as it is based on avoiding Western-oriented unilateralism in foreign policy and a comprehensive view of foreign policy in order to take advantage and create opportunities. It is different from the first clause, and it has subtle differences with the second clause, as the policy is based on trying to communicate with the East and the West bilaterally, albeit prioritizing the East for geopolitical, cultural and economic needs. Therefore, this approach does not mean negation and indifference to the West; emphasis on the East in this case is not the negation of the West. In this regard, it can be inferred that Look to the East is a realistic strategy and—most importantly—seeks to use the opportunities of communication with different countries. In this regard, Ali Akbar Velayati, in describing the Look to the East policy, states: \"Wherever our interests, desires and strategy are better and more met, it is natural that we give priority to it.\"\n\n\nCharacteristics\nIn a situation where there is neither a clear reality called the \"Eastern Bloc\" nor the ideological claims of the East, Look to the East does not mean following the East and pure compliance with the Eastern countries, as was imagined during the Cold War. Therefore, the characteristics of this policy can be listed as follows:\n\nIn balancing relations between East and West, Iran gives priority to the East, but does not negate the West, but is mainly opposed to an over-inclination to the West.\nIt is based on creating advantage and opportunity. Therefore, it has flexibility and fluidity. In other words, it considers the field of relations with countries as wide.\nNor is it contrary to the policy of \"neither East nor West\"; Because turning to the East does not mean accepting the domination of the East, and the East, is no longer like the former and has collapsed realistically and ideologically.\n\n\nHistory\nSince the beginning of the Islamic Republic, Iran has made the slogan \"neither East nor West\" its motto and tried to take an independent step in its foreign policy. Until the end of the Cold War, Iran's absolutist approach to this slogan prevented Iran from finding strategic allies. The Look to the East policy came at a time when Iran's negotiations with European and Western countries over Iran's nuclear program were challenged and failed to serve national interests well; At the same time, the developments that have taken place in Asia in recent years have created new conditions.\nOne of the most important issues related to foreign policy after the ninth government came to power was the Look to the East policy and expanding Iran's relations with Asian countries. In fact, the failure to achieve the desired goals in relations with Western countries with the continuing hostility between Iran and the United States, especially in the nuclear case, led to the expansion of Iran's relations with the East to be considered and emphasized once again. This policy has so far been practically accompanied by a series of international movements and political stances.\nDue to the issue of Iran's nuclear case, in which the three European countries, Britain, France and Germany, played a key role in the negotiations, and the emergence of a stalemate in this case by the mentioned countries, and that these three countries introduced themselves as representatives of the European Community or of the West in general, increased the tendency to find new horizons in the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Look to the East was in fact derived from the conditions mentioned. However, such a policy was not unprecedented in Iran and during the second term of Hashemi Rafsanjani's presidency, moves were made to strengthen existing ties with important Asian countries such as China, India and Russia within the framework of a strategic alliance.\nLook to the East has been considered in the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran at different times, with strengths and weaknesses. However, in the recent years, this strategy has garnered more attention, as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei emphasized on 18 February 2018, that \"in foreign policy, the preference of the East over the West, the preference of the neighbor over the distant, the preference nations and countries that have something in common with us over others is one of our priorities today.\" In this regard, Ali Akbar Velayati, the International Advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran, also considers this policy as a strategic necessity for the Islamic Republic in order to secure its economic, political and defense interests.\nThe policy focused on securance of the country's equipment needs from countries such as China, Russia, and North Korea. Given the success of cooperation with the countries of the Eastern sphere, the policy as a special strategy used by Iranian presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Hassan Rouhani. Among the mentioned governments, during Ahmadinejad's presidency, due to the unprecedented pressure of the West on the Islamic Republic of Iran under political pretexts, this idea took over the country's diplomatic apparatus, which is the key to solving fundamental problems in foreign policy not located in European capitals but in East Asia. According to this, Ahmadinejad, while reforming the approaches and policies of the previous government (Khatami), which was based on establishing and deepening relations with the West and specifically Europe, made special efforts to establish relations with the Eastern world.\n\nAfter the end of the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2013, the eleventh government led by Hassan Rouhani, although made special efforts to solve the previous problems and subsequently improve relations with the West through the so-called \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, BARJAM)\" agreement, but Rouhani did not overlooked from East Asia, and specifically the Indo-Pacific strategic area. Because he knew that given the specific geopolitical and geostrategic situations, these regions would be able to influence the order of the world power pyramid in the coming years. This is the reason why Rouhani's government set up the Iran–China 25-year Cooperation Program as a rising power in politics and international relations.\nLook to the East has been seen as an escape rather than an opportunity to turn to in times of trouble with the West. In other words, it can be said that the strategy of Look to the East in the field of foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been more affected by the challenge to the West as a codified policy.\n\n\nTarget countries\nCountries such as Japan, South Korea, China, Malaysia, Russia, India and Pakistan have been targeted in this policy. Of course, according to some, since Japan and South Korea, by adopting the economic policies of liberal capitalism and cultural dissolution in Western civilization, are no longer defined in the context of Oriental civilization, they can no longer have a place in this policy, and the Look to the East policy is based on the four pillars of Russia, India, China and Malaysia.\n\n\nApproaches\nGeographical-ideological\nBased on this type of view, the definition of the Eastern sphere is based on geographical location and to some extent the confrontation with the Western world.According to this view, Latin American countries are also defined in the Eastern sphere. This approach has been the basis of decision-making in Ahmadinejad's government.\n\nIdeological\nWith the ideological view, which is based on the bipolar east–west confrontation and the Islamist view of the Islamic Republic, the countries of the Islamic world are also defined in the Eastern sphere. This view has few fans.\n\nPragmatic\nThis view of the East is based on the Eastern civilization and with a regional and neighborhood perspective and tries to provide a spatial and geographical identity from the East.\n\n\nCriticism\nFereydoon Majlesi, former Iranian diplomat, believes that the Look to the East policy not only does not lead to Iran's progress and exit from the current situation, but also traps the country in a non-competitive market and causes uneconomic and harmful trade interactions. According to him, the strategy of Look to the East does not make sense for Iran. With this policy, Iran becomes captive to its inability with the East and remains trapped in this market. Therefore, if they give any goods at any price, Iran will have to buy. While Iran should be free in its relations and become a customer of any market that offers better goods at a more competitive price. According to him, the strategy of Look to the East causes Iranian to pay a lot of financial ransom to the countries of the East for playing as broker in the world market. According to him, in general, the Look to the East policy results in a harmful economy for Iran.\nQaem Mousavi, An Iranian political science expert has said, in regards to Look to the East, that \"Iran has tended to China and Russia because of the influence of the West and the pressures of the United States, but China and Russia have not responded positively to our country despite the apparent-verbal declaration. They did not support us in major crises and troubles. China and Russia deprive us of what was necessary and left us empty-handed.\" According to him, Russia benefits are served from Iran's troubles with the West and therefore Russia encourages the continuation of this dispute in order to secure its interests. Russia, meanwhile, has not provided adequate support where needed. According to him, Iran is forced to ignore China's bad treatment with its Muslims in the face of the US and Western pressure. According to him, Iran should avoid dependence on Russia and China, because they are not reliable and stable allies and will no doubt not provide the necessary support to Iran in sensitive areas.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nIran’s Look East Policy: Analyzing The Possibility Of Establishment Of Strategic Economic Alliance Between The Islamic Republic Of Iran And China (1989 2013)\nIran’s look east policy may force US rethink\nIran’s “Look to the East Policy”: Pivot Towards China and Eurasian Economic Union\nImplications of Tehran’s Look to the East Policy for EU-Iran Relations\nIran sticks to 'Look to the East' doctrine amid frustration with Europe\nIran Looking East A Shifting Balance of Power in Tehran’s Foreign Policy\nIran and look to the east policy\nIran's Look to the East - İRAM Center",

    "text": "Leopold van der Pals (St. Petersburg 4 July 1884 – Dornach 7 February 1966) was a Danish/Dutch modernist composer who developed a personal and lyrical style in composing by involving elements of late romanticism, expressionism and impressionism. \nFrom an early age, Van der Pals expressed himself as a composer, writing at least 50 works before the age of 18. He studied with Professor  Julius Johannsen (Van der Pals' grand father), Alexander Denéréas (Lausanne) and Reinhold Gliere (Berlin). Van der Pals also studied piano under Alexander Siloti and cello under Tom Canivez. \nLeopold van der Pals debut as a composer took place in 1909 with Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (Symphony nr. 1 in F sharp minor, Op. 4) and an extensive tour of performances throughout Europe and America followed until WWII. The main part of his 252 works consists of music for singers (8 operas, 9 cantatas and 650 lieder), but it also includes orchestral works and chamber music. He was in close contact with authors, musicians, artists and poets his whole life. Among them were Rudolf Steiner, Andrei Belyj, Rainer Maria Rilke, Friedrich Lienhard, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Serge Koussevitzky and Alexander Scriabin.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nSt. Petersburg 1884-1903\nLeopold van der Pals was born into an artistic and aristocratic home in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire with a Dutch father and Danish mother. His father, Hendrik van Gilse van der Pals was the Dutch general counsel in Russia and director of the “Treugolnik” rubber factory. \nAt the age of 12, Leopold van der Pals started his musical training under his grandfather, Julius Johannsen, a Professor of counterpoint and director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory (Johannsen was himself a student of Felix Mendelssohn and Niels W. Gade). The van der Pals home was open to artists and musicians, and here, Leopold van der Pals heard concerts with Modest Tchaikovsky, Anton Arensky, Alexander Glazunov, Alexander Siloti, Pablo Casals, and many others.\n\n\nLausanne 1903-1907\nAt the age of 19 van der Pals left Russia to continue his studies in Lausanne, Switzerland, with the famous Swiss composer and music theory professor Alexander Denéréas, and the cellist Thomas Canivez. Here he formed a long lasting friendship with the conductor Ernest Ansermet. Van der Pals' education was closely supervised by Denéréas, and even when van der Pals was forced to stay in a sanatorium in Davos to recover from signs of tuberculosis, Denéréas visited him and they continued their studies. \nIn 1907, after four years of basic musical education in Lausanne, Van der Pals moved to Berlin and, on the recommendation of Sergei Rachmaninoff, he now received guidance and lessons by the Russian composer Reinhold Glière. Here, van der Pals formed a friendship with many musical personalities: Arthur Nikisch, Felix Weingartner, Siegmund von Hausegger, Gustav Havemann, Serge Koussevitsky and Alexander Scriabin among others. Here he also met the philosopher Rudolf Steiner, who made a great impression on him and introduced the idea of metamorphosis, derived from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. At the time, Berlin was a melting pot of musical development in the wake of the romantic era. Van der Pals experimented with new harmonic ideas and alternative cadenzas. He shaped his personal expression, a hybrid of different styles such as romanticism, impressionism, free tonality and inspiration from Russian and Nordic folklore. It was here that he started to give his works opus numbers; all previous compositions were abandoned.\n\n\nBerlin 1907-1915\nDuring the Berlin years, 1907–1915, van der Pals was very productive and composed his first 30 works, concentrating on large orchestral pieces and lieder. His First Symphony, Op. 4 was premiered in 1909 by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Heinrich Schulz. The Symphony was very well received in the press and this resulted in an extensive series of performances of his pieces throughout Europe and America. \n\n\nArlesheim 1915-1922\nIn 1915, due to World War I, Van der Pals moved to Arlesheim in Switzerland with his wife Marussja and their young daughter Lea. Here he started his large series of compositions of chamber music for various ensembles. A string quartet, a piano trio, a duo for cello and violin and sonatas for piano, cello and violin. \n\n\nYears of traveling 1922-1934\nIn 1922 van der Pals completed his Second Symphony, Op. 51. However, the orchestration of this piece was interrupted when Leopold's wife Marussja fell ill; in order to treat her condition, the family was forced to leave Arlesheim. For a period of 11 years the family constantly traveled between sanatoriums in order to find a place suitable for Marussja's condition. During these years the family stayed in approximately 80 locations in Europe without a fixed home. This time was troublesome for Van der Pals. His wife's treatment was expensive and Leopold experienced great difficulty to follow and continue his career. He had no chance to travel and hear performances of his compositions. In spite of his difficulties he continued his work and in this period he composed the Third Symphony, \"Rhapsody\", Op. 73, the \"Hodler Suite\", Op. 74, based on four paintings by Ferdinand Hodler, and two operas, Der Berg des Heiligen Michael, Op. 71, and Eisenhand, Op. 85.\n\n\nDornach 1934-1966\nMarussja died in 1934. Her death affected Leopold deeply. He withdrew himself to Ascona, Switzerland, and mourned the loss of his wife. Here Van der Pals wrote 80 poems to her love and memory; 45 of them were put to music. The work became his Op. 96, In Memoriam with the subtitle ”Dem Geiste meiner Frau\". He then finally settled down in Dornach in Switzerland, where he lived during the remaining 31 years of his life.\nIn the early 1930s, Van der Pals experienced the loss of many people close to him: his wife, his father, and several of his close friends. During this period, he composed his Requiem and the Third violin sonata, Op. 101, with the middle movement ”Marcia funebre”. He also now orchestrated the Second Symphony, Op. 51. The premiere of the symphony took place in Vienna in 1937, with his brother Nicolaï van Gilse van der Pals conducting. At the same concert, his Third symphony and Violin Concerto were also played.\nEven though the interest in van der Pals’ music was extensive, the possibilities of performances were soon to be diminished. The climate for modern composers and artists suffered from the harsh political atmosphere and escalating international conflicts. With the start of World War II all possibilities were gone and many artists migrated to America where the conditions were better. Leopold decided to stay in Switzerland even though this meant to distance himself from the modern music environment. He never stopped creating, no matter which obstacles came his way. Apart from the 252 completed opuses, he also wrote poems, articles, reviews and librettos for all of his eight operas. At the time of Leopold's death on 1 February 1966 aged 83, his last piece, an opera called Isis was left on the piano unfinished.\n\n\nFamily\nVan der Pals married Maria (Marussja) von Beshe in St. Petersburg in 1907. They had one daughter, Lea van Gilse van der Pals, who became a renowned dancer and teacher, both in Dornach, Switzerland and internationally. One of Leopold's younger brothers, Nicolaï van Gilse van der Pals, was a conductor in Helsinki and elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\nList of Works\nLeopold van der Pals wrote 252 opus, 43 Jugendwerke and a number of unfinished works.

    "summary": "Leopold van der Pals (St. Petersburg 4 July 1884 – Dornach 7 February 1966) was a Danish/Dutch modernist composer who developed a personal and lyrical style in composing by involving elements of late romanticism, expressionism and impressionism. \nFrom an early age, Van der Pals expressed himself as a composer, writing at least 50 works before the age of 18. He studied with Professor  Julius Johannsen (Van der Pals' grand father), Alexander Denéréas (Lausanne) and Reinhold Gliere (Berlin). Van der Pals also studied piano under Alexander Siloti and cello under Tom Canivez. \nLeopold van der Pals debut as a composer took place in 1909 with Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (Symphony nr. 1 in F sharp minor, Op. 4) and an extensive tour of performances throughout Europe and America followed until WWII. The main part of his 252 works consists of music for singers (8 operas, 9 cantatas and 650 lieder), but it also includes orchestral works and chamber music. He was in close contact with authors, musicians, artists and poets his whole life. Among them were Rudolf Steiner, Andrei Belyj, Rainer Maria Rilke, Friedrich Lienhard, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Serge Koussevitzky and Alexander Scriabin.",

    "text": "Mongaugon Township, is a former township of Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Quarries where gray limestone and celestine associated with calcite, fluorite, gypsum, epsomite, and rarely, sulfur were first worked by the French circa 1749. United States forces aided by Muskrat French defeated United Kingdom forces aided by Native Americans forces at the Battle of Monguagon during the War of 1812.\nMongaugon Township was first settled in 1812 by many former soldiers of the afformentioned War who founded villages that grew to become the cities of Trenton and Riverview, and the civil township of Grosse Ile.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nBattle of Monguagon\nBefore Monguagon's township years, a small conflict of the War of 1812 known as the Battle of Maguaga, also known as the Battle of Monguagon, ensued at then-village Maguaga in present-day Riverview, Michigan.\nIn the days before the coalition, American troops under the Governor of Michigan Territory, Brigadier General William Hull, marched to Fort Detroit to set up a base to attack on Upper Canada. Hull sent Lieutenant-Colonel James Miller with 280 regulars and 330 Ohio volunteer troops to collect supplies for Hull's garrison that were depoted at the site of the Battle of Brownstown, then escort the pack train back to Detroit. On the return, Miller's path was barred by British Captain Adam Muir.\nAs American troops advanced on the British troops, men were noticed creeping through the nearby woods, who turned out to be Potawatomi warriors allied to the British, came to join the battle as flanking skirmishers, but immediately retreated. After American troops unleashed their forces onto the British troops, the British fell back, but then remained in their place, waiting for another attack. Miller decided not to advance on the British troops a second time.\nThe casualties for Miller's force were 18 killed and 64 wounded, while the casualties for Muir's force was 3 killed, 13 wounded, and 2 missing from the 41st Regiment, who returned later and were imprisoned, as well as 1 killed and 2 wounded from the Canadian militia. 2 were killed and 6 were wounded from the Native American contingent.\nMiller's troops camped at the nearby woods for two days, not returning for their knapsacks which they had discarded before the attack to fight more effectively, and ignoring orders from General Hull to resume en route to the Rapids, before being ordered to return to Detroit.\n\n\nAfter battle\n\nOn January 15, 1818, a proclamation by Lewis Cass, Governor of Michigan Territory, established Mongaugon, along with townships of Hamtramck, Huron, St. Clair, and Springwells as townships of Wayne County. These townships were formed under authority initially granted by the Court of General Sessions for the Northwest Territory on November 6, 1790. Under this system, townships were governed by a commissioner.\nOn April 12, 1827, Cass signed an act that abolished the office of township commissioner, and also established in Wayne County the townships of Brownstown, Bucklin, Detroit, Ecorse, Hamtramck, Huron, Mongaugon, Plymouth and Springwells.\nTownship government in Mongaugon was organized on May 25, 1827, with the election of Colonel Abram Caleb Truax as supervisor, with several persons elected to other offices. Truax is credited as the founder of Trenton for laying out the village of Truaxton, which became Trenton.\nThe township created by the act of 1827 consisted of survey township 4 south of range 11 east of the Michigan Meridian and included all of Grosse Ile. By a legislative act of February 16, 1842, the portion of Brownstown Township east of a north–south line through the center of sections 2, 11, 14, 23, and 26 were added to Monguagon Township.  Grosse Ile Township was part of Monguagon until 1914 when it organized as a separate township. The cities of Trenton and Riverview incorporated from the township.\nMongaugon was located at approximately 42°9′N 83°11′W and was bounded on the north by Ecorse Township (what is now the southern boundary of the cities of Southgate and Wyandotte). On the west and south, it was bounded by Brownstown Township.\nThe name Mongaugon is that of a Pottawatomi chief who lived along the Detroit River circa 1755.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBurton, Clarence Monroe (2005) [1922].

In addition, Inner City Miracle, a memoir, was published by Ballantine Books. On June 19, 2022, a new E! reality program, Mathis Family Matters, premiered, starring Greg Mathis as the paternal head of household along with his family and their various loved ones as they encounter various domestic ups and downs.\n\n\nEarly life\nMathis was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Charles Mathis, a Detroit native, and his wife, Alice Lee Mathis, a devoted Seventh-day Adventist, nurse's aide, and housekeeper. Alice (then divorced from Charles) raised Mathis alone in Detroit during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. Mathis moved to Herman Gardens in 1964 and resided with family until roughly 1970. They moved away from the housing complex to avoid rising drug use and rates of violent crime. Mathis was arrested several times as a juvenile delinquent, mainly for purse-snatching, breaking-and-entering, and robbery. He would eventually be arrested and put behind bars at age 17 for nine months for a concealed-weapons charge. While he was incarcerated in Wayne County Jail, his mother visited him and revealed she had colon cancer so the judge overhearing his case would subsequently give him an ultimatum of G.E.D or jail time along with early probation.\n\n\nEducation\nOnce out of jail, Mathis began working at McDonald's, a job he needed to keep to maintain his release on probation. A close family friend helped Mathis get admitted to Eastern Michigan University, and he discovered a new interest in politics and public administration. He became a campus activist and worked for the Democratic Party, organizing several demonstrations against South African Apartheid policies.  He graduated with a B.S. in Public Administration from the Ypsilanti campus and began to seek employment in Detroit's City Hall. He also became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nTelevision\nMathis's biggest claim to fame is his television court show, Judge Mathis, which ran for 24 seasons from 1999 to 2023. The program is one of the longest-running shows in the court programming genre, 4th in place behind only Divorce Court (still in production), The People's Court (now out of production) and Judge Judy (now out of production), respectively. As Divorce Court and The People's Court have suffered temporary cancellations/re-installments/judge-role recasting, Mathis and Judge Judy boasts the longest single-production runs as well as runs with a single presiding judge. With Judge Judy out of production after 25 seasons as of July 2021, Judge Mathis became the longest-running active single-production court show until its end in 2023. Mathis is also the second-longest-reigning arbitrator in courtroom television history.\nFollowing the success of his ongoing court show, Mathis also stars in another program entitled Mathis Family Matters which revolves around himself, his family, and their loved ones as they face domestic highs and lows.\n\n\nOutside of television\nMathis began his political career as an unpaid intern, and then became an assistant to Clyde Cleveland, a city council member. It was at this time  Mathis took the LSAT and applied to law schools; he was conditionally admitted to the University of Detroit School of Law, which was located in downtown Detroit, walking distance from city hall. He passed a summer course and was officially admitted to the night program, which took four years to complete.\nMathis was denied a license to practice law for several years after graduating from law school because of his criminal past. He received his J.D. from the University of Detroit Mercy in 1987. In 1995, he was elected a district court judge for Michigan's 36th District, making him the youngest person in the state to hold the post. During the five years he was on the bench, he was rated in the top five of all judges in the 36th District; there are about thirty judges each year.\nMathis was appointed head of Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign in the state of Michigan in 1988. Mathis later became head of Mayor Coleman Young's re-election campaign and after the victory was appointed to run the city's east side city hall.\nMathis has continued to be involved in politics after rising to national entertainment prominence through his television show. Urban politics and African-American movements have been his focus. Most recently, Mathis was invited by the Obama administration to be a part of \"My Brothers Keeper\", a White House Initiative to empower boys, and men of color.\nOn June 4, 2011, Detroit-area drivers lined up for blocks as Mathis offered up to $92 worth of free gasoline apiece to the first 92 drivers to show up at a northwest Detroit Mobil station. He told the Detroit Free Press it was a gift to the people who elected him to District Court despite his youthful criminal record. \"LA didn't elect me judge,\" he said. \"Chicago didn't elect me judge. Detroiters took a chance on me. It's just the right thing to do. And when you're blessed, you have to look out for the rest.\" The giveaway took place near the Mathis Community Center, which he funds. Its activities include self-improvement classes, food and clothing assistance, and training for ex-convicts. \"No matter what international fame he's achieved, he's still a hometown guy,\" said WMXD-FM's Frankie Darcell, who announced the location on the air. \"Everybody's happy. I'm happy,\" said gas station owner Mike Safiedine. \"The people need it, especially (because) the price is very high.\"\nIn September 2008, Mathis wrote a novel called Street Judge, based on the life of a judge who solves murders. It was co-written by Zane, a well-known erotic series writer of Zane's Sex Chronicles. Mathis also wrote a book entitled Of Being a Judge to Criminals and Such.\n\n\nActivism\nFollowing his time spent in the Herman Gardens mixed-income housing, Mathis remained devoted to aiding families in the area. In 2003, he lobbied city officials on the behalf of former Herman Gardens residents, imploring lawmakers to allow these individuals their first chance to move into new apartments built where Herman Gardens once stood.\n\n\nPersonal life\nMathis met his wife, Linda, a fellow Eastern Michigan University alumnus, shortly after his mother's death. They married in June 1985 and have four children together: a daughter Jade, born May 1985, a daughter Camara, born October 1987, a son Greg Jr. born January 1989 and a son Amir, born July 1990. Mathis, who is a member of the City Temple Seventh-day Adventist Church, was awarded the Black History Achievement Award from Oakwood University, which he says is the most meaningful award he has received.\nOn August 22, 2024, his wife Linda filed for divorce after 39 years of marriage. In court papers, Linda listed their date of separation as July 17, 2024 and also stated that she filed for divorce due to \"irreconcilable differences.\"\nOn November 1, 2024, TMZ announced that Mathis and his wife have reconciled.\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\nBibliography\nMathis, Greg and Blair S.

    "text": "Gisberta Salce (1960–2006) was a Brazilian trans woman who was murdered in Porto, Portugal in 2006.\nSalce grew up in Brazil, but left for France at the age of 18 to escape a wave of homicides against transgender people in São Paulo and ended up in Portugal two years later. In 2006 at the age of 45, she was physically and sexually assaulted over the course of several days by a group of boys ranging in age from 12 to 16. As a result of her murder and the subsequent investigation and trial, multiple controversies erupted over corruption and abuse at the Oficina de São José. \n\n\nLife\n\n\nEarly life\nAngelina Muro Salce and Gisberto Salce, Gisberta's parents, had eight children. Gisberta was the youngest, and was named after her father, Gisberto. She was nicknamed \"Júnior\". She would later feminize her given name, from Gisberto to Gisberta.\nAccording to her sister Jacine, 12 years her senior, she had “delicate, very white skin” and \"really liked to dance\". Jacine said that Salce regularly wore her sister's clothes and that she considered Gisberta to be her \"toy doll.\" According to her sister, Salce \"liked to play with the girls and we didn't care\". While Salce was still a child, her mother expressed concern over her behavior. At some point, she was taken to a doctor and told that she was like that due to \"excessive pampering\". At the age of 14, after her father died, she told her mother that she “was going to be a woman”. Salce was known to wear girl's clothes when visiting friends; however, around her family, she opted for clothes that were more \"gender neutral\". At the age of 18, she decided to leave the country for France after news surfaced of homophobic discrimination and murders in Casa Verde, São Paulo.\nShe temporarily returned to Brazil for hormone replacement therapy, silicone breast implants and other feminizing procedures. She spent two years in France before moving to Portugal and settling in Porto.\n\n\nIn Portugal\nSalce started doing stage performances at a bar named Invictus in the galleries of Hotel Malaposta, where Salce would hang out, which occupied a space formerly used by Kilt, one of the first gay bars in the city. From there, she moved on to stages at other bars, including Bustos and Syndicato. Salce, in her shows, often impersonated Marilyn Monroe. During the day, Salce enjoyed having coffee with her friends and walking her two Yorkshire terriers around the city. Nuno Câmara Lima, a nurse who worked on a Espaço Pessoa project that “supported people who performed sex work”, some of whom also struggled with drug addiction or sexually transmitted infections, spent time with Salce. He had first met Salce during her first few years in the city, saying she was a \"...very active in the trendy nightclubs in Porto, like Swing. She was a very beautiful woman. If I saw her on the street, she would be a woman with good makeup, nice clothes, nice shoes.\" \nWhile living in Porto, Salce was known to engage in sex work on Rua de Santa Catarina, as she earned little money from her stage performances. At some point in 1996, she contracted an HIV infection, which had an adverse impact on her health and was complicated by her drug use. She began to frequent the social welfare associations Migalha de Amor and Espaço Pessoa to eat, bathe and talk. Upon learning of her HIV-positive status, Salce refused treatment.\nAt one point, Salce was treated at Hospital Joaquim Urbano over a 22 day period. Afterwards, she spent a week in a therapeutic community for rehabilitation in Setúbal, but left before being released.\n\n\nHomelessness\nAfter leaving the therapeutic community she began to consume “heavier” drugs. This led to the loss of her home and primary source of income.\n“She started going to houses with lower and lower incomes, then she passed through several social districts, until she fell into that hole”, says Nuno Lima, referring to the tent that she set up in a building on Avenida Fernão de Magalhães. The disease (HIV) took away her livelihood: sex work.\nSalce was “loved by all the nurses” and “showed pictures of her family, showed pictures of herself as a young girl, a girl”. In her 40s, she arrived at Espaço Pessoa, drank coffee, ate something, watched television, talked for a while, stayed for a few hours. \"She would come at midnight and go to her corner.\"\nThey visited the space only after her death, in photographs, part of the material to report the events.\nSalce was also supported by “Coração da Cidade”, the social department of “Migalha de Amor”. This association, founded by La Salete Correia dos Santos, offered dinner to about a thousand homeless people, and Salce was one of them.\n\n\nLast months\nAt the end of 2005, three teenagers, Fernando, Ivo and Flávio started to get together to spray paint \"graffiti\" in an abandoned building in Porto, the same one Salce was living in a tent inside. Fernando's mother was a sex worker and the child was often left with a babysitter. Their house was frequented \"by people associated with the nightlife of Porto\" and it was precisely there that Fernando's mother and her son began to have a connection with Salce. Although contact was lost for some time between them, it was Fernando who later, at the age of 14, identified Salce in the abandoned building where he, along with his friends, were painting murals.\nThe three boys talked to her and, from there, began to visit her regularly. During these visits, Salce \"told them about the health problems she suffered from\", verbalized her weakness, AIDS, a syndrome \"the external physical signs of which the boys were well aware of\". From there, the three boys began to bring Salce some food. In addition, they even “cooked meals for her on the spot”, as stated in the process.\n\n\nDisclosure of Gisberta Salce's existence\nFernando, Ivo and Flávio spoke of \"a man who 'had breasts' and 'really looked like a woman'\" to colleagues at Escola Augusto César Pires de Lima and Oficina de São José, an institution under the tutelage of the Catholic Church that hosted 11 of the 14 boys who would torture and kill Gisberta, that was eventually closed after several scandals related to sexual abuse and embezzlement, in addition to the suicide of a principal in the most critical phase of the trial. The three youngsters who first met Gisberta were then joined by eleven, who were eager to see Salce.\n\n\nFirst aggressions\nThat building became a meeting point to attack the Brazilian immigrant. Not every one of the boys attacked her, nor did they all do so on the same day. But, as of February 15, 2006, the 14 youths had divided into groups and were in the building to attack Gisberta Salce.\nIn one of the first episodes, the boys noticed that Salce was inside the tent and one of them ordered her to get up and shouted: \"Didn't I tell you that I didn't want you here?\" Salce left the tent, while replying that she had nowhere to go. Flávio wielded a stone that he had picked up and threw it in the direction of the woman, hitting her in the frontal region and in anterior part of the left parietal region of her skull.\nSalce fell to the ground, bleeding. When she managed to get up a few minutes later, one of the boys, named David, jumped on her, which caused her to fall again. There, all the elements of the group, with the exception of Vítor Santos, threw themselves on Salce and together attacked her by kicking her and hitting her with sticks. Salce started to scream from the pain and the group ran away in fear of being caught by the security guards in the parking lot that was close to the building.\nThe initial group of three boys, who had before cooked rice for Gisberta in that same building, met the next day, on February 16, to now attack her there. When they arrived at her tent, they realized that Salce's illness had worsened due to the attacks of the previous day, preventing her even from standing up. Salce was lying on a mattress, shivering, spoke in an almost inaudible tone and had dried blood on her head. The three minors asked Salce if she wanted help, and she replied that she \"just wanted a cigarette and to be left alone\".\nThe three left and went to their classes, but were soon replaced by six from the group. José António told José Alexandre to undress “Gi” but he refused because Salce “smelled bad and had AIDS”. So the former teamed up with Jorge Ismael and together they busied themselves by throwing stones at the woman and hitting her on the knees and legs with sticks. Salce shouted and the group once again fled for a few moments.\nThey then returned to Salce, ordered her to get up again, and when she again told them that she couldn't, they assaulted her once more with sticks and kicks, according to the case file. Lying on the floor and unable to defend herself due to her physical weakness and the number of aggressors, Salce just curled up and covered herself with the blanket, shouting \"don't do this, hooligans!\" Not satisfied after this physical assault, the youngsters also destroyed Gisberta's tent before leaving.\n\n\nLast days\n\n\nFebruary 18, 2006\nBy 2:30pm, Gisberta Salce was outside her tent, lying on her side under a blanket, only her head uncovered. David, one of the six who had again agreed to go to the building to attack Salce, ordered Salce to get up. She replied that she couldn't do it “because she was in a very bad state”. He kicked her once more. \"During the assaults, the victim cried convulsively, due to the pain she felt.\" Even so, “the boys continued to attack her in the same way”. David even grabbed a wooden beam about 1.5 meters long and 20 centimeters in diameter and dropped it on Gisberta's body, striking her at stomach level. This blow \"caused great suffering\", concluded the investigators of the case.\n\n\nFebruary 19, 2006\nPart of the group was about to continue their routine of violence when they came across Salce lying on the floor, dressed in a nightgown and naked from the waist down, completely still. They called her name, but Salce was unable to speak and just let out a very low moan. She was then touched on the legs with a stick but didn't move.\n\n\nFebruary 21, 2006\nA day passed and, on February 21, another part of the group returned. Salce was outside the tent, lying on some rocks, \"with her legs curled up\". On her legs were “scratches and eccymoses”. Salce was still naked from the waist down.\nThey thought Salce was dead due to the lack of an answer to their questions, the pale shade of her face and some \"signs that she was not breathing, despite having placed the flame of a lighter next to her mouth\". That day, they warned other members of the group that Salce had died.\nThe next day's meeting was now to \"dispose of the body\" - because they were scared they would be held responsible, and because \"some of them thought that the victim was entitled to 'a funeral'\". The possibility of burial was ruled out, as the boys lacked the tools to make a hole, and setting Gisberta on fire was also impossible as they feared that the smoke might attract the attention of someone, namely the car park security guards.\nAfter some discussion, they chose to throw her into an existing well in the building, as it contained enough water to hide the victim. Then they agreed to collect all the sticks that had been used for the attacks and dispose of them in the same way.\n\n\nFinal day: February 22, 2006\nIt was 8:30 when Ivo put on a woollen glove on his right hand, gave the other to José Alexandre, and Fernando wrapped his hands in a plastic bag. They rolled Salce up in blankets and transported her to the well, about 100 meters away.\nThe water line was about 10 meters from the surface. The three pushed her inside and Salce was submerged in the water. \nIt was this act that caused her death: Gisberta Salce Júnior, a trans woman, Brazilian immigrant, sex worker and homeless person, who lived with HIV, was still alive at this time, and died by drowning, a fact confirmed by her autopsy report.\nThe group that killed Salce warned the rest of the members that everything had been resolved. The information was passed on to Flávio and from him to the rest of the world: when he returned to school, Flávio told his Civic Education teacher about everything that had happened, because he “couldn't take it anymore”.\nThe teacher later confirmed in court that both Flávio and Ivo were “very pale” and that “when Fernando also confirmed what had happened, he cried a lot”. It was Flávio who gave the authorities the exact location of the well. The agents followed his directions, and the corpse was retrieved at 6:50pm.\n\n\nHomicide Process\nThus began six months of investigation and trial, which involved more than just a group of kids and a trans woman. Scandals at Oficina de São José entered the process, LGBT associations were involved and it all appeared on newspapers.\nThe news of her death (and the systematic assaults prior) aroused in the technicians a feeling of responsibility for what had happened.\nThe authorities seized several objects at the scene. Among them were:\n\nA yellow blanket\nA blue knitted sweater\nPieces of newspaper\nEmpty drink containers\nA black shoe\nVarious condoms\nParlodel 2.5 mg tablets\nA comb\nAn eyeliner\nTwo lipsticks\nA user card from the institution “Coração da Cidade” with the number 132\nA prescription from Hospital Joaquim Urbano\n\n\nAutopsy\nThe autopsy confirmed injuries to the head, neck, lower and upper limbs, larynx and trachea, abdomen, intestines and kidneys; multiple ecchymoses, hemorrhagic infiltrations, excoriations and blood infiltrations.\n\n\nSentences\n\n\nVitor Santos\nVítor Santos was the oldest in the group and the only one at 16 years old. Since he had already reached the age of criminal responsibility, which is 16 in Portugal, the process went to Criminal Courts and he was tried as an adult. He was sentenced to eight months in prison for committing the crime of omission of aid, since everyone confirmed that Santos did not attack Salce. He did, however, take the position of observer of events several times.\nIn a first phase, the other 13 minors were held responsible for the “committing a crime of aggravated murder, of attempted form and with possible intent”. But, as the autopsy found drowning to be the cause of death and not aggression, eleven of these boys were charged with qualified bodily harm and the remaining two were only charged with the crime of omission of aid. The measures applied also differed: the former eleven were admitted to an Educational Center for between 11 and 13 months, and the remaining two were charged with the tutelary measure of educational follow-up for 12 months. Between July and September 2007, they will be free.\n\n\nJosé António\nAfter being heard by the court, José António's mother described her son as \"an affable young man\", always \"well behaved\". Experts found “flaws” in his emotional expressiveness and difficulties in dealing with emotions.\nAfter serving time at the Educational Center, José António returned to his mother's house, on the south bank of the Tagus. The incident was never talked about at home again.\n\n\nRodolfo\nAfter the trial that ended the case, Rodolfo fulfilled the internment measure at the educational center and kept in touch with his family. In an initial phase, the grandfather adopted an “excusing” attitude towards his grandson and showed a critical attitude towards the rules of the institution.\n\n\nFernando\nDuring the sessions, the boy's mother confirmed the acquaintance and assured that Fernando “always dealt with Gisberta's differences with no problem”. She said that her son did not tell her that he had found the woman again, but \"she had noticed that sometimes some food went missing at home\". The mother stressed that her son “never managed to give her an explanation for what had happened”.\nFernando went to his mother's house when he finished serving time.\n\n\nLegacy\nGisberta Salce was then seen as a symbol of multiple discrimination: she was a trans woman, Brazilian immigrant, sex worker, homeless person and a person living with HIV, simultaneously. The violence she suffered was adopted by LGBT associations as an example of prejudice.\n\n\nMarcha do Orgulho LGBT do Porto\nThis event that had its genesis with the brutal death of Gisberta Salce Júnior, in 2006, has been increasing its participants with each edition.\nThe march started in Praça 24 de Agosto to July 2006, a place chosen to remember the trans woman murdered by a group of minors, who started the same week of the march to be tried in Porto.\n\"We want to remember Gisberta and all the Gisbertas in this country, as well as all the abused, murdered children, thrown into the river, those who disappear and women raped by their husbands, because this action was organized in defense of human rights,\" said João Paulo, of the organization and the Portugal Gay association. In honor of Salce, bouquets of flowers were deposited at the place where she was found dead.\nMany of the protesters sported pictures of Salce and others displayed banners where messages such as \"I am a transsexual and I do not want to be murdered\", \"I am not ashamed, I have reasons\" and \"Educating without discrimination\", among others.\nAt the end of the march, a manifest was read and distributed with the main demands of the organizers of the initiative. From the set of requirements, we highlight a profound restructuring of the protection system for minors at risk in Portugal and the explicit inclusion of gender identity in anti-discriminatory legislation and protection in criminal legislation against hate crimes motivated by transphobia.\n\n\nInspiration for artists\nThe case has inspired artists.\n\n\nPoem \"Indulgência Plenária\"\nA year after the events, Alberto Pimenta published “Indulgência Plenária”, a poem in the form of elegy that evokes the figure of Gisberta Salce.\n\n\n\"Balada de Gisberta\"\nThat year, Pedro Abrunhosa composed “Balada de Gisberta”, which he included in the album Luz. Later, Maria Bethânia interpreted this song, closing with her the first act of her show Amor Festa Devoção (2009).\n\n\nShort-film \"A Gis\"\nThiago Carvalhaes dedicated a short film, “A Gis”, in 2016. \"What got me involved first was the song, 'Balada de Gisberta', composed by Pedro Abrunhosa, in the version sung by Maria Betânia\", revealed Carvalhaes. “I wanted to know more. The information was scarce, difficult to find. \"Some were wrong”, he continues. The fact that Brazil is one of the countries that have the most cases of violence against transgender people has only helped to increase his “indignation”.\n\n\nGisberta Salce in the theatrical world\nThe same interpretation by Maria Betânia awoke the actor Luis Lobianco. The play “Gisberta”, with text by Rafael Souza-Ribeiro and staging by Renato Carrera, was on stage on 27 and 28 November 2018 at Teatro Sá da Bandeira, in Porto, and on 4,5 and 6 December 2018 at the Tivoli Theater in Lisbon.\nIn a short exchange of messages with Ípsilon, the production director for that show, Cláudia Marques, speaks of “indignation”, but also of “hope for change”. \"Brazil lives in dark days, when setbacks threaten historical conquests and threaten individual freedoms\", she comments. “I believe in the theater because it is an agent of resistance and transformation. Through Gis's story, I believe that we can speak to the public about respect for diversity and life.”\nThere was a theatrical show in Portugal before. Inventing a mother, Eduardo Gaspar first wrote a short version of the monologue “Gisberta” for actress Rita Ribeiro, who in 2013 sold out Teatro Rápido. He later made a longer version, which debuted in Funchal the following year.\n\n\nPão de Açúcar\nPão de Açúcar, the second novel by Afonso Reis Cabral, is fiction that springs from reality, the death of Gisberta Salce Júnior. Starting from a research work, he invents the perspective of one of the 14 boys who assaulted the trans woman in 2006.\nIn 2016, several media outlets tried to mark the tenth anniversary of that death, which paved the way for the fight for the right to gender identity in Portugal. When confronted with that crime again, Afonso Reis Cabral realized that his second novel was there.\n\n\n#AnoGisberta\nThe Ação pela Identidade defined 2016 as the #AnoGisberta, regarding the 10 years of the death of the trans woman. There were posters scattered around Lisbon with the image of the woman and an exhibition of works at Maus Hábitos, in Porto, and a debate at the Confraria Vermelha Livraria de Mulheres on invisibility and transphobia, also in Porto.\n\n\nCentro Gis\nThe Centro Gis, responding to LGBTI populations (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex) created by Associação Plano i, opened in 2017, pays homage to Gisberta Salce Júnior, with her name.\n\n\nStreet Gisberta Salce Júnior\nIn May 2024, a street in Porto’s Bonfim neighborhood was named after Gisberta Salce Junior, following years of advocacy. While the Toponymy Commission initially rejected similar proposals in 2010 and 2020, a renewed petition narrowly passed in October 2023 and was subsequently approved unanimously by the Porto City Council in January 2024.\nEfforts to honor Gisberta Salce by naming a street after her began in 2010 with the “Viver a Rua” project, part of FITEI, the International Festival of Iberian Expression Theater. Participants were asked to submit a list of ten individuals they felt should be commemorated in Porto's street names, and Gisberta’s name was the most frequently mentioned. The project organizers submitted a petition to the Toponymy Commission, but received no response. Nine years later, actress Sara Barros Leitão led a similar initiative, encouraging audiences of her show Todos Os Dias Me Sujo De Coisas Eternas to sign a new petition. Submitted in March 2020, this petition also received no response, and it was later disclosed that both proposals had been rejected by the commission.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Nikolai Mushegian (March 28, 1993 – October 28, 2022) was an American computer scientist and software engineer, best known for his contributions to software platforms supporting decentralized autonomous organizations and decentralized finance.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMushegian was born in 1993 in Lexington, Kentucky. His parents, both life scientists, immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1991. Mushegian had Ukrainian, Armenian and Russian ancestry. His paternal great-grandfather, Tigran Mushegian (Musheghyan), was rector (president) of Yerevan State University (Armenian National University) in 1933-1935. Mushegian attended Blue Valley North High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where he was recognized for academic achievements and as a multi-instrumentalist musician and drum major of the school marching band.\nFollowing high school, Mushegian attended Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in 2014 from the School of Computer Science with a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. While at Carnegie Mellon, Mushegian became fascinated by the use of cryptography to maintain decentralized records that cannot be changed retroactively. Because the university was not offering courses in the foundations of blockchain technology at that time, Mushegian designed such a course and taught it to his peers in 2014 through Carnegie Mellon Student College.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduation, Mushegian went to work full time for the BitShares project, which he had been involved with since his time at Carnegie Mellon. Bitshares was developing blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrency, extending the use cases to other peer-to-peer networks that must maintain trustworthy records in the absence of a central authority. Starting as a developer, Mushegian was then put in charge of the BitShares DNS project, which was an early attempt to build a decentralized Internet Domain Names Service based on blockchain.\nIn 2015, Mushegian started Nexus/DappHub, a consulting business, where he developed a set of utilities for building smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.\nThe same year, Mushegian and Rune Christensen co-founded MakerDAO, the first decentralized stablecoin project on the Ethereum Blockchain. Mushegian designed and built the Single-Collateral Dai system, which was deployed by MakerDAO in December 2017 as the official launch of Dai. Mushegian was involved in researching and writing the Dai Purple Paper, which specified the design of the Multi-Collateral Dai upgrade.\nShortly before the launch of MakerDAO, the first DAO deployed by Ethereum suffered a hacker attack. Mushegian is credited for identifying a vulnerability in most smart contracts designs; he engineered critical security features into the smart contract architecture, which prevented similar hacks in MakerDAO.\nIn 2016, Mushegian led the team that developed Wrapped Ether (WETH), an Ethereum token compatible with the ERC-20 standard, and designed protection against another vulnerability discovered shortly before.\nAfter Mushegian's departure from MakerDAO, in 2019 he co-authored, with Fernando Martinelli, the Balancer white paper. Balancer is the first decentralized exchange capable of supporting n-dimensional price surfaces, an “automated market maker with ... key properties that cause it to function as a self-balancing weighted portfolio and price sensor”; the white paper presents the mathematical proof of those properties.\nIn 2020, Mushegian co-founded the RAI project, a DAO which generates the Rai stablecoin, the first stablecoin to have a scalable, purely crypto-backed design.\nIn 2022, Mushegian co-founded RICO, a next generation stablecoin project with its own blockchain and autonomous multi-collateral capabilities in a minimalist design.\n\n\nDeath\nMushegian left his home near Condado Beach in San Juan in the early morning of October 28, 2022, and was last seen walking towards the beach. Mushegian’s body was found on the nearby reef later the same day. The police investigation found no foul play.\n\n\nPublic persona and reputation\nMushegian was active in professional chat groups and message boards, as well as on Twitter. The main themes of his posts included critiques of established financial systems and of their role in maintaining income inequality and political control; disdain for the incompetence of the majority of blockchain investors, whom he called LARPers; thorn-in-the-flesh-style commentary on various blockchain and cryptocurrency platforms; and discussions of personal  issues, such as aphantasia, mental health concerns and fear of unnatural death.\nMushegian summarized his thoughts and approaches to code development in online posts, some of which were compiled by others after his death as a tribute to him.\nAfter Mushegian’s death in 2022, in eulogies and commemorations published online,  he was called “a cypherpunk, one of a few that remained active in the crypto community.... noble in the cause”, \"a complicated individual, but nothing short of a visionary\", and someone giving inspiration by his “fierce commitment to the truth, even when others don’t yet understand.” In January 2024, the first blockchain-based mobile game, Spells of Genesis, released a monthly card \"Nikola The Magician\" in Mushegian's memory. The release note called Mushegian an \"extraordinary visionary\", \"a pioneering entrepreneur and a fervent technology enthusiast\", and \"a brilliant mind that helped shape the future\".\n\n\nPhilantropy\nIn 2019,  Mushegian gifted MKR tokens valued at ~$1.4 million to his alma mater The School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The gift was used to establish the Mushegian Research Fund and the Mushegian Endowed Computer Science Fellowship, both supporting research in cryptography, game theory and algorithm design.\nIn 2021, Mushegian bought a 288-acre (~1,17 square kilometers) plot of land adjacent to El Yunque National Forest for $2.2 million, and in 2022 he pledged to donate the plot to the United States Forest Service in order to support land and ecosystem conservation in Puerto Rico. The donation, thought to be the largest land donation to El Yunque in several decades, was completed by Nikolai's parents after his death.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nNikolai Mushegian's personal website\nword.site, Mushegian's blog, posts of 2019-2020\n\"We have started a series...\", post by Mushegian\n\"Terry\", post by Mushegian",

    "text": "The Wickham Market Hoard is a hoard of 840 Iron Age gold staters found in a field at Dallinghoo near Wickham Market, Suffolk, England in March 2008 by car mechanic, Michael Dark using a metal detector. After excavation of the site, a total of 825 coins were found, and by the time the hoard was declared treasure trove, 840 coins had been discovered. The coins date from 40 BC to 15 AD.\nThe hoard was described as \"the largest hoard of British Iron Age gold coins to be studied in its entirety\", and was also significant in providing \"a lot of new information about the Iron Age, and particularly East Anglia in the late Iron Age\". It was the largest hoard of staters to be found since the Whaddon Chase Iron Age hoard in 1849.\nIn June 2011, the hoard was purchased by Ipswich Museum for the sum of £316,000.\n\n\nDiscovery and excavation\n\n\nDiscovery\nOn 16 March 2008, a sixty-year-old car mechanic—who originally wanted to remain anonymous, but was later named as Michael Dark—found his first gold coin after twenty-five years of metal detecting in fields in the Wickham Market area. Dark identified the coin, via the internet, as a Freckenham stater—so called because of the hoard in which the type was first found in 1885.\nA week later, in spite of snowfall since his previous trip to the field, and working in sleet, Dark found a further eight gold staters. After further searching, he remarked that his metal detector \"suddenly went doolally\" and that he \"knew for sure [he] was standing right on top of a crock of gold.\"\nMarking the spot with stones, he decided not to dig for the coins until the following night—saying \"these coins have been waiting two thousand years for me to find them, so they can wait one more night for me\" to explain why he had not pressed on with the extraction. With a spade, he dug out 774 more coins. The field had not been ploughed since 1980, and the ground had the consistency of clay, but previous agricultural work on the field had scattered the coins over a 5–10 m (16–33 ft) area after breaking the top of the black earthenware pot they had been buried in. Some coins were still inside the broken pot, and most were found 6–8 in (15–20 cm) under the ground.\nAfter washing them in warm water, Dark gave the coins to the landowner, who reported the find to Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service.\n\n\nExcavation\nThe British Museum and Suffolk County Council funded excavation of the site between 14 and 15 October 2008, and found that the hoard had been buried in a ditched enclosure, possibly a \"rectilinear religious enclosure\". During this excavation, 42 further coins were discovered, making a total of 824 at that time. Analysis of the surrounding area, including intersecting ditches, dated the burial of the hoard at around 15 AD, which was concurrent with the minting of the latest coin found.\n\n\nComposition\nThe coins were declared treasure after a coroner's inquest in June 2009, by which time a total of 840 staters had been reported. All but two of the coins had been minted in East Anglia by the Iceni tribe; two were from Lincolnshire. The vast majority of the coins were of the Freckenham type, the same as Dark's initial find; there were a small number of Snettisham type—named after the hoard in which they were first discovered between 1987 and 1989; these were also the earliest struck coins in the hoard, dating between 40 and 30 BC.\nThe modern-day equivalent of the hoard's value was estimated at somewhere between £500,000 and £1,000,000. This figure was arrived at by using the cost of military service as a comparison: Dr John Sills stated, \"[A] gold stater perhaps bought around a month’s service in the 3rd century BC and five gold staters an infantryman for the duration of a campaign in the 2nd century BC, with ten gold staters buying a cavalryman.\" It was also based on the observations of a previous find in Alton, Hampshire in 1996, when Dr Roger Bland and John Orna-Ornstein of the British Museum suggested a gold stater would be worth around £1,000 when minted.\nThe Freckenham staters were composed of an alloy mix of 40% copper, 20% silver and 40% gold, sometimes called \"rose gold\", but this was taken into account in the valuation. The collectors' guide, Spink's Coins of England (2009), valued each coin to a buyer at £250–£700, depending on condition. Each coin weighed just over 5 g (0.18 oz).\n\n\nImportance\nThe hoard was the largest number of Iron Age gold staters found since 1849, when between 450 to 800 and 2,000 were found in a field on Whaddon Chase near Milton Keynes by a farm worker.\nAlthough it is not known why the hoard was buried, there are several theories including it being a votive hoard, or a communal hoard \"collected and buried for the benefit of the community\", either as a war chest for an impending threat or as a tribute payment to avert invasion.\nSuffolk County Council Archaeological Service's Jude Plouviez said, \"The discovery is important because it highlights probable political, economic and religious importance of an area\", and that this particular find gave \"a lot of new information about the Iron Age, and particularly East Anglia in the late Iron Age\".\nIan Leins, then curator of Iron Age coins at the British Museum, remarked, \"It is the largest hoard of British Iron Age gold coins to be studied in its entirety.\"\n\n\nDisplay\nIn June 2011 it was announced that the hoard had been acquired for £316,000 by Ipswich Museum, with the help of a grant of £225,900 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £40,000 from the Art Fund. The hoard would be put on permanent display at Ipswich Museum. The purchase price of £316,000 will be shared between the landowner, Cliff Green, on whose farm in Dallinghoo the hoard was found, and the metal detectorists, Michael Darke and Keith Lewis, who found the hoard (a half share going to Green, and a quarter share each going to Darke and Lewis).\n\n\nOther hoards\nIn 1984, a hoard of 1,587 Romano-British coins were found in a pot in the Wickham Market area, dating from 270 AD.\n\n\nSee also\nList of hoards in Great Britain\n\n\nReferences",

This area comprises most of the northern part of the town.\n\n\nHistory\nThe community was founded in 1823 as Van Tines Corners.\nThe community was the first in the town of Clarence to have access to a rail line, with the \"Peanut\" line being pulled through the community in 1853, the station was named \"Clarence Center,\" Railroad service was cut off on December 31, 1977, and today the line has been mostly ripped up, replaced by a cycling trail, referred to as the \"Peanut\" line, an homage to the original \"Peanut\" line, on which rail came to the community.\n\n\nColgan Air Flight 3407 crash\n\nOn February 12, 2009 at 10:20 pm, a Continental Connection flight operated by Colgan Air went down in Clarence Center, killing all 44 passengers and five crew members, along with one resident on the ground whose house the plane impacted. The plane, a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 74-seat turboprop, had logged only 1819 hours, having been delivered in 2008. Up to a week after the crash, the entire neighborhood was closed off because of the numerous residents wanting to see the crash site.\n\n\nGeography\nClarence Center is located at 43°0′40″N 78°38′5″W (43.011158, -78.634749).

    "text": "Mattavilasa Prahasana (Devanagari:मत्तविलासप्रहसन), (English: A Farce of Drunken Sport) is a short one-act Sanskrit play. It is one of the two great one act plays written by Pallava King Mahendravarman I (571– 630CE) in the beginning of the seventh century in southern India.\nMattavilasa Prahasana is a satire that pokes fun at the peculiar aspects of the heretic Kapalika and Pasupata Saivite sects, Buddhists and Jainism.  The setting of the play is Kanchipuram, the capital city of the Pallava kingdom in the seventh century.  The play revolves around the drunken antics of a Kapalika mendicant, Satyasoma, his woman, Devasoma, and the loss and recovery of their skull-bowl.  The cast of characters consists of Kapali or Satysoma, an unorthodox Saivite mendicant, Devasoma, Satysoma’s female partner, a Buddhist Monk, whose name is Nagasena, Pasupata, a member of another unorthodox Saivite order and a Madman.  The act describes a  dispute between a drunken Kapali and the Buddhist monk. The inebriated Kapali suspects the Buddhist monk of stealing his begging bowl made from a skull, but after a drawn-out argument it is found to have been taken away by a dog.\n\n\nSynopsis\nMattavilasa Prahasana opens with the entering of two drunken Kapalikas, Satyasoma and his woman, Devasoma.  Full of drunken antics, they stumble from tavern to tavern searching for more alcohol.  The Kapalikas are told to be followers of a heretic Saivite sect whose rites included drinking, wild dancing and singing, and ritual intercourse with their partners. As Satysoma asks for more alms, he realizes that he has lost his sacred skull-bowl. Devasoma suggests that he might have left it at the tavern they previously visited.  To their dismay, it was not there. Satyasoma suspects that either a dog or a Buddhist monk has taken it.\nA  Buddhist monk, Nagasena, enters the stage and the Kapalika suggests that he is the culprit-the one who has stolen the skull-bowl.  Satyasoma criticizes the Buddhist monk by saying that he steals, lies, and desires liquor, meat and women even though his religion prohibits it.  As for Buddhism itself, the Kapali accuses it of stealing ideas from the Mahabharata and the Vedanta.  Satyasoma argues with the monk who denies the accusations and the dispute eventually leads to a physical brawl.  As the fighting escalates, another mendicant, a Pasupata acquaintance of Satyasoma's, enters and mediates the situation.  The drawn-out argument continues until the Buddhist monk, in despair, gives his begging bowl to a delusional Satyasoma.\nThe Madman enters the stage and in his hand is Satyasoma's real skull-bowl.  The madman recovered the bowl from a dog and the skull-bowl is finally returned to its delighted, rightful owner.  There is a happy resolution and all characters leave in an amicable fashion.\n\n\nInterpretations\nThere was a strong revivalist movement of Hinduism in southern India during the seventh century and King Mahendra supported this revivalism.  He excavated temples in mountains, a majority of which were dedicated to Siva.  It is within this atmosphere of this enlightenment when Mahendra’s play, Mattavilasa Prahasana, had its greatest effect.\nIt is widely held that Mahendra’s play is a satire of the degenerate sects of his day.  For example, both the Kapalika and Pasupata sects must have been considered peculiar during Mahendra’s reign, and the king satirizes them in his play. The Kapalikas embodied a serious, yet suspect, religious concept:  Tantrism where religious enlightenment is attained through unorthodox rituals. Some of these notorious rituals were Madya (liquor) and Maithuna (ritual intercourse).  Meanwhile, these rituals are satirically echoed by Nagasena, the Buddhist monk, who wonders why Buddhism disallows liquor and women.  Jainism isn’t spared from Mahendra’s satirical pen as both Devasoma and Satyasoma describe Jains as heretics.\nWhile the play does have a satirical plot, it also provides an interesting look into the life at Kanchipuram during the seventh century.  There are references to the sounds of drums, young ladies and various flower shops.  The King points to the festive climate within taverns and to the corrupted courts of Kanchi where officials were sometimes bribed.  There is also mention of temple towers.\nSatyasoma accuses the Buddha of stealing ideas from the Vedanta and Mahabharata.  This remark has a bearing on the age of the Mahabharata battle and its epic story.\n\n\nAdaptations\nA 2003 dance theatre adaptation of Mattavilasa Prahasanam was produced and presented by SANGALPAM. There was a national United Kingdom tour between 2003-2004. Directed by Stella Uppal-Subbiah, the play was edited to highlight bharatanatyam, and received great reviews.\n\n\nTranslations\n\nMattavilasa Prahasana The Farce of Drunken Sport (1981)  by Michael Lockwood and A.

    "text": "Hunky is an ethnic slur used in the United States and Canada to refer to immigrants of Hungarian or Slavic descent. It originated in the coal regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, where immigrants from Central Europe (Hungarians (Magyar), Romanians, Czechs, Slovaks, Rusyns, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Serbs, Croats) came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to perform hard manual labor in the mines. They were called \"hunkies\" by the American public, which lumped them together into a category of Slavic immigrants, irrespective of their individual ethnic background. The term as an ethnic slur has fallen into disuse, but the term hunky and the public image associated with it has historic relevance in the perception of Slavic immigrants in the United States. There is some usage of the term in other forms; for example, in regions of Pennsylvania, any mill worker may sometimes be referred to as a mill hunky.\n\n\nHistory\nThe terms hunky and bohunk can be applied to various Slavic and Hungarian immigrants who moved to America from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The immigrants came en masse prior to the turn of the twentieth century (starting around 1880) seeking opportunity. The Hunkies' image was a departure from Hungarian prestige that peaked around Lajos Kossuth's visit in 1851–1852, aka Triumphal Tour.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of these economic immigrants (initially 85%, later 65%) consisted of young working age men. Originally they planned to spend only a few years in America, and then return to Hungary with enough capital to transform themselves into independent farmers or self-employed artisans. This was precisely the reason why, instead of moving into agriculture in line with their traditions, they went to work in the coal mines and steel mills. Only in heavy industry did they have a chance to collect enough money to be able to fulfill their goals back in the Old Country.\n\n\nImage\nSlavic immigrants settled in highly industrial areas and shaped the culture of certain towns and cities. Native residents referred to them as hunkies, and in areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. Many Slavic-Americans do not identify with the term and take offense, whereas others are proud of their heritage and the culture their immigrant ancestors created and do not consider the term offensive.\nIn 1990, artist Luis Jimenez made a 15-foot fiberglass statue and named it \"Hunky – Steel Worker\", and the sculpture was chosen to be among the hallmarks of that year's Three Rivers Arts Festival in Pittsburgh. The title was protested, saying the word \"Hunky\" was a slur, and the protest was joined by local politicians. Jimenez said the title was meant to honor the history of low-wage laborers in Western Pennsylvania, but gave his approval to have the word \"Hunky\" sandblasted off, so the title became simply \"Steel Worker\".\nIn 2009, Hunky Blues – The American Dream, a film by Péter Forgács, premiered at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and National Gallery, Washington, D.C. Forgács, a Hungarian filmmaker, composed the poetic documentary exploring the fate of the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian men and women who immigrated to the United States between 1890 and 1921. Forgács constructed the film from segments of early American cinema, found footage, photographs, and interviews. The film considers difficult moments of arrival, integration and assimilation, and the pursuit of the immigrants and their descendants toward achieving the American Dream.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "Hunky is an ethnic slur used in the United States and Canada to refer to immigrants of Hungarian or Slavic descent. It originated in the coal regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, where immigrants from Central Europe (Hungarians (Magyar), Romanians, Czechs, Slovaks, Rusyns, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Serbs, Croats) came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to perform hard manual labor in the mines. They were called \"hunkies\" by the American public, which lumped them together into a category of Slavic immigrants, irrespective of their individual ethnic background. The term as an ethnic slur has fallen into disuse, but the term hunky and the public image associated with it has historic relevance in the perception of Slavic immigrants in the United States. There is some usage of the term in other forms; for example, in regions of Pennsylvania, any mill worker may sometimes be referred to as a mill hunky.",

    "text": "Crusader: Battle for Tobruk, November 1941 is a board wargame published by Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI) in 1976 that simulates Operation Crusader during World War II. The game was originally published as part of the Four Battles in North Africa \"quadrigame\" — a gamebox containing four games simulating four separate battles that all use the same rules. Crusader was also published as an individual \"folio game.\"\n\n\nBackground\nAlthough a successful Allied campaign in North Africa in 1940 resulted in the capture of Tobruk from the Italians in January 1941, Axis forces, now reinforced by the Afrika Korps under German General Erwin Rommel, regrouped in the spring and besieged Tobruk. In November Operation Crusader was the third of three offensives by Allied forces from Egypt, hoping to break the siege. After a confused battle, including a major German counterattack, Rommel broke off, lifting the siege and retreating to El Agheila closer to his supply base.\n\n\nDescription\nCrusader is a game for two players where one player controls the Axis forces, and the other controls the British forces. Mechanized units on both sides provide opportunities for maneuvering. With only 100 counters and relatively few rules, this game has been characterized as \"simple, easy to play and requires a short period of time (1-2 hours) to complete.\"\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game uses a standard \"I Go, You Go\" alternating turn system taken from SPI's previous publication The Battle of Borodino, where one player moves and fires, then the other player does the same. This completes one game turn.\nUnits are not allowed to stack. A unit must stop if it enters an enemy's zone of control, and then must attack the enemy. The losing unit is often forced to retreat, and is only eliminated if it is surrounded. This gives impetus to both players to either attempt to maneuver to surround a unit before combat begins or to escape from an impending envelopment.\n\n\nScenarios\nThe game offers two scenarios, \"Sidi Rezegh\", and \"The Dash to the Wire\". These can be linked together to form a campaign game.\n\n\nVictory conditions\nThe Axis player receives victory points for eliminating Allied units and cutting supply lines. The Allied player receives victory points for eliminating Axis units, and for reaching Tobruk.\n\n\nPublication history\nAfter the success of SPI's first quadrigame, Blue & Gray, in 1975, the company quickly produced more quadrigames, including Four Battles in North Africa in 1976, consisting of the four games Cauldron, Supercharge, Kasserine and Crusader. The latter, designed by Frank Davis, David C. Isby, and Redmond A. Simonsen and with graphic design by Simonsen,  was also offered for individual sale as a \"folio game\" — a game packaged in a cardstock folio. It did not crack SPI's Top Ten Bestseller list.\n\n\nReception\nIn the 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nick Palmer approvingly noted the \"emphasis on mobile warfare, as the British try to relieve the fortress.\"\nIn the Issue 60 of Fire & Movement, Vance von Borries commented \"This game is wide open and fluid without a lot of cluttering terrain. It gives a feel for the desert war at a simple level.\"\nIn Issue 9 of the British wargaming magazine Phoenix, Ralph Vickers admitted that the game \"looked to me like a static siege of Tobruk. I am elated to report that the designers were much more crafty than I expected.\" Instead of a siege, Vickers discovered a game of fluid motion and tactical problems for both players: \"The Axis player must assign the Italians [besieging Tobruk] a backbone of German units that he call ill spare. [...] For the Allies, the best approach is along the coast. But how much strength can they afford to commit there and still contain the panzers in the south? [...] It is a delicate situation for both sides.\" Vickers concluded, \"If all the games and scenarios [in the Four Battles of North Africa box] are typical of this one, then all are first rate.\"\n\n\nOther reviews and commentary\nPerfidious Albion #96\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=8372304",
    "text": "The Aklanon people are the ethnolinguistic group who lived in the province of Aklan. They are part of the wider Bisaya ethnolinguistic group, who constitute the largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group.\n\n\nArea\nAklanon form the majority in the province of Aklan in Panay.\nThey are also found in other Panay provinces such as Iloilo, Antique, and Capiz, as well as Romblon. Like the other Visayans, Aklanons have also found their way to Metro Manila, Mindanao, and even the United States.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Aklanons are descendants of the Austronesian-speaking immigrants who came to the Philippines during the Iron Age. They got their name from the river Akean, which means where there is boiling or frothing.\n\n\nMinuro it Akean\nAklan, originally known as Minuro it Akean, is considered to be the oldest province in the country and is believed to have been established as early as 1213 b.c.e by Ati King Marikudo. The datus paid King Marikudo a golden saduk (helmet), gold necklace, coloured clothing, and small jewelleries in exchange of acquiring the Panay island (\"Government of Aklan,\" 2019). They then  established the sakup (states) of Hamtik, Akean (which includes the Capiz area), and Irong-irong, cultivated the land, and renamed the new nation as the Confederation of Madya-as (Madjaas). The datus supposedly landed in Malandog, Hamtik, where a marker commemorates the event which is reenacted in the Binirayan (literally, \"place where the boats landed\") Festival.\nTradition holds that the first ruler of Aklan was Datu Dinagandan who was dethroned in 1399, by Kalantiaw. In 1433, Kalantiaw III formulated a set of laws that is known today as the Code of Kalantiaw. William Henry Scott, a well-known American historian, later debunked the Code of Kalantiaw as a fraud. \nHowever, many Filipinos, including Aklanons and other Visayans continue to believe this legend as true.\nThe capital of Akean changed several times. Towards the end of the 14th century, Datu Dinagandan moved the capital from the present Batan, which was captured in 1399 by Chinese adventurers under Kalantiaw. Kalantiaw established then a dynasty but it prematurely ended when his successor, Kalantiaw III, was slain in a duel with Datu Manduyog, the legitimate successor to Datu Dinagandan. When Manduyog became the new ruler, he moved the capital back to Bakan (ancient name of Banga) in 1437. Several datus succeeded Manduyog and when Miguel Lopez de Legaspi landed in Batan in 1565, Datu Kabanyag was ruling Aklan from what is now the town of Libacao.\n(These historical vignettes have no historical record as credible basis, but have been manufactured in such a way as to acquire a hint of historical veracity and reinforced among school children primarily through yearly programs or shows supposedly commemorating those historical events. Nonetheless, these vignettes have found no support among the established and respected historians of the Philippines, and are thus relegated as folklore of no historical provenance or significance.)\n\n\nSpanish Era\nDuring the Spanish era, Aklanons were generally peaceful and did not revolt against Spanish rule in the area. However, the situation changed when two Aklanons, Francisco del Castillo and Candido Iban, joined the Katipunan with the intention of regaining the independence of Aklan along with the rest of the Philippines. Both were successful in ridding the area of Spaniards.\n\n\nPresent\nCurrently, Aklanons enjoy some form of self-reliance since Aklan is  now a province of the Philippines. Some Aklanons have also been active in Philippine politics, which includes Jose M. Hontiveros from Tangalan, Aklan became Senator representing district of Iloilo, Capiz, and Romblon from 1922 to 1928 and was appointed  Justice of the Peace, Capiz, Capiz (1913-1916); Provincial Governor of Capiz (1916-1919); Auxiliary Judge, Court of First Instance (1929-1931); Judge of the Court of first Instance, 19th judicial district (1931-1933); and of the 22nd judicial district (1933-1934) and a Delegate representing 3rd District of Capiz in the July 10, 1934 Constitutional Convention.  Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon, Former Undersecretary of Health, Godofredo P. Ramos, Father of Aklan, Congressman, Governor, delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention and Justice of the Court of Appeals and was appointed Foreign Affairs Secretary by President Marcos replacing Carlos P. Romulo but did not materialize – he died of cancer before his appointment is approved; Incumbent Senator Risa Hontiveros, the Grand niece of Sen. Jose M. Hontiveros Alejandro Melchor, Victorino Mapa, and Cardinal Jaime Sin, who was active in the two People Power Revolutions.\nSenator Jose M. Hontiveros was never mentioned among the Prominent Aklanons who has been active in politics because during his time as Senator Aklan was just the 3rd Congressional District of Capiz and so he was known to be a Capiznon. But his Birthplace is Tangalan, Aklan (CApiz) to Leon Hontiveros and Genoviva Miraflores on March 19, 1899.\nAklanons are also known throughout the Philippines due to the location of Boracay, one of the major tourist destinations in the country.\n\n\nDemographics\nAklanons number 559,416 in the Philippines in 2010. They are culturally close to the Karay-a and Hiligaynons. This similarity has been shown by customs, traditions, and language.\n\n\nLanguages\nAklanons speak the Aklan languages, which includes Aklanon and Malaynon. Ati and Kinaray-a are also spoken to some extent. Meanwhile, Hiligaynon is used as a regional language. Aklanon and Hiligaynon are spoken by Aklanons in Metro Manila, while the official languages of the Philippines, Filipino and English are taught at school.\n\n\nCulture\n\nMost Aklanons engage in agriculture while those in the coastal areas engage in fishing. They also make handicrafts. Music, such as courtship songs or kundiman, wedding hymns, and funeral recitals, are well-developed, as it is with dance.\nThere are still a lot of Cultural Dances that has never been mentioned by some historians and these dances are the ethnic dance of the Minority groups in the hinterlands of Libacao, Aklan, the barangay Rosal bounding Tapaz, Capiz and this minority group is called the \"Pan-ayanon\". These dances are the following: Binanog, Panagaytay, Inagong, Sotes, Pahid, Patadyong Dance, and Nigo Dance. Those were the real cultural/Ethnic dance that historians are unaware of.\nAS to the name given by the Indigenous People's Satff from Iloilo who went to Libacao and organized it is not acceptable to Libacaonons, \"The Tribu Bukidnon\"..this Tribu bukidnon never exist in the history of Libacao or Aklan in general. As far as I can remember the Minority group in the hinterlands of libacao is the \"Pan-ayanon\" who are ethnic Libacaonon and Pan-ay, Tapaz because formerly Pan-ay, Tapaz and Libacao are both part of the Province of Capiz and these are the places where their Tribe used to Live. They have what we called the Minuro as their seat of govt and they have their Chieftains. These Tribe are warlike people having Talibong, Bankaw, Esi, Tara-tara as their weapons and Taming(shield made of wood as their Shield.These people are so artistic. They made their own Silver jewelries like earrings, necklaces as long as 5–6 ft made from US coin silvers and some silver ornaments to the handles of Talibong and Bankaw and they have learned the art of a good Silversmith and those necklaces are being used when they have celebrations and performing the ethnic dances.\nThe other tribe is the Tag-ilaya who were from the barangays of Oyang and Dalagsaan. The Tag-ilayas has no much culture to tell but only their being warlike and using the same weapons as the Pan-ayanon. These 2 Tribes of the hinterlands of Libacao are clannish people and their main livelihood since time immemorial is the Abaca Fibers. Aklan is one of the producers of Abaca in Region VI and Libacao has almost 90% of it.\nHistorically, Aklanons practised tattooing, sometimes including henna, but abandoned the practice during the Spanish era. Recently, however, there has been a revival of it in Boracay island, which is caused primarily by its popularity with tourists.\nThey are among the Filipino ancestries that are tolerant to the Negritos, such as the Ati.\n\n\nCuisine\nTwo main dishes associated with Aklan and Aklanons are Inubaran and Binakol.\nInubaran, is a Filipino chicken stew or soup made with chicken cooked with diced banana pith, coconut milk (gata) or coconut cream (kakang gata), a souring agent, lemongrass, and various spices. The souring agent (called aeabihig) is traditionally either batuan fruits (Garcinia morella) or libas leaves (Spondias pinnata). The name means \"[cooked] with ubad (banana pith)\", not to be confused with ubod (palm heart); although ubod can sometimes be used as a substitute for ubad which can be difficult to acquire. Variants of the dish can also be made with other types of meat or seafood. It is a type of ginataan.\nBinakol, also spelled binakoe, is a Filipino chicken soup made from chicken cooked in coconut water with grated coconut, green papaya (or chayote), leafy vegetables, garlic, onion, ginger, lemongrass, and patis (fish sauce). It can also be spiced with chilis. Binakol can also be cooked with other kinds of meat or seafood. It was traditionally cooked inside bamboo tubes or directly on halved coconut shells.\n\n\nLiterature\nThe Aklanons have a long tradition in literature with Marikudo as the most notable. Currently, many writers of Aklanon origin, including Melchor F. Cichon, have been trying to introduce Aklanon literature into the mainstream.\n\n\nMythology\nLike other Western Visayans, Aklanons are known to believe in the aswang. Tales about these creatures are common among Aklanons and superstitions are practised to ward against the danger brought by the aswang. As to this Aswang, which means witch or maybe cannibals are maybe true or not.\n\n\nSee also\nAklanon language\nAklan\nVisayan people\nBoholano people\nCapiznon people\nCebuano people\nCuyunon people\nEskaya people\nHiligaynon people\nKaray-a people\nMasbateño people\nPorohanon people\nRomblomanon people\nSuludnon\nWaray people\nVisayan languages\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nAklanon\nAklanon Literature (Archived 2009-10-24)\nPrecolonial Period (of the Philippines) (Archived 2009-10-24)\nBisayaExpats.com - Bisaya Expat Forum",

When one is imprisoned for attempted fraud, the other has to readjust her life. Selected to compete for the Golden Bear at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, the leading actress Ana Brun won the Silver Bear for Best Actress and the director Marcelo Martinessi won the Silver Bear.\n\n\nPlot\nChela and Chiquita have been a couple for over 30 years but their funds are running out. They start selling the furniture and Chela, fearing disgrace, refuses money from friends. When Chiquita gets notice to report to the city jail, charged with seeking a loan fraudulently, Chela is suddenly on her own. Telling people Chiquita has gone for a  stay by the sea, she carries on selling the house contents. Picuta, an elderly lady living close by, asks if Chela will drive her to visit friends who meet for cards and gossip. It was Chiquita who drove their venerable Mercedes, since Chela has no licence, but she obliges her neighbour, who forces cash on her to pay for the fuel. This develops into an informal taxi service for Picuta's friends.\nOn one of her trips meets the younger vivacious Angy, who begs her to drive out on the motorway to Itauguá, where her mother is being treated. Though Chela has never been on a motorway, she makes the effort. Angy takes an interest in the lonely older woman, telling her stories of her very varied love life. But the friendship takes a chill when Angy jumps out of the car to join a passing boyfriend. Chela also worries that Chiquita in the women's prison is too interested in the other inmates.\nChauffeuring Picuta and some of her friends to a funeral, she meets Angy again and late that night the two go back to Chela's house to share a bottle of wine. When Angy offers herself, Chela hides in the toilet. Emerging later to find Angy gone, she boozily drives round the darkened city looking for her. A few days later Chiquita is released, but Chela is disoriented by the stresses she has been under and the sudden changes she has faced. In the morning Chiquita finds both Chela and the car missing.\n\n\nCast\nAna Brun as Chela\nMargarita Irún as Chiquita\nAna Ivanova as Angy\nMaría Martins as Pituca\nAlicia Guerra as Carmela\nYverá Zayas as a Singer\n\n\nAccolades\nIt was selected to compete for the Golden Bear in the main competition section at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.

It is one of several coronation cases which appeared in the courts after King Edward VII fell ill and his coronation was postponed.\n\n\nFacts\nMr Webster agreed to let Mr Chandler a room on Pall Mall to watch the king's coronation on 26 June 1902 for £141 15s (equivalent to £19,300 in 2023). It was understood between the parties that the money for the room should be paid before the procession. Mr Chandler hired the room with the intention of erecting a stand and selling tickets.\nOn 10 June Mr Chandler wrote to Mr Webster saying:\n\nI beg to confirm my purchase of the first-floor room of the Electric Lighting Board at 7, Pall Mall, to view the procession on Thursday, June 26, for the sum of £141, 15s., which amount is now due. I shall be obliged if you will take the room on sale, and I authorize you to sell separate seats in the room, for which I will erect a stand. If the seats thus sold in the ordinary way of business do not realize the above amount by June 26, I agree to pay you the balance to make up such amount of £141, 15s.\nMr Chandler paid £100 on 19 June but then the king fell ill. The question was whether the £100 could be recovered by Mr Chandler, or whether Mr Webster could demand the balance.\n\n\nJudgment\n\n\nHigh Court\nWright J held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the £100 which he had paid, and that, on the construction of the letter of 10 June, it appeared that the balance was not payable until after the procession, and consequently the defendant was not entitled to recover on the counter-claim.\n\n\nCourt of Appeal\nLord Collins MR, Romer LJ and Mathew LJ held that Mr Chandler was not entitled to recover his damages before the procession became impossible.\n\n\nReform\nThe Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 provided, among other things, that monies provided in advance of performance of a contract are recoverable in the event of performance being frustrated.\n\n\nSee also\n\nFrustration in English law\nFibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd [1943] AC 32\nKrell v Henry\nHerne Bay Steamboat Co v Hutton",

    "text": "Dominic James Dwyer (born July 30, 1990) is a professional soccer player who plays as a forward for EFL League One club Mansfield Town. Born in England, he played for the United States national team.\nWhile in England, Dwyer represented, among other teams, Norwich City as a youth. In 2009, he moved to the United States on a soccer scholarship and played for Tyler Junior College and the South Florida Bulls. He was drafted by Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer in 2012, and won the MLS Cup with them in 2013. In 2017, he joined Orlando City SC in the largest transfer between two MLS clubs.\nDwyer became an American citizen in March 2017 and was called up to the U.S. national team later that year for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, winning the tournament.\n\n\nCollege and amateur\nDwyer was born in Cuckfield, West Sussex. After the family moved to East Anglia he was spotted playing for King's Lynn Community Football by Jess Ibrom Football Development Officer and invited to the Kings Lynn FC Youth Team, and was then signed into the youth program of Norwich City. Dwyer studied at the College of West Anglia from 2006 to 2008.\nAfter playing for Staines Town for a year, in 2008, Dwyer joined King's Lynn F.C., where he broke his right foot three times. He was then told by doctors that he would never be physically capable of playing at a professional level. Dwyer was given an opportunity by scout Joe McLaughlin of Soccer Icon USA, to get a sports scholarship to study for a college degree in the U.S., Dwyer has said that he accepted the offer to get a free degree and that, at the time, he had given up on the dream of a soccer career.\nDwyer moved from England to attend Tyler Junior College in Texas, where he won two national championships and was the national junior college player of the year after scoring 37 goals as a sophomore. After two years at Tyler, he made the move to the University of South Florida, where he played in 2011.\n\n\nProfessional career\n\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\nOn January 12, 2012, Dwyer was selected No. 16 overall in the 2012 MLS SuperDraft by Sporting Kansas City. He was first included for a professional game on March 25, remaining an unused substitute in a 2–1 win over FC Dallas at Sporting Park. He made his debut on 29 May in a 3–2 win over Orlando City in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup third round, playing the first half before being replaced by C. J. Sapong; his team went on to win the tournament, although he played no further part in their run. Dwyer made his MLS debut against Toronto FC on September 2, replacing Sapong for the final four minutes of a 2–1 home win for his only appearance of the regular season; on November 4, he made another substitute appearance in the 2012 MLS Cup Playoffs against the Houston Dynamo, a 2–0 away defeat.\nFollowing the 2012 Major League Soccer season, Dwyer went on trial with Scottish Premier League club St Mirren in hopes of securing a loan to gain playing time. However, on January 3, 2013, it was announced that the proposed loan for Dwyer had been called off by Sporting.\nA little over a month later, Dwyer, along with three other teammates, were loaned to USL Pro club Orlando City for the 2013 season as part of the alliance between the two clubs. He made an instant impact for the Lions by tallying two goals and one assist in the club's first three matches. On May 4, 2013, Dwyer scored his first career hat-trick in a 7–2 victory over the Antigua Barracuda. Three weeks later, he scored his 13th goal of the season against the Wilmington Hammerheads, tying the all-time season record in the USL Pro for goals with only 46% of the season played. On June 7, Dwyer scored his 14th goal of the season against Phoenix FC, surpassing Jhonny Arteaga's tally of 13 goals for FC New York in 2011. On June 22, 2013, Dwyer scored the opening goal of an international friendly against Fluminense of Brazil's Série A, an eventual 3–4 loss.\nOn June 27, 2013, Dwyer was recalled by Sporting the morning after Orlando's US Open Cup defeat to Chicago Fire SC. On August 3, he scored his first goal in MLS against the New York Red Bulls in the second minute of stoppage time, albeit in a 2–3 home loss. Five days later, Dwyer made his debut in the CONCACAF Champions League for Sporting. In the 75th minute, he scored to give Sporting a 2–0 lead against Nicaraguan outfit, Real Esteli. Coming back for one more game with Orlando City on September 7, Dwyer scored four goals, a club record for one game, against the Charlotte Eagles in the 2013 USL Pro Championship, leading the Lions to a 7–4 victory.\nOn November 23, 2013, Dwyer scored the winning goal for Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference Final against Houston to lead them to the MLS Cup. He was substituted for Claudio Bieler after 72 minutes of the championship game on December 7, which his team won 7–6 in a penalty shootout.\n\n\nOrlando City\nOn July 25, 2017, Dwyer was traded from Sporting Kansas City to Orlando City, the MLS successor to the USL team he had previously been loaned to, in exchange for US$900,000 in guaranteed allocation funds (split between general and targeted), as well as up to US$700,000 in future allocation funds based on his performance. This set the record for most expensive transfer in the league to date.\nFour days after his transfer, Dwyer made his Orlando debut by starting in a 1–1 tie at Atlanta United. He scored his first two goals on September 16 against the same opponents, also assisting Cyle Larin as the game ended 3–3. On August 3, he played the second half of the 2017 MLS All-Star Game against Real Madrid at Soldier Field, in which he scored a late equalizer for a 1–1 tie but missed his attempt as his team lost on penalties.\nDwyer signed a three-year contract extension with Orlando City on January 3, 2018. He led the team in goals in 2018 with 13 as Orlando finished last in the Eastern Conference and ahead of only San Jose in the overall standings.\nDwyer began the 2020 season injured, missing the opening two matches before the season was temporarily suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. He recovered by the time play resumed in June via the MLS is Back Tournament and started in the opening two group games, substituting off around the 60-minute mark in both in a bid to manage his workload. However, his injury reoccurred, forcing him to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery which ended his season. On December 2, the club announced he would be leaving upon the expiration of his contract at the end of the year.\n\n\nToronto FC\nOn May 11, 2021, he signed with Toronto FC through the end of the 2022 season.\nOn January 10, 2022, Toronto FC traded the forward, along with the No. 3 pick in the 2022 SuperDraft, to FC Dallas, in exchange for $50,000 in general allocation money, with Dallas immediately buying out Dwyer's contract.\n\n\nAtlanta United\nIn 2022, Dwyer went on trial with MLS club Atlanta United. In February, it was announced that he would sign a two-year deal with the club.\nOn February 27, just about a week after inking his deal with Atlanta, Dwyer was subbed on for Luiz Araújo due to a hamstring injury in the 22nd minute, and scored his first MLS goal in 2 seasons against Sporting Kansas City, as he contributed to Atlanta's 3–1 win in the season opener. Dwyer was waived by Atlanta on January 6, 2023.\n\n\nOakland Roots\nAfter being without a club for the 2023 season, Dwyer signed for USL Championship club Oakland Roots in April 2024.\n\n\nMansfield Town\nOn March 8, 2025, Dwyer returned to England, joining League One side Mansfield Town on a short-term deal until the end of the season. He was offered a new contract in May 2025.\n\n\nInternational career\nBorn in England, Dwyer moved to the United States in 2009 and gained U.S. citizenship after eight years of residence in March 2017. Following his naturalization, Dwyer was called up by the United States men's national team on June 3, 2017, as part of their 40-man preliminary roster for the 2017 Gold Cup.\nOn June 25, 2017, Dwyer was named to the final 23-man Gold Cup roster for the United States men's national team. Dwyer scored in his first cap in a 2–1 friendly victory over Ghana on July 1, 2017. He scored again in his second cap on July 8, 2017, in the U.S.'s first match of the Gold Cup, a 1–1 tie with Panama, making him only the ninth player in USMNT history to score two goals in as many appearances. He was one of six players replaced in the roster after the conclusion of the group stage of the tournament on July 16.\n\n\nPersonal life\nDwyer received his U.S. green card in 2012. In January 2015, he married Sydney Leroux in a private ceremony, announcing it on February 14 on their social media. Their son, Cassius Cruz Dwyer, was born in September 2016. On March 17, 2017, Dwyer became an American citizen. Their daughter, Roux James Dwyer, was born on June 28, 2019.

    "text": "Mary Ann Gilbert (1776 – 26 April 1845) was an English agronomist.\n\n\nBirth and childhood\nMary Ann Gilbert was the daughter of Thomas Gilbert, who was a grocer in Lewes, Sussex. When he died in 1782, he left (by her own account) his widow and daughter almost penniless. After her mother's death in 1807, she frequently stayed with her uncle Charles at Eastbourne.\n\n\nMarriage\nOn 18 April 1808, she married Davies Giddy, a Cornish landowner, who had served as High Sheriff of the Duchy. He was an M.P. for Cornish constituencies from 1806 to 1832. Among his roles in Parliament was as Chairman of the Board of Agriculture. Mary Ann Gilbert was passionately concerned about low agricultural productivity and the plight of the rural poor. Davies was more interested in how the Parish Rate for the support of unemployed might be reduced.\nIn 1814, Mary Ann Gilbert's uncle, Charles Gilbert, died. In his will, he left her much property in Sussex, or to a future husband, if he changed his name to \"Gilbert\". In December 1817 Davies Giddy took his wife's surname, \"Gilbert\", to perpetuate it. In January 1818, the names of their children were also changed.\n\n\nAgronomic experiment\nSharing her husband's interest, Mary Ann Gilbert managed some successful practical agronomical experiments at Beachy Head in feeding the poor, or rather, teaching them to feed themselves using land no one else wanted, for a fair rent. She presented the statistical results of these works to her husband's political, scientific and \"County\" contacts. She was also a prominent member of the Labourer's Friend Society (later the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes). Among those who advised her were Richard Whately, Anglican Archbishop of Dublin  and his brother, the Vicar of Cookham in Berkshire, Edwin Chadwick and William Gill, of Chacewater, Cornwall.\n\n\nTopographic illustrations\nHer illustrations appear in Thomas Bond's Topographical and historical sketches of the boroughs of East and West Looe, in the county of Cornwall (1823). Bond was a cousin of her husband.\n\n\nChildren\nOf their eight children, three daughters and a son survived her husband. Their son, John Davies Gilbert (5 December 1811 – 16 April 1854) was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April, 1834. He played a significant part, as landowner, in developing the town of Eastbourne.\n\n\nDeath\nMary Ann Gilbert died on 26 April 1845 at Eastbourne \n\n\nSee also\nBritish Agricultural Revolution\n\n\nSources, Notes and References\n\n\nSources\nTodd, A.C.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=948014",
    "text": "In physics, the terms order and disorder designate the presence or absence of some symmetry or correlation in a many-particle system.\nIn condensed matter physics, systems typically are ordered at low temperatures; upon heating, they undergo one or several phase transitions into less ordered states.\nExamples for such an order-disorder transition are:\n\nthe melting of ice: solid–liquid transition, loss of crystalline order;\nthe demagnetization of iron by heating above the Curie temperature: ferromagnetic–paramagnetic transition, loss of magnetic order.\nThe degree of freedom that is ordered or disordered can be translational (crystalline ordering), rotational (ferroelectric ordering), or a spin state (magnetic ordering).\nThe order can consist either in a full crystalline space group symmetry, or in a correlation. Depending on how the correlations decay with distance, one speaks of long range order or short range order.\nIf a disordered state is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, one speaks of quenched disorder. For instance, a glass is obtained by quenching (supercooling) a liquid. By extension, other quenched states are called spin glass, orientational glass. In some contexts, the opposite of quenched disorder is annealed disorder.\n\n\nCharacterizing order\n\n\nLattice periodicity and X-ray crystallinity\nThe strictest form of order in a solid is lattice periodicity: a certain pattern (the arrangement of atoms in a unit cell) is repeated again and again to form a translationally invariant tiling of space. This is the defining property of a crystal. Possible symmetries have been classified in 14 Bravais lattices and 230 space groups.\nLattice periodicity implies long-range order: if only one unit cell is known, then by virtue of the translational symmetry it is possible to accurately predict all atomic positions at arbitrary distances. During much of the 20th century, the converse was also taken for granted – until the discovery of quasicrystals in 1982 showed that there are perfectly deterministic tilings that do not possess lattice periodicity.\nBesides structural order, one may consider charge ordering, spin ordering, magnetic ordering, and compositional ordering. Magnetic ordering is observable in neutron diffraction.\nIt is a thermodynamic entropy concept often displayed by a second-order phase transition. Generally speaking, high thermal energy is associated with disorder and low thermal energy with ordering, although there have been violations of this. Ordering peaks become apparent in diffraction experiments at low energy.\n\n\nLong-range order\nLong-range order characterizes physical systems in which remote portions of the same sample exhibit correlated behavior.\nThis can be expressed as a correlation function, namely the spin-spin correlation function:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        G\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n        )\n        =\n        ⟨\n        s\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        s\n        (\n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n        )\n        ⟩\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G(x,x')=\\langle s(x),s(x')\\rangle .\\,}\n  \n\nwhere s is the spin quantum number and x is the distance function within the particular system.\nThis function is equal to unity when \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=x'}\n  \n and decreases as the distance \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        −\n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |x-x'|}\n  \n increases.  Typically, it decays exponentially to zero at large distances, and the system is considered to be disordered. But if the correlation function decays to a constant value at large \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        −\n        \n          x\n          ′\n        \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |x-x'|}\n  \n then the system is said to possess long-range order.  If it decays to zero as a power of the distance then it is called quasi-long-range order (for details see Chapter 11 in the textbook cited below. See also Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition).

These parameters are said to be quenched or frozen. Spin glasses are a typical example. Quenched disorder is contrasted with annealed disorder in which the parameters are allowed to evolve themselves.\nMathematically, quenched disorder is more difficult to analyze than its annealed counterpart as averages over thermal noise and quenched disorder play distinct roles. Few techniques to approach each are known, most of which rely on approximations. Common techniques used to analyze systems with quenched disorder include the replica trick, based on analytic continuation, and the cavity method, where a system's response to the perturbation due to an added constituent is analyzed. While these methods yield results agreeing with experiments in many systems, the procedures have not been formally mathematically justified. Recently, rigorous methods have shown that in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, an archetypal spin glass model, the replica-based solution is exact. The generating functional formalism, which relies on the computation of path integrals, is a fully exact method but is more difficult to apply than the replica or cavity procedures in practice.\n\n\nAnnealed disorder\nA system is said to present annealed disorder when some parameters entering its definition are random variables, but whose evolution is related to that of the degrees of freedom defining the system. It is defined in opposition to quenched disorder, where the random variables may not change their values.\nSystems with annealed disorder are usually considered to be easier to deal with mathematically, since the average on the disorder and the thermal average may be treated on the same footing.\n\n\nSee also\nIn high energy physics, the formation of the chiral condensate in quantum chromodynamics is an ordering transition; it is discussed in terms of superselection.\nEntropy\nTopological order\nImpurity\nsuperstructure (physics)\n\n\nFurther reading\nH Kleinert: Gauge Fields in Condensed Matter (ISBN 9971-5-0210-0, 2 volumes) Singapore: World Scientific (1989).\nBürgi, H.

    "title": "QuickTime for Java",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=8390588",
    "text": "QuickTime for Java or QTJ is a software library that allows software written in the Java programming language to provide multimedia functionality, by making calls into the native QuickTime library.  In practice, it allows Java applications on Mac OS, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows to support the capture, editing, playback, and export of many different media formats and codecs.\nQTJ has been deprecated by Apple.\n\n\nHistory\nOwen W. Linzmayer, in Apple Confidential 2.0, traced QuickTime for Java's genesis back to Kaleida Labs, a spin-off company created by Apple Computer and IBM, noting that it and some Unicode text classes were the only Mac software salvaged from the four-year, $150 million disaster.  Ported to the Mac OS, it was developed under the code-name \"Biscotti\", and first released as a public beta in 1999.  Later versions were installed by default with Mac OS and Mac OS X, and were an optional part of the QuickTime install for Windows.\n\n\nQTJ 6.1\nIn 2003, Apple issued a Java 1.4.1 implementation that broke any QTJ applications that tried to run under 1.4.1 on Mac OS X.  The underlying problem was Apple's move from Carbon to Cocoa for their AWT implementation, and the removal of a Java-to-native library called \"JDirect\" that QTJ relied on.  QTJ applications could still run under Java 1.3.1, but apps that did not specify the version of Java they required, or that needed 1.4 features, were rendered unusable.\nLater in 2003, Apple released a new version of QTJ that dealt with the incompatibilities, by offering a compatible but scaled-down version of the GUI classes.  This 6.1 version of QTJ also radically changed the API, so that instead of having developers create GUI components and associate Movies or other renderable objects with them, the developers now needed to start with the Movie and request a suitable component from a factory.  The new version also neglected to provide a component to show a visual preview of the input from a capture device, such as a webcam or camcorder.\n\n\nDesign\nQTJ lays an object-oriented API on top of the native C-based QuickTime library. It does this by associating common structs and the functions that work with them into classes.  For example, the Movie struct is the basis of the class quicktime.std.movies.Movie, with functions like NewMovieFromFile and GetMovieTrackCount becoming the instance methods fromFile() and getTrackCount() respectively. The result is more like a genuine object-oriented API than other C-to-Java adaptations (such as JOGL, which dumps the OpenGL header files into classes with thousands of static methods).\nThe Cocoa-based QTKit is a similar attempt to put an object-oriented layer atop the procedural QuickTime library, using Objective-C.\nApple's use of the top-level package name quicktime violates the Java Language's Specification convention that packages use a reverse-domain-name scheme, such as com.apple.quicktime.  However, as Apple owns the \"QuickTime\" trademark, there is no realistic chance of a namespace collision, the prevention of which is the purpose of the package naming convention.\nQTJ is not a Java implementation of QuickTime. It is a Java wrapper around native QuickTime calls. For this reason, it can only run on systems that have the QuickTime libraries installed, namely the classic Mac OS (which is no longer supported), Mac OS X, and Windows.\n\n\nFeatures\nQTJ offers access to most of the native QuickTime library, including\n\nPlayback\nEditing\nCapture\nGraphic import and export\nMovie import and export\nSample-level access\nAs a wrapper around QuickTime, QTJ also inherits support for a vast collection of media formats and codecs, including MPEG-1, MPEG-4, H.264, AAC, Sorenson Video, Flash, 3GPP, WAV, AIFF, and more.  Since QuickTime itself can be extended, QTJ can pick up support for formats such as DivX and Ogg Vorbis through the use of third-party QuickTime components.\n\n\nCode Example\nThe following example shows an AWT file-selection dialog and then tries to import and play the selected media file.\n\nMost of the code in this example involves itself with setting up the GUI.  The only calls to QTJ are the calls to OpenMovieFile.asRead() and Movie.fromFile(), which create a QuickTime movie from the specified file, and the calls to create an AWT component from the QTFactory.  This example puts the movie into the frame and immediately starts playing it; if a control bar (aka a \"scrubber\") were desired, you would create a MovieController from the Movie and then create a component from the controller, rather than from the movie.\n\n\nStatus and Outlook\nQTJ's acceptance is limited by its nature as a wrapper around Apple's proprietary QuickTime library.  It does not exist for any platform other than Mac and Windows, and cannot until and unless Apple ports QuickTime to another platform, such as Linux.\nCurrently most of QTJ is broken on recent Windows-running computers. Windows machines that use the no-execute (NX) page-protection security feature of recent CPUs cannot run even the demos without changing the configuration. This can be easily verified by a developer via a test-run of one of the demos coming with QTJ. An \"execution protection violation\" is reported and the program is aborted by Windows. This renders QTJ unsuitable for end-user application development due to the necessary complicated configuration of the NX feature.\nFollowing the 2003 release of QTJ 6.1, Apple has made few updates to QTJ, mostly fixing bugs.  Notably, QuickTime 7 was the first version of QuickTime not to be accompanied or followed by a QTJ release that wrapped the new native API's.  QuickTime 7's new API's, such as those for working with metadata and with frame-reordering codecs, are not available to QTJ programmers.  Apple has also not offered new classes to provide the capture preview functionality that was present in versions of QTJ prior to 6.1.  Indeed, QTJ is dependent on some native API's that Apple no longer recommends, most notably QuickDraw.\n\n\nSee also\nJava Media Framework\nXuggler, Java API for video encoding and decoding that works on Mac, Linux and Windows\n\n\nExternal links\nQuickTime for Java at Apple Developer Connection\n\n\nReferences",

This verse is the opening of the final antithesis, that on the commandment to \"Love thy neighbour as thyself\".\n\n\nContent\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou\nshalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\n\"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall\nlove your neighbor, and hate your enemy.'\"\nThe Novum Testamentum Graece text is:\n\nἨκούσατε ὅτι ἐρρέθη\nἈγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου καὶ μισήσεις τὸν ἐχθρόν σου.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThis verse begins like the other antitheses with a reference to the Old Testament. \"Love your neighbour\" comes from Leviticus 19:18 and is part of the Great Commandment. In Jesus' time neighbour was interpreted to mean fellow Israelites, and to exclude all others. In full the Leviticus verse states that you should love your neighbour \"as you love yourself.\" Leaving out this last phrase somewhat reduces its demands. As the second part makes clear, however, Jesus was probably not making a reference to scripture, but rather to a common interpretation.\nNowhere in the Old Testament does it directly state that one should hate one's enemies, but it is implied by several verses, such as in Psalm 137 that calls for vengeance. However at several places in the Old Testament there are also limited calls to love one's enemies such as 1 Samuel 24:19. At the time Jewish thinkers were thus divided, some extolled universal love, others hatred of enemies. One of the clearest hatred commands is found in the rules of the Qumran community, which stated that believers should love everyone God has elected and hate everyone he has cast aside.  Nolland notes that the idea of reciprocity, doing good to those who do you good, and evil to those who do you evil was also a central doctrine of Greco-Roman ethics, addressed by scholars such as Plato.\n\n\nSee also\nBrotherly love (philosophy)#Hate thy enemy?\nJewish ethics\nJudaism and peace\nJudaism and war\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nMorris, Leon.

Rinaldi attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte after high school and worked at a car wash station part-time. His coworker at the car wash, who was a BJJ practitioner, introduced him to BJJ and since then he has transitioned from wrestling to MMA.\n\n\nMixed martial arts career\n\n\nEarly career\nRinaldi fought in a number of promotions including World Series of Fighting (WSOF) and Resurrection Fighting Alliance (RFA) during his early MMA career. He picked up eight stoppages in 12 professional career wins since his 2010 debut, noticeably held wins over former UFC veterans Dennis Bermudez, Diego Saraiva and Clay Harvison. He held a 5 fight winning streak prior to signing with the UFC. Rinaldi competed for the featherweight title for Resurrection Fighting Alliance (now known as Legacy Fighting Alliance) in 2012 and lost the fight to Jared Downing. He was the former Welterweight champion for Complete Devastation promotion where he submitted Tenyeh Dixon who missed the welterweight upper limit of 22 lbs on that fight.\n\n\nThe Ultimate Fighter\nRinaldi was one of the contestants for the UFC TV MMA fighting competition, The Ultimate Fighter 15 (TUF 15) also known as The Ultimate Fighter: Live in 2012. He faced Joe Proctor during the entry round and lost the fight via submission on round 1 and failed to be accepted into the TUF house.\n\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nRinaldi made his promotional debut as a short notice replacement, filling in for Carlos Diego Ferreira who was pulled out from the fight due to a potential USADA violation, against Abel Trujillo on May 29, 2017 at UFC Fight Night: Almeida vs. Garbrandt. He lost the fight via unanimous decision.\nRinaldi next faced Álvaro Herrera on August 5, 2017 at UFC Fight Night: Pettis vs. Moreno. He won this fight via submission (Von Flue choke) in round one. The submission victory was Rinaldi's first in the UFC. He is also the fourth fighter in UFC history to have defeated an opponent with a Von Flue Choke submission.\nRinaldi faced Gregor Gillespie on January 27, 2018 at UFC on Fox: Jacaré vs. Brunson 2.

    "text": "Feeding is the process by which organisms, typically animals, obtain food. Terminology often uses either the suffixes -vore, -vory, or -vorous from Latin vorare, meaning \"to devour\", or -phage, -phagy, or -phagous from Greek φαγεῖν (phagein), meaning \"to eat\".\n\n\nEvolutionary history\nThe evolution of feeding is varied with some feeding strategies evolving several times in independent lineages. In terrestrial vertebrates, the earliest forms were large amphibious piscivores 400 million years ago. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types, other tetrapods (carnivory), and later, plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation (in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials).\n\n\nEvolutionary adaptations\n\nThe specialization of organisms towards specific food sources is one of the major causes of evolution of form and function, such as:\n\nMouth parts and teeth, such as in whales, vampire bats, leeches, mosquitos, predatory animals such as felines and fishes, etc.\nDistinct forms of beaks in birds, such as in hawks, woodpeckers, pelicans, hummingbirds, parrots, Kingfishers, etc.\nSpecialized claws and other appendages, for apprehending or killing (including fingers in primates)\nChanges in body colour for facilitating camouflage, disguise, setting up traps for preys, etc.\nChanges in the digestive system, such as the system of stomachs of herbivores, commensalism and symbiosis\n\n\nClassification\n\n\nBy mode of ingestion\nThere are many modes of feeding that animals exhibit, including:\n\nFilter feeding: A form of food procurement in which food particles or small organisms are randomly strained from water.\nDeposit feeding: obtaining nutrients from particles suspended in soil\nFluid feeding: obtaining nutrients by consuming other organisms' fluids\nBulk feeding: obtaining nutrients by eating all of an organism.\nRam feeding and suction feeding: ingesting prey via the fluids around it.\n\n\nBy mode of digestion\nExtra-cellular digestion: excreting digesting enzymes and then reabsorbing the products\nMyzocytosis: one cell pierces another using a feeding tube, and sucks out cytoplasm\nPhagocytosis: engulfing food matter into living cells, where it is digested\n\n\nBy food type\n\nPolyphagy is the habit in an animal species, of eating and tolerating a relatively wide variety of foods, whereas monophagy is the intolerance of every food except for one specific type (see generalist and specialist species). Oligophagy is a term for intermediate degrees of selectivity, referring to animals that eat a relatively small range of foods, either because of preference or necessity. \nAnother classification refers to the specific food animals specialize in eating, such as:\n\nCarnivore: the eating of animals\nAraneophagy: eating spiders\nAvivore: eating birds\nCorallivore: eating coral\nDurophagy: eating hard-shelled or exoskeleton bearing organisms\nEgg predator: eating eggs (but also see \"Intrauterine cannibalism\" below), also Ovivore\nHaematophage/Sanguivore: eating blood\nInsectivore: eating insects\nMyrmecophage: eating ants and/or termites\nInvertivore: eating invertebrates\nKeratophagy or Ceratophagy: eating keratin-based  material, such as wool by cloths moths, or snakes eating their own skin after ecdysis.\nLepidophagy: eating fish scales\nMolluscivore: eating molluscs\nMucophagy: eating mucus\nOphiophagy: eating snakes\nPiscivore: eating fish\nAnurophagy: eating frogs\nSpongivore: eating sponges\nTeuthophagore: eating mainly squid and other cephalopods\nVermivore: eating worms\nZooplanktonivore: eating zooplankton\nHerbivore: the eating of plants\nExudativore: eating plant and/or insect exudates (gum, sap, lerp, etc.)\nGummivore: eating tree sap or gum\nFolivore: eating leaves\nFlorivore: eating flower tissue prior to seed coat formation\nFrugivore: eating fruits\nGraminivore: eating grasses\nGranivore: eating seeds\nNectarivore: eating nectar\nPalynivore: eating pollen\nXylophage: eating wood\nAlgivore: eating algae (both macroalgae and microalgae)\nPhytoplanktonivore: eating phytoplankton\nOmnivore: the eating of both plants, animals, fungi, bacteria etc. The term means \"all-eater\".\nBy amount of meat in diet\nHypercarnivore: more than 70% meat\nMesocarnivore: 30–70% meat\nHypocarnivore: less than 30% meat\nFungivore: the eating of fungus\nBacterivore: the eating of bacteria\nThe eating of non-living or decaying matter:\n\nCoprophage: eating faeces\nDetritivore: eating particulate decaying organic matter\nGeophagia: eating inorganic earth\nNecrophage: eating carrion\nOsteophage: eating bones\nSaprophage: eating or metabolising decaying organic matter\nScavenger: eating carrion, refuse or other decaying organic matter\nThere are also several unusual feeding behaviours, either normal, opportunistic, or pathological, such as:\n\nCannibalism: feeding on members of the same species\nAnthropophagy: the practice of eating human flesh\nAutocannibalism: feeding on parts of one's own body (see also autophagy)\nFilial cannibalism\nIntrauterine cannibalism\nOophagy or ovophagy: the embryo/foetus eats sibling eggs\nEmbryophagy: the foetus eats sibling embryos\nSexual cannibalism: cannibalism after mating\nKleptoparasitism: stealing food from another animal\nKleptopharmacophagy: act of stealing chemical compounds for consumption\nLignophagia: eating wood, typically a pathological condition in some domestic animals\nPaedophagy: eating young animals\nPica: appetite for largely non-nutritive substances, e.g. clay or hair, sometimes in pregnancy or in pathological states, typically a medical or veterinary concern.\nPlacentophagy: eating placenta\nTrophallaxis: eating food regurgitated by another animal\nZoopharmacognosy: self-medication by eating plants, soils, and insects to treat and prevent disease.\nAn opportunistic feeder sustains itself from a number of different food sources, because the species is behaviourally sufficiently flexible.\n\n\nStorage behaviours\nSome animals exhibit hoarding and caching behaviours in which they store or hide food for later use.\n\n\nSee also\nConsumer-resource systems\nDinosaur diet and feeding\nList of abnormal behaviours in animals\nIngestive behaviors, the physiological behaviors of feeding\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes",

    "text": "Day-Timer is an American manufacturer of personal organizers  and other paper-based time management and organizational tools. The company was founded in 1951 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and ultimately relocated to neighboring East Texas, Pennsylvania, in the 1960s as its sales and product popularity grew.\nIn the early 21st century, however, the company suffered from emerging competition from electronic devices with similar functionality. In 2012, it ultimately decentralized its offices across several states while continuing to publish its paper-based products.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n20th century\n\nThe Day-Timer product began with Morris Perkin, an attorney for the Allentown, Pennsylvania, law firm of Perkin, Twining & Christie. The idea of what Perkin called Lawyer's Day was that it provided two loose-leaf pages that combined five different types of record keeping into one place: a record of what time was spent with which client on what work, an appointment book for meetings and events, a reminder or \"tickler\" of things that needed to be done each day, a daily/weekly/monthly plan of work to be done, and a permanent record of work activities. Initially Perkin made Lawyer's Day just for himself, but colleagues in the firm saw its advantages and wanted it for themselves.\nStarting in 1951, Perkin offered the Lawyer's Day product for mail order from an address in Allentown. He used an Allentown printer for that but things did not work out. It was later published by Fallon Press in New York City, but that collaboration also ultimately failed.\nIn 1956, Dorney Printing was granted the job of producing the Day-Timer product. Located in East Texas, Pennsylvania in Lower Macungie Township, Dorney Printing had been around since at least 1940. The company was then run by the three Dorney brothers, in partnership with their mother, in a business that the brothers once labored on in a converted chicken coop with their late father. The family operation was known for printing calendars for local churches, and advertising products, school yearbooks, and other marketing and publication materials.\nAnother product, Accountant's Day, was formed for that occupation. In 1959, Accountant's Day was assigned the generic name \"Day-Timer\" and began to grow sales in the financial, advertising, and architectural worlds. This acceptance by professionals continued into the 1960s.\n\nIn 1963, Perkin's company was rebranded as Day-Timers, Inc. The product was offered in various sizes ranging from full letter-paper size down to small pocket-sized versions. A subsidiary, Day-Timers Canada, Ltd., was created and also performed well.\nDay-Timers product was initially considered a filler job for the family. Once its sales began accelerating, however, it began representing the lion's share of the company's publications and the company developed a sizable production facility in East Texas, Pennsylvania to accommodate the growth. The collaboration between Perkin and the Dorneys was going well, and Perkin decided to buy Dorney Printing and make it a subsidiary.\nPerkin was president of Day-Timers, Inc. and brother Robert Dorney, who had coordinated the printing work with Perkin, was the company's vice president and general manager. By the end of the 1960s, Day-Timers, Inc. had 300,000 customers and 125 employees. Most sales were coming via direct mail.\nIn 1972, the company was acquired by Beatrice Foods, which kept a hands-off approach. Four years later, in 1976, Perkin died, and Dorney became the company's president.\nIn the mid-1980s, Day-Timer was manufacturing and selling containers for storage of prior years' books. The company also identified a large market for paper datebooks that a few companies were still publishing, and the company's product remained highly popular among professionals. Filofax was one of Day-Timer's largest competitors during this time.  \nIn 1986, Day-Timer had some $100 million in sales and about 3 million customers, predominantly including corporate executives and professionals.\nThe Day-Timer product sold particularly well among its original customer base of attorneys; the company estimated in 1987 that a fifth of all practicing attorneys in the United States were using one, and the company was employing approximately 800 full-time employees at its East Texas, Pennsylvania facility during this time. By 1987, the product was selling successfully even during economic downturns since demand for tools that could provide greater managerial efficiency was largely not impacted.\nBy the late 1980s, Day-Timer was publishing a variety of desk diaries, organizers, and pocket calendars. The main Day-Timer product has a page for each day, with spaces for annotating various kinds of activities; there is also a pull-out calendar which can provide a view of the year as a whole. The product also has calendar inserts that can be changed on a regular basis.\nIn 1988, American Brands acquired Day-Timer and made it part of what would become ACCO Brands.\nThe company's East Texas, Pennsylvania factory facility also emerged as a popular destination for Day-Timer customers. In 1985, one enthusiastic Day-Timer customer said, \"Only compulsives can do this system. But there are a lot of us out there.\" Several notable public figures who enthusiastically used Day-Timers included Dwight Eisenhower, Bob Hope, and Lorne Greene.\nIn the mid-late-1990s, the company had a successful PC product in the PIM space, called Day-Timer Organizer. Following Day-Timer's acquisition of Chronologic Corporation and their program Install Recall, the reworked and rebranded Day-Timer Organizer for Windows was released in 1994. One review of the new product said it kept a \"zealous dedication to the hard-copy Day-Timer metaphor.\"\n\n\n21st century\n\nBy 2000, Day-Timer Organizer had gone through several versions, and the product was well-received, twice winning \"Editor's Choice\" awards from PC Magazine. Later versions, such Day-Timer Organizer 2000, still kept their resemblance to the Day-Timer paper product. The Day-Timer Organizer product competed with Lotus Organizer.\nDatebooks and personal organizers tended to inspire loyalty to particular brands; in July 2006, The Morning Call, an Allentown-based newspaper reported, \"Some people cannot live without their Day-Timer Day Planners.\"\nDay-Timer's initial paper products co-existed with the advent of personal computers. The popularity of Day-Timer was of the level that early PC personal information manager (PIM) applications such as Borland Sidekick could print out appointment pages in Day-Timer format, for physical insertion into a Day-Timer book. Early on there was a collaboration with Lotus 1-2-3 that did not work out.\nWith the emergence of smartphones, the company began exploring mobile software options for its product. In 2006, the company entered into an agreement with The SCO Group, which agreed to build a mobile app named DT4 for the BlackBerry and other mobile app devices. While work on it began, the collaboration between the two companies did not last.\nIn 2009, Day-Timer introduced a calendaring app for the iPhone.\nIn 2012, the company introduced Plan2Go, a replacement app for Android phones supported as a platform in addition to the iPhone.\nIn early 2014, the company decided to discontinue the app and ceased offering a software application, marketing its products as purely paper offerings, a position they maintained into the early 2020s.\nPaper-based personal organizers continued losing market share to digital versions and electronic devices. Day-Timer struggled during the Great Recession; in 2009, the company reduced employees' pay as opposed to conducting layoffs.\n\n\nCorporate relocation\nIn 2012, ACCO Brands merged with MeadWestvaco, which also had other personal organizer products, including At-A-Glance and Day Runner; to eliminate redundancies, corporate heads decided to shut down Day-Timers' historical Lehigh Valley-based headquarters, leading to the loss of 300 jobs there, and shifted Day-Timer product operations to corporate facilities in New York, Ohio, and Illinois. This was another blow to the Lehigh Valley economy, which had previously undergone major factory closings from Mack Trucks, Ingersoll Rand, and other historically Lehigh Valley-based companies.\nThe market for paper-based personal organizers and calendars remains, and Day-Timer continue to publish these products.\n\n\nSee also\nFranklinCovey\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

He served during the Civil War as a quartermaster on the USS Varuna.

    "text": "Gilbert Mair (23 May 1799 – 16 July 1857) was a sailor and a merchant trader who visited New Zealand for the first time when he was twenty, and lived there from 1824 till his death. He married Elizabeth Gilbert Puckey – who had the first piano brought to New Zealand in 1827. They had twelve children. Among them were \"famous New Zealanders\" like Captain Gilbert Mair and Major William Gilbert Mair. Mair is a direct-line ancestor of Māori politician and activist Ken Mair.\nIn 1835 Gilbert Mair senior signed the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand as a witness (together with James Clendon) when a number of northern Māori rangatira (chiefs) established themselves as representing a confederation under the title of the \"United Tribes of New Zealand\". Gilbert Mair senior was \"present at the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, and he and his family were acquainted with many of the noted men who visited the Bay of Islands\".\n\n\nBiography\nMair, born in Peterhead, Scotland, in 1799, had sailed on the whaling vessel New Zealander in 1820. At this occasion he visited New Zealand for the first time. When it returned to England on 2 March 1820, the missionary Thomas Kendall was among the passengers, together with Hongi Hika and Waikato, the two rangatira of Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe) that were the first Māori to come to England. \nIn 1823 he made his second trip to New Zealand. This time he bought two preserved heads. In 1824 he made his third visit. He would never sail back to England again.\n\n\nSailing master of the Herald\nHerald was a 55-ton mission schooner, built at the beach of Paihia in the Bay of Islands. Missionary Henry Williams laid the keel for the vessel in 1824. He needed a ship to provision the mission stations and to visit the more remote areas of New Zealand to bring the Gospel. When Gilbert Mair visited New Zealand for the third time, Williams asked him to assist in building the ship.\nWhen the Herald was finished in 1826, Mair became the sailing master.\nHe made a lot of trips. He went to Australia three times. He visited the Bay of Plenty 4 times, and sailed up and down the east coast of the North Island from the East Cape to the North Cape, and on the west coast south to Kawhia.\nIn May 1828 the Herald foundered, while trying to enter Hokianga Harbour. After the Herald was wrecked, Gilbert Mair purchased land from the natives, built his home at Wahapu and carried on the business of merchant and trader.\n\n\nMarriage\nOn his first visit to New Zealand, Gilbert Mair had been in contact with the Puckey family: William Puckey and his wife Margery, their son William Gilbert Puckey (1805–1878) and daughter Elizabeth Gilbert (1809–1870). When he had first met Elizabeth she was only 11 or 12, but when he returned in 1824 \"she had grown into a 15-year-old woman\".\nThey married on 12 September 1827 in Sydney, during one of trips of the Herald there. \nThey would raise twelve children:\n\nCaroline Elizabeth, the first born in 1828; she died in 1917\nRobert (1830–1920). His name \"is held in high regard at Whangārei, his life-long home town, to whose people he gave a beautiful park\"\nWilliam Gilbert Mair (1832–1912), soldier, later a major in the army\nMarianne (1834–1893)\nHenry Abbott (1836–1881)\nCharlotte (1838–1891)\nJessie Eliza (1840–1899)\nGilbert (1843–1923): Gilbert Mair junior, or \"Te Kooti's Nemesis\"\nMatilda Helen (1845–1927)\nEmily Francis (1848–1902)\nSophia Marella (1850–1884)\nLavinia Laura, the last born in 1852; she died in 1936\n\n\nDeath\nMair died at \"Deveron\", Whangārei, in 1857. He was buried on his own property. Many years later his sons removed his remains to the graveyard round the Church, where now only members of the Mair family are laid to rest\".\n\n\nWitness of the Musket Wars\nDuring his trips around NZ Gilbert Mair witnessed \"the savagery\" of the Musket Wars, the wars between Māori iwi (tribes) in the years between 1818 and 1830. He saw for instance the results of a clash at Ohiwa Harbour in 1828, with fifty dead bodies on the shore. And in that same year, he saw the remains of a fight at Te Papa pa at Tauranga Harbour, with \"hundreds of bodies of men, women and children, dead animals and human bones, the remnants of a cannibal feast\". \nHe later told his son Gilbert of a visit he had made to the Te Totara Pa site in 1826. Five years before, in 1821, a Ngāpuhi taua (war party), led by Hongi Hika, had slaughtered the Ngāti Maru, living there. But when Gilbert Mair senior walked there in 1826, he had still found it \"... strewn with human bones – a veritable Golgotha\".\nShortly after Elizabeth and Gilbert married, in 1828, the famous Ngāpuhi rangatira Hongi Hika died. He had provided protection to the missionary community, and the time following his death was of considerable anxiety for the settlers.\n\n\nTrader\nIn February 1830 Gilbert Mair purchased 159 hectares (1.59 km2) of land at Te Wahapu Point, some four km south of Kororāreka (nowadays Russell). This was the first of a long chain of trading ventures. He purchased the land with goods, including six muskets, many casks of gunpowder and hundreds of musket balls and flints. Here he built up a flourishing trading station. He built his home on an elevated site above the trading station. \nHe was \"one of the first to exploit the kauri gum industry, he exported gum to the United States and timber and flax to Sydney.\nIn that same year of settling at Te Wahapu, the so-called Girls' War broke out in Kororāreka, during which the chief Hengi was killed. Eventually the Reverend Henry Williams persuaded the warriors to stop the fighting. The Reverend Samuel Marsden had arrived on a visit and over the following weeks he and Henry Williams attempted to negotiate a settlement in which Kororāreka would be ceded by Pōmare II as compensation for Hengi's death, which was accepted by those engaged in the fighting. In 1837 Pōmare II fought a three month war with Tītore in the Bay of Islands. An underlying cause of the fighting was a dispute as to the boundary line of the Kororāreka block that had been surrendered as a consequence of the death of Hengi some seven years previously in the Girls’ War.\nIn 1840 the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi finally brought a period of peace to the country.\nIn 1842 Mair sold his business and property at Wahapu. In the beginning of the 1840s he had purchased 728 hectares (7.28 km2) at Whangārei. The family moved there in 1842, and lived in a house, he called \"Deveron\". From this base, Mair continued \"active trading in a number of fields – kauri timber, kauri gum, whaling, as well as general trading and his own farming venture\". In 1845 the situation again became so difficult when the Flagstaff War began in the Bay of Islands, that Gilbert Mair asked the governor to send a vessel to take all settlers to Auckland. Mair \"only had three peaceful years in his new home in Whangārei, when he and his family were driven out by hostile natives, going to Auckland for some months, then back to the Bay in 1846, finally returning to Whangārei in 1847\".\n\n\nOther occupations\nGilbert Mair was appointed Justice of Peace by Governor William Hobson.\nMair was \"involved in representations to the British government to have New Zealand declared a British colony, and in the formation of the Kororareka Association, a controversial attempt at settler self-rule\".\nGilbert Mair \"met and entertained many notable people who visited the Bay. Among them was Bishop Broughton of Sydney, who consecrated the Church at Russell in 1842; Bishop Selwyn; Charles Darwin, the celebrated naturalist; Allan Cunningham, a well-known botanist; Admiral Sir James McClintoch (…) and many others\".\nSamuel Marsden introduced the first horses to New Zealand, from Sydney; Gilbert Mair \"bought the next lot from a shipment to Kororareka from Valparaíso. He sold one horse which was sent to the East Coast, and the others he took to Whangārei\".\n\n\nGilbert Mair Junior\n\nBeing raised amongst Māori his son Gilbert was a fluent speaker of the Māori language. During the attack on Auckland by the Ngāti Maniapoto and the Ngāti Hauā in 1863, Gilbert junior joined the Forest Rangers under William Jackson, as an ensign or trainee officer. He took part in the Invasion of Waikato against the rebel Māori Kīngitanga forces and became famous in late 1863 for entering into discussions with the rebels during the Battle of Orakau under a flag of truce. The government forces were aware that a number of women and children were in the stronghold and Mair pleaded with the rebels to let them out but they refused and shot Mair in the shoulder. Mair later became and officer and lead the hunt for Te Kooti between 1868 and 1872 which led to the defeat of Te Kooti's guerillas. Mair was able to convince Ngāi Tūhoe Ringatū, who had been part of Te Kooti's band, to lead the government forces to Te Kooti's secret camp in the Ureweras. Mair later became a government officer trusted with establishing friendly relationships with Rewi Maniapoto in the 1880s.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nLiterature\nCowan, James (1933) – 'The Mair Brothers, soldiers and pioneers'; in: New Zealand Railways Magazine, Vol. 8, Issue 8 (1 December 1933) – online available at New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC)\nCrosby, Ron (2004) – Gilbert Mair, Te Kooti's Nemesis.

In time, Japanese composers began writing children's songs called shōka, in this new Western style. These songs were mainly sung in compulsory music classes in primary schools around the country.\n\n\nDevelopment of dōyō\nIn 1918, a new movement began in which Japan’s top songwriters assembled to consciously create higher quality children’s songs. It was called \"The Red Bird Movement\", referring to a progressive children's literature magazine Akai tori (赤い鳥, \"Red Bird\"), which published the songs. The songs were called dōyō, and they were later introduced in textbooks throughout Japan, becoming an essential part of the nation’s musical education.\nAll Japanese are familiar with the songs today, and most people have a great affection for them. Despite their somewhat recent origin, they are considered to be an important element of Japanese culture. The themes of the songs are very closely tied to nature. They reflect a more simple and gentle era.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDoyo Cultural News",

After being held at the Farmville detention center for two months, he was released in October 2025. He planned to return to school.\n\n\nSpecialty centers\n\nOf the nine comprehensive high schools in Henrico County, Tucker is the only one to host three speciality centers: Advanced College Academy, International Baccalaureate, and Spanish Language and Global Citizenship (commonly known as Immersion).\nThe Advance College Academy is designed for students within the program to earn an associate degree in social sciences from J. Sergeant Reynolds Community College (accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) in addition to an advanced high school diploma from J. R. Tucker. The students are simultaneously enrolled in both institutions without cost. The program is founded on the standards of the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships. The 60 college credits earned through the program are earned in the last two years of high school. The students beginning learning the college level material starting their junior year.\nThe I.B Program at J.R. Tucker was first authorized in the 2008-09 school year for the first class of ninth grade IB Middle Years Programme students and, two years later, expanded to include the diploma programs. Tucker's I.B. program is a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference of IB World Schools. Students at Tucker have to complete Creativity, Action, and Service projects throughout all four years of high school to explore their community and identity, a personal project in the summer after ninth grade to engage in creating a final product of the student's interests, and an extended essay — a university level paper under 4,000 words with a topic of choice — during 11th grade.\nThe middle years certificate is awarded based on CAS projects in the ninth and 10th grade, meeting certain International Baccalaureate assessment scores in classes, and the personal project score. The International Baccalaureate Diploma requires doing well in CAS projects, International Baccalaureate assessments, and an extended essay.\nThe Center for Spanish Language and Global Citizenship was founded in the 1993-94 school year. Most immersion students have already had one year of study of Spanish. To apply, students should be prepared to take an entrance exam in addition to submitting their transcript and application essay. The program consists of continuing Spanish in immersive classes through high school, taking at least one year of a supplemental language, and opportunities such as studying abroad for credit, gaining entrance with guest speakers, field trips, and cultural events. The students take approximately two-to-three center classes in a seven block schedule, focusing on oral and written Spanish as well as the culture, literature and art of Spanish-speaking countries.

    "text": "Apothecarius Argentum (Japanese: 薬師アルジャン, Hepburn: Yakushi Arujan) is a Japanese shōjo manga series by Tomomi Yamashita, published in Akita Shoten's Princess Gold magazine and collected into eleven volumes. It was licensed in English by CMX Manga, who released the first eight volumes. It is about a princess, Primula, and her bodyguard Argent.\n\n\nCharacters\nArgent: Born and raised as a basilisk, a human being who is fed poison since childhood, later becomes resistant to poison and becomes poisonous as well. Basilisk's touch is enough to kill a normal human. His silver hair is the definite proof of how poisonous he is. He was bought by the King as a slave to become Primula's poison tester. Primula aided his escape and he became an apothecary, a person who is well known to create and prescribe medicine. His talent led him back to the castle as a royal apothecary. He falls in love with Primula and protects her secretly. He is very devoted to Primula and always ready to sacrifice himself for her. Since his touch is poisonous he is not able to pursue Primula despite the fact that their feeling is mutual. His feelings for Primula later also become his motivation to find a cure for his condition.\nPrimula: The only heir and princess of the Beazol kingdom. She is called the \"iron princess\" due to her tomboyish nature. When she was young, she became the target of assassinations with poison. She did not know at first, why Argent was brought to the castle. She was the one who gave Argent his name and tried to befriend him. After she knew Argent's role as her poison tester, she aided his escape. Primula also vowed to become stronger so that no one would be sacrificed for her anymore. She loves Argent but her position and her responsibilities as the princess as well as Argent's nature as basilisk held her back.\n\n\nReception\nKatherine Dacey of Pop Culture Shock describes Primula as being a modern, faux-independent Disney princess, but feels that the manga is overly flawed to be a guilty pleasure. Connie C. for the same outlet regarded the manga as being one of her favourites, but felt that the seventh volume was not the best as it separated Primula and Argent. Brigid Alverson from Graphic Novel Reporter described the manga as being an enjoyable light read.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nChavez, Ed (May 12, 2007). \"MangaCast283\".

It is a basically rectangular structure, with a four-story central section flanked by three-storey wings.  It has a frame of steel and concrete, and is mainly faced in buff brick.  The central section is recessed from the wings, but a projecting cornice on the wings extends over the recess area to provide a curved canopy over the entrance.  The central part of the center section is even taller, with a projecting rounded window bay topped by a clock face.  The wings are symmetrical, with the ground floor composed mainly of glass blocks interspersed with regularly spaced horizontal windows.  The upper floors are defined by long bands of horizontal windows.\nThe building was designed by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott and built in 1937 for the B B Chemical Company, a subsidiary of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation since 1929. In 1946, it described itself as supplying \"adhesives and related compounds for the shoe leather, aircraft, rubber clothing and shipbuilding industries\". The facility, which include a more simply designed second building behind this one, produced adhesives used in the shoe manufacturing process at other plants. It served as the headquarters for the Polaroid Corporation starting in 1979.

    "text": "Charlotte Forman (1715–1787) was a British journalist, translator, political essayist and activist. Between 1756 and 1780, she wrote political essays and news from abroad for many newspapers under various pseudonyms, most notably Probus (in The Gazetteer and the Public Ledger). Unknown in her lifetime, in more recent years Forman's career has garnered significance as she was one of the few women of the period who wrote essays on what were considered masculine subjects (politics and trade).\nEssays and writings which can be attributed to her have been described as erudite and moralising and, due to sexist attitudes towards women prevalent at the time, were considered to have been written by a man.\n\n\nEarly life\nForman was one of five children of Charles Forman, an Irish Jacobite and pamphleteer, and his wife Mary. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, her father (a clerk of the English war office) fled to France after he delayed sending orders to the English general Charles Wills, who was fighting the Jacobites. Therefore, there is ambiguity as to whether Charlotte was born in England or France, although she later wrote that she was \"nursed in the palace of the Trianon\" in France. She however lived in London for most of her life in extreme poverty, and  went into debtors' prison for a short time in 1767.\n\n\nWriting career\nForman was unknown in her lifetime but in more recent years her career garnered significance as she was one of the few women of the period who wrote essays on stereotypically masculine subjects. Forman wrote a number of political essays for the Gazetteer and London Daily Advertiser between 1756 and 1760, then continued in the Public Ledger, or, Daily Register of Commerce and Intelligence in 1760. Both newspapers were aimed at merchants, traders, and shopkeepers in London, and contained information relating to international trade such as shipping news and offers of wholesale and retail goods. Forman wrote a number of letters 'To the printer' as a regular correspondent.\nForman's essays in the Gazetteer and the Public Ledger, all signed under the pseudonym Probus, were written in the months leading up to and during the Seven Years' War. A large number (roughly 200) of the surviving essays comment upon the diplomatic news, offering historical background relevant to understanding the interests of the contending nations, weighing the credibility of various news reports, and analysing the interests of England, Prussia, France, Holland, Austria, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. She consistently supported the English war effort, reassures readers that England has the capacity to defeat France, defends Frederick the Great and William Pitt the Elder from critics, and argues against a premature peace that would make unnecessary concessions to France.\nHer frequent correspondence with Radical satirist and politician John Wilkes have been described as providing modern readers with \"graphic evidence of the struggles of an independent woman in the 18th century attempting to support herself by writing\". She described herself as a literary day labourer.\nShe is not known to have published anything under her own name, although there are almost certainly many works published anonymously which cannot now be attributed.\n\n\nReferences\n\nSage, Lorna; Greer, Germaine; Showalter, Elaine (30 September 1999).

As a child he had no interest in religion. His first contact with the Reform movement was in 1967, when he joined a student delegation to Jewish communities in the United States. After returning to Israel, he joined the small Reform youth movement.\nRegev studied law at Tel Aviv University Law School and went on to practice law. In the late 1970s, he began studying at the Reform movement′s rabbinical school, Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, where he was ordained in 1986.

The long legal battle for the recognition of Reform conversion and the political struggle against the Conversion Law led to the appointment of the Ne'eman Commission, which recommended the creation of a common conversion institute for all three streams of Judaism - a recommendation that was accepted by the Chief Rabbinate.\nRegev is a founding member of B'Tselem, the organization monitoring human rights in the occupied territories, and has served on the boards of many Jewish organizations, including the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency, Rabbis for Human Rights, and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nUri Regev (July 28, 2010). \"Israel's Marital Woes\".

    "text": "Girolamo Zenti (Viterbo c.1609 - Paris c.1666) (also: Girolama de Zenti, Gerolamo de Sentis, Hieronymus de Zentis) was an Italian harpsichord maker and organ builder in the 17th century. He is known as the probable inventor of the bentside spinet and for having traveled unusually extensively to practice his trade at the courts of Europe, including Rome, Florence, Paris, London and Stockholm.\n\n\nBiography\nInformation on Zenti's life is fragmentary and spread wide. Zenti was born in Viterbo, near Rome, and was registered as an instrument maker in the papal capital by 1638. He was apprentice to Giovani Battista Boni, and took over the workshop at the latter's death in 1641. He took a commission at the Swedish court in 1653, serving Queen Christina for several years. He took an Organ building project in Rome in 1660, but left the instrument unfinished for Paris. By 1664 he was in service at the newly restored English court of Charles II. He received the title of The King's virginal maker, but was back in Rome before the year was out. Two years later he was again in Paris, where he died in 1666. At some point he was probably in service of the Medici family in Florence, for an inventory made at Bartolomeo Cristofori's arrival there in 1700 lists six Zenti instruments.\n\n\nZenti and the bentside spinet\nIt is not proven that Zenti invented the bentside spinet, but the earliest existing bentside spinet (1631) is by Zenti, and the instrument became popular, especially in Britain, after his travels there. The final clue giving this theory support is that in France the bentside spinet was called: espinette á l'italienne.\n\n\nSurviving instruments\n\nNo instruments from his time in northern Europe have been discovered, but around a dozen instruments from Italy have been attributed to him, although only two with certainty, a bentside spinet and a harpsichord. The most famous is without doubt the 1631 bentside spinet now in Brussels. A true inner instrument of thinwalled cypress in an ornate outer box, single scale in brass.  A harpsichord, now preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY, dated to the year of his death in 1666, is a single manual, 2x8', true inner-outer instrument, notably restored by Cristofori's apprentice, Giovani Ferrini, bearing the inscription: \"HIERONYMUS ZENTI FECIT ROMAE A.S. MDCLXVI/ JOANNES FERRINI FLORENTINVS RESTAVRAVIT MDCCLV\"    The Metropolitan museum also houses an octave spinet probably by Zenti of unusually small size, possibly made for a child. In the Deutsches Museum in Munich there is an instrument traced through organological evidence to Zenti, that regrettably is a victim of Leopoldo Franciolini, a noted antiques fraudster in the late 19th century who ruined the instrument by installing two extra keyboards to pump up its price.\n\n\nSee also\nList of historical harpsichord makers\nGiovanni Batista Giusti (harpsichord maker)\nBartolomeo Cristofori\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nKottick EL, A History of the Harpsichord, 2003, Indiana University Press.\nKipnis I, The Harpsichord and Clavichord: An Encyclopedia, 2013, Routledge\nBoalch, Builders of the Harpsichord and clavichord 1480 - 1840, 1 ed, 1956, Oxford University Press.\n\n\nExternal links\nPhoto and description of the 1666 harpsichord at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York\nPhoto and description of the octave spinet attributed to Zenti at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York\n\nA video of Julian Perkins performing on the harpsichord attributed to Girolamo Zenti in the Cobbe Collection at Hatchlands Park.",

    "text": "Springdale is a city in Washington and Benton counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The city had a population of 84,161 at the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Arkansas. It is included in the four-county Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area, which had 546,725 residents in 2020.\nLocated on the Springfield Plateau deep in the Ozark Mountains, Springdale has long been an important industrial city for the region. In addition to several trucking companies, the city is home to the world headquarters of Tyson Foods, the world's largest meat producing company.\nSpringdale has been experiencing a population boom in recent years, as indicated by a 133% growth in population between the 1990 and 2010 censuses. During this period of rapid growth, the city has seen the establishment of a Springdale campus of Northwest Arkansas Community College and the Northwest Arkansas Naturals minor league baseball team move into Arvest Ballpark. Tyson remains the city's top employer and is visible throughout the city. Governor Mike Beebe signed an act into law recognizing Springdale as \"The Poultry Capital of the World\" in 2013.\n\n\nHistory\nSpringdale was formerly called Shiloh, after the local Shiloh church, and was platted under that original name in 1866. In 1878, the town was incorporated with the name of Springdale.\nIn 2020, voters of the city of Bethel Heights decided to merge with Springdale after the city sanitation plant received several violations from the Arkansas Health Department. The city was eventually annexed on August 21, 2020.\nAn intense EF3 tornado struck the town on March 30, 2022, heavily damaging or destroying several structures and injuring seven people.\n\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 49.7 square miles (129 km2), of which, 49.2 square miles (127 km2) of it is land and 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2) of it, or 0.62%, is water. The city limits extend north into southern Benton County. Springdale is bordered by the cities of Cave Springs, Lowell, to the north, by Elm Springs and Tontitown to the west, and by Johnson and Fayetteville to the south.\nThe city is located in both Benton and Washington counties along Interstate 49/US Highway 62/US Highway 71 (I-49/US 62/US 71). This is the only fully controlled access route through the area, which replaced the winding US 71 (now US 71B) in the 1990s. An interstate connection with Fort Smith to the south and Kansas City, Missouri, to the north has greatly helped to grow Springdale. Within Washington County, Springdale is bordered along the south by Fayetteville and Johnson. In some locations, this transition is seamless. The city extends west and east along Highway 412 toward Tontitown and Beaver Lake, respectively.\n\n\nGeology\nSpringdale is located on the Springfield Plateau, a subset of The Ozarks which run through northwest Arkansas, southern Missouri, and Northeastern Oklahoma. In the Springdale area, sandstone and shale were deposited on top of the Springfield Plateau during the Pennsylvanian Period. These were eroded after the Ouachita orogeny and uplift, exposing Mississippian limestone formations of the Springfield Plateau visible today.\n\n\nClimate\nSpringdale lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cfa) with influence from the humid continental climate type. The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.  The climate is similar to that of nearby Fayetteville.\nJuly is the hottest month of the year, with an average high of 89 °F (32 °C) and an average low of 71 °F (22 °C). Temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) are uncommon but not rare, occurring on average twice a year, with 57 days over 90 °F (32 °C) annually. January is the coldest month with an average high of 46 °F (8 °C) and an average low of 29 °F (−2 °C). The city's highest temperature was 111 °F (43.9 °C), recorded in 1954. The lowest temperature recorded was −24 °F (−31 °C), in 1899. Precipitation is weakly seasonal, with a bimodal pattern: wet seasons in the spring and fall, and relatively drier summers and winters, but some rain in all months.\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\n2020 census\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 84,161 people, 26,443 households, and 19,475 families residing in the city.\n\n\n2010 census\n\nAccording to the 2010 US census, the total population was 69,797. Of this, 45,185 (64.74%) were White, 15,332 (21.97%) were some other race, 3,976 (5.70%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders, 2,011 (2.88%) were two or more races, 1,363 (1.95%) were Asian, 1,251 (1.79%) were Black or African American, 679 (0.97%) were American Indian or Alaska Native. 24,592 (35.38%) were Hispanic or Latino (of any race)\nThere were 22,678 households, out of which 41.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.0% were married couples living together, 13.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.0% were non-families. 21.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.02 and the average family size was 3.54.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $26,523, and the median income for a family was $46,407. Males had a median income of $31,495 versus $26,492 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,645. 21.3% of the population and 17.4% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 33.6% of those under the age of 18 and 6.3% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.\n\n\nMetropolitan area\nThe Northwest Arkansas region consists of three Arkansas counties: Benton, Madison, and Washington. The area had a population of 347,045 at the 2000 census which had increased to 463,204 by the 2010 census (an increase of 33.47 percent). The Metropolitan Statistical Area does not consist of the usual principal-city-with-suburbs morphology; instead Springdale is bordered to the north by Rogers, the south by Fayetteville, and the northwest by Bentonville, with smaller cities like Lowell and Johnson in between.\n\n\nMarshallese population\n\nThe city is home to the largest community of Marshall Islanders in the United States, which dates to the 1980s, when one Marshall Islander arrived in the city to work for Tyson Foods and subsequently spread word of plentiful jobs to others in the islands. The Marshall Islands opened a consulate in the city in 2008. The Marshallese could easily settle in the U.S. as their country is in a free association with the United States. Photographer Lawrence Sumulong stated that this is the largest concentration of ethnic Marshallese in the United States.\n\n\nReligion\n56.8% of Springdale's population describes themselves as religious, slightly above the national average of 48.8%. 25.6% of people in Springdale who describe themselves as having a religion are Baptist (14.5% of the city's total population). 12.5% of people holding a religion are Catholic (7.1% of the city's total population).\n\n\nEconomy\n\nSpringdale has a robust poultry processing industry, including large hatcheries and/or processing plants owned and operated by Tyson Foods, Cargill, and George's throughout the city. Since Tyson Foods and George's are based in the city, a host of administrative/executive/support staff is also employed in Springdale to support these large operations. Springdale also has a variety of industrial/manufacturing employers present in the city, including Apex Tool Group, Ball Corporation, Brunner & Lay, Dayco Products, and Pratt & Whitney. This strong industrial sector differentiates the city among the four large principal cities of Northwest Arkansas.\n\n\nArts and culture\n\nPoints of interest\nArts Center of the Ozarks\nArvest Ballpark\nFitzgerald Station and Farmstead\nShiloh Historic District\nShiloh Museum of Ozark History\nSpringdale Poultry Industry Historic District\nThe Springdale Post Office contains a 1939 Natalie Smith Henry mural, titled Local Industries, commissioned by the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts. Depictions of poultry and fruit farmers reflected the early industries of Tyson Foods and  Welch's Grape Juice Company. Springdale was the southwest regional headquarters of the Welch's company.\nParsons Stadium in eastern Springdale is host to many events throughout the year, most notably the Rodeo of the Ozarks. This four-day event began in Springdale in 1944 and brings professional cowboys and cowgirls to the city for one of the nation's top outdoor rodeos. Always hosted on Independence Day weekend, the event brings a parade, the Miss Rodeo of the Ozarks Pageant, and the Grand Entrance to the stadium. It also hosts Buckin' in the Ozarks (a Professional Bull Riders [PBR] event), Arenacross (a motocross competition with professional and amateur exhibitions) during Bikes Blues and BBQ weekend and other motorized exhibitions.\n\n\nSports\n\nSpringdale is home to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals, the minor league baseball team of the Texas League. The team, formerly known as the Wichita Wranglers, relocated in 2008 upon completion of Arvest Ballpark. The stadium has 6,500 seats and additional grass berm seating as well as suites and event space for private events. Approximately 70 Naturals home games are played in the stadium every year. In 2013, Arvest Ballpark hosted the 77th annual Texas League All-Star Game.\n\n\nGovernment\n\nSpringdale operates within the mayor-city council form of government. The mayor is elected by a citywide election to serve as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the city by presiding over all city functions, policies, rules and laws. Once elected, the mayor also allocates duties to city employees. Mayors serve four-year terms and can serve unlimited terms. The city council consists of eight members who together form the legislative body for the city. Also included in the council's duties is balancing the city's budget and passing ordinances. The body also controls the representatives of specialized city commissions underneath their jurisdiction. Two members are elected from each of the city's four wards. The Council meets every second and fourth Tuesday of the month at the City Administration Building.\nCitizen input is welcomed through the use of various specialized groups. Positions are appointed by the Mayor and approved by the City Council. Springdale is represented by Republican Steve Womack Representative for Arkansas's 3rd congressional district.\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nPrimary and secondary\nSpringdale Public Schools is the largest school district in Arkansas, providing educational services to over 23,000 students on 29 campuses in the city.

Ecclesia College is a small religious work college accredited through the Association for Biblical Higher Education located in western Springdale.\n\n\nInfrastructure\n\n\nTransportation\n\nThe major through route in Springdale is Interstate 49/US 71/US 62 (the concurrent routes are unsigned and thus the route is simply known as I-49 in Springdale). This fully controlled access, four-lane expressway is a discontinuous piece of a route ultimately planned to connect Kansas City, Missouri to New Orleans, Louisiana. Formerly designated as Interstate 540 with the re-designation as Interstate 49 being granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration in 2014, the highway became the first freeway in the area when it was completed in the 1990s to relieve the former US 71 (now US 71B) of a much-increased demand of through travelers following the unanticipated and rapid growth of Northwest Arkansas. Major construction along the I-49 corridor included the Bella Vista Bypass, which was opened to traffic north of Springdale in October 2021. Future plans for the I-49 corridor include completion of a freeway segment through the Ouachita Mountains to Texarkana.\nSpringdale's major provider of public transportation is Ozark Regional Transit. The bus-based regional transit system runs throughout Washington and Benton Counties and is administrated by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department. The nearest intercity bus service is provided by Jefferson Lines in nearby Fayetteville.\nThe Springdale Municipal Airport is a general aviation airport located near downtown Springdale.

    "text": "Hubert Patrick O'Connor, OMI (17 February 1928 – 24 July 2007) was a Canadian Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Prince George from 1986 until his resignation following charges of sex crimes stemming from his time as principal of Saint Joseph's Mission Residential School in Williams Lake. At the time, he was the highest ranking Catholic official in the world to be charged with a sex crime. He was a member of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\nO'Connor was tried twice for the alleged sex crimes. The first trial resulted in a stay of proceedings on constitutional grounds, but that decision was set aside on appeal and a new trial ordered by the Supreme Court of Canada. He was convicted at the second trial on some charges, but the convictions were set aside on appeal by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which ordered a new trial. Before the new trial was held, O'Connor formally apologised to some of his victims in a First Nations healing circle in 1998. The victims said that they had received a sense of closure from the healing circle and the apology that they had not received from the criminal trial process. Based on the victims' comments, the Crown prosecution service entered a stay of proceedings to avoid revictimising them at another trial.\nO'Connor died in 2007. After his death, a new allegation arose that O'Connor had sexually abused a young boy. \n\n\nFamily and early life\nO'Connor was born in Huntingdon, Quebec on 17 February 1928. His parents were Patrick O'Connor and Stella Walsh and he had several brothers and sisters.\n\n\nChurch career\nO'Connor was ordained to the priesthood on 5 June 1955 with the Oblates of Mary Immaculate after studying in Ottawa, Ontario. He worked within the church until being sent to Williams Lake as the principal of Saint Joseph's Mission from 1961 to 1967. St. Joseph's Mission was a key component of the Canadian Residential School System. It was during his time at St. Joseph's that O'Connor committed multiple sex crimes against underage Indigenous girls and boys and raped multiple Indigenous women.\nOn 15 October 1971, O'Connor was appointed Bishop of Whitehorse, Yukon. He then served as the Bishop of Prince George, British Columbia from 1986 to 1991 before resigning after being charged with multiple sex crimes.\n\n\nSexual assault charges\nIn 1991, several students from the St. Joseph's Mission Residential School in Williams Lake came forward with allegations of sexual assault and sexual indecency while O'Connor was principal between 1964–1967. O'Connor went on trial in 1992, on four counts of sexual offences. Eight women testified that O'Connor repeatedly molested, raped, coerced, and physically and sexually abused young Indigenous girls at St. Joseph's Mission. Testimonies revealed that O'Connor also entered into sexual relationships with female staff at St. Joseph's who were in their teens and early 20s. O'Connor targeted the all-female bagpipe and dance band in particular because of their frequent field trips across British Columbia and Canada that left them isolated with O'Connor. One woman testified that during these trips, O'Connor would \"crawl into girls' bunks and start kissing them\". Incidents such as these led to O'Connor fathering at least one child, who was placed for adoption to avoid public scandal.\nAt trial, the defence raised a constitutional issue, alleging that the Crown prosecutors had failed to disclose evidence to the defence. After hearing submissions from Crown and defence, the trial judge agreed that the Crown had infringed O'Connor's constitutional right to full disclosure, and entered a stay of proceedings. The Crown appealed from that decision. In 1994, the British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a retrial. O'Connor appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, but in 1995 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal and confirmed the order for a new trial, in R v O'Connor.\nAt the second trial, in 1996, O'Connor was acquitted on two of the charges, but convicted of rape and indecent assault of two young Indigenous women that occurred at St. Joseph's Residential School. Justice Wally Oppal sentenced O'Connor to two-and-a-half years in prison; he served six months of his sentence before being released on $1,000 bail pending an appeal in 1997.\nIn March 1998, the B.C. Court of Appeal acquitted O'Connor on the charge of indecent assault, and ordered a new trial on one count of rape. However, three months later, in June, O'Connor participated in a seven-hour healing circle held at Esk'etemc, a Secwepemc First Nations community near Williams Lake (formerly known as Alkali Lake Band). During the healing circle, O'Connor formally apologized to his victims. The victims later reported a sense of closure they had not found in the prior trials. The Crown, having considered the impact of O'Connor's apology and the extent to which the trials had retraumatized his victims, decided to drop the remaining rape charge.\n\n\nDeath and subsequent allegation\nO'Connor died suddenly of a heart attack in Toronto on 24 July 2007.\nIn July 2021, a new sexual assault allegation against the now-deceased O'Connor surfaced. Ronald Wayne Petruk filed a suit with the Supreme Court of B.C. stating that O'Connor sexually assaulted Petruk and other teen boys with fellow priests at St. Joseph's Mission. The suit was ongoing of 2022.\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=445967",
    "text": "The Battle of Lobositz or Lovosice also Lowositz on 1 October 1756 was the opening land battle of the Third Silesian War and the wider Seven Years' War. Frederick the Great's 28,000 Prussians were prevented by 33,000 Austrians under Maximilian Ulysses Count von Browne from continuing their invasion into the rich Bohemian plain, forcing Frederick to ultimately fall back north into Saxony for the winter.\n\n\nPrelude\nBeing a believer in the pre-emptive strike, on 29 August 1756 Frederick invaded Saxony with the bulk of the Prussian army, against the advice of his British allies. Neither the Saxon nor the Austrian army was ready for war. The Saxon army took up a strong defensive position near Pirna, and Frederick had no option but to isolate and try to starve them into surrendering. Meanwhile, realizing that the siege would take some time, he was compelled to leave a covering force around Pirna and head south through the rough Mittel-Gebirge of northern Bohemia to establish a winter base in the rich Bohemian plain.\nAn Austrian army under Field Marshal von Browne had prepared a fortified base at Budin to block any Prussian moves out of the Mittel-Gebirge. Browne had been in secret communication with the Saxon prime minister, Heinrich Count Bruhl, and had planned a rescue mission up the right bank of the Elbe to Königstein, near Pirna, to help the Saxon army escape across the river and join its allies. On the 28th, Browne received an enthusiastic agreement from Bruhl on his proposal; the date of the rendezvous of the two forces was to be the night of 11/12 September.\nMeanwhile, Frederick and his 28,000 men were making their way through the Mittel-Gebirge toward the Bohemian plain. Browne's intelligence told him that the Prussians would exit from the mountains at Lobositz, modern day Lovosice in the Czech Republic a few miles northwest of his fortified base at Budin. He recalled his small relief force up the Elbe and raced with 33,000 men up to Lobositz on the 28th to lay an ambush for Frederick as he debouched from the narrow passes of the mountains.\n\n\nBattle\n\nThe Austrian army took up defensive positions on an extinct volcano above Lobositz, the Lobosch, deploying their battalions from Croatia among the walled vineyards that covered the lower flanks of that hill. These, in turn, were supported by 7,800 regular infantry under Franz Moritz von Lacy, hidden from view on the eastern side of the mountain. In front of the town Browne set up a relatively small force of cavalry and grenadier battalions as bait. Behind these, and hidden by a sunken road, he positioned more irregulars and grenadiers in ambush, and behind these he positioned a reserve brigade of cuirassiers. On the south Browne hid the bulk of his army on the other side of a marsh defined by the Morellenbach. He had his battalions lie down in the tall grass and hid his heavy cavalry squadrons behind the woods of a game preserve next to the village of Sullowitz. In this village he also placed some battalions of infantry and artillery. Most of his army was hidden from Prussian view by morning mist and terrain.\nOn the morning of 1 October, in heavy fog, Frederick's Prussians approached Lobositz in column of route. They were completely unaware that they were walking into a trap. The Austrians irregulars on the Lobosch began to fire at them and Frederick dispatched Duke of Brunswick-Bevern with seven battalions of infantry to brush them off. The center of the Prussian position between the two mountains, the Lobosch to the north and the Ovcin to the south, was dominated by a low spur called the Homolka. The few irregulars defending this were chased away and the Prussians unlimbered a battery of heavy artillery on it. From the Homolka, in the slowly dissolving fog and squinting into the sunrise, it looked to Frederick and his staff as though the plain below them was occupied by only a few cavalry. Their consensus was that Browne was in retreat and had just left this small rear guard.\nThe Prussian battery on the Homolka began to fire on the scurrying cavalry below them, who had been repeatedly shuffled around by their commanders to make them moving targets. These were composed of a regiment of the Kaiser Franz Dragoons, some combined cavalry of elite companies, and two small regiments of hussars (Hadik and Baranyay).\nIn the meantime, Frederick's main force of infantry began to deploy into line between the Homolka mound and the Lobosch. They were, in turn, backed by several lines of the main Prussian cavalry force, over 10,000 in all, in the narrow valley behind them; the steep, vine-covered flanks not suitable for the normal 18th century deployment of cavalry on the army's wings.\nAs the mist lifted, a heretofore hidden battery of Austrian heavy guns in front of Lobositz (12 pounders and howitzers) began to fire on the exposed Prussian infantry. Frederick's artillery commander,  Karl Friedrich von Moller, brought up the rest of his own heavy guns and howitzers on the Prussian left to answer this new threat. But for the next few hours, the Prussian infantry (who, apparently and unlike the Austrians, remained standing in close ranks) took heavy casualties.\nAnxious to end this and brush away what he thought was an annoying rear guard, Frederick took his staff's advice and ordered a limited cavalry charge down the hill to chase the few Austrians away. Led by Lt. Gen. Kyau, some 1,200 Prussian cuirassiers charged the Austrian horse and drove them back toward the Elbe. Continuing on, however, the Prussian squadrons came upon the unexpected sunken road between Lobositz and the Morellenbach, in which were hidden several hundred irregulars and Austrian grenadiers. The Prussian cuirassiers were also surprised by considerable fire from their right flank by massed batteries of artillery and infantry hidden in the village of Sullowitz. As the surviving Prussian cavalry made their way forward in disorder across the sunken road, assailed on the right and left by the ambush laid for them, they were finally counterattacked by a hidden brigade of 1,300 fresh Austrian cuirassiers (the Cordua and Stampach Regiments under Karel Adam Felix von Lobkowitz) and thrown back. The Prussian troopers retreated with heavy casualties back up the Homolka.\nIt was suddenly apparent from this surprising setback that Frederick was not facing any mere rear guard but the entire Austrian army, deployed in a strong, flanking position. Moreover, the action on the Prussian left up on the Lobosch mountain was also proving to be much more strongly held than anticipated. Bevern was having no luck in \"brushing aside\" the irregulars from the vineyards, who had themselves, all morning, been heavily reinforced by Lacy's infantry. But even worse was to come.\nSeeing his fellow cavalrymen humiliated and repulsed, General Gessler, Frederick's chief of cavalry, took it upon himself to order a general charge with all his remaining squadrons. Gessler had evidently been stung by a reprimand on his courage by the Prussian King a few days before and was anxious to amend the insult. He was also merely obeying Frederick's standing order to all of his cavalry to never let a check go unanswered, but to always attack on its own initiative. So filtering all of his 7,200 troopers through the Prussian infantry, Gessler led a massive charge down into the floodplain. As he watched this charge unfold, Frederick was said to have exclaimed, \"My God, what is my cavalry doing! They're attacking a second time, and nobody gave the order!\"\nThe results were the same as the first charge, but on a larger scale. The Prussian squadrons were raked on their flanks by the hidden Austrian guns and infantry, and counterattacked by the now-reinforced Austrian cavalry. A few Prussian cuirassiers attempted to struggle across the muddy Morellenbach to get at the main Austrian guns but their horses were so blown that they couldn't climb the bank on the far side and were mowed down by the Austrian battalions (now standing up) at the top. In the end, all of Frederick's cavalry were spent and forced to retreat.\nAs in another of his first battles, Mollwitz, Frederick was convinced at this point that he had lost this one and abandoned the field. In that other battle, too, fifteen years before, it was his cavalry that had let him down. This time he withdrew to the village of Wchinitz behind his front line and left command of the battle to Bevern and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick.\nFor his part, Bevern was not so discouraged. His original seven battalions on Lobositz had shot away all of their ammunition without dislodging the irregulars from the vineyards. He grabbed more battalions from the Prussian center and threw them into the fight on the hill. When told by his men, unused to this kind of broken country fighting, that they had run out of ammunition, he was reported to have sneered, \"What! Haven't you got bayonets? Skewer the dogs dead!\" and led a charge across the slopes. The Austrians and irregulars on Lobosch, too, had run out of ammunition themselves and had also been fighting all day. They started to slowly fall back into the town, defending the gates tenaciously. But the Prussian artillery commander, von Moller, ordered his howitzers to set fire to the town and drive the defenders out. Hundreds of Austrian wounded and even captured Prussian wounded in Lobositz were burned alive in the fire before they could all be gotten out.\nIt was now about sunset (17:42 at this time of year at this latitude) and both sides, after having fought all day long, stopped firing. Browne brought all of his surviving right wing safely through Lobositz and over the Morellenbach. Both armies went into bivouac for the night. Browne had lost about 2,900 men during the battle. The Prussians, themselves having lost about the same number, had fully expected to have to resume fighting the next day, this time attacking across the formidable marsh of the Morellen. But during the night Browne, having accomplished his immediate objective of stopping Frederick's momentum, ordered his army to fall back to the prepared lines of Budin.\nIt wasn't until late that night that the rattled Frederick was convinced by Bevern and Brunswick that he hadn't lost this, his first battle of the war. And when, the next morning, he saw that Browne had pulled out during the night, he was greatly relieved. There was a saying going around the army, comparing these enemies to those they had so easily beaten during the previous war, \"These are no longer the same old Austrians.\"\n\n\nAftermath\nBoth sides lost about the same number of men each, about 2,900, which was more severe for the initially smaller Prussian army Frederick, still shaken in the following days, decided his only political option was to proclaim Lobositz as a victory by 18th century rules of combat (since Browne had left the field of battle). However, Browne had done exactly what he had set out to do: stop Frederick at Lobositz and cover his own crossing of the Elbe further upstream to go and rescue the Saxon army at Pirna. Indeed, Frederick, though he sat on the \"field of victory\", never advanced beyond Lobositz and within two weeks had ordered a general retreat back into Saxony. So, strategically, with his army intact, Bohemia safe, and his way north to the Saxons unhindered, Browne could be thought of as having won a strategic victory at Lobositz.\nIn the aftermath, Browne did lead his rescue mission north, with a picked force of 8,000 men, down the right (eastern) bank of the Elbe. Though suffering from tuberculosis himself and coughing up blood, Browne drove himself and his men through rain and mountain passes to arrive at his rendezvous point, Königstein, at precisely the date he promised the Saxons, October 11. However, the Saxons had not lived up to their own promise to cross the Elbe at Königstein on that date, and procrastinated. The dissembling Count Bruhl was negotiating with the Prussians for a better deal and kept sending disingenuous pleas for patience to Browne. By the 14th, the Prussians, finally alerted to the presence of the Austrians waiting on the right bank opposite Königstein, had crossed with a blocking force themselves. By then Bruhl and the Saxon King Augustus III, as well as the senior Saxon general staff, surrendered the entire Saxon army to Frederick, and had negotiated some fairly lucrative compensation arrangements for themselves. The Saxon regiments were all incorporated whole into the Prussian army (as IRs 50-59). However, this political-military coup proved short-lived for most of the infantry regiments defected within a year. And the Saxon cavalry regiments took it upon themselves (including Count Bruhl's own chevauleger regiment) to escape and fight intact for the Austrians.\nBrowne brought his rescue party safely back to his base at Budin, having failed in his mission, but through no fault of his own. By the end of October, the entire Prussian army had retreated out of Bohemia and back across the Elbe to winter in Saxony. So the end of 1756, the first year of the Seven Years' War, ended in a stalemate, but with Austria in a good strategic position for 1757.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\nAsprey, Robert B. 1986.

His organ works have been published in France and Germany.\nFor many reasons (health problems with two of his children, family life), Pallesco gave few organ recitals. So, many organists have agreed to include among its \"ambassadors\" around the world.\n\n\nOrgan works\nPallesco uses a personal musical language, often atonal (“Christ a vaincu la mort”, the first 3 “Caprices poétiques”,…), sometimes bitonal (\"Harmonies en Paradis\") or even modal (the \"Fugue\" of the \"Toccata et Fugue en Ut#\"). His music, though it is very original, is also certainly inspired by the compositions of the three great \"D\" of the French contemporary organ music: Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé and Jeanne Demessieux. Many pieces require a great virtuosity (the \"Toccata en Ut#\" is the best example).

    "text": "Delphinia picta is a species of picture-winged fly in the family Ulidiidae. The specific name picta is from Latin and means \"painted\". It is the only species in the monospecific genus Delphinia. It is found in the United States on the East Coast and in the Midwest from Florida to Maine across to Kansas through Minnesota but also can be found in Mexico and El Salvador. It is sometimes mistaken for a species of fruit fly, but D. picta do not feed on living plant matter, as they are detritivores and eat decaying plant matter. They also have been observed eating fermenting frass from Megacyllene robiniae on black locust trees. They can be found almost anywhere there is decaying vegetation: landfills, temperate deciduous forests, swamps, and even shaded fields.\n\n\nDescription\nThe best way to identify the species is by the distinct pattern on its wings, which are shiny and dark brown with a hyaline background. Its body is about 7mm long with a black abdomen and a light brown head, thorax, and legs. The ovipositor averages 1.27mm long with two dorsal and one ventral prominent pairs of setae, as well as many short setae on both sides. The tip of the ovipositor also has a slight bend downward.\n\n\nLife cycle\nAdults raised in the lab usually live less than 40 days, but can live up to 69 days. Mating takes place in the evening two days after emergence from pupae. The female will wave her wings gently and a male will respond by flicking his wings before copulation. Courtship may also include one or both of the partners blowing a bubble from their mouth. Females will lay up to 500 eggs in decaying herbaceous plant matter, which then hatch into larvae in 4 to 6 days. Larvae develop through three instar stages and reach pupae in 21–30 days then finish pupating 14–17 days later. The development is affected by the amount of daylight: D. picta is a multivoltine species with one generation going from May to July and the other overwintering as mature larvae.\n\n\nEcology\nAmong the plants it associates with are black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). It is prey for wasps, such as Crabro monticola.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences",

He taught at the London School of Economics from 1895 to 1926.\n\n\nBiography\nEdwin Cannan was the younger son of David Alexander Cannan and artist  Jane Dorothea Claude. \nHis mother died at the age of 38 of tuberculosis in Madeira, Portugal 18 days after her son Edwin was born. He studied at Balliol College, Oxford.\nAs a follower of William Stanley Jevons, Edwin Cannan is perhaps best known for his logical dissection and destruction of Classical theory in his famous 1894 tract A History of the Theories of Production and Distribution. Although Cannan had personal and professional difficulties with Alfred Marshall, he was still   \"Marshall's man\" at the LSE from 1895 to 1926. During that time, particularly during his long stretch as chairman after 1907, Edwin Cannan shepherded the LSE away from its roots in Fabian socialism into tentative Marshallianism. This period was only to last, however, until his protégé, Lionel Robbins, took over with his more \"Continental\" ideas.\nThough Cannan, in his early years as an economist, was a critic of classical economics and an ally of interventionists, he moved sharply to the side of classical liberalism in the early 20th century. He favoured simplicity, clarity, and common sense in the exposition of economics.  Cannan emphasised the institutional foundation of economic systems.\nCannan is buried at Wolvercote Cemetery Oxford, England.\n\n\nMajor works\n \nThe Duke of Saint Simon. Oxford and London: B.H.

She attended Carlow College and West Virginia University. She served on the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency and was a founding member of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2009.\nSusan Kelly-Dreiss worked on behalf of battered women and their children for over thirty years. She started her career by helping to open a shelter for battered women in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Then in 1976, she joined with other women to successfully lobby for passage of Pennsylvania's first domestic violence law, the Pennsylvania Protection from Abuse Act. During this time, there was little to no law to protect battered women due to the wake of Roe v. Wade, Title IX, and the ongoing fight for the Equal Rights Amendment.\nShe was the co-founder of the first domestic violence coalition in the United States, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV). Her inspiration behind starting the PCADV came from growing up in a battered home herself. As the Executive Director of PCADV, Kelly-Dreiss oversaw the growth of the network from nine to sixty-one community-based programs throughout the state of Pennsylvanian. In 1993, she was instrumental in securing federal funding to establish the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence at PCADV, which provides information and technical assistance on domestic violence and related issues.\nShe played a key role in drafting federal legislation including the Federal Violence Prevention and Services Act and the Violence Against Women Act. In her testimony to the United States Senate, she strongly advocated for the action of the Violence Against Women Act by defining domestic violence, the equal treatment of women, and her urgency to help all American women who are victims. She served in \nleadership positions on family violence task forces under two Pennsylvania attorneys general, and was appointed by Governor Tom Ridge and re-appointed by Governor Ed Rendell to the Pennsylvania Commission \non Crime and Delinquency.\nSusan Kelly-Dreiss was the recipient of a National Crime Victim Service Award and mentored and motivated women to carry out the work of the Battered Women's Movement.

    "text": "The geology of the Bay of Biscay formed as the North Atlantic opened during the late Cretaceous. Near shore, thinned continental crust shows signs of complicated stress patterns, while  basalt oceanic crust lies beneath deep water offshore. Geologists have debated whether the bay opened in a simple rotation \"scissor pattern\" or through left-lateral strike slip faulting. \n\n\nStructural geology\nMuch of the geologic structure of the Bay of Biscay is interpreted from seismic profiles. A series of analyses published between 1987 and 1990 found thin layers of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments and the Moho around 33 kilometers deep. Different reflections suggested possible thrust sheets related to the Variscan orogeny and signs of foreland deformation down into the mantle. \nNorth of La Rochelle the seismic reflection became scattered, marking north-dipping features related to South-Armorican south-vergent thrusts. \nThe Basque-Cantabrian Basin is a large sedimentary basin on thinned continental crust that lies onshore and offshore along the southern margin of the Bay of Biscay on the north coast of Spain. Rifting broke up Jurassic carbonate \"ramps,\" leading to the erosion of some of these carbonate units. When the basin first formed, it was partly separated from the neighboring Pyrenean basin by the Landes high-ground, although this feature later got underthrusted and buried by Cretaceous sediments offshore. \nThe faulted offshore Biscay synclinorium is believed to be an extension of the onshore Pyrenean fault zone, by way of the Leiza fault. This structural feature was buried by deep-sea volcanic eruptions during the Aptian. \n\n\nOil and natural gas\nThe Bay of Biscay is a potential target area for deep water oil and gas drilling. Spectrum reinterpreted old seismic data in the region between 2014 and 2015, which was included in its \"Atlantic Deep\" dataset with a focus on sedimentary layers in Jurassic rifts. \n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Bermuda Agreement (formally Agreement between the government of the United Kingdom and the government of the United States relating to Air Services between their respective Territories), reached in 1946 by American and British negotiators in Bermuda, was an early bilateral air transport agreement regulating civil air transport. It established a precedent for the signing of approximately 3,000 other such agreements between countries. The Agreement was replaced by the Bermuda II Agreement, which was signed in 1977 and effective in 1978.\n\n\nBackground\n\nDuring World War II, transatlantic air service between Britain and America was limited to Boeing 314 flying boat service between Baltimore and Foynes, which Pan American World Airways had begun in July 1939. British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) also flew the route using three Boeing 314s purchased from Pan Am.\nThe Bermuda Agreement arose in the wake of the Chicago Conference of 1944, where the United States and United Kingdom disagreed about economic control of international air transport. The US and UK had generally agreed on the first two freedoms of the air (overflight and landings for repair/refueling) but the UK and several other countries refused to accept the US position on the third, fourth and fifth freedoms regarding the handling of passenger and cargo traffic. Specifically, the US sought the freedom for its carriers to determine capacity and frequencies on international routes, while the UK sought predetermined routes and an equal division of capacity between the two nations' carriers on those routes. Britain had lost much of its air fleet in the course of World War II and was reluctant to place itself in full competition with the stronger American air fleet.\nPrior to the Bermuda Agreement, the United States signed bilateral aviation agreements with several other European countries (Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark), and had signed a multilateral Transport Agreement with several European and Latin American countries, but service to and from the United Kingdom had to be negotiated with the British government on an ad hoc basis. As of late 1945, the UK had limited transatlantic traffic by the US to 14 services per week, 500 seats per week and a minimum fare of $375.\nIn July 1945, the US government granted Pan Am, Trans World Airlines (TWA) and American Export Airlines (shortly thereafter acquired by American Airlines and renamed American Overseas Airlines) the right to operate transatlantic service. American began its Douglas DC-4 service between New York and Bournemouth that October. Pan Am announced its own DC-4 service in October 1945 at prices less than 50% of the previous flying boat fares, which led the British government to pressure both Pan Am and the US government to back away from what Britain described as a \"wholly uneconomic proposition.\"\nThe US and UK governments agreed in late 1945 to meet and discuss the terms of a bilateral aviation agreement. Bermuda was chosen to host the meeting due to its location between the two countries and isolation from their respective governments. In a sign of the rapidly advancing technology of the time, the British delegation arrived in January by Boeing 314 flying boats, and departed in February by Lockheed 049 Constellation pressurized landplanes.\n\n\nKey terms\nUnlike the existing bilateral and multilateral aviation agreements, the Bermuda Agreement defined specific routes on which each countries' carriers could fly, with the right to pick up or discharge international traffic (but no cabotage rights) at any point along the routes:\n\nBritish carriers:\nLondon – New York – San Francisco – Honolulu / Midway / Wake / Guam / Manila – Singapore / Hong Kong\nLondon – New York – New Orleans – Mexico\nLondon – New York – Cuba – Jamaica / Panama – Colombia / Ecuador / Peru / Chile\nUnited States carriers:\nUS points – London – Netherlands / Germany / Scandinavia / Russia\nUS points – London – Belgium – Central Europe – Near East – India\nHonolulu – Hong Kong – China / India\nHonolulu – Hong Kong – Singapore – Netherlands East Indies\nThe inclusion of many fifth freedom routes (beyond the United States and British Isles) reflected the fact that many territories such as Hong Kong, Singapore and India were still British colonies at the time the agreement was signed, and that many third countries were eager for air service and willing to provide rights to British and American carriers without restrictions.\nAs a compromise on the capacity issue, the Bermuda Agreement provided for equitable principles that \"there shall be a fair and equal opportunity for the carriers of the two nations to operate on any route between their respective territories (as defined in the Agreement) covered by the Agreement and its Annex\" and that \"in the operation by the air carriers of either Government of the trunk services described in the Annex to the Agreement, the interest of the air carriers of the other Government shall be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides.\"\nFares were made subject to regulatory approval by authorities in each country or by the International Air Transport Association, effectively giving the IATA immunity from US antitrust law, which immunity remained in effect on North Atlantic routes until 1979.\n\n\nOperations under the agreement\n\n\n1940s\n\nPan Am took delivery of the Lockheed 749 Constellation in June 1947 and began its \"round-the-world\" route with eastbound stops in New York, Gander, Shannon, London, Istanbul, Dhahran, Karachi, Calcutta, Bangkok, Manila, Shanghai, Tokyo, Guam, Wake, Midway, Honolulu and San Francisco, taking advantage of Bermuda Agreement fifth freedom rights.\nNewfoundland, an essential refueling stop on any transatlantic air route in the 1940s, was part of Britain at the time the Bermuda Agreement was signed. In 1949, following its accession as a Canadian province, the United States signed an agreement with Canada to provide for fifth freedom rights to and from Gander.\n\n\n1950s\n\nPan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines in 1950, concentrating the US-UK air travel market to three carriers: Pan Am, TWA and BOAC.\nBOAC, still Britain's sole transatlantic carrier, sought to compete with Pan Am's \"round the world\" service by offering an \"all-red\" route from Britain to Australia via Canada, but bilateral agreements between the UK and these countries stalled in the early 1950s. BOAC proceeded to open a London-Chicago route in May 1954, with the intention to extend the service to San Francisco and Tokyo. The San Francisco extension was not realized until 1957, and US government approval for the Tokyo service did not come until 1959 due to objections by Northwest Airlines.\nBOAC introduced de Havilland Comet jet service on the London-New York route in 1958. TWA began jet service on the New York-London-Frankfurt route in 1959.\n\n\n1960s\nThe United States began to exercise an even more dominant position in the transatlantic market during the 1960s. One key issue was that Pan Am and TWA began to use the hub and spoke system to feed passengers from many US destinations through a transatlantic \"gateway\" and on to Europe, giving the US carriers an advantage in serving secondary markets. Partly as a result of this competitive pressure, the market share of BOAC on transatlantic routes fell from 37.8% in 1961–62 to 30.9% by 1966–67.\n\n\n1970s\nThe British government added a privately owned carrier, British Caledonian, to the transatlantic market in 1973, with flights from London's Gatwick Airport to New York and Los Angeles. BCal was forced to exit the market in 1976 after the British government determined that competition was not improving Britain's overall market share.\n\n\nTermination\nIn 1976, the British government announced its intention to renounce the agreement, beginning the negotiation of the Bermuda II Agreement which became effective in 1978. Although the UK initially sought an equal division of capacity between UK and US carriers, the final Bermuda II agreement largely preserved the liberal capacity provisions of Bermuda I.\nThe Bermuda agreements were replaced in two stages on 30 March 2008, and 24 June 2010, by the EU–US Open Skies Agreement between the European Union (representing 25 European countries) and the United States, providing for an Open Skies regime even more liberal than Bermuda I.\n\n\nEffect on other aviation agreements\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom made the Bermuda Agreement their model for bilateral agreements with other countries until Bermuda II. The only major exception during this era was the 1966 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which designated Pan Am and Aeroflot as the operating carriers from each country and left commercial details of service to the airlines' prior agreement. Although most other agreements during this era followed the Bermuda I model, they tended to include fewer and fewer fifth and sixth freedom rights (traffic rights to and from third countries) as time went on, as the increased range of aircraft made such rights less necessary. The general principles of the Bermuda Agreement were also followed by other countries, such as Canada in its various bilateral agreements.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "The Bermuda Agreement (formally Agreement between the government of the United Kingdom and the government of the United States relating to Air Services between their respective Territories), reached in 1946 by American and British negotiators in Bermuda, was an early bilateral air transport agreement regulating civil air transport. It established a precedent for the signing of approximately 3,000 other such agreements between countries. The Agreement was replaced by the Bermuda II Agreement, which was signed in 1977 and effective in 1978.",

After completing initial training with Consolidated B-24 Liberators, it moved to Wendover Field, Utah for Phase 2 training, and to Sioux City Army Air Base, Iowa for final training.  The ground echelon moved to Camp Shanks, New York and sailed for England aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth on 23 November.  The air echelon completed final processing at Herington Army Air Field, Kansas and deployed with their Liberators via the southern ferry route.\n\n\nCombat in Europe\n\nThe squadron flew its first combat mission from RAF Seething on 22 December 1943.  It was primarily engaged in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany, attacking ball bearing plants in Berlin, marshalling yards at Cologne, a V-1 flying bomb assembly plant at Fallersleben, aircraft factories in Gotha, an airfield at Hanau, a chemical plant at Ludwigshafen, synthetic oil refineries near Pölitz, aircraft engine plants at Rostock, among other strategic targets.  The squadron participated in Big Week, an intensive campaign against German aircraft manufacturing plants from 20 to 25 February 1944.\nThe squadron was occasionally diverted from its strategic bombing mission to fly interdiction and close air support missions.  It bombed V- weapon launch sites, airfields and transportation facilities to support Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, and on D-Day attacked coastal defenses and choke points on German lines of communication.  It struck enemy positions to assist the allied attacks on Caen and Operation Cobra, the breakout at Saint Lo.  It dropped supplies to allied troops during Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands.  During the Battle of the Bulge, it attacked transportation and communications targets in December 1944 and January 1945.  In the spring of 1945, it again dropped supplies to airborne troops in Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine near Wesel.  The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945, an attack on a railroad yard near Salzburg, Austria.\nThe air echelon began returning to the United States with their planes in June 1945, while the ground echelon sailed from Greenock on the RMS Queen Mary on 6 July.  Squadron members were given leave upon arrival in the States and the squadron began to assemble at Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota in the middle of the month.  After training with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the squadron moved to Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas in December 1945.  At Fort Worth, it became one of the first units of Strategic Air Command in March 1946.  However, in August the squadron was inactivated and its personnel and equipment were transferred to the 325th Bombardment Squadron, which was simultaneously activated.\n\n\nAir Force reserve\nThe squadron was reactivated as a reserve unit under Air Defense Command (ADC) at Long Beach Army Air Field, California in April 1947, where its training was supervised by the 416th AAF Base Unit (later the 2347th Air Force Reserve Training Center).  Although nominally a B-29 unit, it is not clear whether or not the squadron was fully staffed or equipped.  In 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC.  In June 1949nAC reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization, and the squadron became a Douglas B-26 Invader unit of the 448th Bombardment Wing.  However, it was staffed at 25% of normal strength.\nIn August 1950, the 448th Wing's companion reserve unit at Long Beach, the 452d Bombardment Wing, was mobilized for Korean War service.  In order to bring the 452d Wing to combat strength, skilled reservists and reservists who required 60 or fewer days training to qualify them as fully skilled assigned to the 448th Wing were transferred to the 452d Wing.  The 712th Squadron itself was called to active duty in the second wave of mobilization in March 1951 and its personnel who had not been transferred to the 452d Wing were used as fillers for other Air Force organizations, while the squadron was inactivated four days later.\n\n\nAir refueling operations\nThe squadron was redesignated the 712th Air Refueling Squadron and activated in April 1994 at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia as a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker tanker squadron.   The squadron assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 912th Air Refueling Squadron, which moved on paper from Robins to Grand Forks Air Force Base, Kansas, as the 19th Air Refueling Wing's second air refueling squadron.  In July 1996, the 19th Wing was inactivated when the refueling activity at Robins was reduced to group size and the squadron was also inactivated.\nThe squadron was converted to a provisional unit as the 712th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron in February 2001, and assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe to activate or inactivate as needed. It was activated in March 2008 at Budapest Ferihengy International Airport Hungary and inactivated at the end of the following month. While on this deployment, it supported the Romanian-led Operation Noble Endeavor which had the task of providing air policing during the 2008 Bucharest summit. Maintenance of the aircraft was provided by airmen of the 100th Air Refueling Wing from RAF Mildenhall.\n\n\nLineage\nConstituted as the 712th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 6 April 1943\nActivated on 1 May 1943\nRedesignated 712th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy on 20 August 1943\nRedesignated 712th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 5 August 1945\nInactivated on 4 August 1946\nActivated in the reserve on 19 April 1947\nRedesignated 712th Bombardment Squadron, Light on 27 June 1949\nOrdered to active service on 17 March 1951\nInactivated 21 March 1951\nRedesignated 712th Air Refueling Squadron and activated, on 1 April 1994\nInactivated on 1 July 1996\nConverted to provisional status and redesignated 712th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron on 5 February 2001\nActivated on 18 March 2008\nInactivated on 30 April 2008\n\n\nAssignments\n448th Bombardment Group, 1 May 1943 – 4 August 1946\n448th Bombardment Group, 19 April 1947 – 21 March 1951\n19th Operations Group, 1 April 1994 – 1 July 1996\nUnited States Air Forces in Europe to activate or inactivate as needed, 5 February 2002\n398th Air Expeditionary Group, 14 March–30 April 2008\n\n\nStations\n\n\nAircraft\nConsolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943–1945\nBoeing B-29 Superfortress, 1945–1946\nBoeing KC-135 Stratotanker, 1994–1996\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n This article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency\n\nAnderson, Capt.

It was suppressed as a parish ca. 1975.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Sacred Heart Church and Cemetery were established in the late 1800s to accommodate the Irish Catholic population \nwho were employed on the railroads and large estates in Barrytown and the surrounding hamlets. Prior to a Catholic church\nin Barrytown, the residents of the area attended services across the river in Kingston and Saugerties. People would walk\nacross the frozen river in winter or cross by boat in other seasons, weather permitting. Walter V. Miller in \"A Parish History\"\ntells of an old tale: \"The account has it that, on one occasion, a boat and its occupants thereof narrowly missed playing the\nleading role in a very tragic incident, this happening, strange as it may seem, played a very large part in establishing of the \nfirst church at Barrytown instead of Red Hook.\" Apparently, some members of the Donaldson family of Edgewater were on that boat. The Donaldson family donated the land for the church and cemetery at Barrytown.\nThe cornerstone of the church was laid by Rev. Thomas S. Preston on October 17, 1875. Barrytown was a mission attended from St. Joseph's in Rhinecliff, by pastor James Fitzsimmons, until 1886 when Archbishop Corrigan appointed Rev. William J. McClure resident rector.  The first burial in the Cemetery was November 23, 1886. The rectory was built in 1887. St. Christopher's in Red Hook began as a mission station of Sacred Heart Parish.\n\n\nPastors\nFather William J.

According to Forbes, he was ranked as the 248th millionaire in 2012, with an estimated fortune of $4.3 billion.\n\n\nBiography\nHaefner was born in the Zurich in 1910. He was one of seven children of a protestant missionary and went on study business economics.\nHe worked for Shell before joining the Swiss division of General Motors Corporation. During World World II, he took over AMAG Automobil- und Motoren and began adapting cars to be powered by wood gas rather than fuel.  Haefner introduced Volkswagens to Switzerland and imported 1,680 Beetles by 1948. \nIn 1960, he opened the Automation Center AG. Recognizing the important role a computer could play in his growing chain of dealerships, in 1957 Haefner became one of the first in Switzerland to import an IBM system for business use. He sold the data-processing firm in 1968 to University Computing.\nIn 1976, he expanded operations to the United States and, after merging his company Computer Associates International, Inc. in 1987, Haefner remained CA's largest individual shareholder until his death. He continued to own AMAG Automobil- und Motoren, a highly successful Swiss automobile dealership chain. Until his death, at age 101, he was the oldest person worth more than a billion dollars.\n\n\nMoyglare Stud Farm\nIn 1962, Haefner purchased the 440-acre (1.8 km2) Moyglare Stud Farm near the town of Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland. His thoroughbred racehorses have won numerous Group One and British Classic Races in England, Ireland, and France as well as important races at other venues in Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong.\nThrough horse racing, Haefner met art dealer Daniel Wildenstein, who was himself a successful horse breeder. In the mid-1960s, Haefner acquired his first paintings from Wildenstein's New York branch.\nIn the United States Moyglare's racing stable was handled by trainer Christophe Clement while Dermot K. Weld is the trainer in charge of its European operations. In 1991 Weld became the first European-based trainer to win a race in Hong Kong when Moyglare's colt Additional Risk won the Hong Kong Invitational Bowl at Sha Tin Racecourse.\nIn 1975, the Curragh Racecourse honored Moyglare's contribution to Irish racing by naming a Group I race the Moyglare Stud Stakes. In 1988 Trinity College, Dublin awarded Haefner an honorary doctorate for his services to the Irish bloodstock industry and for his contributions to education in Ireland.\nSelective major race wins by some of the horses owned or bred by Moyglare Stud Farm: \n\nAdditional Risk - Hong Kong Bowl\nAgain Tomorrow - Premio Parioli\nAssert - Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby Stakes\nBikala  - Prix du Jockey Club, Prix Ganay\nBrief Truce - St. James's Palace Stakes\nCarwhite - Prix d'Ispahan\nDance Design - Irish Oaks, Pretty Polly Stakes (2), Tattersalls Gold Cup\nDefinite Article - Tattersalls Gold Cup, National Stakes\nDress To Thrill - Matriarch Stakes, Matron Stakes, Sun Chariot Stakes\nGo And Go  - Belmont Stakes\nMarket Booster - Pretty Polly Stakes, Bayerisches Zuchtrennen\nMedia Puzzle - Melbourne Cup\nRefuse To Bend - 2,000 Guineas, National Stakes, Eclipse Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes\nRelaxed Gesture - Canadian International Stakes\nStanerra - Japan Cup\nTrusted Partner - Irish 1,000 Guineas\nTwilight Agenda - won Meadowlands Cup, San Pasqual Handicap, Del Mar Breeders' Cup Mile.

The vessel is named after Manuel Florencio Mantilla, an Argentine politician who promoted the first law creating the PNA; she is the first ship of this service with this name.\n\n\nDesign\nDoctor Manuel Mantilla is one of five Mantilla-class patrol boats ordered by the Argentine Naval Prefecture (PNA) in 1981, corresponding to the coast guard cutter “Halcon II” type, designed and build by the Spanish Empresa Nacional Bazán shipyard. The design is optimised for long range open seas patrols, for prolonged periods of time away from port.\nMantilla has a steel hull and superstructure, with a single mast atop, behind the bridge. She is powered by two Bazán-MTU 16V-956-TB91 marine diesel engines of 2500kw each (maximum intermittent power 3000kw), driving two Variable-pitch propellers; with a maximum speed of 18kn (19kn at maximum intermittent power). The design has a maximum range of 3650 nautical miles at a cruise speed of 16kn. She has an additional bedroom at the bow to allow her functioning as a training ship.\nShe has 3 electrical generators of 185Kva each, powering a varied array of systems: controls and communications system that integrates with other PNA air and surface assets; navigation radar; echosound; direction finder; and helicopter navigation control.\nMantilla is equipped with two water cannons for firefighting, anti-contamination gear, active stabilizers and a retractable hangar and landing pad with support facilities for an Alouette-sized helicopter. She is armed with a single 40mm L/70 Bofors dual-purpose autocannon in a position at the front of the bridge.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMantilla was ordered by the Argentine Naval Prefecture (PNA) in 1981 as part of the five-ship Mantilla-class, composed by the patrol boats GC-24 to GC-28. She was built in 1981-83 by the Spanish Empresa Nacional Bazán shipyard. She was launched in June 1981, completed in December 1982, and left El Ferrol, Spain, arriving in Buenos Aires on 30 March 1983. She was commissioned on 5 April 1983 and assigned to the Coast Guard Service ((in Spanish) Servicio de Buques Guardacostas}).\nIn June 1983 she sailed on her first patrol of the Argentine Sea, from her base in Buenos Aires.\nAs of 2016, she is based at Puerto Nuevo, part of the Port of Buenos Aires.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee also\nZ-28 class patrol boat\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nOther sources\n\"Guardacostas Marítimo Clase Halcón II \"MANTILLA\" GC-24\".

A fund established in Gray's honour promotes the education and leadership of women in theology and is called the Janette Gray RSM Fund.  \n\n\nEarly life\nBorn 1 February 1952 in Adelaide, South Australia, Gray studied at Macquarie University (Sydney) receiving a BA and Dip.Ed before becoming a sister of Mercy in 1997. She took first vows at the Convent of Mercy (Angas St, Adelaide) in 1977 and final vows in St Francis Xavier Cathedral, Adelaide in 1984. Gray completed a MTheol at the Melbourne College of Divinity and went on to do a PhD in Theology at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\n\nWork\nGray's teaching subject areas included Christology, women in the church, faith and culture and the theology of the human person. She was a Senior Lecturer in Theology at the University of Notre Dame Australia, Western Australia 1999-2003, Faculty of Jesuit Theological College, Parkville, Melbourne 2004-2014, Lecturer & Supervisor at the United Faculty of Theology (UFT), Pilgrim College and Yarra Theological Union (YTU) (latterly University of Divinity, Melbourne).  For years Gray was a book review editor for Pacifica, recognised as the leading ecumenical journal in Australasia. She was also a member of the National Council of Churches in Australia’s (NCCA) Faith and Unity Commission 2013-2016. At the time of her death, Sr Janette Gray was completing a book on a French Dominican who had proved very influential in preparing for the Second Vatican Council: Theology for Global People: Marie-Dominique Chenu. This dissertation, which was edited by Kathleen Williams, was published posthumously in 2019.\n\n\nFeminism\nGray's first book, Neither Escaping Nor Exploiting Sex: Women's Celibacy (1995), emerged from her Masters in Theology for the Melbourne College of Divinity. Her supervisors and examiners called for its publication.  In the book she explored how celibate women live their sexuality and how their personal challenges yield valuable ideas about human relationships and ecological awareness. The book symbolised a lifelong, passionate concern to educate herself and others.\nDuring her time at Cambridge, Gray, Ann Gilroy, and Kathleen O’Grady resurrected a speaker series called: Women’s Voices in Religion. This series was originally begun in 1990-91 organised by Teresa Elwes resulting in an edited collection published  in 1992.  In turn, they published an edited collection “Bodies, Lives, Voices: Gender in Theology” and the series continued under Carrie Pemberton 1997-98.\n\n\nOther work\nGerald O'Collins includes Gray in his book “Portraits: Popes, Family, and Friends” along with Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Cardinal Carlo Maria Martin.   \n\n\nPublications\nGray, J.

Due to the social taboo of \"Ming\" (Ming or Daming means the former Ming dynasty), its name was changed to \"Shuangjiang\" (双江; 'Two Rivers'). In 1754, during the Qianlong era, magistrate Yao Wenguang (姚文光) supervised the restoration and renamed it \"Juxing\" (聚星).\n\n\nModern China\nIn December 1987, it has been designated as a provincial level cultural heritage by the Jiangxi Provincial Government.\nThe pagoda became dilapidated for neglect.

    "text": "Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731 (2011), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that U.S. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft could not be personally sued for his involvement in the detention of a U.S. citizen in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.\n\n\nBackground\nThe plaintiff, Abdullah al-Kidd (born Lavoni T. Kidd in Wichita, Kansas), was an American citizen and a prominent football player at the University of Idaho. While at college, Kidd converted to Islam and adopted the name Abdullah al-Kidd. Al-Kidd was arrested by federal agents in 2003 at Dulles International Airport. He was travelling to Saudi Arabia to attend school. He was held for two weeks under the federal material-witness statute and controlled by supervised release for 13 months because he was to testify in the trial of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen. The latter was tried and acquitted on charges of supporting terrorist organizations.\nAt the time of al-Kidd's arrest, the FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress that it was one of the FBI's \"success\" stories.  Al-Kidd was never charged or called as a witness, and he was ultimately released. As a result of his arrest, al-Kidd lost his job and a research scholarship, and he also claimed that it led to the end of his marriage.\nAl-Kidd filed suit against John Ashcroft, who was U.S. Attorney General from 2001 to 2005. Al-Kidd alleges that he was denied access to a lawyer, shackled, and strip-searched. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented al-Kidd, claim that he is one of 70 Muslim men who were similarly treated.\nThe federal government said that Ashcroft has absolute immunity from such civil suits because he was acting within the scope of his duties as U.S. Attorney General. In the alternative, Ashcroft has qualified immunity that prevents such suits unless the official violated a right that was clearly established at the time of the violation.\nIn 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that Ashcroft could personally be sued and held responsible for al-Kidd's wrongful detention. On October 18, 2010, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear Ashcroft's appeal of the Ninth Circuit's ruling.\n\n\nOpinion of the Court\nOn May 31, 2011, the Supreme Court, in an 8–0 ruling, stated that al-Kidd's lawyers had not met the high burden of proof needed to show that Attorney General Ashcroft could be personally sued, that he was directly involved or had explicit knowledge of the events (suggesting the matter was handled mostly by distant subordinates). The ACLU had sued him personally because it is very hard to sue a senior agent of the government in his or her official capacity (unless an individual commits a felony or other serious crime, in which case an elected official may be impeached) because American government bodies enjoy immunity from being sued. In the majority opinion written by Justice Scalia, the court ruled that \"Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions. When properly applied, it protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. Ashcroft deserves neither label\" (internal citation omitted).\nJustice Kagan did not participate in the case as she had previously worked on the government's preparation of its case while serving in the Obama administration.\n\n\nEffect of the decision\nThe case is widely viewed as broadening the protection that qualified immunity affords to officials, and eroding civil liberties.\n\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 563\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nText of Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731 (2011) is available from: CourtListener  Findlaw  Google Scholar  Justia  Oyez (oral argument audio)  Supreme Court (slip opinion) (archived)",

    "text": "Ghostbusters: Original Soundtrack Album is the soundtrack album for the 1984 film of the same name, released by Arista Records on June 8, 1984. The soundtrack includes the Billboard Hot 100 number one hit \"Ghostbusters\", written and performed by Ray Parker Jr. The film score, Ghostbusters: Original Motion Picture Score, was composed by Elmer Bernstein. The film score remained unreleased until March 16, 2006, when it was released by Varèse Sarabande.\n\n\nGhostbusters: Original Soundtrack Album\n\n\nDevelopment\nEarly on, Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman and Elmer Bernstein discussed the idea that the film would feature popular music at specific points to complement Bernstein's original score. This included \"Magic\" by Mick Smiley, which plays during the scene when the ghosts are released from the Ghostbusters headquarters. Bernstein's main theme for the Ghostbusters was later replaced by Ray Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\". Bernstein personally disliked the use of these songs, particularly \"Magic\", but said, \"it's very hard to argue with something like [\"Ghostbusters\"], when it is up in the top ten on the charts\". The soundtrack also includes two tracks from Elmer Bernstein's score for the film.\nMusic was required for a montage in the middle of the film, and \"I Want a New Drug\" by Huey Lewis and the News was used as a temporary placeholder because of its appropriate tempo. Reitman was later introduced to Parker Jr. who developed \"Ghostbusters\" with a similar riff to match the montage. There were approximately 50 to 60 different theme songs developed for Ghostbusters by different artists before Parker Jr.'s involvement, though none was deemed suitable. Huey Lewis was approached to compose the film's theme, but was already committed to work on Back to the Future's soundtrack.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nGhostbusters: Original Motion Picture Score\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Ghostbusters score was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony at The Village in West Los Angeles, California. It was orchestrated by Bernstein's son, Peter and David Spear. Bernstein had previously scored several of Ivan Reitman's films and was hired before filming had begun or all the cast had been signed. Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny. Bernstein used the ondes Martenot (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a theremin) to produce the \"eerie\" effect. Bernstein had to bring a musician, Cynthia Millar, from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists. He also used three Yamaha DX7 synthesizers.\nIn a 1985 interview Bernstein described Ghostbusters as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the film's varying comedic and serious tones. He created an \"antic\" theme for the Ghostbusters he described as \"cute, without being really way out\". He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound \"awesome and mystical\".\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nSee also\nGhostbusters II (soundtrack)\nGhostbusters (2016 soundtrack)\nGhostbusters: Afterlife (soundtrack)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\nLarson, Randall D.

    "text": "Sir Charles Forbes, 1st Baronet (1774–1849) was a Scottish politician, of Newe and Edinglassie, Aberdeenshire. Forbes was the son of the Rev. George Forbes of Lochell. He was a descendant of Alexander Forbes of Kinaldie and Pitsligo, and was in 1833 served heir male in general to Alexander Forbes, 3rd Lord Forbes of Pitsligo, father of Alexander Forbes, 4th Lord Forbes of Pitsligo, attainted in 1745.\n\n\nPolitical career\nForbes was educated at Aberdeen University, of which, late in life (1814–1819), he was elected Lord Rector. Shortly after leaving the university he went out to India, and became the head of the first mercantile house there, Forbes & Co. of Bombay. His name ranked high in the commercial world for ability, foresight, and rectitude of character. On returning to England, he was elected to parliament for the borough of Beverley, and represented that place from 1812 to 1818. In the latter year he was returned for Malmesbury, and continued to represent that town until the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. As a member of the House of Commons he enjoyed the respect of all parties, for his love of justice, kindly feeling, and plain, straightforward honesty. Though a tory of the tories, he \"never allowed his political creed to cloud his fine judgment and keen sense of right and wrong, and his manly spirit was readily engaged in favour of the poor, the weak, and the persecuted\". He warmly supported catholic emancipation; and when the Duke of Wellington incurred great unpopularity in 1830, Forbes pronounced in the House of Commons a warm panegyric on the duke's conduct.\nForbes was one of the earliest to advocate the claims of women to the franchise. In the session of 1831 he asked upon what reasonable grounds they could be excluded from political rights, pointing out that ladies had the power of voting for directors of the East India Company, and maintaining that if the right of voting was grounded on the possession of property, there ought to be no distinction of sex. Forbes was a strong opponent of the Reform Bill of 1831–2. During the debates in the former session he spoke of the measure as \"the vile Reform Bill, that hideous monster, the most frightful that ever showed its face in that house\". He promised to pursue it to the last with uncompromising hostility, and if it were carried to abandon parliament. He put forward an urgent plea for Malmesbury. The borough, after much angry discussion, was left with one member only. Forbes vainly contested Middlesex against Joseph Hume at the general election of 1832.\n\n\nPhilanthropy in India\nHe was most distinguished in connection with India. From his long residence in the East, he knew the people intimately, and he spent a large portion of his fortune in their midst. In parliament and in the proprietors' court of the East India Company his advocacy of justice for India was ardent and untiring. One of his last acts was the appropriation of a very large sum of money to procure for the inhabitants of Bengal a plentiful supply of pure water in all seasons. His fame spread from one end of Hindostan to the other. When he left India he was presented by the natives with a magnificent service of plate, and twenty-seven years after his departure from Bombay the sum of £9,000 was subscribed for the erection of a statue to his honour. The work was entrusted to Sir Francis Chantrey, and the statue now stands in the town hall of Bombay, between those of Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir John Malcolm. It was the first instance on record of the people of India raising a statue to any one unconnected with the civil or military service of the country. An address, signed by 1,042 of the principal native and other inhabitants of Bombay, expatiated upon his services to the commercial development of the country and the improvement in the position of the natives. In his private charities Forbes was most liberal; he was also a munificent contributor to the leading public charities of Scotland.\n\n\nFamily\nForbes was of a bluff but kindly nature, diffident as to his own merits, of a straightforward and manly character. On the death of his uncle in 1821, Forbes succeeded to the entailed estates of the Forbeses of Newe, and was created a baronet by patent in 1823.\nHe married Elizabeth Cotgrave (d. 1861) in 1811. Forbes died in 1849. Their eldest son, John, had predeceased his father: the title was inherited by their second son, Charles. Their daughter, Elizabeth, married General, Lord James Hay, second son of the seventh Marquess of Tweeddale.\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Stephen, Leslie, ed.

    "text": "The Battle of Tiracol was a military engagement between Portuguese forces under the command of the Viceroy of India Dom Pedro Miguel de Almeida Portugal e Vasconcelos against the Bhonsles at Tiracol. It was part of the Novas Conquistas or \"New Conquests\" campaigns.\n\n\nBackground\n\nDue to persistent raids by the Bhonsles against Portuguese shipping and the border districts of Bardez and Pondá of Portuguese Goa, in Portuguese India, Viceroy Dom Pedro de Almeida Portugal decided to occupy the lands owned by the Bhonsles north of Goa. In April 1746 the Portuguese captured Bicholim, Alorna and Sanquelim, while a Portuguese fleet blockaded the mouth of the Chapora River.  \nThe fort of Tiracol was the main base and haven of Bhonsle pirates and privateers. It was equipped with 34 guns and garrisoned by 200 men capable of bearing arms, while a heavy chain closed off the mouth of the river from naval entry. With the end of the monsoon rains by September, the Portuguese began preparing to occupy it. \nThe Viceroy mobilized two ships-of-the-line, five palas and 20 smaller craft. 3690 men, of which 1000 were footsoldiers, 300 caçadores, 90 horsemen, and 2300 sepoys, of which 1200 were led by the Raja of Sooda, 600 in the service of the Portuguese and 500 under the command of the dessais of Query.\nThe viceroy departed on his flagship Misericórdia on November 14, while the Portugues army marched overland towards Tiracol, opening a path through the jungle if necessary.\n\n\nBattle\nBy early morning of November 23 1746, Portuguese land forces took position in the vicinity of the fort of Tiracol while Portuguese vessels blockaded the rivermouth and bombarded both the fort as well as five Bhonsle palas then within the harbour, beyond the river chain. The ships of the Bhonsles responded vigorously, but within a few hours they had been heavily damaged, and their crews began to flee ashore. \nBy late afternoon, Portuguese soldiers assaulted the fort, which was captured after weak resistance. \n\n\nAftermath\nAfter its capture, the fort was christened Santíssima Trindade.\nThe Portuguese captured 10 palas, three of which were burned, 17 galvetas, seven of which were burned, 10 parangues and minor vessels. 243 guns were captured, along with a considerable amount of material meant to equip ships. On December 1, the Portuguese occupied the fort of Rarim, which surrendered without a fight and a further 18 vessels were captured. After both the forts of Rarim and Tiracol were garrisoned, all remaining Portuguese forces returned to Goa on December 20. \nAs a result of Portuguese campaigning, the capability of the Bhonsles to harass Goa or its shipping was considerably diminished, while Portuguese territory was expanded north to as far as Rarim. When the Bhonsles again attempted to attack Portuguese shipping two years later, the Viceroy also captured Neutim.\n\n\nSee also\nAlorna Fort\nSiege of Alorna\nMarquis of Alorna\n\n\nReferences",

Las Vegas had qualified for a playoff spot, the final one in the National Conference, but the league's board of directors voted against their inclusion in the postseason, considering that with no team ownership, there was no funding for the team.  The Outlaws were replaced in the playoffs by the Portland Thunder, who had finished last in their division but had the better record of the two remaining non-playoff National Conference teams, meaning that all teams in the Pacific Division made the playoffs.\n\n\nAlignment\n\n\nRegular season standings\n\n\nPlayoffs\n\n\nConference semifinals\n\n\nConference finals\n\n\nArenaBowl XXVIII\n\n\nAll-Arena team\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Laguiole knife (French pronunciation: [laɡjɔl], locally [lajɔl]) is a traditional Occitan pocketknife originally produced in the \"knife city\" of Thiers, source of 70% of France's cutting tool production, as well as the small village of Laguiole, both located in the Massif Central region of France. Laguiole in this instance does not refer to any knife brand in France, where use of the name is not legally restricted, but to a generic type of traditional slipjoint knife of a sort associated with this French region, now made worldwide.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe major influence on the form of the classic laguiole is most likely the Arabo-Hispanic clasp knife of Andalusian Spain, the navaja. The laguiole was first designed in 1829 by Jean-Pierre Calmels. The earliest forms of laguiole knife were straight-bladed and handled, the so-called laguiole droit; the classic navaja-like laguiole seems to have been developed around 1860. \nThe Calmels laguiole droit had a 'half-lock' on the blade where a small projection on the end of the backspring (mouche) exerts pressure on a corresponding indent in the heel of blade when the knife is open; this, and not the full locking system of the navaja, remained a fixed feature in subsequent laguiole knives.  Seasonal migrations of shepherds and cattle herders between Catalan Spain and southern France in summer and winter introduced the navaja to France.  \nThe Arabo-Hispanic design of the navaja was merged with that of local folding knives represented by older patterns such as the laguiole droit and Capuchadou; the result became the classic laguiole. In 1840, the first awl or trocar (a surgical instrument used to puncture body cavities and relieve the suffering of cattle and other animals with bloat) was added to the some laguiole knife patterns. In 1880, some models of the laguiole began featuring a corkscrew, in response to demands from the owners of bars in the Auvergne, and restaurants in Paris.\n\n\nDesign\n\nClassic laguiole knives feature a slim, sinuous outline. They are about 12 cm long when closed, with a narrow, tapered blade of a semi-yataghan form, steel backspring (slipjoint) and a high quality of construction. Traditionally, the handle was made of cattle horn; however, nowadays other materials are sometimes used. These materials include French woods, exotic woods from all around the world, and fossilised mammoth ivory from Alaska or Siberia. \nThe French designer Philippe Starck re-designed laguiole knives using aluminium for the grips, but it was only a revival of a 1910 model. The blade is often made of stainless steel or high-carbon steel, with XC75 steels being 0.75% carbon and XC100 being 1% carbon.\n\nThe traditional laguiole utilizes a single blade, but sometimes a corkscrew or some other implement is added. This necessitates an even slimmer cutaway handle, the shape of which is fancifully known as the \"lady's leg\", the bolster at the base resembling a foot.  A 'Shepherd's Cross' consisting of 6–8 inlaid metal pins forming a cross can be found on the handle of some laguioles. It is a myth that this embellishment is a reference to a legend of Catholic shepherds in need of a cross for prayer during their seasonal migrations between the mountains and the plains. The cross can be found in the knives not earlier than the 1950s and is a mere decoration.\nThere is much mythology about the insect depicted on the spring. A legend identifies the design as a bee granted by Emperor Napoleon I (the bee was adopted as a dynastic symbol by Napoleon) in recognition of the courage of local soldiers. However, the \"bee\" on the laguiole knives was only introduced after World War II, more than a century after the death of the emperor.  Technically, \"la mouche\" (the fly) is the end of the backspring, which sits over the rotating part of the blade. The upper section was expanded to form a thumb rest. Older laguiole knives feature many kinds of decorated springs which don't necessarily feature insects.\nThere are about 109 production steps for a one-piece laguiole (single blade), about 166 for a two-piece one (blade and one other tool), and about 216 for a three-piece model (blade and two tools – corkscrew and awl).\nThe name Laguiole has since been used as a trademark designation for various other implements, so that one can now buy, for example, a \"Laguiole\" corkscrew, spoon, or steak-knife set.\n\n\nFrench and overseas production\nAs laguiole designates a type of knife and is not a brand or trade name of cutlery, laguiole knives are manufactured globally. This has led to the widespread availability of inexpensive, and sometimes low-quality, \"laguiole\" knives from China and elsewhere. Laguiole knives from France are currently produced in the cutlery town of Thiers, and more recently, production resumed in the village of Laguiole, the knife's namesake. French manufacturers stamp a trademark or signature into the steel of their knives. A description of the type of steel used and \"Made in France\" will often be stamped as well.\n\n\nSee also\nOpinel knives\nDouk-Douk\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHistory of the Laguiole knife\nThe Laguiole knife museum's website Archived 2009-06-24 at the Wayback Machine\nHandcrafting pictures and videos for Laguiole knives\nManufacturing a Laguiole knife\nForge de Laguiole - Forge de Laguiole - Manufacturer in the village of Laguiole\nLaguiole Honore Durand - Honore Durand - Manufacturer in the village of Laguiole\nLaguiole French Knives - Manufacturer of Laguiole",

His trademark is the scratchy, smoky voice. Joe Cocker himself therefore also called him the \"Polish Joe Cocker\".\nHe was awarded with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Order of the Smile. He also is honorary citizen of Elbląg, Poland.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nEarly career\n\nAs a child he learned the piano, first from an organist in his home parish and then at a state music school. He then played in various amateur bands in Elbląg. From 1967 to 1970 he studied at the gymnasium Juliusz Słowacki in Elbląg, where he directed the cabaret \"Tak To Bywa\". With this cabaret he won 2nd place at a competition of schools in northern Poland in 1968. He then studied at the Faculty of Music Education in Olsztyn.\nHe made his musical debut in 1972 with the group El at the 5th Student Cultural Festival in Olsztyn. In 1973 he moved to Warsaw and began working at the Warsaw Operetta and Theatre Targówek (later renamed Rampa Theatre).\nFrom 1977 to 1978 he was the pianist of the Gramine Blues Group, a Polish vocal/instrumental ensemble. At the same time, he wrote the music for the play Rapsod Polski, which was performed in Pruszków near Warsaw by a theatre group led by Bolesław Jastrzębski accompanied by a VIP band. He was then a member of the band Victoria Singers, which changed its name to Vox in 1979. He wrote numerous songs for this band, including:\n\nMasz w oczach dwa nieba (3rd prize for KFPP Opole '79) (KFPP = National Festival of Polish Song in Opole),\nBananowy Song (awarded the Bronze Lyre at the Bratislava Festival 1980),\nSzczęśliwej drogi, już czas.\n\n\nSolo career\n\nAfter parting ways with the group Vox in 1987, he embarked on a solo career. He managed to emerge as the winner of the National Festival of Polish Songs in Opole in 1979, 1989, 1990 and 1994 respectively.\nIn 1993, he appeared in the title role of \"Pan Twardowski\" in the musical of the same name. In 2001, he was named Singer of the Year by Phonographic Academy of Poland and received the annual \"Fryderyk\" award as a distinction. Prize.\nOn 10 December 2001, Rynkowski and Joe Cocker gave a joint charity concert in Warsaw, which culminated with a duet by the two (High Time We Went). In this way, Rynkowski celebrated his 50th birthday, which was celebrated in September of that year. Another joint concert took place on 5 July 2002 in Szczecin at the Pogoń Stadium. This collaboration led to, that the album Ten typ tak ma, released the following year in 2003, was recorded with support from some of Joe Cocker's band, including Deric Dyer, Nick Milo and Jack Bruno, and bassist Dale Davis (Tina Turner, Amy Winehouse).\nIn 2011 he took part in the recording of the song Mazurski cud, created as part of the campaign \"Mazury Cud Natury\" (The Wonder of Nature in Masuria) to promote the region of Masuria.\nIn December 2011, he appeared in the multimedia spectacle 16.12.1981 directed by Łukasz Kobiela, which took place on the 30th anniversary of the pacification of the Wujek Coal Mine in Katowice. This \"pacification\" was the bloody suppression of a strike by mine workers in Katowice.\nIn 2019, Ryszard Rynkowski participated as a judge in the Polish TV show \"Szansa na sukces\" (A Chance for Success), a Polish equivalent of the German DSDS.\n\n\nPrivate life\nHis first wife Hanna died of breast cancer in 1996. This marriage produced a daughter, Marta (born 1978). In 2006 he remarried, after the new relationship remained a secret for a long time. He met his second wife, Edyta, 22 years younger, at a \"Meet and Greet\" after one of his concerts. In October 2008, his second child, son Ryszard Junior, was born. On 3 April 2009, the singer's first grandson was born, Jan and in 2010 his second grandson, Ignacy.\nIn 2002, the Elbląg city councillors granted him honorary citizenship of the city of Elbląg.\nIn 2005, he supported the election campaign of the PiS party and participated in the \"Spring of Poles\" concert series.\nOn the night of 15 to 16 November 2016, he threatened his family with suicide. The reason was marital problems and a resulting nervous breakdown. However, after talking to the police for a few minutes, the singer calmed down and handed over the gun to the officers. The pistol in his hand was loaded with live ammunition.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rynkowski, like many of his fellow musicians, was basically unemployed, which in turn plunged him into a deep emotional crisis. To make matters worse, the singer had been experiencing increasing problems with mobility in his hip for some time, which made him realise that he would no longer be able to perform larger concerts or even tours. In 2011, his wife Edyta was finally able to persuade him to invest the rest of his savings in a rehabilitation centre at his home Brodnica, where people with limb and spinal injuries are helped, thus guaranteeing him and his family, also for the future, a secure income.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nMusical\nPan Twardowski – Musical, P 1993 Polonia Records, Polonia CD 014.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nMedals awarded\n2002: Order of the Smile (Order Uśmiechu)\n2010: Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (Order of Polonia Restituta)\n2015: silver medal \"Gloria Artis Medal for Cultural Merit\" (Srebrny Medal \"Zasłużony Kulturze Gloria Artis\")\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nformer homepage (only available in the web archive, Polish)",

    "text": "George Andrew Killenberg (March 30, 1917 – May 20, 2008) was a notable American newspaper editor.\nKillenberg was executive editor of the now defunct St. Louis Globe-Democrat, or the Globe as it was commonly called, from 1979 until retiring from the position in March 1984. His 43-year career at the newspaper began in 1941 when he was hired as a reporter. He later served as city editor (1956–1966) and managing editor (1966–1979).\n\n\nEarly life, education\nKillenberg was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, on March 30, 1917. His father, George Washington Killenberg (1892-1939), was the only son of German immigrants in East St. Louis. His mother, Lavina Ruhl (1890-1954) was youngest of four children born to second-generation German immigrants in New Athens, Illinois. Killenberg was the eldest of two children. His younger sister Miriam (Mimi) Killenberg was born in 1918.\nKillenberg attended the now-defunct McBride High School, a Catholic high school for boys. Thereafter, he attended Saint Louis University, the oldest university west of the Mississippi River and the second-oldest Jesuit university in the United States. Killenberg suspended university studies to serve in the Army Medical Corps during World War II, ultimately earning a Bachelor of Science and a master's degree in American history upon his return.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nSaint Louis University\nWhile attending McBride High School, Killenberg was paid to provide scores and write stories about high school sports to the daily newspapers. After providentially meeting the director of sports information at Saint Louis University in the elevator at the St. Louis Star-Times, he was hired to replace him, though barely out of high school. The pay included free tuition to the university, and until the job came along, Killenberg had no hope of going to college. He was forced to leave the position when a new university president cut his salary along with the SLU football program, but continued studies at the university.\n\n\nWorld War II\nKillenberg suspended studies at St. Louis University and took leave from a job as a reporter at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat to join the Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he returned to his job at the Globe and to SLU as a part-time student.\n\n\nSt. Louis Globe-Democrat\nA short stint in public relations led him to the reporter job at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. As a reporter, Killenberg covered the 1947 Centralia mine disaster, a coal mine explosion near the town of Centralia, Illinois, that killed 111 people. In 1956, Killenberg was promoted to city editor, followed by promotions to managing editor in 1966 and executive editor in 1979.\nAs editor, Killenberg's focus was on the interests of the people, resulting in him and his staff putting out \"a damned good paper\" that won a Pulitzer Prize among other prestigious awards for public service, including the Alfred Sloan Award for stories about highway safety. With his insistence on the localization of national news and humanization of victims beyond mere statistics, he literally brought stories home to the reader. When his story ideas were met with little enthusiasm at meetings with his news editors, Killenberg was known to say, \"Nobody's going to like this story but the readers!\" Killenberg shared his passion for local news with Globe-Democrat publisher Richard H. Amberg. Both men were highly involved in civic organizations. \"How can you tell what's going on in a community unless you're part of it?\" Amberg said.\nKillenberg and Amberg used this approach toward local news to set the newspaper apart from its competitor, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which had an international and national focus. Its publisher Joseph Pulitzer Jr. said he was \"careful to disassociate from boards and committees that could distort (his) news judgment\". The June 9, 1967, issue of Time magazine contained a story on the legendary rivalry between the two newspapers. \"It has become livelier since Killenberg, who has a keen sense of the city, took over last year as managing editor\", Time said of the Globe-Democrat, and that it was \"more brightly written than its rival and better to look at\". But it was the Globe-Democrat's level of civic engagement and coverage that sent the message to City Hall, and subsequently to the readers, that it was a force to be reckoned with. Its motto in 1967, emblazoned on its delivery trucks, was \"Fighting for St. Louis\". In 1974, Killenberg inaugurated a special edition for its previously neglected Illinois readers and established news bureaus in Edwardsville, Belleville, Alton and East St. Louis.\nSue Ann Wood, a reporter, city editor and managing editor of the Globe-Democrat, remembers Killenberg as \"mild-mannered in appearance and demeanor as Clark Kent, he never lost his temper, swore at anyone or criticized a staff member openly.\" According to Wood, he was the first to promote women, including her, to some top editor positions at the newspaper, which was uncommon in that business before the mid-1980s. Killenberg was a Catholic and Democrat working at a newspaper known for its conservative, Republican editorial page, but this did not affect his integrity as a journalist. \"He never let his religion or political views influence his decisions, and he demanded that the news pages give fair and equal coverage to all local, state and national election candidates, regardless of which ones the editorial page was endorsing\", Wood recalls.\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nAs managing editor of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Killenberg ushered reporters Al Delugach and Denny Walsh to a 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Local Investigative Specialized Reporting for exposing fraud and abuse of power within the St. Louis Steamfitters Union, Local 562. The Globe-Democrat earned prestigious awards for public service, including the Alfred Sloan Award for stories about highway safety.\nKillenberg was posthumously inducted into the Missouri Press Association's Hall of Fame on September 11, 2015.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn June 1943 he married Therese Murphy. The couple had five children and enjoyed a long and happy 64-year marriage until her death in November 2007. On May 20, 2008, Killenberg died in his home in Bel-Nor, Missouri. He was survived by three daughters, two sons, a sister, thirteen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\n\nReferences",

Jaber Āl Safa (born 13 September 1942; Arabic: اللواء الركن هشام جابر آل صفا) is a retired Lebanese Major General and a prominent military expert, political commentator, and researcher. He served extensively in the Lebanese Army, ultimately serving as military commander of Beirut. Post-retirement, he has emerged as a highly sought-after analyst on military and political affairs in Lebanon and the broader Middle East region.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJaber was born in Nabatieh, Jabal Amel, to a prominent family of notables and intellectuals descended from the Safavids. \nMahmoud-Moufid Jaber Āl Safa, his father, was a distinguished jurist and anticolonial activist. He was the son of the historian Muhammad Jaber Al Safa and the grandson of the linguist and writer, Sheikh Ahmad Rida. His mother, Julia Tayyar, a Greek Orthodox Christian, hailed from Safita and was the daughter of the notable Youssef Tayyar. Sadiq Tayyar, Julia’s brother, closely associated with Antoun Saadeh, played a pivotal role as the founding leader of the SSNP’s Safita chapter.\nAfter graduating from the Lebanese Army Military Academy, Jaber was assigned to the French postgraduate École d'application de l'infanterie in Saint-Maixent-l'École for specialized infantry training. He subsequently undertook intensive courses in public relations and information at the Defense Information School at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, in 1976. He furthered his studies in psychological warfare at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1982, Jaber earned a Master of Military Art and Science degree from the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, while simultaneously pursuing a master’s degree in mass communication at the University of Kansas.\nJaber then obtained a DEA (diplôme d'études approfondies) in contemporary history at the Sorbonne (Paris IV), Paris, France in 1993, and later in 1997, a PhD in modern political history also at the Sorbonne. His four-hour thesis defense was attended by several political figures, including French Foreign Minister Hervé de Charette, French deputy Gérard Bapt and Lebanese statesman Raymond Eddé.\n\n\nMilitary career\n1982 – He was head of the Liaison Office between the American forces (as part of the Multinational Force) and the Lebanese army during the Lebanese Civil War.\n1986 – He was Commander of the High Center for Military Sport.\n1991 – He became Lebanon's military attaché at the Lebanese Embassy in Paris.\n1993 – He taught terrorism, guerrilla warfare and unconventional warfare at the Command and Staff College in the Lebanese Army.\n1996 – He was Commander of the Lebanese Army Teaching Institute.\n1997 – In his last term in the military corps, Jaber became military governor of Beirut.\n2000 – The general retired and founded Help&Data, a public relations, lobbying and business intelligence firm based in Beirut, for he maintains excellent relationships with heads of states in West Africa and Arab countries.\n\n\nPolitical career\nJaber advocates for Lebanon's right to resist foreign aggressions, emphasizing that such resistance must be coordinated under the state's control and strictly for defensive purposes. As such, he supports the formation of a state-controlled national guard that would absorb all Lebanese non-state armed groups. \nHe has expressed opposition to unauthorized military actions by non-state armed groups, notably criticizing Hezbollah's unilateral involvement in the 2023 Gaza conflict which began on October 7. \nJaber is also a critic of the ruling sectarian political class, and a leading critic of the Israeli–Lebanese maritime border deal, which was mediated by Israeli-American envoy Amos Hochstein and resulted in Lebanon relinquishing its claims to parts of the Karish gas field.\nDuring the 2018 Lebanese general election, Jaber ran as an independent candidate facing the Hezbollah/Amal list in the South III electoral district. He headed the Al-Janūb Yastahiqq (\"The South Deserves It\") list, which placed second in terms of overall votes in the district.\nIn June 2021, following months of political deadlock over the Lebanese cabinet makeup, Jaber was suggested, as part of a French mediation effort, for the post of Foreign Minister. The proposal was described by Lebanese President Michel Aoun as \"too good to be true,\" but was rejected by Amal's leader Nabih Berri, who bears animosity towards Jaber since the February 6 Intifada, when the latter refused to defect from the Lebanese Army to join Berri. Jaber had been nominated for the posts of Foreign Minister and Defense Minister several times before by Presidents Emile Lahoud, Michel Suleiman, and Aoun, but his nomination was vetoed each time by Berri.\nJaber is regularly hosted and cited as a military and Middle East politics expert by such outlets as the Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times, CNN, the Washington Post, The Economist, BBC, France 24, RT, Sputnik,  Al Jazeera, and others.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHisham Jaber Curriculum Vitae at Help and Data (H&D), the Middle-East Center for Studies and Public Relations\n\"A decisive peace or continued uncertainty?\" August 17, 2006 CNN Your World Today interview with Jaber, Isaac Herzog and David Gergen\n\"Bomb under road may have killed Hariri\" February 19, 2005 Associated Press article citing Jaber, hosted by MSNBC\n\"Lebanon's Army\" on YouTube May 11, 2008 Al Jazeera English Inside Story interview with Jaber\n\"Help & Data aims to provide its customers with just that\"",

    "text": "Woolamai Granite is a Devonian age rock formation found on Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia. The granite outcrops at the south-eastern corner of Phillips Island at Cape Woolamai and at Pyramid rock, midway along the southern coast.\n\n\nDescription\nThe rock formation is described as biotite granite: pink coarse-grained leucocratic; contains quartz, perthite, oligoclase, biotite and accessory apatite and zircon; veins of aplite and pegmatite present locally.\n\n\nHistory of Investigation\nGranite was first recorded at Cape Woolamai on Phillip Island by Louis Freycinet in 1802 as part of the Baudin expedition to Australia.\n\nIn 1855 the explorer William Blandowski during his survey of Phillip Island noted that: The granite of Cape Woolamai is quite peculiar to that locality, and forms picturesque pyramidal peaks... This fine-grained granite is characteristic, on account of the intense green colour of the mica, and the livid flesh colour of the felspar.\nWoolamai Granite was subsequently described in 1929 as a granite mass with cream-coloured acid veins and vughs of large pink feldspar crystals, which impacts the evenness of the grain. It was also noted that the granite has a pleasant colour varying between light and dark pink, according to the amount of feldspar present. In 1942, the heavy minerals in the formation were analysed and were found to be the most acid of all Victorian granites\n\n\nStratigraphy\nAt Cape Woolamai (a tombolo system), Woolamai Granite has been described as a stock-like body, covering an area of about 10 square kilometres (4 square miles), with the stock being originally part of the Bass horst. At the northern end, the granite is overlain by thin beds of Tertiary gravels (originally derived from the granite), Tertiary basalts and recent dunes. The granite is well exposed in coastal cliffs and on the south-western coast forming spectacular cliffs. Jointing has determined the direction of gutters and clefts that have been eroded in the cliff face, and has produced the pyramidal rock stacks and large boulders that are typical of the exposed southern coastlines.\n\nWoolamai Granite makes up the basement of Pyramid rock, which consists of residual basalt, and is the largest outcrop outside of Cape Woolamai. Pyramid rock is an important example of the contact between volcanics and the pre-volcanic land surface and is one of the few locations on Phillip Island where the lava flows are absent or very thin and represents a high point on the pre-volcanic land surface.\n\n\nEconomic Resources\nA granite quarry located at Cape Woolamai, has provided Woolamai Granite for buildings. This included the base-courses and portico for the Colonial Mutual Building, built in 1893, in Melbourne.

The film was produced and distributed by Box Office Attractions Co., the predecessor to Fox Film.\n\n\nPlot\nAccording to a film magazine, \"'The Idler' is Mark Cross, a young man of good family, who in a wild fit of daredeviltry has emigrated from London to the far west. John Harding, also well-born of wealthy parents, but disinherited, and a poor clerk, is also seeking his fortune in the gold fields. One day Harding receives a letter from a firm of London solicitors informing him that his father has died and that he is now Sir John Harding, Bart. He sets out at once to make his preparations for his return to civilization and to take up the station in life that is rightfully his. But that very day he becomes involved in a quarrel with Felix Strong, the young brother of a miner named Simeon Strong, and Felix is shot accidentally during the dispute. Harding is accused of murder, but flees to England in time to escape the vengeance of a posse, headed by Simeon Strong, who is determined to avenge his brother.\nYears after in London, Harding, who has married the girl both he and Cross were in love with before they emigrated, comes face to face with Cross and Strong, who have become partners and have 'struck it rich.' In order to win Lady Harding for his own Cross allows the evil side of his nature to get the upper hand of him and plots to have Strong kill Sir John in a duel. Strong slaps Harding in the face in the foyer of the opera house in order that he may involve him in 'an affair of honor' and avenge his brother's death by killing Harding. Cross in the meantime lures Lady Harding to his rooms where Sir John comes to seek her. She hides in Mark Cross' bedroom, but reveals herself at a dramatic moment when Harding, shouting 'Curse you, I'll kill you!' springs at Cross' throat. Her splendid nature, as shown in her denunciation of both men, one as a husband without faith in his wife and the other as the would-be destroyer of a home, overcomes them with shame. They shake hands and Mark, parting forever with Lady Harding, orders his valet to pack his things for he is off 'on a long trail.'\"\n\n\nCast\nCharles Richman as Mark Cross\nCatherine Countiss as Lady Helen Merryweather Harding\nWalter Hitchcock as Sir John Harding\nClaire Whitney as Kate Merryweather\nStuart Holmes as Simeon Strong\nMaude Turner Gordon as Inez\nW.

    "title": "Clonorchis sinensis",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=663302",
    "text": "Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is a liver fluke belonging to the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. It infects fish-eating mammals, including humans. In humans, it infects the common bile duct and gall bladder, feeding on bile. It was discovered by British physician James McConnell at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1874. The first description was given by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it Distoma sinense. The fluke passes its lifecycle in three different hosts, namely freshwater snail as first intermediate hosts, freshwater fish as second intermediate host, and mammals as definitive hosts.\nEndemic to Asia and Russia, C. sinensis is the most prevalent human fluke in Asia and third-most in the world. It is still actively transmitted in Korea, China, Vietnam, and Russia. Most infections (about 85%) occur in China. The infection, called clonorchiasis, generally appears as jaundice, indigestion, biliary inflammation, bile duct obstruction, and even liver cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatic carcinoma.\nAs a major causative agent of bile duct cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified C. sinensis as a group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009.\n\n\nDiscovery\nThe symptoms of C. sinensis infection (clonorchiasis) have been known from ancient times in China. The earliest record is from corpses buried in 278 BC at Jiangling County of Hubei Province and the Warring States tomb of the western Han Dynasty. The parasite was discovered only in 1874, though,  by James McConnell, a professor of pathology and resident physician at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta. He recovered the fluke from a 20-year-old Chinese carpenter who died on 8 September 1874. On autopsy, he observed that the corpse had a swollen liver (hepatomegaly) and distended bile ducts, which he noted were blocked by \"small, dark, vermicular-looking bodies.\" He recovered the vermicules (worms) and compared them with known flukes Fasciola hepatica and Distoma lanceolatum. He concluded that the new fluke was significantly different. He published his observations in the 21 August 1875 issue of The Lancet.\nThe formal scientific description was published in 1875 by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it Distoma sinense. In 1876, Rudolf Leuckart named it Distomum spithulatum. Kenso Ishisaka recorded the first case of clonorchiasis in Japan in 1877. McConnell identified another infection in a Chinese cook from Hong Kong in 1878. Erwin von Baelz reported the presence of similar flukes from an autopsy of a Japanese patient at Tokyo University in 1883. He recorded two different forms, naming the smaller, more pathogenic form as Distoma hepatis endemicum sive perniciosum, and the larger, less pathogenic form as D.h.e.s. innocuum. Isao Ijima correctly redescribed them as the same species, but still wrongly renamed it Distoma endemicum in 1886. When a new genus Opisthorchis was created by Émile Blanchard in 1895, Cobbold's species name D. sinense was moved to the new genus because of close similarities with the other members. Further analyses by Arthur Looss, though,  showed significant differences from the general features of Opisthorchis, particularly on the highly branched testes. He created a new genus Clonorchis (from Greek klon meaning \"twig/branch\", orkhis meaning \"testis\") in 1907. Similar to Baelz, he differentiated the larger species as Clonorchis sinensis, which is mostly found in China, and the smaller species as C. endemicum, found mostly in Japan. In 1912, Harujiro Kobayashi corrected the classification that the differences in sizes were due to the nature of the host and intensity of infection, and had nothing to do with the biology. Hence, he supported only C. sinensis. Kobayashi was also the first to discover fish as the second intermediate host in 1911. Masatomo Muto discovered snails as the first intermediate host in 1918.\n\n\nDescription\n\nAn adult C. sinensis is a flattened (dorsoventrally) and leaf-shaped fluke. The body is slightly elongated and slender, measuring 15–20 mm in length and 3–4 mm in width. It narrows at the anterior region into a small opening called the oral sucker, which act as the mouth. From the mouth, two tubes called caeca run the length of body. They are the digestive and excretory tracts. The posterior end is broad and blunt. A poorly developed ventral sucker lies behind the oral sucker, at about one-fourth of the body length from the anterior end. A common genital pore opens just in front of it. As a hermaphrodite, it has both male and female reproductive organs. A single rounded ovary is at the centre of the body, and two testes are towards the posterior end. The uterus from the ovary, and seminal ducts from the testes, meet and open at the genital pore. The testes are highly branched. Other highly branched organs called vitellaria (or vitelline glands) are distributed on either side of the body.\nThe eggs are similar to those of other related flukes such as Opisthorchis viverrini and O. felineus, and are often confused during diagnosis. They small and oval in shape, measuring about 30 x 15 μm in diameter. They are sharply curved and with a clear convex operculum towards the narrower end. At the broader end is a stem-shaped knob. The miracidium can be seen inside the fertilised egg.\n\n\nLife cycle\n\n\nProduction of eggs\nThe eggs of a C. sinensis are released through the biliary tract, and excreted out along with the faeces. The eggs are embryonated and contain the larvae called miracidia. Unlike most other flukes in which the miracidia undergo development and swim in water to infect suitable hosts, the eggs of C. sinensis are simply deposited in water. The eggs are then eaten by snails.\n\n\nFirst intermediate host\nFreshwater snail Parafossarulus manchouricus often serves as a first intermediate host for C. sinensis in China, Japan, Korea, and Russia. Other snail hosts include Alocinma longicornis, Bithynia longicornis, Bithynia fuchsiana, Bithynia misella, Parafossarulus anomalospiralis, Melanoides tuberculata, Semisulcospira cancellata, Koreoleptoxis amurensis, Semisulcospira libertina, and Assiminea lutea in China; and Melanoides tuberculata in Vietnam.\nOnce inside of the snail body, the embryonic membrane is dissolved by the snail's digestive enzymes, so the miracidium hatches from the egg. The ciliated miracidium can move about, penetrating the intestine, and enters the haemocoel and digestive gland. Here, it undergoes metamorphosis into a sporocyst. The sporocyst gives rise to small larvae called rediae. The rediae burst out from the sporocyst to become the next-stage larvae called cercaria. This system of asexual reproduction allows for an exponential multiplication of cercaria individuals from one miracidium. This aids the fluke in reproduction, because it enables the miracidium to capitalize on one-chance occasion of passively being eaten by a snail before the egg dies. The mature cercariae bore out of the snail body into the freshwater environment. However, they are nonfeeding and must find a fish host within 2–3 days, otherwise they die.\nThe cercariae of C. sinensis are different from those of other flukes in that they do not swim. Instead, they initially hang upside down in the water, and then sink to the bottom. They rise to the water surface to resume their initial position, and the movement is repeated again. They attack fish when they feel any disturbance.\n\n\nSecond intermediate host\nWhen they detect fish, the cercariae attach themselves on the scales using their suckers. Boring their way into the fish's body, they penetrate into the fish muscle within 6 to 13 minutes. Within an hour of penetration, they develop hard coverings called cysts and become metacercariae. This protective cyst is useful when the fish muscle is consumed. The metacercariae gradually develop and become infective to their next hosts after 3 to 4 weeks.\nThe common second intermediate hosts are freshwater fish such as common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), crucian carp (Carassius carassius), goldfish (Carassius auratus), Pseudorasbora parva, Abbottina rivularis, Hemiculter spp., Opsariichthys spp., Rhodeus spp., Sarcocheilichthys spp., Zacco platypus, Nipponocypris temminckii, and pond smelt (Hypomesus olidus). In China, 102 species of fish and four species of shrimp are known to be the intermediate hosts. In Korea, 40 species of freshwater fish are recorded as hosts. Seven species of fish are known as hosts in Russia.\n\n\nDefinitive host\nHumans are the major definitive hosts. Infection occurs when raw or undercooked fish contaminated with the metacercariae is eaten. The cysts of the metacercariae are gradually digested by the human gastric acids, and upon reaching the small intestines, the entire cyst is lost. The free metacercariae penetrate the intestinal mucosa and enter the bile ducts. Migration into the bile ducts takes 1–2 days. They start feeding on the bile secreted from the liver, and gradually grow. They become adults in about a month, and start laying eggs. The average lifespan of an adult fluke is 30 years. An individual fluke can produce 4,000 eggs in a day.\nOther definitive hosts are fish-eating mammals such as dogs, cats, rats, pigs, badgers, weasels, camels, and Water Buffalo.\n\n\nPrevalence\nC. sinensis is estimated to be the third-most prevalent worm parasite in the world. It is endemic to Russia, Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam. In Asia it is the most prevalent human trematode, with over 15 million people estimated to be infected and 200 million people at constant risk of infection. China has the highest incidence with about 13 million infections, accounting for 85% of the total cases.\nInfection rates are generally higher in men, fishermen, farmers, businessmen, and catering staff. The infection is more serious in adults aged 40–60 and the elderly. More cases occur in low- or middle-class countries, increasing the disease burden and creating economic problems. Clonorchiasis causes 275,370 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) globally. The calculated economic burden for treating clonorchiasis-related ailments in the Guangdong Province of China alone was $200 million by 2010.\nThe type of freshwater fishes and shrimp that are infected by C. sinensis contributes to the prevalence of infection. Commonly eaten fishes (e.g. C. idellus, C. auratus, H. nobilis, C. carpio, H. molitrix, and M. anguillicaudatus) were found to have the metacercariae when sampled from lakes, rivers, and markets. In total, almost 31 types of freshwater fish and shrimp were found to carry the parasite.\n\n\nEffects on human health\n\nDwelling in the bile ducts, C. sinensis induces an inflammatory reaction, epithelial hyperplasia, and sometimes even cholangiocarcinoma, the incidence of which is raised in fluke-infested areas.\nOne adverse effect of Clonorchis spp. is the possibility for the adult metacercaria to consume all bile created in the liver, which would inhibit the host human from digesting food, especially fats. Another possibility is obstruction of the bile duct by the parasite or its eggs, leading to biliary obstruction and cholangitis (specifically oriental cholangitis).\nUnusual cases of liver abscesses due to clonorchiasis have been reported. Liver abscesses may be seen even without dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts.\n\n\nSymptoms\nWhile normally asymptomatic, most pathological manifestations result from inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the biliary ducts.  The acute phase consists of abdominal pain with associated nausea and diarrhea.  Long-standing infections consist of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and jaundice.  The pathology of long-standing infections consist of bile stasis, obstruction, bacterial infections, inflammation, periductal fibrosis, and hyperplasia.  Development of cholangiocarcinoma is progressive.\n\n\nDiagnosis and treatment\nInfection is detected mainly on identification of eggs by microscopic demonstration in faeces or in duodenal aspirate, but other sophisticated methods have been developed, such as ELISA, which has become the most important clinical technique. Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using PCR, real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which are highly sensitive and specific. \nTypical imaging features center around imaging of the liver with CT, ultrasound, or MRI for detection of primary biliary cirrhosis. Traits that raise suspicion for the infection include intra- and extrahepatic dilatation and structures with intraductal pigmented stones, usually in the absence of gallstones and with regions of segmental liver atrophy, particularly the lateral aspect of the left hepatic lobe. Also, reduced arborization of peripheral ducts is seen. A full 5% of chronic infections go on to develop cholangiocarcinoma.\nDrugs used to treat infestation include triclabendazole, praziquantel, bithionol, albendazole, levamisole, and mebendazole. However, benzimidazoles are very weak as a vermicide. As with other trematodes, praziquantel is the drug of choice. Lately, tribendimidine has been acknowledged as an effective and safe drug.\n\n\nGenetics\nC. sinensis has 28 pairs of chromosomes (2n=56) in a cell. The chromosome pairs can be categorized into two groups: 8 large pairs and 20 small. Structural variations are seen between those from different countries. The draft genome sequence was published in 2011. The total genome size is estimated to be 516 to 580 MB, and the GC content was calculated as about 43.85%. About 16,000 genes are predicted, out of which 13,634 genes have been identified.\n\n\nSee also\nList of parasites (human)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nFreeman, Scott (2002).

    "summary": "Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is a liver fluke belonging to the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. It infects fish-eating mammals, including humans. In humans, it infects the common bile duct and gall bladder, feeding on bile. It was discovered by British physician James McConnell at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1874. The first description was given by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it Distoma sinense. The fluke passes its lifecycle in three different hosts, namely freshwater snail as first intermediate hosts, freshwater fish as second intermediate host, and mammals as definitive hosts.\nEndemic to Asia and Russia, C. sinensis is the most prevalent human fluke in Asia and third-most in the world. It is still actively transmitted in Korea, China, Vietnam, and Russia. Most infections (about 85%) occur in China. The infection, called clonorchiasis, generally appears as jaundice, indigestion, biliary inflammation, bile duct obstruction, and even liver cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatic carcinoma.\nAs a major causative agent of bile duct cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified C. sinensis as a group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009.",

    "text": "Semax is a medication which is used in Russia and Eastern Europe for the treatment of a broad range of conditions like brain trauma but predominantly for its claimed nootropic, neuroprotective, and neurorestorative effects.\nThe mechanism of action of Semax is unknown. It might interact with certain melanocortin receptors or inhibit enkephalinase enzymes. Chemically, Semax is a peptide and a synthetic analogue of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).\nSemax was first described by 1991. Although used as a prescription drug in Russia and Eastern Europe, Semax has not been evaluated, approved for use, or marketed in most other countries. The drug is widely sold by online vendors and used as a purported nootropic (cognitive enhancer).\n\n\nMedical uses\n\nSemax has undergone extensive study in Russia and is on the Russian List of Vital & Essential Drugs approved by the Russian Federation government on 7 December 2011. Medical uses for Semax include treatment of stroke, transient ischemic attack, memory and cognitive disorders, peptic ulcers, optic nerve disease, and to boost the immune system.\n\n\nPharmacology\n\n\nPharmacodynamics\nIn animals, Semax rapidly elevates the levels and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its signaling receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus, and rapidly activates serotonergic and dopaminergic brain systems. Accordingly, it has been found to produce antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects, attenuate the behavioral effects of exposure to chronic stress, and potentiate the locomotor activity produced by D-amphetamine. As such, it has been suggested that Semax may be effective in the treatment of depression.\nThough the exact mechanism of action of Semax is unclear, there is evidence that it may act through melanocortin receptors. Specifically, there is a report of Semax competitively antagonizing the action of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) at the MC4 and MC5 receptors in both in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions, indicating that it may act as an antagonist or partial agonist of these receptors. (&alpha-MSH acts as a full agonist of all five melanocortin receptors).  Semax did not antagonize α-MSH at the MC3 receptor, though this receptor could still be a target of the drug. As for the MC1 and MC2 receptors, they were not assayed.\nIn addition to actions at receptors, Semax, as well as a related peptide drug, Selank, have been found to inhibit enzymes involved in the degradation of enkephalins and other endogenous regulatory peptides (IC50 = 10 μM), though the clinical significance of this property is uncertain.\n\n\nPharmacokinetics\nAs a peptide, Semax has poor oral bioavailability and hence is administered parenterally as a nasal spray or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nChemistry\nSemax is a heptapeptide and synthetic analogue of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), ACTH (4-10), of the following amino acid sequence: Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro (MEHFPGP in single-letter form).\n\n\nHistory\nSemax was first described in scientific literature by 1991.\n\n\nSociety and culture\n\n\nEtymology\nSemax is composed of seven amino acid residues: Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro (MEHFPGP), which is reflected in the name - from an abbreviation of \"seven amino acids\"—in Russian: СЕМь АминоКиСлот—СЕМАКС.\n\n\nSee also\nSelank\nAdamax\n9-Methyl-β-carboline (9-Me-BC)\nBromantane\nList of Russian drugs\n\n\nReferences",

'Long Way to Go' was not written in such a nice way. This happened to be an experience that I had with somebody that I did very much love, who... we had been broken up for a long time before, a year before, and I had just finished Rock a Little, and I had walked into my house with Rock a Little under my arm, an acetate... the phone rang, and it was him, and he wanted me to drive two and a half hours to wherever it was that he lived... and I was very tired, and it was very late, it was like 3:30, 4 in the morning, and I turned around to somebody that was living in my house at that time, and I said, 'should I go?' And they said, 'well, it's a pretty long way to go to say goodbye again... And so I went back and forth and back and forth in my mind, and finally he said to me 'I'm sending a limousine for you.' And I said alright. \nAnd so... chump that I was, I got in the car and drove down there and played the record for him, and he kept it. Which I will never forgive him for. He kept my first acetate disc. And I think the last thing that I did say to him was, 'you know, it's a real long way to go to say goodbye again. I thought we already did that. Have fun, tell the world.' Which basically means words we don't say over the radio. Goodbye. Forever this time. Don't ever call me again. I mean, he put me in the car, and I was hysterical in tears, and I cried all the way home, and I said, 'I will never, ever, ever put myself in that position again. Nobody will ever do that to me again. As much as I loved him, I will never let that happen again.\"\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nWeekly charts\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=27120",
    "text": "The Sorbian languages (Upper Sorbian: serbska rěč, Lower Sorbian: serbska rěc) are the Upper Sorbian language and Lower Sorbian language, two closely related and partially mutually intelligible languages spoken by the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethno-cultural minority in the Lusatia region of Eastern Germany. They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czech–Slovak. Historically, the languages have also been known as Wendish (named after the Wends, the earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or Lusatian. Their collective ISO 639-2 code is wen.\nThe two Sorbian languages, each having its own literary standard, are Upper Sorbian (hornjoserbsce), spoken by about 20,000–25,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (dolnoserbski), spoken by about 7,000 people in Brandenburg. The area where the two languages are spoken is known as Lusatia (Łužica in Upper Sorbian, Łužyca in Lower Sorbian, or Lausitz in German).\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter the settlement of the formerly Germanic territories (the part largely corresponding to the former East Germany) by the Slavic ancestors of the Sorbs in the 5th and 6th centuries CE, the Sorbian language (or its predecessors) had been in use in much of what was the southern half of Eastern Germany for several centuries. The language still had its stronghold in (Upper and Lower) Lusatia, where it enjoys national protection and fostering to the present day. For people living in the medieval Northern Holy Roman Empire and its precursors, especially for the Saxons, the Wends (Wende) were heterogeneous groups and tribes of Slavic peoples living near Germanic settlement areas, in the area west of the River Oder, an area later entitled Germania Slavica, settled by the Polabian Slav tribes in the north and by others, such as the Sorbs and the Milceni, further south (see Sorbian March).\nThe exact origin of the Sorbian language is uncertain. While some linguists consider it to be a transitory language between Lechitic and other non-Lechitic languages of West Slavic languages, others like Heinz Schuster-Šewc consider it a separate dialectical group of Proto-Slavic which is a mixture of Proto-Lechitic and South Slavic languages. According to him, \"Sorbian spoken today in Upper and Lower Lusatia is what remains of an earlier extensive Old Sorbian dialect area between the Elbe/Saale rivers in the west and the Bober/Queis rivers in the east\".\nFurthermore, while some consider it a single language which later diverged to two major dialects, others consider these dialects two separate languages. There exist significant differences in phonology, morphology, and lexicon between them. Several characteristics in Upper Sorbian language indicate a close proximity to Czech language which again are absent in Lower Sorbian language. The Upper Sorbian is considered as representative of the old \"Sorbian proper\", while the Lower Sorbian would be a transitional hybrid language more akin to the Lechitic languages. According to some researchers the archaeological data cannot confirm the thesis about a single linguistic group yet supports the claim about two separated ethno-cultural groups with different ancestry whose respective territories correspond to Tornow-type ceramics (Lower Sorbian language) and Leipzig-type ceramics (Upper Sorbian language), both derivations of Prague culture.\nOutside Lusatia, the Sorbian language has been superseded by German. From the 13th century on, the language suffered official discrimination. Bible translations into Sorbian provided the foundations for its writing system.\nToday, around 60,000 Sorbs live in Germany, about 40,000 in Saxony and 20,000 in Brandenburg. Since national affiliation is not officially recorded in Germany, and identification with the Sorbian nationality is voluntary, the exact number is only an estimate. The number of active Sorbian speakers is likely lower. Unlike Upper Sorbian, Lower Sorbian is considered critically endangered. According to projections, around 7,000 people actively speak Lower Sorbian, which could become extinct within 20 to 30 years, while around 13,000 speak Upper Sorbian. According to language experts, Upper Sorbian is expected to survive into the 21st century.\nCurrently, Sorbian is taught at 25 primary schools and several secondary schools. At the Lower Sorbian Gymnasium in Cottbus and the Upper Sorbian Gymnasium in Bautzen, it is compulsory. In many primary and Sorbian schools, lessons are held in the Sorbian language. The daily newspaper Serbske Nowiny is published in Upper Sorbian, and the weekly Nowy Casnik in Lower Sorbian. In addition, the religious weekly journals Katolski Posoł and Pomhaj Bóh are published. The cultural magazine Rozhlad appears monthly, along with one children's magazine each in Upper and Lower Sorbian (Płomjo and Płomje, respectively), as well as the educational magazine Serbska šula.\n\nMitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) and Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB) also broadcast monthly half-hour TV magazines in Sorbian, as well as several hours of daily radio programming—the Sorbian radio. Wikipedia editions exist in both written forms of the Sorbian language.\n\n\nGeographic distribution\n\nIn Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages. In the officially defined Sorbian settlement area, both languages are recognized as second official languages next to German.\nThe city of Bautzen in Upper Lusatia is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, \"Bautzen/Budyšin\".\nTo the north, the city of Cottbus/Chóśebuz is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian; there, too, bilingual signs are found.\nSorbian was also spoken in the small Sorbian (\"Wendish\") settlement of Serbin in Lee County, Texas, however no speakers remain there. Until 1949, newspapers were published in Sorbian. The local dialect was heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and English.\nThe German terms \"Wends\" (Wenden) and \"Wendish\" (wendisch/Wendisch) once denoted \"Slav(ic)\" generally; they are today mostly replaced by \"Sorbs\" (Sorben) and \"Sorbian\" (sorbisch/Sorbisch) with reference to Sorbian communities in Germany.\n\n\nEndangered status\nThe use of Sorbian languages has been contracting for a number of years. The loss of Sorbian language use in emigrant communities, such as in Serbin, Texas, has not been surprising. But within the Sorbian homelands, there has also been a decrease in Sorbian identity and language use. In 2008, Sorbs protested three kinds of pressures against Sorbs: \"(1.) the destruction of Sorbian and German-Sorbian villages as a result of lignite mining; (2.) the cuts in the network of Sorbian schools in Saxony; (3.) the reduction of financial resources for the Sorbian institutions by central government.\"\nA study of Upper Sorbian found a number of trends that go against language vitality. There are policies that have led to \"unstable diglossia\". There has been a loss of language domains in which speakers have the option to use either language, and there is a disruption of the patterns by which the Sorbian language has traditionally been transmitted to the next generation. Also, there is no strong written tradition and there is not a broadly accepted formal standardized form of the language(s). There is a perception of the loss of language rights, and there are negative attitudes towards the languages and their speakers.\n\n\nLinguistic features\nBoth Upper and Lower Sorbian have the dual for nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs; very few living Indo-European languages retain this as a productive feature of the grammar. For example, the word ruka is used for one hand, ruce for two hands, and ruki for more than two hands. As with most Slavic languages, Sorbian uses no articles.\n\n\nGrammar\nThe Sorbian languages are declined in six or seven cases:\n\nNominative\nAccusative\nGenitive\nDative\nLocative\nInstrumental\nVocative (Upper Sorbian only)\n\nIn Lower Sorbian, the vocative is preserved only in a few fossilized forms.\nNotably, in addition to the singular and plural, the dual number (used for two items), inherited from Old Slavic, has also been preserved.\n\nSingular: ruka (\"hand\")\nDual: ruce (\"two hands\")\nPlural: ruki (\"more than two hands\")\nIn contrast to other West Slavic languages (Czech, Slovak, Polish, Kashubian), Upper Sorbian literary language and some dialects have preserved the synthetic past tense (aorist, imperfect) to this day. This form was also common in Lower Sorbian literary language, but over the course of the 20th century, it has become increasingly rare and is hardly used today.\nLower Sorbian, however, has retained the supine (a variant of the infinitive used after verbs of motion), e.g.: njok spaś (\"I don't want to sleep\") versus źi spat (\"go to sleep\")\nLess demanding written texts in Sorbian can generally be understood by speakers of West Slavic languages.\n\n\nVocabulary comparison\nThe following is selected vocabulary from the two Sorbian languages compared with other Slavic languages.\n\n\nDifferences between the two written languages\nThere are several differences between the two written languages, Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian, particularly in the alphabet.\n\n\nPhonetic differences\n\n\nIn the consonants\nThe two written languages differ significantly in terms of consonants. For example, the letter ć has been alphabetically placed after č in Upper Sorbian since 2005.\n\n\nVowels\nBoth Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian have eight vowels.\n\n\nDifferent number of syllables\nIn some words, the number of syllables differs because Upper Sorbian has shortened them here, similarly to Czech.\n\nDifferences in declension\nUpper Sorbian have seven cases and Lower Sorbian have six cases.\nDifferences in case government (i.e., which case follows which preposition or verb)\n\n\nDifferences in gender\n\n\nDifferences in conjugation\n\n\nDifferences in vocabulary\n\n\nSimilarities\n\n\nPhonetic Similarities\n\n\nConsonantal Parallels\n\n\nVocalic Parallels\n\n\nGrammatical Similarities\nPreservation of the dual (grammatical number for two items)\nMerger of the locative dual with the dative/instrumental dual\nStress on the first syllable\nBroad generalization of the genitive plural ending -ow for nouns\n\n\nPhonological development of Sorbian\n\n\nCommon developments and developments only in Lower Sorbian\nAs in Polish and Czech, the two Proto-Slavic reduced vowels ь and ъ in Sorbian developed early into e in stressed position. Full vowels, which stood in syllables before a reduced vowel in unstressed position, were lengthened after the fall of the reduced vowels. Over time, the opposition of short and long vowels was lost, and words were generally stressed on the first syllable; in Proto-Slavic the stress had been free. This development occurred under the influence of German and has a parallel in Czech.\nThe nasal vowels in Sorbian disappeared according to Jerzy Nalepa in the second half of the 12th century under Czech influence.\nThe affricate ʒ was, as in most other Slavic languages, simplified to z, cf. mjeza (Polish: miedza) (“border”).\nAs in Polish and originally also in Kashubian, the soft dentals ť and ď in Sorbian changed into the affricates ć and dź. This transition already occurred in the 13th century. In Lower Sorbian, these affricates later also lost their plosive component: ć > ś, dź > ź, except after dental spirants: rjeśaz “chain”, daś “to give”, kosć “bone”, źiwy “wild”, měź “copper”, pozdźej “later” (compared to Upper Sorbian rjećaz, dać, kosć, diźwi, mjedź, pozdźe). This change occurred in the mid-16th century in the western dialects and 100 years later in the eastern dialects, whereby the central transitional dialects as well as the dialects of Muskau and Schleife were not affected.\nSoft c', z', s' were hardened in Sorbian. When the sound i followed them, it changed to y: ducy “to go”, syła “strength”, zyma “winter” (compared to Czech jdoucí, síla, zima). This change probably took place in the early 15th century. A similar change (only in Lower Sorbian) occurred at the beginning of the 16th century with the soft č', ž', š': cysty “clean”, šyja “neck”, žywy “alive” (cf. Upper Sorbian čisty, šija, žiwy).\nIn the mid-16th century, č became c: cas “time”, pcoła “bee” (from čas, pčoła). This change did not occur only in the ending -učki and after spirants. In addition, č appears in loanwords and onomatopoeic words.\nAfter p, t, and k, the sounds r and r' in Sorbian became ř and ř'. In Lower Sorbian, ř developed further to š and ř' to ć (later ś): pšawy “right”, tśi “three”.\nAs in Polish, the voiceless ł in Lower Sorbian became bilabial w, with the first written records dating from the 17th century, and the soft ľ adopted the “European” alveolar articulation (as in German) except before front vowels.\nThe sound w in Sorbian disappeared in initial clusters gw- and xw- (Proto-Slavic gvozdj > gozd “dry forest”, Proto-Slavic xvoščj > chošć “horsetail”), at the beginning of a word before a consonant, and after a consonant before u. This process probably began before the 13th century and ended in the 16th century. The soft “w” in the middle of words in intervocalic position and before consonants as well as at the end of words changed to “j”: rukajca “glove” (Polish: rękawica), mužoju / mužeju “man” (Polish: mężowi), kšej “blood” (Polish: krew).\nThe sound e changed into a in the position after soft consonants and before hard consonants: brjaza “birch”, kolaso “wheel”, pjac “oven”, lažaś “lie”, pjas “dog” (cf. brěza, koleso, pjec, ležeć', pos). This change was completed in the mid-17th century and again did not affect the dialects of Muskau and Schleife.\nPhonological developments Only in Upper Sorbian\nIn some positions, metathesis of or, ol, er, and el occurred in Upper Sorbian: in positions between consonants, these became ro, lo, re, and le, while at the beginning of a word, or, ol became either ra-, la- or ro-, lo- depending on the stress.\nAs in Polish and Czech, the two Proto-Slavic reduced vowels in stressed position changed to e in Sorbian as well. Unstressed full vowels in the syllable before the reduced vowel were lengthened with the disappearance of the reduced vowels. Long ē and ō in stressed position became mid vowels in Upper Sorbian, which are written in the modern Upper Sorbian literary language as ě and ó. Proto-Slavic ē merged with ě. Later, in the 19th century, ó became o before reflexive pronouns and labials: mloko – w mlóce (“milk” – “in milk”). Over time, the contrast between long and short vowels was lost.\nSyllabic ṛ became or in Upper Sorbian: *kъrmiti > kṛmiti > kormić (“to feed”), and similarly, ṛʼ before voiceless dentals also became or: *pьrstъ > pṛʼstъ > porst (“finger”), while in other positions it softened to je: *prštěp > pṛʼštěp > pjeršćeń (“ring”). Syllabic ḷ became oł: *dъlgъ > dḷgъ > dołh (“debt”), or before voiceless dentals became ḷʼ: *rlnj > pḷʼpъ > połny (“full”), and in other positions became el: *vjlk > vḷʼkъ > wjelk (“wolf”).\nThe nasal vowels in Sorbian disappeared, according to J. Nalepa, in the second half of the 12th century under Czech influence, while in Polish they remain to this day. The vowel a between two soft consonants became e in Upper Sorbian: jeje (“egg”), žel (“compassion”). Written evidence suggests this occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in some Upper Sorbian dialects, it has not occurred at all.\nJust as in Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian, the plosive g turned into the fricative h in Upper Sorbian. The g sound only appears in relatively recent loanwords or expressive words in Upper Sorbian. J. Nalepa dates the beginning of the shift g > h to the late 13th century, while J. Stone places it in the 12th century, stating that the change spread from south to north. Gunter Schaarschmidt, based on texts and toponyms, assumes that the transition occurred via the intermediate sound γ (as in Belarusian) and that this sound γ already existed in Upper Sorbian in the 12th to 14th centuries. Later, h was mostly lost in Upper Sorbian, except before vowels and after consonants. In most dialects and in Upper Sorbian colloquial language, h also disappeared in intervocalic position. The first written evidence of this dates back to the beginning of the 17th century.\nAs mentioned, in the 13th century the soft dentals ť and ď in Sorbian became the affricates ć and dź: tělo > ćěło (“body”), devęt > dźewjeć (“nine”). In Upper Sorbian, ć later merged with č, and dź with the allophone č – dž, which led to their phonologization. The Proto-Slavic combinations šč and ždž were first simplified to šť and žď respectively, and then by affrication of ť and ď to šć and ždź. Soft cʼ, zʼ, and sʼ were hardened, and the following i and ě changed to y: Proto-Slavic cělъ > cyły, Proto-Slavic sila > syła, Proto-Slavic zima > zyma. After p, t, k, the sounds r and rʼ in Sorbian changed to ř and řʼ; in Upper Sorbian, this sound later became š. Still later, the combination tš was simplified to cʼ.\nThe spirant x in Upper Sorbian changed to aspirated k (kʰ) at the beginning of a word before a vowel, and elsewhere to unaspirated k. This change is already evident in texts from the 16th century, though it is not reflected in modern Upper Sorbian orthography. Similar to Polish, hard ł was replaced with w in Upper Sorbian (first evidence from the 17th century), except in the northeastern dialects, while soft lʼ assumed a “European” (alveolar) articulation (like in German), except when followed by a front vowel.\nThe sound w dropped in Sorbian in the initial clusters gw- and xw-, e.g. Proto-Slavic gvozdj > hózdź (“nail”) and Proto-Slavic hvogsttъ > chróst (“horsetail”), specifically at the beginning of a word before a consonant, and after consonants before u. This process likely began before the 13th century and ended in the 16th century. The soft wʼ in the middle of a word in intervocalic position and before a consonant, as well as at the end of a word, became j: prajić (“to speak”) (Polish: prawić), mužej (“man”) (Polish: mężowi), krej (“blood”) (Polish: krew).\nBefore soft consonants at the end of a word or elsewhere before other consonants (and before originally soft dental affricates and spirants also in other positions), an epenthetic j appeared in Upper Sorbian. When j follows e or ě, the preceding consonant becomes voiceless. The consonant ń is also hardened before other consonants. This change is not reflected in the spelling: dźeń [ˈd͡ʒejn] (“day”), ležeć [ˈlejʒet͡ʃ] (“to lie”), tež [tejʃ] (“also”), chěža [ˈkʰejʒa] (“house”). This epenthetic j likely already appeared in Upper Sorbian at the end of the 16th century.\nThe replacement of the dental r by the uvular r in several Upper Sorbian dialects is attributed to German influence.\n\n\nSee also\nSorbian alphabet\nList of Sorbian-language writers\nLow Lusatian German\nWhite Serbia\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nWerner, Eduard.

    "summary": "The Sorbian languages (Upper Sorbian: serbska rěč, Lower Sorbian: serbska rěc) are the Upper Sorbian language and Lower Sorbian language, two closely related and partially mutually intelligible languages spoken by the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethno-cultural minority in the Lusatia region of Eastern Germany. They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czech–Slovak. Historically, the languages have also been known as Wendish (named after the Wends, the earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or Lusatian. Their collective ISO 639-2 code is wen.\nThe two Sorbian languages, each having its own literary standard, are Upper Sorbian (hornjoserbsce), spoken by about 20,000–25,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (dolnoserbski), spoken by about 7,000 people in Brandenburg. The area where the two languages are spoken is known as Lusatia (Łužica in Upper Sorbian, Łužyca in Lower Sorbian, or Lausitz in German).",

    "title": "Rapid response system",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=40831614",
    "text": "A rapid response system (RRS) is a system implemented in many hospitals designed to identify and respond to patients with early signs of clinical deterioration on non-intensive care units with the goal of preventing respiratory or cardiac arrest.  A rapid response system consists of two clinical components, an afferent component, an efferent component, and two organizational components – process improvement and administrative.\nThe afferent component consists of identifying the input early warning signs that alert a response from the efferent component, the rapid response team. Rapid response teams are those specific to the US, the equivalent in the UK are called critical care outreach teams, and in Australia are known as medical emergency teams, though the term rapid response teams is often used as a generic term. In the rapid response system of a hospital's pediatric wards a prequel to the rapid response team known as a rover team is sometimes used that continuously monitors the children in its care.\n\n\nTriggers\n\nThe afferent component, or identification limb, also known as the track-and-trigger system, uses standardized tools to track early signs of reversible clinical deterioration and trigger a call to, and response from the efferent component, or response limb. Examples of afferent tools include single-parameter calling criteria and multi-parameter early warning scores. These tools can predict clinical deterioration based upon the patient’s medical condition, and detect deterioration through the patient’s state such as a high respiratory rate. Single-parameter calling criteria require that only one criterion be met before activating the efferent component. Criteria may be based on vital signs, diagnoses, events, subjective observations, or concerns of the patient. Multi-parameter tools are more complex in that they combine several parameters into a single early warning score (EWS).\n\n\nFamily activation\nMETs were originally activated exclusively by bedside clinicians in need of emergency assistance. Recently, many hospitals have begun to allow families to activate a MET if they feel the care team is not adequately addressing their concerns. The team may differ in composition from the clinician-activated MET such as including a patient relations coordinator.\nFamily-activated METs were put in place as a response to the preventable death of Josie King in 2001. King was 18-months old when she died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, from medical errors and delays in escalation of care despite her family’s concerns. As a result of the highly publicized death, the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh began a program called Condition HELP that allows families to activate a MET. Families receive training on Condition HELP when the patient is admitted and are asked to voice concerns to their care team before activating the MET.\nThe Ryan's Rule initiative was trialled in some public hospitals in Queensland, Australia in 2013. It allows patients, their carers, friends and family to initiate a graduated escalation of care if they are concerned that the patient is not improving as expected. In 2016, Ryan's Rule was made available across all public hospitals in the Queensland Health system. Similar policies are called \"REACH\" in New South Wales and \"CARE\" in Australian Capital Territory. \nMartha's Rule was introduced in NHS England hospitals from April 2024. It is initially being rolled out in 100 hospitals. It will allow patients, their families and carers, and hospital staff, to access a rapid review by the critical care outreach team if they are worried about the patient's condition.\n\n\nResponse\nThe efferent component is a rapid response team – a multidisciplinary team trained in early resuscitation interventions, and advanced life support that rushes to the deteriorating patient’s bedside to prevent respiratory and cardiac arrest in order to improve the patient’s outcomes. The team is known in the US as a rapid response team (RRT), in the UK as a critical care outreach team (CCOT), and in Australia as a  medical emergency team (MET), but rapid response team is also used generically.The team responds to calls placed by clinicians or families at the bedside who have detected deterioration. It may also provide proactive outreach to patients at high risk for deterioration. Composition of the teams may vary but often include one critical care attending physician or fellow, at least one nurse, and a respiratory therapist.\n\n\nImpacts and improvements\nThe process improvement component uses evidence-based evaluation of the RRS to determine its effectiveness and to improve the system through targeted interventions. It works closely with the administrative component, clinicians (especially those on RRTs), and quality improvement experts to evaluate three measures: outcomes measures, process measures, and balancing measures.\n\n\nOutcomes measures\nRates of hospital-wide mortality and respiratory and cardiac arrest, which are exceedingly rare and may or may not be preventable, are common outcome measures. Rapid response teams appear to decrease the rates of respiratory and cardiac arrest outside the intensive care unit. They also appear to decrease the chance of death in hospital. Overall effectiveness of rapid response teams is somewhat controversial due to the variability across studies as is the overall effectiveness of the rapid response system in improving patient safety.  More recent work uses proximal outcome measures, such as the Children’s Resuscitation Intensity Scale (measures level of care within 12 hours pre-transfer),  the Clinical Deterioration Metric (measures level of care within 12 hours post-transfer),  and UNSAFE transfers (measures level of care within 1 hour post-transfer).\n\n\nProcess measures\nProcess measures determine if the RRS is used as intended. Measures include the MET call rate, percentage of MET calls that result in transfer to the ICU, the time between initial physiologic abnormality and admission to ICU, timing of calls, reasons for MET calls, and evaluation of early warning scores using sensitivity and specificity.\n\n\nBalancing measures\nBalancing measures evaluate any unintended consequences of the RRS. Identified barriers to activating the MET include the primary team’s overconfidence in their ability to stabilize the patient, poor communication, hierarchal problems, and hospital culture.  Interventions to overcome barriers include improved intradisciplinary staff education, protocol requiring activation when calling criteria are met, and use of “champions” to foster cultural change.\n\n\nAdministrative component\nThe administrative component oversees the planning, implementation, and maintenance phases for the RRS. A formal committee of frontline clinicians and ward and ICU leaders operate the administrative component. Cost effectiveness of RRS implementation has not been rigorously studied.\n\n\nHistory\nLee and colleagues developed the first reported MET in 1995 in Liverpool Hospital in Australia.  The first pediatric RRS was implemented in 2005 by Tibballs, Kinney, and colleagues at Royal Children’s Hospital in Australia which included vital sign ranges that differed by age group.  Since its development, the RRS has been implemented around the world. The RRS became a standard of hospitals in the U.S. after its promotion by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in 2005 and the Joint Commission in 2008. Outside the U.S., RRS implementation has been encouraged and adopted by several national organizations, such as the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in Canada, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare.\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=3216197",
    "text": "Francesco Mochi (29 July 1580 Montevarchi – 6 February 1654 Rome) was an Italian early-Baroque  sculptor active mostly in Rome, Piacenza and Orvieto. His dramatic early works in Orvieto are now often regarded as the first truly Baroque sculptures.\n\n\nCareer\n\nHis early training was with the Florentine painter Santi di Tito, where he formed a taste for pictorial clarity and the primacy of disegno, exemplified in the sculpture of Giambologna and his studio and followers. Although documented as a painter, none of Mochi's paintings appear to survive. \nHe moved to Rome around 1599 and continued his training in the studio of the Venetian-trained sculptor Camillo Mariani. \nMochi worked with Stefano Maderno on a prominent papal commission, the Cappella Paolina in Santa Maria Maggiore, where he contributed his still somewhat immature Saint Matthew and the Angel, in travertine.            \nHis first major work was the Annunciation of the Virgin by the Angel, composed of two statues (the Angel completed 1605, the Virgin Annunciate, 1608, Orvieto, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo). \"A fanfare raising sculpture from its slumber\", as Rudolf Wittkower called it, it prefigures the baroque with its restrained emotiveness.\nMochi was one of the few seventeenth-century sculptors who was also a master bronze-caster. He made two masterly equestrian bronze statues of Ranuccio and Alessandro Farnese in Piazza Cavalli, Piacenza. Ranuccio Farnese, 1612–20, and Alessandro Farnese, 1620–29, are among the high points of his career.\nHe returned from Piacenza to Rome where, at long last, he finished his long overdue Saint Martha for the Barberini family chapel at Sant'Andrea della Valle (1609–1621). He now found Gian Lorenzo Bernini fully in charge of major commissions, and a current fully developed Baroque style with which Mochi was now out of touch. His reputation for bitterness and irritation regarding the overshadowing of his career significantly decreased the number of commissions he received.\nHis late Roman works are the Christ Receiving Baptism (1635 or later, Ponte Milvio, Rome); Taddeus (1641–44, Orvieto), and Saints Peter and Paul (1638–52, Porta del Popolo). \n\n\nSaint Veronica in the Crossing of St Peter's Basilica\nOne of the four massive sculptures in the crossing of St. Peter's Basilica, the statue of the frantic Saint Veronica displaying the by then lost Veil of Veronica (1629–40) is the best-known masterpiece by Mochi, in the most prominent position. The other three are François Duquesnoy's (Saint Andrew), Bernini's (Saint Longinus), and Andrea Bolgi's (St Helena).\nOf the four, Mochi's is the least appropriate to its site and topic, the most idiosyncratic and original. Bernini's Longinus is an intermediary between the sober but contorting classicism of Bolgi and Duquesnoy and the emotive dynamism of Mochi. Mochi's passionate depiction appears to overstep the decorum of the place.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=451781",
    "text": "Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is a synthetic, semicrystalline organic polymer resin, with the linear formula (CH2CHCN)n.  Almost all PAN resins are copolymers with acrylonitrile as the main monomer.  PAN is used to produce large variety of products including ultra filtration membranes, hollow fibers for reverse osmosis, fibers for textiles, and oxidized PAN fibers. PAN fibers are the chemical precursor of very high-quality carbon fiber.  PAN is first thermally oxidized in air at 230 °C to form an oxidized PAN fiber and then carbonized above 1000 °C in inert atmosphere to make carbon fibers found in a variety of both high-tech and common daily applications such as civil and military aircraft primary and secondary structures, missiles, solid propellant rocket motors, pressure vessels, fishing rods, tennis rackets and bicycle frames. It is a component repeat unit in several important copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic.\n\n\nHistory\nPolyacrylonitrile (PAN) was first synthesized in 1930 by Hans Fikentscher and Claus Heuck in the Ludwigshafen works of the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben. However, as PAN is non-fusible, and did not dissolve in any of the industrial solvents being used at the time, further research into the material was halted. \nIn 1931, Herbert Rein, head of polymer fiber chemistry at the Bitterfeld plant of IG Farben, obtained a sample of PAN while visiting the Ludwigshafen works. He found that pyridinium benzylchloride, an ionic liquid,  would dissolve PAN. He spun the first fibers based on PAN in 1938, using aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium sodium thiocyanate and aluminum perchlorate for the production process and considered other solvents including DMF. However, commercial introduction was delayed due to the wartime stresses on infrastructure, inability to melt the polymer without degradation, and solvents to allow solution processing were not known yet.\nThe first mass production run of PAN fiber was in 1946 by American chemical conglomerate DuPont. The German intellectual property had been stolen in Operation Paperclip. The product, branded as Orlon, was based on a patent filed exactly seven days after a nearly identical German claim.  \nIn the German Democratic Republic (GDR), industrial polyacrylonitrile fibre production was started in 1956 at the VEB Film- und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen due to the preliminary work of the \"Wolcrylon\" collective (de:Max Duch, Herbert Lehnert et al.). Prior to this, the preconditions for the production of the raw materials had been created at the Buna Werke Schkopau (Polyacrylonitrile) and Leuna works (Dimethylformamide). In the same year, the collective was awarded the GDR's National Prize II Class for Science and Technology for its achievements.\n\n\nPhysical properties\nAlthough it is thermoplastic, polyacrylonitrile does not melt under normal conditions. It degrades before melting. It melts above 300 °C if the heating rates are 50 degrees per minute or above.\nGlass transition temperature is around 95 °C and fusion temperature is at 322 °C. PAN is soluble in polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, ethylene and propylene carbonates, and in aqueous solutions of sodium thiocyanate, zinc chloride or nitric acid. Solubility parameters: 26.09 MPa1/2 (25 °C) are 25.6 to 31.5 J1/2 cm−3/2. Dielectric constants: 5.5 (1 kHz, 25 °C), 4.2 (1 MHz, 25 °C).Can behave as branched as well as linear polymer.\n\n\nSynthesis\nMost commercial methods for the synthesis of PAN are based on free radical polymerization of acrylonitrile. In most of the cases, 10% amounts of other vinyl comonomers are also used (1–10%) along with AN depending on the final application.  Comonomers include acrylic acid, acrylamide, allyl compounds, and sulfonated styrene. Anionic polymerization also can be used for synthesizing PAN. For textile applications, molecular weight in the range of 40,000 to 70,000 is used. For producing carbon fiber higher molecular weight is desired.\nIn the production of carbon fibers containing 600 tex (6k) PAN tow, the linear density of filaments is 0.12 tex and the filament diameter is 11.6 μm which produces a carbon fiber that has the filament strength of 417 kgf/mm2 and binder content of 38.6%. This data is demonstrated in the Indexes for Experimental Batches of PAN Precursor and Carbon Fibers Made from It table.\n\n\nApplications\nHomopolymers of polyacrylonitrile have been used as fibers in hot gas filtration systems, outdoor awnings, sails for yachts, and fiber-reinforced concrete. Copolymers containing polyacrylonitrile are often used as fibers to make knitted clothing like socks and sweaters, as well as outdoor products like tents and similar items. If the label of a piece of clothing says \"acrylic\", then it is made out of some copolymer of polyacrylonitrile.  It was made into the spun fiber at DuPont in 1942 and marketed under the name of Orlon. Acrylonitrile is commonly employed as a comonomer with styrene, e.g. acrylonitrile, styrene and acrylate plastics. Labelling of items of clothing with acrylic (see acrylic fiber) means the polymer consists of at least 85% acrylonitrile as the monomer. A typical comonomer is vinyl acetate, which can be solution-spun readily to obtain fibers that soften enough to allow penetration by dyes. The advantages of the use of these acrylics are that they are low-cost compared to natural fiber, they offer better sunlight resistance and have superior resistance to attack by moths. \nAcrylics modified with halogen-containing comonomers are classified as modacrylics, which by definition contain more than PAN percentages between 35-85%. Incorporation of halogen groups increases the flame resistance of the fiber, which makes modacrylics suitable for the use in sleepwear, tents and blankets. Some mattresses also use them to meet the flame resistance requirements in North America. However, the disadvantage of these products is that they are costly and can shrink after drying.\nPAN absorbs many metal ions and aids the application of absorption materials.  Polymers containing amidoxime groups can be used for the treatment of metals because of the polymers’ complex-forming capabilities with metal ions.\nPAN has properties involving low density, thermal stability, high strength and modulus of elasticity. These unique properties have made PAN an essential polymer in high tech.\nIts high tensile strength and tensile modulus are established by fiber sizing, coatings, production processes, and PAN's fiber chemistry.  Its mechanical properties derived are important in composite structures for military and commercial aircraft.\n\n\nCarbon fiber\nPolyacrylonitrile is used as the precursor for 90% of carbon fiber production.  Approximately 20–25% of Boeing and Airbus wide-body airframes are carbon fibers. However, applications are limited by PAN's high price of around $15/lb.\nA carbon fiber was created using resonant acoustic mixing with boron nitride nanotubes that has an increased tensile strength and storage modulus. \n\n\nGlassy carbon\nGlassy carbon, a common electrode material in electrochemistry, is created by heat-treating blocks of polyacrylonitrile under pressure at 1000 to 3000 °C over a period of several days. The process removes non-carbon atoms and creates a conjugated double bond structure with excellent conductivity.\n\n\nSupport polymer\nDivinylbenzene-crosslinked polyacrylonitrile is a precursor to ion exchange resins. Hydrolysis converts the nitrile groups to carboxylic acids. Amberlite IRC86 is one commercial product.  These weakly acidic resins have high affinities for divalent metal ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPolyacrylonitrile at Polymer Science Learning Center\nPolyacrylonitrile air filter Stanford engineers develop new air filter that could help Beijing residents breathe easily",

It takes place annually from the end of November to 23 December on Leipzig's market square and the adjacent streets and, with around 300 stalls and over 2.8 million visitors (2019), is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany.  \n\n\nHistory\n\nIts history goes back to 1458. In notes by Johann Jacob Vogel from 1714 there is the note:\n\n\"Anno 1458. Frederick II, Elector of Saxony, Marggraff of Meissen and Hertzog of Saxony / publicly advertised the Weynachtsmarckt / and the city / because of the loyal service rendered / as shown to him by the council / and the citizens / thus pardoned.\"\nThis makes it one of the oldest Christmas markets in Germany, alongside the Munich Christmas Market (1310), Bautzen Wenzelsmarkt (1384), Frankfurt Christmas Market (1393) and Dresden Striezelmarkt (1434).\nThe Christmas markets planned for 2020 and 2021 were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nProgram of supporting events\nThe Leipzig Christmas Market 2023 will be opened by the cultural mayor Skadi Jennicke, the Thomanerchor and the Leipzig Youth & Wind Orchestra. Every day at 6 p.m., tower brass players traditionally play from the balcony of the Old Town Hall. Further concerts take place on the market stage. The Ore Mountains Miners' parade is a procession of a brass band with seven miners' bands with 265 mountain musicians and around 370 people in uniform and takes place every two years.\n\n\nAttractions\n\nThe market offers several areas, including a fairytale land for children on Augustusplatz, a historical market on Naschmarkt, a nativity scene with real sheep, an 8 metres (26 ft) tall Ore Mountains Christmas pyramid on Nikolaikirchhof and a Finnish village on Augustusplatz. On the market square there is the approximately 20 metres (66 ft) tall Christmas fir, usually a spruce from the region.\nThe South Tyrolean village is a popular meeting point on Augustusplatz during the Leipzig Christmas market. Tyrolean dishes are served while listening to Alpine music.\nThe historic carousel is a special attraction of the Christmas market on Salzgässchen. The carousel, parts of which were over 100 years old, fell victim to a fire due to a short circuit before the market opened in November 2009. In 2010 the carousel was rebuilt true to the original. The “Wichtelwerkstatt” where children can do crafts has existed since 2010 and was completely renovated and reopened in 2017.\nA special and widely celebrated Leipzig tradition is the arrival of Santa Claus in the city. Every year on the Saturday before the Advent Sunday at 11 a.m., numerous children and their parents welcome Santa Claus and his entourage at the main station, where he arrives on a special train. They then escort his carriage and brass band across the city to the market square. Santa Claus will hold his office hours there every day until the end of the Christmas market.\nAnother attraction at the Christmas market was the largest free-standing Advent calendar in the world, which was installed from 1997 to 2012 and, at 857 square metres (9,225 sq ft), according to the Guinness Book of Records, was on the facade of a house in Böttchergässchen with 3 metres (10 ft) by 2 metres (7 ft) windows. It was played by students from Leipzig schools and the ″Musikschule Leipzig Johann Sebastian Bach\". Due to damage caused by vandalism, the calendar was no longer installed in 2013.\n\n\nOffer\nAround a third of the stands offer baked goods and confectionery such as roasted almonds, Pulsnitzer gingerbread or Stollen, as well as other food and drinks. The largest proportion are high-quality dealers, showmen and craftsmen. Among other things, wood carvings from Ore Mountain folk art and other handicrafts are on offer.\n\n\nImages\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Leipziger Weihnachtsmarkt 2023\" [Leipzig Christmas Market 2023] (PDF). leipzig.de (in German and English).

    "text": "Ben Wilson (June 23, 1913 – November 9, 2001) was an American artist known for his early, expressionistic paintings from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s and his subsequent non-objective paintings, a personal synthesis of abstract expressionism and constructivism. He is generally considered a second-generation abstract expressionist.\n\n\nEarly years and education\nBen Wilson was born in Philadelphia to Jewish parents who had emigrated from the Ukrainian city of Kyiv. When he was three, the family settled in New York City, where Wilson attended public schools and graduated in 1935 from City College (CCNY); there he studied with Abram Gustav Schulman and did honors with George William Eggers. To gain exposure to a wider range of styles, he also studied at the National Academy Museum and School with George Lawrence Nelson, Carl Anderson, Leon Kroll and Gordon Samstag, and at the Educational Alliance with Abbo Ostrowsky.\n\n\nArtwork\nIn spite of his predominately academic training, Wilson was particularly attracted to Analytic Cubism and experimented with elements of abstraction even in his earliest figurative work. Following his formal art education, he shared a studio in Chelsea with several of his CCNY classmates and worked for the WPA (Works Progress Administration) as an art instructor. By the late 1930s through the 40s an expressionistic style and social content dominated his painting. Strongly identifying with the plight of the persecuted in Europe, Wilson explored themes of war, torment, and futility, attempting to convey \"the grief of the intolerable.\"\nOne of the youngest artists to show at the A.C.A. Gallery in 1940 and with the Bombshell Group at the Riverside Museum in 1942, he had his first one-man show in 1946 at the Gallery Neuf. His work—expressionistically rendered Biblical parables more closely akin to the German expressionists than to the prevailing social realists—was much admired by the critics for its sincerity and vehement social protest. Art critic Howard Devree wrote in The New York Times (Nov. 17, 1946), \"If there has been more earnest and emotional painting shown this season than the somber canvases by Ben Wilson at Galerie Neuf, it has escaped my attention.\"\nWhen times improved and social pressures subsided, Wilson's mood lifted. Along with his sculptor wife Evelyn Wilson and daughter Joanne, he spent 1950–52 in Paris, where he worked at the Academie Julien. During this time his involvement with imagery persisted. While he remained concerned with his sense of universal injustice, his work took a turn towards the psychological and mythic.\nBy 1960, influenced by the Russian constructivists, Mondrian, and Abstract Expressionism, Wilson had fully embraced abstraction. Searching for what he called \"a scaffolding under the externals\", he struggled to develop his unique personal vocabulary and structure, a fusion of the cerebral and the emotive.  In time he became increasingly experimental, incorporating unorthodox materials; working his paintings from all directions; and dripping, spraying, stenciling and collaging. While continuing to explore unusual color harmonics, compositional variations increasingly became his major focus. Employing disjunctions, repeated and interlocking motifs, linear networks, and complex overlays, he worked to create a sense of transparency through a multilayered development of space. Through the years Wilson pursued similar investigations in notebook after notebook of drawings.\nA dedicated teacher, for five decades Wilson taught painting in his various studios in Manhattan and later New Jersey, and lectured to museum- and gallery-visiting classes for Brandeis University and NYU. He was also active in artist groups such as MAG (Modern Artists Guild). and Vectors. Widely exhibited, with more than 30 solo exhibitions, Wilson is cited in Who's Who in Art, Who's Who in the East, the Dictionary of International Biography and American Artists of Renown. As well as in private collections, his work is represented in numerous museum and university collections. Montclair State University, in Montclair, New Jersey, permanently houses his art estate and papers. A portion of his papers is also included in the Smithsonian Archives of American Art\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBen Wilson :: Official Homepage\nBen Wilson American Artist :: Catalogue\nBen Wilson at the Chassidic Art Institute\nBen Wilson papers at Archives of American Arts\nBen Wilson Collection at Montclair State University\nBen Wilson: From Social Realism to Abstraction Exhibit",

    "text": "Exit Planet Dust is the debut studio album by English electronic music duo the Chemical Brothers. It was first released on 26 June 1995 in the United Kingdom by Junior Boy's Own, Freestyle Dust, and Virgin Records, and on 15 August 1995 in the United States by Astralwerks. The album was recorded between August and November 1994, with \"Song to the Siren\" performed live. Its title is a reference to their departure from their earlier name the Dust Brothers.\nThe album received critical acclaim and was in the UK charts for many weeks, charting in each year from its release in 1995 until 2000; its highest peak was number 9 in 1995.\n\n\nBackground\nTheir initial work included a remix of an Ariel song (a band which included Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers on drums), released under their '237 Turbo Nutters' name, and the track \"Song to the Siren\", issued as an independent single on Diamond Records, reportedly inspired by a nickname Ed Simons had. The single also contained two longform remixes of the track. The band took the song to various dance record shops around London but no one picked it up. \"Song to the Siren\" was made simply using a Hitachi hi-fi system, an Atari ST, a sampler, and a keyboard, using a sample of This Mortal Coil.\nAndrew Weatherall of the Sabres of Paradise had heard the track. He decided to play it live in his DJ sets and suggested Steven Hall sign the duo to Junior Boy's Own record label, which re-released the single in 1993. The band had become popular remixers, mixing tracks ranging from \"Jailbird\" by Primal Scream to \"Voodoo People\" by the Prodigy (their remix of this particular track also became the A-side of \"Voodoo People\" on select versions).\n\n\nRecording\nThe album's recording began in August 1994 and concluded in November. Tom Rowlands stated in 2002 that they \"stayed up for three weeks making it\". One song from the sessions, \"Leave Home\", was first released in late 1994 on the duo's mix album, NME Xmas Dust Up, released as a covermount cassette tape in an issue of NME. The first six tracks on Exit Planet Dust are continuous, making a medley. These six tracks include \"Leave Home\"; and edits of the duo's previous songs \"Chemical Beats\" and their first track \"Song to the Siren\", the latter being recorded live on the album from Sabresonic nightclub in March 1994, which belonged to Weatherall's act the Sabres of Paradise, who also remixed \"Leave Home\".\nThe duo became resident DJs at the small—but hugely influential—Heavenly Sunday Social Club at the Albany pub in London's Great Portland Street at this point. The likes of Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller, James Dean Bradfield, and Tim Burgess were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers (as they were known at the time) were subsequently asked to remix tracks by Manic Street Preachers and the Charlatans.\nThe album was finished by 1995 and released on the Junior Boy's Own label, in conjunction with the Chemical Brothers' own independent leg of that label, Freestyle Dust; and Virgin Records, which later replaced Junior Boy's Own as the band's head label. The duo, however, had to change their name to the Chemical Brothers after the American production duo Dust Brothers had threatened to sue them if they refused to. The Chemical Brothers name came from the duo's track \"Chemical Beats\". The name change inspired the name of the album.\n\n\nContent\n\n\nSamples\nThe beginning of \"Leave Home\" is a short sample of the beginning of the Kraftwerk song \"Ohm Sweet Ohm\" from the album Radio-Activity. Also sampled are percussion sections from Pucho & His Latin Soul Brothers' \"Got Myself a Good Man\" and vocals from \"Brothers Gonna Work It Out\" by Blake Baxter (1992), as well as short samples from \"The Defector\" by Recoil. \"In Dust We Trust\" contains several short samples of the Beastie Boys song \"The Maestro\" from the album Check Your Head. The vocal sample in \"Song to the Siren\" is a reversed sample of part of the Dead Can Dance track \"Song of Sophia\" from the album The Serpent's Egg. \"Song to the Siren\" also samples drums from \"God O.D.\" by Meat Beat Manifesto.\n\n\nArtwork\nThe cover of the album was from a 1970s fashion shoot reject box, according to Ed Simons. In a 1995 interview with Select magazine, Simons said, \"We wanted something that just looked nice. A lot of techno albums just have fractals on them, and we wanted something a bit more romantic and otherworldly with soft, nice colours. It's the wrong way round as well - intentionally. If me and Tom are in that picture we're in the car going, \"Oh she's alright, I wish I had a guitar on my back with her.\" That would rank as one of the good things in life. Originally we had this pregnant woman in a field wearing this white see-though dress, like a Flake advert gone wrong. But we couldn't use it because the unborn child could have sued us\". Stylus Magazine said that the people on the cover \"are presumably travelling, but are content on making their own way—content travellers in a picturesque setting.\" Another image from the same fashion photo shoot was used as one of the images in the Dig Your Own Hole booklet.\nThe reference to \"the kids from Orlando\" in the liner thank you notes is a reference to the duo's first performance in the United States, at The Edge nightclub in Orlando, Florida on 4 July 1993. The LP features a series of messages on the run-out grooves. One of them, \"Huw is innocent!\" on side four, apparently refers to Rowlands' brother. This message would later be referenced on the LP of Push the Button (2005), where the side four run-out message claims \"Huw is still innocent!\"\n\n\nRelease\nThe album was released in the UK in June 1995. Shortly before its release, Ed Simons said to Muzik that \"nobody from the dance world has come up with an album to reflect these times. Why is that? Why is it left to a group like Oasis to express the way that young people want to go out and get battered every weekend? That's what The Chemical Brothers are about\".\n\"Leave Home\" was released as the first official single from the album on 5 June 1995. It reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. \"Life Is Sweet\" was released as the second single on 28 August 1995 and reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe album was certified platinum by the BPI on 1 January 1996. On 30 October 2000, the album was released on MiniDisc. In 2004, the album was packaged with 1997's Dig Your Own Hole in a limited edition box set as part of EMI's \"2CD Originals\" collection.\n\n\nReception\n\nExit Planet Dust received praise upon release. NME described the album as \"brash, raw, rule-bending gear made by open-minded music fans, for open-minded music fans.\"\nThe album has received retrospective acclaim and continues to inspire. Muzik named it the second best dance album of all time in 2002 and Q TV named it the 41st best album of the 1990s. AllMusic's top-marks review states \"The Chemical Brothers' sound is big on bombast, replete with screeching guitar samples and lots of sirens and screaming divas. A breakthrough album of sorts, Exit Planet Dust was, upon its release, one of the few European post-techno albums to make any sort of headway into the stateside market.\"\nFollowing the album's release, the duo were thanked in the liner notes of Better Living Through Chemistry by Fatboy Slim and Homework by Daft Punk. Tim O'Neil of PopMatters described the former album as \"one of the first albums—and probably the best, outside of the Chems' own later material—to take the rough template of [Exit Planet Dust] as a direct model.\" The Edge also named it his favourite album of 1995.\nThe album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nStereogum did a review in 2015, 20 years after the album release and called it one of the \"best psychedelic rock records of the '90s.\"\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nSample credits\n\n\"Leave Home\" contains samples of \"Brothers Gonna Work It Out\", written and performed by Blake Baxter.\n\"One Too Many Mornings\" contains samples of \"Peekaboo\" and \"Follow Me Down\", both written by Mike Mason and Louise Treahy and performed by Swallow.\n\n\nPersonnel\nCredits for Exit Planet Dust adapted from album liner notes.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nWeekly charts\n\n\nCertifications and sales\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nExit Planet Dust at Discogs (list of releases)",

Around 1840 he moved to the firm of Burn & Bryce, staying with David Bryce when William Burn left to set up in London in 1844.\nHe set up an independent practice around 1850, specialising in churches and country villas and farmsteads. In 1864 he entered the competition for the Scottish National Albert Memorial (now in Charlotte Square). Although unsuccessful his drawings were displayed in the 1886 Edinburgh Exhibition on The Meadows.\nHe died of a heart attack whilst walking on Princes Street, to his home at 37 York Place in Edinburgh's New Town, on 18 May 1898.\n\n\nFamily\nHe was married to Helen Henderson (d.1916).

    "text": "Jessica Rosenworcel (born July 12, 1971) is an American attorney who served as a member and chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). She originally served on the FCC from May 11, 2012, to January 3, 2017, and was confirmed by the Senate for an additional term on August 3, 2017. She was named to serve as acting chair in January 2021 and designated permanent chair in October 2021. She was confirmed for another term by the Senate in December 2021. In August 2025, she was named Executive Director of the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nRosenworcel was born to Willa (née Linoff) and Elliot Rosenworcel, she grew up Jewish in West Hartford, Connecticut and in 1989, graduated from Hall High School. She graduated from Wesleyan University in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and English literature, then studied law at the New York University School of Law, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 1997.\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter law school, Rosenworcel was an associate at the law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath (now Faegre Drinker), where she worked in communications law. In 1999, she joined the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC, and in 2003 started working for then-FCC Commissioner Michael Copps. Starting in 2007, she served as Senior Communications Counsel to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, under the leadership of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D–WV).\nShe previously served in the same role on the Committee under the leadership of Senator Daniel Inouye (D–HI). In 2013, Rockefeller led a push to have Rosenworcel named to be the first female chairwoman of the commission when former Chairman Julius Genachowski stepped down, although the position was ultimately given to Tom Wheeler. \n\n\nFederal Communications Commission\n\nRosenworcel was first nominated to the FCC by President Barack Obama in October 2011. Her confirmation was delayed for months when Republican Senator Chuck Grassley refused to bring it up for a vote until the FCC released documents about a project he opposed. She was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and sworn into office on May 11, 2012, for a term ending June 30, 2015.\nOn July 13, 2012, Politico designated Rosenworcel as one of 50 politicos to watch, describing her as \"whip-smart and intensely serious\".\nBy law, commissioners may continue serving until the appointment of their replacements, but not beyond the end of the next session of Congress following term expiration. In May 2015, President Obama renominated Rosenworcel for a second term, but she was not reconfirmed by the Senate by the time she was required to leave her seat in January 2017. In June 2017, Rosenworcel was nominated to an additional term by President Donald Trump. She was confirmed by the Senate on August 3, 2017. \nFollowing the election of Joe Biden as president, Biden named Rosenworcel as his choice to become chairperson of the FCC after the departure of prior chairman Ajit Pai with the change in administration. Biden named Rosenworcel to serve as acting chairwoman in the interim, making her the second-ever woman to serve in this position. Biden later named Rosenworcel to be the permanent FCC Chairwoman in October 2021, making her the first female to hold the permanent chairperson position on the FCC, and she was confirmed by the Senate on December 7, 2021 for another term as commissioner. She resigned from the FCC in January 2025.\nRosenworcel served as the Chairwoman of the Federal-State Joint Conference on Advanced Telecommunications Services, a forum for dialogue among the FCC, state regulators, and local and regional entities about the deployment of advanced telecommunications capabilities. In 2022, Rosenworcel announced new plans to create a space bureau within the FCC to address the increased number of satellite launches.\n\n\nPositions\nDuring her initial term as an FCC commissioner, Rosenworcel voted to enforce net neutrality by classifying Internet service providers as Title II common carriers, overturn state laws that protect Internet service providers against competition from municipal broadband, change the technical definition of \"broadband\" from 4 Mbit/s to 25 Mbit/s, use the LifeLine program to subsidize Internet access for low-income individuals, and expand consumer protection against robocalls. On the latter topic, Rosenworcel in 2019 argued that the FCC should order telecommunications companies to provide free call-blocking services. On March 17, 2021, she kicked off an anti-robocall agenda. This agenda includes issuing significant fines to companies, demanding cease-and-desist, and launching a Robocall Response Team.\nOn net neutrality, Rosenworcel said, \"We cannot have a two-tiered Internet with fast lanes that speed the traffic of the privileged and leave the rest of us lagging behind. We cannot have gatekeepers who tell us what we can and cannot do and where we can and cannot go online, and we do not need blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization schemes that undermine the Internet as we know it.\"\nRosenworcel has been a champion of updating national education policy in order to connect the country's schools and libraries with high-speed Internet.

    "text": "Gondal is a city of about 115,000 residents and a municipality of about 175,000 in the Rajkot district of the Indian state of Gujarat. Gondal village was one of the eight first-class princely states of Kathiawar Agency, Bombay Presidency in British India.\n\n\nHistory\n\nGondal is mentioned in texts like the Ain-i-Akbari (written in the reign of Akbar) and Mirat-i-Ahmadi as a Vaghela state in Sorath (Saurashtra). The Gondal State in Kathiawar Agency was founded in 1634 by Kumbhojī I from the Jadeja dynasty, who received Ardoi and other villages from his father Merāmanjī. Kumbhoji's fourth descendant, Kumbhoji IV, increased the size of the state by acquiring parganas such as Dhoraji, Upleta, and Sarai.\nSir Bhagwant Singhji, who reigned from 1888 until his death in 1944, was noted for tax reforms, compulsory education for women, and also for stopping the practice of purdah (female seclusion) at a time when the royal households of India were known for this tradition.\nIn 1901, Gondal city had a population of 19,592, and was a stop on the branch line between Rajkot and Jetalsar on the Viramgam–Rajkot and Rajkot–Somnath lines.\nThe ancestors of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, belong to Paneli village in Gondal state.\n\n\nHistorical places\n\nThe Naulakha Palace is the oldest extant palace in Gondal, dating back to the 17th century. It has stone carvings with jharokhas (enclosed balconies), a pillared courtyard, delicately carved arches, and a unique spiral staircase. The large chandelier-lit durbar (court) contains stuffed panthers, gilt wooden furniture, and antique mirrors. The Private Palace Museum has a display of silver caskets which were used to carry messages and gifts for Maharajah Bhagvatsinhji during his silver jubilee as ruler of Gondal.\nThe Riverside Palace was built in 1875 by Maharajah Bhagwat Sinhji for his son, Yuvraj Bhojraji. It has groomed lawns and gardens, a living room furnished in typical colonial style with chandelier, antique wooden furniture and sofas, and an \"Indian room\" decorated with beadwork, brassware and paintings. The palace has now become a heritage hotel.\nThe Huzoor Palace is the current royal residence. One wing of this palace, called the Orchard palace, is open to the public. It was built as an annex of the Huzoor Palace in the late 19th century to host guests of the Maharajas. The property gets its name from the fruit orchards, lawns and gardens that surround the palace.\nOrchard Palace was converted into a seven-room heritage hotel decorated with 1930s–1940s art deco furniture, antiques and handicrafts. The garden contains many types of birds, including a large population of peacocks. The Room of Miniatures is a sitting room with a collection of miniature paintings, brass, and furniture. One of the highlights of the palace is the Rail Saloon of the royal family of Gondal which has been converted into a suite with a drawing room, dining room and bedroom. The royal garages have an extensive collection of vintage and classic cars.\n\n\nThakurs\nThe rulers of Gondal were Thakurs of the Jadeja dynasty who had the right to an 11-gun salute. They bore the title 'Thakur Sahib' from 1866 onwards.\n\n\nReligious sites\n\nThe people of the Gondal, as in most of the other parts of Saurashtra, are considered highly spiritual.\nThe temples in Gondal include Akshar Mandir and Deri (BAPS Swaminarayan), Shri Trikamrayji Haveli, Shri Madanmohanji ni haveli (Moti Haveli), Shri Ramji Mandir, Bhuvneshwari Mandir (one of the few temples in India dedicated to this Goddess), Ashapura Mata, Sureshwar Mahadev, Dhareshwar Mahadev, Kashi Vishwanath Mahadev and the massive Ambey Dham (Ramanath) Temple. There is also another Pushtimargiya Haveli and Swaminarayan temple in the city centre.\nThe Akshar Deri, housed within the Akshar Mandir, is the samadhi sthan (memorial site) of Gunatitanand Swami, who was a paramhansa of Swaminarayan, and is accepted as the first spiritual successor of Swaminarayan by the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS). This temple is visited by people from all over the world.\nDasi Jeevan Mandir (temple) in Ghoghavadar, 6 km (3.7 mi) from Gondal, is a site where Saint Dasi Jeevan lived.

It was enlarged in 1759. John Wesley preached a sermon \"On the death of the Rev Mr George Whitefield\" both there and at Whitefield's Tabernacle, Moorfields, in 1770.\nThe original chapel stood on the west side of Tottenham Court Road, between Tottenham Street and Howland Street, surrounded by fields and gardens. Its foundation stone was laid by Whitefield in June 1756, and it opened for its dedication service on 7 November of the same year. Its initial popularity led to plans being drawn up for enlargement, and these were quickly put into effect in 1759. Beneath the chapel, a vault was also prepared; it was Whitefield's hope that he could be interred here along with his wife Elizabeth and the two Wesleys, but he died and was buried in Newburyport, Massachusetts.\nIn 1890, the building was taken down and re-erected as Whitefield's Central Mission. In 1895, the coffins buried in the crypt (including Elizabeth Whitefield, but excluding the lead coffin of Augustus Toplady) were moved to Chingford Mount Cemetery in north London.\nFrom 1903 until his death in 1914, the church's minister was Silvester Horne, the father of the broadcaster Kenneth Horne.\nOn Palm Sunday 1945, the church building was destroyed by the last V-2 rocket to fall on London. A new chapel was built in 1957, and the grounds became a public thoroughfare.\nSince 1972, the chapel has been the home of the American International Church. It was offered to them by the United Reformed Church when they were forced to move from their building in North Audley Street in 1972. It also houses the London Chinese Lutheran Church. \nThe adjoining grounds have recently  had a series of interpretive panels designed for them by Groundwork Camden, with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. These depict various scenes in the history of the chapel, Whitefield's links to Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, and the abolition of slavery as represented by Olaudah Equiano, who was buried at Whitefield's Tabernacle.\n\n\nAmerican Church\nDuring the Second World War, members of the U.S. military worshipped at the Anglican Grosvenor Chapel which was close to the American Embassy then on Grosvenor Square. After the war, the congregation grew from the ranks of State Department and Defense Department families while still relying on military chaplains for leadership.\nIn 1969, the church launched independent of that support and called the Rev. William Schotanus to be its first minister. After worshipping in several different church buildings, the American Church moved to the Whitefield Memorial Church in 1972.\n\n\nNotable burials\nOlaudah Equiano\nGeorge Gauld (surveyor)\nAugustus Toplady\nJ.

    "text": "Glenolabral articular disruption (GLAD) lesion is a type of shoulder injury.  It is difficult to diagnose clinically, and requires surgical repair to correct the damage to the shoulder.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nPersistent or worsening shoulder pain is the most common symptom of glenolabral articular disruption lesions. The pain is often described as anterior or global. Joint instability has also been reported in some cases.\n\n\nCauses\nGlenolabral articular disruption lesions often develop as a result of shoulder trauma. External rotation and forced shoulder adduction from an abduction position characterize the classic pattern from the original series. This often occurs due to falling onto an outstretched arm. The injury has also been reported in association with forceful adduction as a result of throwing.\n\n\nMechanism\nThe glenoid cartilage underneath the labrum in the glenohumeral (GH) joint is disrupted by glenolabral articular disruption. The articulation of the humeral head inside the glenoid fossa of the scapula forms the GH joint itself, which is a synovial ball and socket joint. The labrum, a fibrocartilaginous rim, encircles the fossa at its edge and is lined with articular cartilage. The labrum gives the fossa more depth and serves as an anchor for the GH ligaments and the long head of the biceps tendon.\nGlenolabral articular disruption lesions usually occur from forceful adduction of the humeral head onto the glenoid fossa. Shear force might also be present. This results in varying degrees of underlying cartilage damage as well as a superficial tear along the anterior-inferior aspect of the labrum. This could be a loose chondral body, a more significant flap tear, or even a focal cartilage defect.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nOn non-contrast MRI or CT arthrography imaging, lesions might be harder to find, but the more recent 3T MRI scanners might increase the pick-up rate in the absence of contrast. The accepted gold standard for identifying or detecting the glenolabral articular disruption lesion is MR arthroscopy (MRA).\n\n\nTreatment\nThe preferred course of treatment for the glenolabral articular disruption lesion is arthroscopic debridement of the labrum and glenoid articular defect in patients without any discernible anterior instability.\n\n\nSee also\nALPSA lesion\nBankart lesion\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nWermers, Jens; Schliemann, Benedikt; Raschke, Michael J.; Dyrna, Felix; Heilmann, Lukas F.; Michel, Philipp A.; Katthagen, J.

    "text": "Gaist Crusher (ガイストクラッシャー, Gaisutokurasshā) is an action video game developed by Treasure and published by Capcom. It was released for the Nintendo 3DS on December 5, 2013 in Japan. The game launched as a part of a cross-media franchise including manga adaptations in Shueisha magazines and an anime television adaptation by Pierrot.\nA sequel, entitled Gaist Crusher God (ガイストクラッシャーゴッド, Gaisutokurasshā Goddo), was released in Japan on September 4, 2014, and features the original story from the first game as well as another \"God\" story, refined mechanics and more enemies. It is also the final video game developed by Treasure before the company went on hiatus shortly after its release.\n\n\nStory\n\n\nGaist Crusher\nIn the year 2047, mankind discovered a rare metal ore called \"Gaimetal\", which possessed a huge amount of energy, and mining for these strange metal ore begins all over the world. However, in 2064, humankind were constantly attacked by Gaist, a race of metallic creatures whose bodies were encrusted with Gaimetal, thus forming the GCG (also known as \"Gaist Crusher Garrison\"), an organization tasked with dealing against the Gaist. In 2075, the GCG send out mankind's line of defense: the Gaist Crushers, humans who can wear a special Gaimetal armor called \"Gaist Gear\", and battle the Gaist, as well as the threat opposed by a mysterious organization called \"Erasers\".\n\n\nGaist Crusher God\nA few months after their victory against Erasers, Rekka Shirogane and the other Gaist Crushers are faced with a new threat from the ultimate Gaist, called God Gaist (ゴッドガイスト, Goddo Gaisuto), led by the powerful God Hinokagutsuchi, who plans to cleanse Earth of its \"impurity\", which was blamed on the human race. Once again, this leaves the task to Rekka and his allies to defeat them, with the help of a sentient Gaist named Maikuma (マイクマ, Maikuma), as well as going up against Cypher (the only member of the Erasers that survived), who plans to use the \"ultimate Gaimetal\" for his nefarious use.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is fairly similar to Lord of Arcana, with most of its combat mechanics bears similar to the God Eater series, although it usually focuses on combos and techniques. Players must explore the mission map, battling Gaist along the way. At the end of the map, a larger Gaist will appear, which the player must defeat to complete a mission. Players can make use of various attacks, as well as using \"Gaist Arts\" and \"Form Changes\". When defeating the Gaist, a special \"Crush Chance\" will appear, in which the player must destroy Gaist's core (which is surrounded with Gaimetal) within a given period of time, rewarding them with a new Gaist Gear once completed.\nIn combat, players can change the form of their Gaist Gear to adapt in the battlefield. There are three forms:\n\nMelee form: The player's default form, usually used in frontal attacks.\nWeapon form: The Armor Form's alternate form. The Weapon Form works similarly to Armor Form, though its appearance and function vary for each Gaist Gear equipped.\nExtreme form: A form that can be temporarily activate for a short period of time. In this form, a character will be transformed into a Gaist closest to the Gaist Crusher's Gaist Gear, thus gaining invincibility and more attack power.\nGaist Arts are special attacks that can be use against the Gaist. It was available for the Armor Form and Weapon Form. Each Gaist Art varies, depends on the form used, or on the Gaist Gear equipped. Most of the Gaist Arts can capable of paralyzing nearby enemies.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nGaimetal\nA mysterious metallic ore discovered 50,000 meters (160,000 feet) beneath the ground 15 years from the main story. Although appeared to be metallic in nature, Gaimetals (ガイメタル) are capable of rapid crystallization, and it can also alters a genetic make-up of an organism. There are two different kinds of Gaimetal:\n\nThe Jewel-type Gaimetals are gem-like Gaimetals where Gaist were usually sealed in, and most of this kind of Gaimetal were used by the Gaist Crushers.\nThe Structural-type Gaimetal are Gaimetal that look like a chunk of crystallized rock, and it was usually used for building large structural objects, such as large ruins.\nOn occasions, an unpurified Gaimetal can be unstable and unpredictable, forcefully transforming a living organism into Gaist much faster. Fortunately, Gaimetals can be purified through various tampering techniques.\n\n\nGaist\nA race of metallic lifeforms that are made entirely of Gaimetal, usually \"born\" when a Gaimetal is given a certain stimulus. Named after motifs from mythical cultures and legends, each Gaist differ in elemental attributes, appearance and abilities. It was said to be born from Gaimetals, as certain devices can accelerate a Gaist's \"hyper-activation\"(or in otherwords, awakening). Most of the Gaist are capable of intelligence, such as the God Gaists (ゴッドガイスト), which has immerse intelligence about everything in the universe.\n\n\nCrush Chance (クラッシュチャンス)\nWhen a Gaist's certain body part cracks, and crystals sprout out of it, a Crush Chance (クラッシュチャンス) occur, giving the Gaist Crushers the opportunity to destroy its \"crush metal\" to defeat and restore them into their Gaimetal form.\n\n\nGaist Crusher Garrison (ガイストクラッシャーギャリソン)\nUsually referred to \"GCG\", the Gaist Crusher Garrison (ガイストクラッシャーギャリソン) is a worldwide-sanctioned organization whose main mission is to analyse, research, and even subdue any Gaist around the globe.\n\n\nGaist Crushers\nA term referring to those who can equipped themselves with a special armor called \"Gaist Gear\". The Gaist Crushers usually works under the Gaist Crusher Garrison, selected for their respective specialties, such as combat, tactical strategies, and such. Rekka Shirogane was an \"exception\" to this, since he was accepted due to his very strong determination.\n\n\nGaist Phone\nA portable device usually used by the Gaist Crushers and most of the Gaist Crusher Garrison's personnel. Resembling a small touch-screen phone, it has many functions, differs for each personnel. The \"GC Model\" Gai Phone was only available for the Gaist Crushers, and it has a special function called \"Gaist On!\" (ガイストオン). However, it requires inserting a Gaimetal on the Gai Phone, and the user must have an \"aura\" that can release enough Gaivolts (ガイ・ボルト) to activate it.\n\n\nGaist Gear\nA special kind of armor made entirely of Gaimetal. The Gaist Gear can be equipped by the Gaist Crushers via a special command, called \"Gaist On\". The armor gave its user enhanced abilities, and get stronger the more determined the user was. The Gaist Gear has three forms:\n\nMelee Form (メールフォーム): This form protects its user from any physical damage done by the Gaist.\nWeapon Form (ウェポンフォーム): This form takes shape of a weapon for the Gaist Crusher to use.\nExtreme Form (エクストリームフォーム): The most dangerous form of the Gaist Gear. Upon activation, the user will be covered in crystalline Gaimetal, and transforms into a Gaist from the inside. According to Hayato Kongōji, the Extreme Form is the hardest form to control, requiring 100,000 Gaivolts to activate it, and therefore, very dangerous. According to him, it can traumatize its user, usually capable of straining their body, and in one case, unable to revert into human form.\n\n\nCharacters\n\n\nGaist Crushers\nA group of humans who can equip a special armor called \"Gaist Gear\".\n\nRekka Shirogane (白銀レッカ, Shirogane Rekka)\nVoiced by: Daiki Yamashita\nGaist Gear: Flame Fenrir -> Bakuen Fenrion -> Exceed Fenrir\nWeapon Attribute: Sword\nElement Attribute: Fire\nHayato Kongōji (金剛寺ハヤト, Kongōji Hayato)\nVoiced by: Yūichi Iguchi\nGaist Gear: Wind Garuda -> Storm Garudia -> Glory Garuda\nWeapon Attribute: Scythe\nElement Attribute: Wind\nKurama Shindō (真銅クラマ, Shindō Kurama)\nVoiced by: Yasuyuki Takase\nGaist Gear: Gaia Orochi -> Geo Orojiarg -> Shinobi Oroshi\nWeapon Attribute: Claw\nElement Attribute: Gaia\nShiren Quartzheart (シレン・クォーツハート, Ku~ōtsuhāto Shiren)\nVoiced by: Makoto Furukawa\nGaist Gear: Blizzard Unicorn -> Mirage Unicornia -> Crystal Unicorn\nWeapon Attribute: Bow\nElement Attribute: Ice\nIzuna Kokuyou (黒曜 イズナ, Kokuyou Izuna)\nVoiced by: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka\nGaist Gear: Lightning Dragoon -> Plasma Drageizer -> Blitz Dragoon\nWeapon Attribute: Spear\nElement Attribute: Thunder\n\n\nGaist Crusher Garrison\nThe organization where the Gaist Crushers were working with, whose sole purpose is to research and, if possible, eliminate the Gaist.\n\nSango Sakura (桜さんご, Sakura Sango)\nVoiced by: Risa Taneda\nRock Volcan (ロック・ボルカン, Rokku Borukan)\nVoiced by: Katsuyuki Konishi\nZeke Bana (ジーク・バナ, Jiiku Bana)\nVoiced by: Tsuguo Mogami\nKohaku Kongōji (金剛寺コハク, Kongōji Kohaku)\nVoiced by: Asami Tano\nLuminella Hotaru (蛍ルミネラ, Hotaru Ruminera)\nVoiced by: Ayahi Takagaki\nMagnus (マグネス, Magunesu)\nVoiced by: Kentaro Tone\nHisui Midori (緑ヒスイ, Midori Hisui)\nVoiced by: Sora Amamiya\n\n\nErasers (イレイザー)\nThe mysterious organization who wreak havoc using Gaist, and plots to take over Earth.\n\nCypher (サイファ, Seifa)\nVoiced by: Kenichi Suzumura\nMangan (マンガン, Mangan)\nVoiced by: Yūsaku Yara\nRounder (ラウンダ, Rounder)\nVoiced by: Mitsuishi Kotono\nAlumni (アルーミ, Arumi)\nVoiced by: Yao Kazuki\nΩ (Ω（オメガ）, Omega)\nVoiced by: Ishizuka Unsho\n\n\nOther characters\nGōka Shirogane (白銀ゴウカ, Shirogane Gōka)\nVoiced by: Shinya Fukumatsu\nHinoko Shirogane (白銀ひのこ, Shirogane Hinoko)\nVoiced by: Kikuko Inoue\nRin Shirogane (白銀リン, Shirogane Rin)\nVoiced by: Megumi Han\nGus Tennen (天念ガス, Tennen Gasu)\nVoiced by: Daichi Nomura\nKen Nitta (新田ケン, Nitta Ken)\nVoiced by: Ai Terashima\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe game was announced in April 2013 as a cross-media campaign with a Nintendo 3DS \"Custom Armor Action\" game as the core.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=569188",
    "text": "The Volkswagen Transporter (T4), marketed in North America as the Volkswagen EuroVan, is a van produced by the German manufacturer Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles between 1990 and 2004, succeeding the Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) and superseded by the Volkswagen Transporter (T5).\n\n\nHistory\nIntroduced in 1990, the T4 was the first Volkswagen van to have a front-mounted, water-cooled engine. Prompted by the success of similar moves with their passenger cars, Volkswagen had toyed with the idea of replacing their air-cooled, rear-engined T2 vans with a front-engined, water-cooled design in the late 1970s. The reasons for deciding in 1980 to instead introduce a new rear-engined T3 are unclear. Thus, the introduction of a front-engined layout was delayed until the arrival of the T4. After a run of nearly 14 years, T4 production ceased in 2003, making it second only to the T1 for length of production in its home market.\n\n\nChassis\n\nPart of the success of the T4 was its versatility. It was available in many forms and sizes as standard and formed the basis of many specialist vehicles, from buses to campervans to ambulances.\n\n\nWheelbase\nTwo standard wheelbases were available; a short (2920 mm) and a long (3320 mm) one.\n\n\nBody types\n\n\nVan\nPanel Van - without any windows behind the b-pillar; single row of seats\nKombi or Half-Panel - with additional windows between the b and c-pillars; 2 rows of seats\nCaravelle, Multivan and (in the US) EuroVan - with windows all round; 3 rows of seats\n\n\nPickup\nSingle cab - based on a SWB chassis\nDouble cab - based on a LWB chassis (aka Doka, from the German: Doppelkabine)\nRazor back - with a hydraulic rear body that was produced between 1998 and 2000 in the UK\n\n\nRoofs\nPanel vans were available with two different roof heights; standard (1940mm) and high-top (2430mm). High-tops were only manufactured on the LWB chassis, although campervan conversions often have pop-top or (usually fibreglass) high-tops added to both SWB and LWB chassis.\n\n\nDoors\nVans have either a single, roof-hinged \"tailgate\" or two \"barn\" doors at the rear and either a single (passenger side) or twin (both sides) sliding doors but they are commonly only on one side of the van, usually on the passenger side.\n\n\nLong and short-nose\n\nThere was one major facelift to the T4, in 1996, when a reshaped, longer front end was introduced. This was needed to fit the six-cylinder VR6 engine into the T4's engine bay. Initially, only Caravelles and Multivans were available with the longer nose, since these were the only models available with the VR6 engine.\nThe commercial variants continued to be produced with the shorter nose until 2003. However, campers and other specialist vehicles produced between 1996 and 2003 may have either the short or the long nose, depending on which model was used as the base vehicle. In keeping with the Type 2's naming convention, the short and long-nose versions are also informally known as T4a and T4b, respectively.\n\n\nFour Wheel Drive (Syncro)\nThe T4 was also available with a permanent 4WD system that uses a Viscous coupling unit as a centre differential to regulate the distribution of torque to the rear axle. These models are called \"syncro\" and were available with the 2.4D, 2.5Tdi and 2.5 petrol engines on all body types and both wheelbases. Some syncro models also have a mechanically locking rear differential. Since the rear differential precludes the placement of the spare wheel in the usual place under the body, syncro vans either store it inside the body or on an external, hinged bracket.\n\n\nCampervans\nThe T4 is a very popular base for building a small to medium-sized camper and day-vans, both as self-build projects and for professional conversions. Volkswagen themselves also sold campervan versions of the T4. Outside of the US these were made by and named after their contractor, Westfalia-Werke. These Westfalia built campervans were named 'California', except in Canada where they were called simply 'Westfalia'.\n.\nWinnebago Industries was the primary converter of VW T4 campers sold in the US.\n\n\nEngines\n\n\nPetrol engines\n\n\nDiesel engines\nIndirect injection\n\nTurbocharged Direct Injection\n\n\nEnthusiasts' groups\nDue largely to its versatility, as well as popularity as a campervan, the Volkswagen Transporter (including the T4) has an extensive following amongst enthusiasts. Meetings are held regularly throughout the year in countries across Europe and there are several Internet forums dedicated to T4 owners and enthusiasts.\nIn May 2010, the German enthusiasts of the T4 held a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the production of the first T4. Several hundred T4s took part with vans from as far afield as Russia, France, Spain, central Europe and the Nordic countries.\n\n\nT4 in North America (EuroVan)\n\nThe Transporter T4 was exported to North America from 1992 until 2003 under the moniker EuroVan.\nIn the United States, the short wheelbase EuroVan 5-cylinder passenger models (CL, GL, GLS, and MV) were only sold for model year 1993. Smaller than a standard American delivery van, but larger than an American or Japanese passenger minivan, Volkswagen played up its size with the slogan, \"EuroVan: There's nothing mini about it\". Volkswagen only imported them to the U.S. market for one year because sales in the United States were disappointing, but sales continued in Canada and Mexico. Volkswagen reintroduced the EuroVan passenger models in the United States for model year 1999 with a VR6 engine as standard, but discontinued the T4 worldwide after 2003. The manual gearbox was not offered in North America with the VR6 engine.\nVolkswagen imported the short wheelbase EuroVan 5-cylinder petrol engine passenger models (CL, GL, GLS, MV Weekender and Westfalia Camperised) to Canada from 1991 to 1996. The 77 hp 2.4 litre diesel engine was optional in Canada between 1993 and 1996. The long wheelbase version was also on offer in 1992 only as a 10 seaters CL or GL model trim. Kombi and crewcab pickup versions (sold as Transporter) were also available in 1992. A panel version (LWB only) was sold from 1993 to 1997.\nThe EuroVan Camper by Winnebago was introduced to the United States and Canada in 1995 with the five-cylinder engine, and upgraded to the VR6 for the 1997-2003 models. These were only available on the longer 3,320 mm (131 in) wheelbase T4.

    "text": "A halo orbit is a periodic, non-planar orbit associated with one of the L1, L2 or L3 Lagrange points in the three-body problem of orbital mechanics. Although a Lagrange point is just a point in empty space, its peculiar characteristic is that it can be orbited by a Lissajous orbit or by a halo orbit. These can be thought of as resulting from an interaction between the gravitational pull of the two planetary bodies and the Coriolis and centrifugal force on a spacecraft. Halo orbits exist in any three-body system, e.g., a Sun–Earth–orbiting satellite system or an Earth–Moon–orbiting satellite system. Continuous \"families\" of both northern and southern halo orbits exist at each Lagrange point. Because halo orbits tend to be unstable, station-keeping using thrusters may be required to keep a satellite on the orbit.\nMost satellites in halo orbit serve scientific purposes, for example space telescopes.\n\n\nDefinition and history\nRobert W. Farquhar first used the name \"halo\" in 1966 for orbits around L2 which were made periodic using thrusters. Farquhar advocated using spacecraft in such an orbit beyond the Moon (Earth–Moon L2) as a communications relay station for an Apollo mission to the far side of the Moon. A spacecraft in such an orbit would be in continuous view of both the Earth and the far side of the Moon, whereas a Lissajous orbit would sometimes make the spacecraft go behind the Moon. In the end, no relay satellite was launched for Apollo, since all landings were on the near side of the Moon.\nIn 1973 Farquhar and Ahmed Kamel found that when the in-plane amplitude of a Lissajous orbit was large enough there would be a corresponding out-of-plane amplitude that would have the same period, so the orbit ceased to be a Lissajous orbit and became approximately an ellipse. They used analytical expressions to represent these halo orbits; in 1984, Kathleen Howell showed that more precise trajectories could be computed numerically. Additionally, she found that for most values of the ratio between the masses of the two bodies (such as the Earth and the Moon) there was a range of stable orbits.\nThe first mission to use a halo orbit was ISEE-3, a joint ESA and NASA spacecraft launched in 1978. It traveled to the Sun–Earth L1 point and remained there for several years. The next mission to use a halo orbit was Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), also a joint ESA/NASA mission to study the Sun, which arrived at Sun–Earth L1 in 1996. It used an orbit similar to ISEE-3. Although several other missions since then have traveled to Lagrange points, they (eg. Gaia astrometric space observatory) typically have used the related non-periodic variations called Lissajous orbits rather than an actual halo orbit.\nAlthough halo orbits were well known in the RTBP (Restricted Three Body Problem), it was difficult to obtain Halo orbits for the real Earth-Moon system.  Translunar halo orbits were first computed in 1998 by M.A. Andreu, who introduced a new model for the motion of a spacecraft in the Earth-Moon-Sun system, which was called Quasi-Bicircular Problem (QBCP).\nIn May 2018, Farquhar's original idea was finally realized when China placed the first communications relay satellite, Queqiao, into a halo orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 point. On 3 January 2019, the Chang'e 4 spacecraft landed in the Von Kármán crater on the far side of the Moon, using the Queqiao relay satellite to communicate with the Earth.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope entered a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point on 24 January 2022. Euclid entered a similar orbit around this point in August 2023.\nIndia's space agency ISRO launched Aditya-L1 to study the Sun from a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L1 point. On 6 January 2024, the spacecraft, India's first solar mission, successfully entered a halo orbit with a period of approximately 178 days, at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.\n\n\nSee also\nInterplanetary Transport Network – Low-energy trajectories in the Solar System\nInterplanetary spaceflight – Crewed or uncrewed travel between stars or planets\nLissajous orbit – Quasi-periodic orbital trajectory, another Lagrangian-point orbit which generalizes halo orbits.\nNear-rectilinear halo orbit – Periodic, three-dimensional orbit\nCategory:Spacecraft using halo orbits\nLibration point orbit – Quasiperiodic orbit around a Lagrange point\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nSOHO – The Trip to the L1 Halo Orbit\nLow Energy Interplanetary Transfers Using Halo Orbit Hopping Method with STK/Astrogator\nGaia's Lissajous Type Orbit – a Lissajous-type orbit, i.e., a near-circular ellipse or \"halo\"",

In 1089, David IV became the King of Georgia and began to actively reform the country. In 1103 he convened the \"Ruis-Urbnisi Church Council\" at which he purged the clerical hierarchy of his opponents. The aim was the subjection of the church to state power, which was necessary for David given his plans of centralization and the reordering of church affairs.\nHe gave unprecedented power to his friend and advisor George of Chqondidi. The office of the powerful Archbishop of Chqondidi was merged with that of Mtsignobartukhutsesi, chief adviser to the king on all state issues, and the new office of Chqondidel-Mtsignobartukhutsesi introduced direct royal authority into the church. The new chancellor also was given judicial powers and influence in both domestic and foreign affairs. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families.\nRuis-Urbnisi Council adopted a special Code (Dzeglistsera lit. \"pillar-writing\"). It's believed that the author of the \"Code\" is Arsen Iqaltoeli, the translator of the \"Great Nomocanon\". It condemned Armenian Monophysitism in stronger terms than ever before.\n\n\nSources\nSynod of Ruis-Urbnisi (1103), ed. E. Gabidzashvili, Tbilisi, 1978",

    "text": "Lithuanian Braille is the braille alphabet of the Lithuanian language.\n\n\nAlphabet and digits\nThe alphabet and digits are mapped as follows: \n\nMost of the print letters with accents are derived in Lithuanian braille by adding a dot 6 to the base letter, and those which already have a dot 6 through inversion (cf. Czech Braille, Esperanto Braille). Ū uses the international convention for a second u. Ž is unusual, but perhaps forms a set with s, š, z (cf. Hungarian Braille). \n\nSeveral of these conventions are also used in Polish Braille.\n\n\nPunctuation\n\nSource:\n\n\nSignalling marks\nDue to the limited number of different braille dot combinations, it's impossible to express all different characters using their own distinct dot combinations. To alleviate this, most braille writing systems use additional signalling marks which affect the values of the dot combinations that immediately follow them. The standard marks in Lithuanian braille are:\n\nFor example, ⠨⠁⠃ is read as 'Ab', and ⠼⠁⠃ as number '12'.\nThe cancelling mark ⠠ is only used when necessary, that is, when a number or multiple uppercase letters are immediately followed by a lowercase letter.\n\n\nHistory\nLithuanian alphabet was originally adapted for braille by Pranas Daunys in 1927.\nIn 1999, Daunys' adaptation was revised and aligned more closely with braille alphabets used by other Latin-based languages. Mappings of letters U, V, W, and Z to braille dots were changed to match international convention, affecting mappings for Ė and Ū in the process. This revised Lithuanian braille alphabet was officially mandated for use in education in 2000, and has been in use since.\nIn addition to the alphabet, a much more complete braille writing system was standardised in 2019 as a National Annex to ISO 17049 (LST ISO 17049/NA). The annex covers braille usage for literary works, math, physics, chemistry, music, chess, and checkers.\n\n\nEight-dot braille\nTwo versions of the eight-dot braille writing system were standardised in 2011. In practice, both of them are barely used, as is acknowledged by the 2019 standard.\nThe eight-dot braille doesn't use the signalling markers from 6-dot braille mentioned above. Instead, uppercase letters are marked with dot-7 (lower left), and numbers with dot-8 (lower right). For example, ⡁ is read as letter 'A', and ⢁ as digit '1'.\n\n\nReferences\n\nVisuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija. Vilnius, 2001",

    "text": "The Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility (LDF) is an agreement between the governments of Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom which enables UK citizens to declare previously undisclosed assets to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The LDF, which came into force on 1 September 2009, is a subsidy designed to encourage individuals voluntarily to regularize their affairs. The scheme offers more favourable terms than other tax investigations, with participants normally receiving a fine of 10 per cent of tax due instead of 100 per cent, with tax interest and penalties only sought for the previous 10 years rather than the previous 20 years.\n\n\nBackground\nFollowing the 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair, the Liechtenstein financial centre worked to develop a solution with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to promote compliance within the country. The Liechtenstein task force was led by Fritz Kaiser, executive chairman at wealth management firm Kaiser Partner, and the conclusion was a pledge to transparency called the Liechtenstein Declaration. A direct outcome of this pledge was a solution for UK taxpayers to disclose previously undeclared offshore assets called the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility, an approach to compliance developed by Philip Marcovici, a now retired tax lawyer, independent member of the board of Kaiser Partner and an advisor to the Liechtenstein Government. Philip Marcovici and Fritz Kaiser received an award from Spear's for their work in relation to the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility and related arrangements.\n\n\nStructure of the LDF agreement\nThe details of the LDF are outlined in a ‘'Memorandum of Understanding'’ between the Liechtenstein authorities and HMRC. Under the agreement, Liechtenstein banks and other financial intermediaries are required to identify 'relevant persons' (i.e. accounts with UK addresses which might have UK tax liability) and contact them about their tax affairs. These 'relevant persons' must then register with HMRC that they wish to use the LDF and provide their financial institution with a relevant certificate. \nBut for those with assets already in Liechtenstein or who create a 'footprint' in the country, disclosure can be made voluntarily without prior contact from a financial institution. This means those who have undeclared assets in another offshore jurisdiction can bring that account within the terms of the LDF by opening a new account in Liechtenstein.   \nOnce registered under the LDF, an individual has up to 10 months to complete their disclosure to HMRC. Tax liabilities declared under the LDF only need to cover the timeframe after 6 April 1999 rather than the standard 20 year assessment period. Furthermore, when under a tax investigation, an individual could be exposed to 20 years of back taxes plus interest, a potential 100 per cent penalty or criminal prosecution. However, under the LDF, there is normally only a 10 per cent penalty as well as assurance that no criminal investigation will be initiated.\n\n\nOutcome\nWriting in STEP Magazine, Dr. Ariel Sergio Goekmen of Kaiser Partner Privatbank AG compared the benefits of the LDF with the UK-Swiss tax agreement. He writes that \"It seems the view of the tax planning and accounting industry is that currently the LDF is the best and probably the cheapest route for concerned parties who wish to regularise their tax affairs and regain full control of the underlying assets\". He notes that the success of the LDF is due to the fact that it is structured, safe, can be implemented very quickly and can be used to regain control over globally diversified assets.\nIn an interview with Accountancy Age, the UK's permanent secretary for tax, Dave Hartnett, estimated 1,200 people had now used the LDF and that returns from declarations might reach £3 billion rather than the £1 billion originally predicted. The popularity of the scheme resulted in an extension of the original 2015 deadline to 5 April 2016 however the Chancellor George Osborne used his final 2015 Budget statement of this Parliament to announce an unexpected early closure date of 31 December 2015.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nLiechtenstein Disclosure Facility (LDF) – A reference website for the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility with a knowledge base of official HMRC documents and news about the LDF.",

While the premise of a bereaved comedian dealing with the tragic death of a loved one had potential for drama and angst, the protagonist's \"path to healing, though, is made Easy-Bake simple\" by director David Wexler, whose use of father-finding-unhappy-son the perfect job where he then meets \"perfect-match Veronica (Margarita Levieva)\", then allows the protagonist of Zoe to become a \"passive participant in his own healing, which Wexler leaves so uncomplicated that the story simply coasts along on a smooth path to happily ever after.\"  It was concluded, \"regrettably, it’s impossible for the film or its star to do little more than recall other recent comedies and performers: the superior School of Rock for one and, via the portly Sollis’s eerily similar voice, Jonah Hill.\"\nThe Hollywood Reporter felt it was an \"unconvincing indie effort\" whose premise and role were more suitable as vehicles for Jack Black or Seth Rogen.  In a project where a \"depressed comedian becomes an unlikely kindergarten teacher\", it was felt that despite its potential, \"the film never manages to find a consistent footing, shifting uneasily in tone and haltingly proceeding with its formulaic plotting.\"  Further, for a stand-up comic, the character of Zoe Hardwick \"proves to be remarkably unfunny, and Sollis lacks the necessary charisma to make us fully care about his undeveloped character.\"  And while praising Margarita Levieva as a highly appealing love interest, \"she’s unable to overcome the sheer implausibility of her character’s falling in love with the charmless Zoe.\"  Praise went to Aidan Quinn's role as Zoe's father for giving \"a drolly humorous performance that enlivens every scene in which he appears. While it’s hard to imagine how exactly this talented veteran actor wound up appearing in this low-budget affair, moviegoers are not likely to look a gift horse in the mouth.\"\nThe New York Times wrote that writer/director David Wexler was to be commended for taking viewers where might be expected in an \"oaf-in-kiddieland story\", but also offered it was \"too bad that he didn’t bring a little more creativity to the predictable tale he does fashion\".  Granting that the film had Kindergarten Cop and School of Rock moments\" and Jonathan Sollis having a physique similar to Jack Black, rather than being a comedy, \"the focus soon shifts to finding Zoe a rebound romance. Conveniently, a good-looking fellow teacher (Margarita Levieva) is available. (For those keeping score, that’s two hot women inexplicably attracted to a moping schlump.)\"  It was offered that Levieva shows her range and \"is quite watchable\" but \"Sollis can’t always handle the naturalistic acting style Mr. Wexler demands\". It was concluded that \"the main shortcoming of this film is that the story Mr. Wexler finally decides to tell is utterly ordinary.\"\nConversely, CultureMap Austin spoke toward the film's debut at the Austin Film Festival and offered that it might have been better named \"The Kindergarten Teacher\", as \"stand up comedy bookends the film but doesn't really play an important symbolic or therapeutic role\".  It was felt that while the premise of a stand-up comic dealing with the death of a girlfriend by taking a job as a kindergarten teacher \"sounds like something from a wacky Jonah Hill comedy,\" the film managed to execute it \"with restraint and complexity in a surprising way\".  It was also offered that Margarita Levieva's role of a fellow teacher and sympathetic new love interest allowed her to \"elevate the character well out of Manic Pixie Dream Girl Territory\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nThe Stand Up at IMDb\nThe Stand Up, 67% at Rotten Tomatoes",

    "text": "David Brog (born 1965/1966) is the former executive director of Christians United for Israel (CUFI), an American pro-Israel Christian organization, and a conservative activist.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, Brog served as an executive at America Online and practiced corporate law both in Israel and the United States. In the early 1990s, Brog practiced in Israel.\nAfterwards he worked in the United States Senate for seven years, where he eventually became the chief of staff to Senator Arlen Specter and staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBrog is often considered a protégé of American philanthropists Miriam and Sheldon Adelson. In July 2015, Brog was tapped to head a new group called Maccabee Task Force, an entity formed by the Adelsons and fellow philanthropist Haim Saban to combat Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions activities on college campuses. Brog was seen as a surprising choice due to his position far from the mainstream within pro-Israel position, according to a Jewish organizational official speaking to The Forward in 2015. Nonetheless, the official found Brog's past success in organizational development explanatory regarding his appointment.\nAccording to David Krone, Harry Reid's chief of staff, Brog was key in securing House Republican support for the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which passed in 2016.\nHe co-founded the Edmund Burke Foundation with Yoram Hazony. As part of that foundation's work, Hazony and Brog organized the National Conservatism Conference. They hoped to develop the frame the development and growth of conservatism through the conference.\n\n\nChristians United For Israel leadership\nBrog helped found Christians United For Israel (CUFI), an American pro-Israel Christian organization. CUFI founder and San Antonio-based Pentecostal preacher John Hagee hired Brog in 2006. Hagee did so as a solution to his organization's lack of pull in political circles; with Brog's political connections and ability, Hagee hoped to extend influence from the familiar broadcast radio to the unfamiliar Washington, D.C.\nBrog said in 2015 that his first task upon joining CUFI was to tap into existing bases of Christian Zionist support. Around 2015, the organization was exploring the idea of expanded political engagement, whether through Washington office focused on lobbying or through the development of a political action committee.\nAccording to Sander Gerber, a major player in the passage of the Taylor Force Act, a bill passed in 2018 that halted aid to the Palestinian Authority until it stops paying the families of deceased terrorists, Brog played a role in the bill's passage. Brog brought CUFI into the lobbying effort to pass the bill, bringing evangelical groups on board long before Jewish groups entered the arena, according to Gerber.\n\n\n2022 Republican Nevada congressional primary\nIn 2022, Brog ran for Republican Congressional nominee in Nevada's 1st congressional district. He lost in an eight-way race, finishing second with 17% to former Army colonel Mark Robertson's 30%. Brog announced his entry into the race in February and raised $284,000 in the first six weeks, including a $50k loan to himself. By June, Brog had spent $187k. His campaign spent $59k on mail advertisements and $88.5k on \"media placements\". This left his campaign with $174k in remaining cash at that point. By that point in the campaign, Brog had received endorsements from Genie Energy PAC, the Hindu American PAC, and former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nBrog described \"securing our Southern border and finishing Trump's border wall\" as among his top priorities.\n\n\nEducation and early life\nBrog was born in Margate City, New Jersey, a community near Atlantic City. His parents were largely secular, his father Eugene attending synagogue only for the high holidays. His Zionism was fostered after reading The Revolt by Menachem Begin while a student at Atlantic City High School.\nBrog attended Princeton University for his bachelor's degree. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991.\n\n\nPersonal life\nHe is a cousin of former Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak, whose original surname was also \"Brog\" until he Hebraized it to Barak in 1972. He is married to an Israeli-American woman.\nBrog is Jewish. He occasionally attends his local Orthodox synagogues, Young Israel Aish HaTorah and Chabad. He does not work on Shabbat. Before moving to Nevada, Brog lived in Texas.\n\n\nViews\nBrog says he was a Democrat until law school.\nIn 2014, Brog expressed concern in Middle East Quarterly that traditional reflexive American evangelical Christian support for Israel was waning.\n\n\nBooks\nReclaiming Israel's History: Roots, Rights, and the Struggle for Peace (2017)\nIn Defense of Faith: The Judeo-Christian Idea and the Struggle for Humanity (2010)\nStanding With Israel: Why Christians Support the Jewish State  (2006)\nBrog's Standing With Israel is an attempt to establish Christian Zionists as both allies to the Jewish people and not motivated by replacement theology. Brog details in four chapters how Christian Zionists aided in the establishment of the State of Israel. He poses modern Zionist evangelicals as the heirs to the righteous gentiles of World War II. Nikolas K. Gvosdev says in his review for the Journal of Church and State that the book \"suffers from the fact that its author wants to make definitive statements on a variety of issues while ignoring inconvenient details\", a byproduct of the book's nature as a political polemic. Brog's primary audience is other members of the Jewish community.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Brog's Blog\" at Christians United For Israel\nDavid Brog's website Archived 2020-01-11 at the Wayback Machine",

It is located 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) east of Humboldt on Highway 5.\n\n\nHistory\nMuenster incorporated as a town on August 18, 1908.\nSt. Peter's Abbey began in 1903 with the arrival of seven Benedictine monks.\nIn 1921 St. Peter's Abbey became the Territorial Abbey of Saint Peter-Muenster. The abbot's duties were similar to those of a bishop of a diocese. The Territorial Abbey was suppressed in 1998 to become part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saskatoon.\nThe historic territory of the abbey was also referred to as St. Peter's Colony. The villages and parishes in St. Peter's Colony included: St. Peter's monastery and parish at Muenster, St. Boniface (Leofeld), Englefeld, Annaheim, Bruno, St. Joseph (Old Fulda), Marysburg, Humboldt, Lake Lenore, St. John Baptist (Willmont), Watson, St. Martin, St. Scholastico, St. Patrick's, St. Oswald Immaculate Conception. Dana, St. Gregor, St. Bernard (Old Pilger), St. Leo (St. Meinrad), St. Gertrude, Carmel, Peterson, Cudworth, Naicam, Holy Family Mission, St. Benedict, Pilger, St. James, and Middle Lake.\nThe majority of the early settlers in the region were German speaking Roman Catholics from the United States.\nIn 1938, a German-language newspaper published in Muenster, St. Peter's Bode, was \"banned from Germany by order of Heinrich Himmler, chief of the National police.\" The paper's editor, Reverend Father Peters, responded: \"All we did was print the facts. We carried little editorial content or criticism on German affairs.\"\n\n\nClimate\n\n\nDemographics\n\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Muenster had a population of 403 living in 173 of its 186 total private dwellings, a change of -6.3% from its 2016 population of 430. With a land area of 1.36 km2 (0.53 sq mi), it had a population density of 296.3/km2 (767.5/sq mi) in 2021.\nIn the 2016 Census of Population, the Village of Muenster recorded a population of 430 living in 176 of its 184 total private dwellings, a 1.9% change from its 2011 population of 422. With a land area of 1.33 km2 (0.51 sq mi), it had a population density of 323.3/km2 (837.4/sq mi) in 2016.\n\n\nEducation\nMuenster is home to St. Peter's College, an affiliate of the University of Saskatchewan. It was founded by the Benedictine monks of St. Peter's Abbey in 1921. The college offers a full first year of Arts and Sciences classes and senior classes in several disciplines. Annual full-time enrollment is limited to 150 students.\n\n\nMuenster landmarks\n\nSt. Peter's Cathedral features paintings and murals by the artist Berthold Imhoff\nThe skyline of Muenster is mainly defined by the steeples of St. Peter's College and Abbey\nMuenster Hill is a popular local tobogganing destination\nSt. Peter's College library is the third largest book repository in Saskatchewan\nWolverine Creek runs through Muenster, past St. Peter's College and Abbey\n\n\nEvents\nSt. Peter's Abbey is host to the annual Junior and Teen Choir Camps of the Saskatchewan Choral Federation.\n\n\nSports\nMuenster was home to the Muenster Red Sox, a senior baseball team. The Red Sox played in the North Central Baseball League from 1964–2003 and have in the Saskatoon Senior League until 2009. The Muenster Midget AAA Red Sox currently compete in the Saskatchewan Premier Baseball League, capturing the provincial title in 2016 and winning a bronze medal at nationals that same year.

    "text": "Brent Richard Sherman (born May 24, 1974) is an American professional racing driver. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 28 Ford Mustang for RSS Racing. He has also previously competed in the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Truck Series, ARCA Racing Series and the Firestone Indy Lights Series.\n\n\nRacing career\nSherman's route to NASCAR was not like that of most drivers. After high school, he completed a six-year enlistment in the U.S. Air Force as an Air Surveillance Technician on the E-3 AWACS. It was during his last year in the Air Force that racing caught Sherman's attention. After a trip to the Jim Russell Racing School in Sonoma, California, Sherman was asked to compete for a racing scholarship in the Russell Champ Series. He won the scholarship and his racing career began.\nDuring the next few years Sherman competed in several different racing series including the Barber Dodge Pro Series, Grand American Road Racing Association and the ARCA Re/Max Series.\nIn 2003, driving a Ford sponsored by Serta Mattresses, he collected six top-five and eleven top-ten finishes in ARCA competition and finished fourth in the final point standings. The following year he posted nine top-five and fourteen top-ten finishes, which placed him second in the series’ point standings. He also received the prestigious Bill France Triple Crown honor and the HG Adcox Sportsman of the Year Award.\nWhen he competed in ARCA in 2004, Sherman won the ARCA Re/Max Series Bill France Triple Crown Honor as well as the Grant Adcox Sportsmanship Award.\n\nSherman competed in a handful of NASCAR Busch Series races in 2004 in the No. 58 Serta Dodge for Akins Motorsports and planned to run a full schedule with the team in 2005. Glynn Motorsports bought out his team and after eleven races and one top-ten finish between the two teams, Sherman and his sponsors parted ways with the team. In July 2005, Sherman signed on with ppc Racing, replacing Michel Jourdain Jr., and brought the Serta sponsorship with him (along with Hickory Farms and Consort hair spray).\nIn 2006, Sherman moved up to the NEXTEL Cup Series. Bringing Serta as his primary sponsor, he was signed to drive the No. 49 for BAM Racing, replacing Ken Schrader, who moved to Wood Brothers Racing that year. His best finish was a 21st place finish in the Daytona 500. After poor performance, BAM Racing asked Sherman to step aside while the team tested other drivers. He resigned from the team (taking the sponsorship with him) and returned to the ARCA Re/Max Series for the remainder of the 2006 season. This turned out to be a good move, and Sherman scored his first ARCA win at Michigan, and finished nineteenth in points despite starting the season late. In 2007, he left ARCA again and returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 36 Big Lots Chevy for McGill Motorsports. He departed the team in September, and would spend the remainder of the season driving a limited schedule for Braun Racing in their No. 10 Toyota.\nOn February 19, 2008, it was announced that Sherman had signed with Panther Racing to move to the Firestone Indy Lights Series for the 2008 season. He finished 11th in points with a best finish of 3rd which came in the first race of the year at Homestead-Miami Speedway. His best road course finish was tenth in a rain drenched attrition filled race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.\nIn 2009, he drove in a few Camping World Truck Series races for Stringer Motorsports in the No. 90 Great Clips Toyota as well as one ARCA race at Salem, also in Stringer's No. 90.\nAfter five years of being without a ride, Sherman came back to stock car racing in a one-off attempt with Mason Mitchell's No. 98 team in the ARCA race at Chicago in 2016. He shook the rust off pretty quickly and earned a top-ten finish in ninth after qualifying eleventh. Sherman would not run any races in any series until 2023. When the Chicago Street Course was added to the NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series schedules, he wanted to come back and race there. He would run the Xfinity Series race at the street course driving the No. 28 car for RSS Racing.\n\n\nPersonal life\nSherman is a veteran of the United States Air Force. He currently lives in Chicago with his teenage children and was inspired to return to run the Chicago Street Race when it was added to the Xfinity Series schedule so he could race in his hometown and have his children see him race as they were too young to remember the last NASCAR race he ran.

    "text": "Lake Mallalieu is located in St. Croix County, Wisconsin just inside of North Hudson, Wisconsin. The man-made lake is 289 acres (117 ha) with a maximum depth of 17 feet (5.2 m). It is a flowage lake almost on the Minnesota border connected to both the Willow River and the St. Croix River.\n\n\nHistory\nTo understand how the man-make lake originated, we must understand its source, the Willow River. The Willow River flows into Lake Mallalieu, and similar to the other rivers in the area, is a product of the continental glaciation. At the end of the Ice Age, a mile-thick massive ice sheet spread into Wisconsin until about 10,000 years ago when the warm climate forced it to retreat, creating the Willow River.\nThe Willow River, which would eventually run into Lake Mallalieu, carved channels around the lake and formed high banks surrounding. After its foundational period, the Willow settled into what we see today.  Vegetation stabilized the watershed, which reduced the erosion until the nineteenth century settlement.\n\n\nEarly years\nThe first settlers of Hudson, French-Canadians brothers-in-law Louis Massey and Peter Bouchea, found a place to call home at the mouth of the Willow in 1840. In 1848, the first dam and sawmill was built by James Purrington, which created a lake called Willow Pond. Settlement became more popular because of the steamboat and practical transportation provided by the nearby St. Croix River. In 1854, Caleb Greene built the second dam, known as “brush dam.” The dams were bought by D.A. Baldwin of the West Wisconsin Railroad in 1867 and then again by Comstock and Clark who made further improvements.\nIn 1867, Henry and William Montman built a brewery on the south shore of the Willow Pond. The brewery now would be located where the public boat launch is, and used the caves for aging the beer. After multiple owners, the brewery burned down in 1917, but was never rebuilt due to the prohibition.\nIn 1871, the railroad arrival made a drastic change for Hudson. The railroad was located on the cliffs hanging about the lake, and with the railroad and the rivers, it was an important spot for transportation and settlement.\n\n\nMiddle years\nIn 1887, Willow Pond became what we know as Lake Mallalieu. During this time, Dr. Irving Wiltrout was building Hudson’s first hospital and in honor of him, the Hudson Star & Times wanted to name the lake “Lake Irving,” which the doctor declined and said, “I have named this lake in honor of Rev. William F. Mallalieu, D.D., L.L.D., Bishop of the Methodist church and a resident of New Orleans.”\nIn the 1890s, The Willow had been known from the earliest days as a fine trout stream, but a St. Paul group bought a tract of land along the river below Willow Falls and established the exclusive Willow River Club, which was fenced in and controlled by members. Local, Frank Wade, challenged this because he didn’t want his fishing curtailed. After being arrested for trespassing, he eventually won his case and it became issued that “the Willow River was a public, navigable stream, and the defendant was not guilty of catching the fish in question.” This led to free use of the lakes and rivers by the public.\nOn April 5, 1934 the Willow got its second big flood, washing out dams upstream. The debris and floodwaters cause severe damage on Mallalieu, such as the bridge collapsing, railroad trestle and the large dam on the St. Croix. Lake Mallalieu emptied into the St. Croix River. Today, we now see the new bridge that was built as a result of this flood as well as the new dams.\n\n\nPresent\nDuring the late 1950s, Mallalieu started being recognized as an ideal and great place to live and raise a family. Prior, there had only been a few houses and cottages build on the lake. in the 1960s, large parcels started being divided into lots, and the building has continued since then until now, when essentially all the buildable sites are already in use.\nLake Mallalieu experienced a record flood in 1965 when the lake rose three to four feet over its normal level, covering parts of Riverside Drive almost 2 feet deep. In the spring of 2020 lake Mallalieu flooded again after the newly constructed Willow River dam failed to hold back flood waters following a large rainstorm. Neighbors all along Riverside Drive banded together to take out docks and boats before the flood waters could cause significant damage.\n\n\nBiology\nThe fish found in the lake include Panfish, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Northern Pike. Invasive species noticed there are Curly-leaf Pondweed, Eurasion Watermilfoil, and Rusty Crayfish.\n\n\nReferences",

She earned the bronze medal at the 2017 World Championships and was the flag bearer of her country with the olympic swimmer Florent Manaudou during the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies.\n\n\nDiscus career\nAt the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Robert-Michon won the discus silver medal with her last throw – a distance of 66.28 metres – which broke her own national record (65.78 m) set 11 years prior on 17 July 2002. Her 66.28 metres was much better than her hitherto, 2013 best distance of 63.75m. She had never finished better than eighth place in the final in her four previous World Championships appearances.  She became the first male or female French athlete to win a World Championships medal in the discus event. Right after securing the silver medal, she told a television interviewer, \"I had been working hard a long time for this. Since the start of the season, I said that I wanted to climb onto the podium. Many people laughed at it and did not quite believe it. I have been waiting so long for this.”\nIn December 2013, Robert-Michon was chosen as the 2013 French female athlete of the year, according to an Internet poll taken from the athletics fraternity, in which more than 2500 votes were cast over two weeks. The poll was conducted by the Fédération française d'athlétisme.\nOn 25 June 2016, Robert-Michon won her 16th French National Discus Championship, by throwing 63.40 m, less than 1 metre more than the runner-up Pauline Pousse (62.68 m). She finished fifth at the 2016 European Championships in Amsterdam with a throw of 62.47m in the final, after having thrown 63.99m in the qualifying round (which would have been good enough for the bronze medal).\nRobert-Michon's achieved her best result in her fifth Olympic appearance at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. 16 years after her first Olympic appearance at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, she won the silver medal at the age of 37; her throw of 66.73m in the final beat her own French national record and was 2.48 m less than the distance registered by the Croatian winner Sandra Perković. Robert-Michon finished in 2nd place at both the 2016 Meeting de Paris (27 August, 64.36 m) and the 2016 Weltklasse Zurich (1 September, 63.91 m), behind the winner Sandra Perković in both competitions.\nIn December 2016, she was chosen for the second in her career as the 2016 French female athlete of the year, ahead of trail-runner Caroline Cheverot and 800 m European silver medalist Rénelle Lamote.\nAfter a difficult season struggled by minor injuries, the French managed to win the bronze medal at the World Championships in London behind Croatia's Sandra Perković and Australia's Dani Stevens, both former world champions. Her result of 66.21m is her best throw of the season, and the third best of his career (behind 66.73m in 2016 and 66.28m in 2013).\nIn January 2018, she retained her « French female athlete of the year award » for the second consecutive year, this time for 2017, well ahead of world trail-runner champion Adeline Roche and 400 m runner Floria Gueï. She is the first athlete to win three times the award.\n\n\nFamily\nRobert-Michon has a daughter named Elyssa, born on 24 August 2010.

The Memorial was built on Hill 145, the highest point of the ridge to commemorate the battle and the Canadian soldiers who lost their lives during the First World War. The Memorial is also the site of the Canadian Cemetery No. 2, Neuville-St.-Vaast and Givenchy Road Canadian Cemetery, Neuville-St.-Vaast.\nThe Neuville-St Vaast German war cemetery (also called Maison Blanche) is the largest in France from WWI, with 44,833 buried here.\n\n\nGeography\nNeuville-Saint-Vaast is 4 miles (6 km) north of Arras. Vimy Ridge rises from Neuville-St.-Vaast to its high point at Hill 145 (the location of the Canadian Memorial), where there is a steep drop off.\n\n\nHistory\nIn World War I, Neuville-Saint-Vaast was the location of intense mining activity by the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers. In March 1916, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company relieved the French 7/1 compagnie d'ingénieurs territoriaux in the \"Labyrinth\" sector of the Western Front. The German \"Labyrinth\" stronghold was located near Neuville-Saint-Vaast, between Roclincourt and Écurie and not far from Notre Dame de Lorette. On 29 March 1916, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company exchanged position with the 185th Tunnelling Company and moved to Roclincourt-Chantecler, a kilometre south of their old sector.  The 176th Tunnelling Company  moved to Neuville-Saint-Vaast in April 1916 and remained there for a considerable time, as did the 172nd Tunnelling Company, which was relieved at Neuville-Saint-Vaast by the 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company in May 1916.\n\n\nPopulation\n\n\nPlaces of interest\nCanadian National Vimy Memorial\nNeuville-St Vaast German war cemetery\n\n\nNotable people\nHenri Gaudier-Brzeska, sculptor, died in the fighting here on the 5 June 1915.\nFrançois Hennebique, an inventor of reinforced concrete, was born here on the 26 April 1842.\n\n\nSee also\nCommunes of the Pas-de-Calais department\nGivenchy Road Canadian Cemetery\nCanadian Cemetery No. 2\nNeuville-St Vaast German war cemetery\nBattle of Vimy Ridge\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website of the commune (in French)\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission British cemetery at Neuville-Saint-Vaast (La Targette)",

The team was named in honor of the Oneida Football Club, the first ever organized football team in the United States, which operated from 1862–1865. Together with the New Jersey Turnpike Titans and the Rhode Island Rebellion, they were one of three new teams to join the league.\nThe club operated under the leadership the USARL's other Boston-based team, the Boston Thirteens, but competed as a separate team. The establishment of Oneida FC put two USARL teams in Boston, and four in New England, an arrangement that lowered operating costs. The team struggled on the field in their inaugural season but found success in recruiting players from other sports.\nOneida finished the 2012 season in sixth place, missing the playoffs. They were initially announced to compete in 2013, but withdrew before the season, along with the New Haven Warriors.\nOneida FC played all home games at Henry G.

    "text": "Arcesilaus (; Ancient Greek: Ἀρκεσίλαος; 316/5–241/0 BC) was a Greek Hellenistic philosopher. He was the founder of Academic Skepticism and what is variously called the Second or Middle or New Academy – the phase of the Platonic Academy in which it embraced philosophical skepticism.\nArcesilaus succeeded Crates of Athens as the sixth scholarch of the academy around 264 BC. He did not preserve his thoughts in writing, so his opinions can only be gleaned second-hand from what is preserved by later writers.\nIn Athens Arcesilaus interacted with the Pyrrhonist philosopher, Timon of Phlius, whose philosophy appears to have influenced Arcesilaus to become the first Academic to adopt a position of philosophical skepticism, that is, he doubted the ability of the senses to discover truth about the world, although he may have continued to believe in the existence of truth itself. This brought in the skeptical phase of the academy. His chief opponent was his contemporary, Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, whose dogma of katalepsis (i.e., that reality could be comprehended with certainty) Arcesilaus denied.\n\n\nLife\nArcesilaus was born in Pitane in Aeolis. His early education was provided by Autolycus the mathematician, with whom he migrated to Sardis. Afterwards, he studied rhetoric in Athens. He then studied philosophy, becoming a disciple first of Theophrastus and afterwards of Crantor. He also attended the school of Pyrrho, whose philosophy he maintained, except in name. He subsequently became intimate with Polemo and Crates of Athens, who made Arcesilaus his successor as scholarch (head) of the Platonic Academy. \nDiogenes Laërtius says that, like his successor Lacydes, Arcesilaus died of excessive drinking, but the testimony of others (e.g. Cleanthes, who said that he lived a dutiful life) and his own precepts discredit the story. He is known to have been much respected by the Athenians.\n\n\nPhilosophy\n\nArcesilaus committed nothing to writing. His opinions were imperfectly known to his contemporaries, and can now only be gathered from the statements of later writers. This makes his philosophy difficult to evaluate and partly inconsistent. This led scholars to see his skepticism in several ways. Some see his philosophy as completely negative or destructive of all philosophical views. Others regard him as taking the position that nothing can be known on the basis of his philosophical arguments. Others claimed he held no positive views on any philosophical topic, including the possibility of knowledge.\nArcesilaus' contemporary, Aristo of Chios, described Arcesilaus as being: \"Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus\" meaning that Arcesilaus presented himself as a Platonist, the substance of what he taught was the dialectics of Diodorus, but his actual philosophy was that of Pyrrhonism. Eusebius, probably quoting Aristocles of Messene, reported that Arcesilaus studied in Pyrrho's school and adhered, except in name, to Pyrrhonism. Numenius of Apamea said \"Arcesilaus accompanied Pyrrho. He remained Pyrrhonist in his rejection of everything, except in name. At least the Pyrrhonists Mnaseas,  Philomelos and Timon call him a Pyrrhonist, just as they were themselves, because he too rejected the true, the false, and the persuasive.\"  Sextus Empiricus said that Arcesilaus' philosophy appeared essentially the same as Pyrrhonism, but granted that this might have been superficial.\nOn the one hand, Arcesilaus professed to be no innovator, but a reviver of the dogma-free dialectic that had characterized the academy under Plato. Thus he is said to have restored the doctrines of Plato in an uncorrupted form. On the other hand, according to Cicero, he summed up his opinions in the formula, \"that he knew nothing, not even his own ignorance.\" There are two ways of reconciling the difficulty: either we may suppose him to have thrown out such aphorisms as an exercise for his pupils, as Sextus Empiricus, who calls him a \"skeptic\", would have us believe; or he may have really doubted the esoteric meaning of Plato, and have supposed himself to have been stripping his works of the figments of the Dogmatists, while he was in fact taking from them all certain principles.\nCicero attributes the following argument to Arcesilaus:\n(i) it is rash and shameful to assent to something false or unknown, but since\n(ii) nothing can be known (and obviously we shouldn't do what is rash and shameful),\n(iii) we should suspend judgment about everything\nZeno of Citium and the other Stoics were the chief opponents of Arcesilaus. He attacked their dogma of katalêptikê phantasia (i.e., a convincing conception) as understood to be a mean between episteme (knowledge) and doxa (opinion). He argued that this mean could not exist. It involved a contradiction in terms, as the very idea of phantasia implied the possibility of false as well as true conceptions of the same object. As such, it was merely the interpolation of a name.\n\n\nCommentary on Arcesilaus\nThe Pyrrhonist philosopher and contemporary of Arcesilaus, Timon of Phlius ridiculed Arcesilaus in his Silloi, but also praised him in Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus. Fragments from Timon about Arcesilaus include:\n\n\"Having the lead of Menedemus at his heart, he will run either to that mass of flesh, Pyrrho, or to Diodorus.\"\n\"I shall swim to Pyrrho and to crooked Diodorus.\"\n\"And mixing sound sense with wily cavils.\"\nThe Greek Middle Platonist philosopher, historian, biographer, essayist, and priest Plutarch wrote (Adversus Colotem, section 26):\n\"But the reputation of Arcesilaus, who was the best beloved and most esteemed of all the philosophers in his time, seems to have been no small eyesore to Epicurus; who says of him that, delivering nothing peculiar to himself or of his own invention, he imprinted in illiterate men an opinion and esteem of his being very knowing and learned. Now Arcesilaus was so far from desiring any glory by being a bringer-in of new opinions, and from arrogating to himself those of the ancients, that the sophisters of that time blamed him for attributing to Socrates, Plato, Parmenides, and Heraclitus the doctrines concerning the retention of assent, and the incomprehensibility of things; having no need so to do, but only that he might strengthen them and render them recommendable by ascribing them to such illustrious personages.\"\nBlaise Pascal wrote of Arcesilaus in his Pensées (1669, para. 375):\n\nI have seen changes in all nations and men, and thus after many changes of judgement regarding true justice, I have recognized that our nature was but in continual change, and I have not changed since; and if I changed, I would confirm my opinion.

He is followed in a spaceship by Big Barda, G'nort, Rocket Red, and Martian Manhunter. Teamwork allows them to find Khan, which enrages him to the point of damaging L-Ron. His robotic assistant is not too concerned, he then ponders what the 'fall line' of robotic forms look like.\nAfter this situation, Manga Khan becomes a more helpful person, befriending the Justice League.

Despero however escapes, but Khan hires Lobo to retrieve him. Lobo comes to believe that Khan's way of speaking has started to affect him: Khan suffers from a condition which causes him to soliloquy at random intervals. In the same vein, he founds the Manga Khan School of Melodrama to teach similar speech patterns to other characters.

Based in New York City, she is best known for chamber operas about women who find themselves in situations where they are forced to confront patriarchal structures.  Sankaram is also known for incorporating the latest technologies (e.g., virtual reality) and discussing the social effects of technology in musical theater works.\n\n\nLife\nThe daughter of a Telugu father from India, and a White-American mother, Sankaram was born in Orange County, California, and grew up largely in Ramona, a small town in San Diego County.  She took some piano lessons as a child, but her interest soon turned to theater. She grew up listening to Telugu movie soundtracks and Carnatic music with her father, and Debussy and Rachmaninoff with her mother. She said, \"I was in a theater show called Choice in Southern California. I would do these big dance and song numbers and that’s what got me even more interested in it. I wanted to be on Broadway!\" \nIn 1996, Sankaram moved to New York to attend Sarah Lawrence College. She then went on to earn a doctorate in cognitive psychology at the New School of Social Research.  Her 2013 dissertation examines how interactivity affects the way people process information on the Internet.  She concludes, \"Reading on the Internet may also have the potential to create a more positive effect on reading in the form of deeper information processing.  In particular, reading may be enhanced by the presence of some form of interactive, two-way communication, such as a comments section.\"\n\n\nMusical career\nSankaram’s musical career began taking off as she was finishing her Ph.D., ironically because, as she says, \"I couldn’t get any grant money to research on Twitter, but people started asking me to write more music.\" As a composer, her current catalogue includes eleven musical theatrical works, some of which have been produced by the Washington National Opera, the Los Angeles Opera and the Houston Grand Opera, and numerous vocal and instrumental chamber works.  With regards to her musical inspirations, Sankaram stated, \"I have played as much rock and avant jazz as I have classical music, and those connections are found in the music I write.\"  In the same interview, she also said, \"I grew up hearing a lot Carnatic music in my house, so I think that those modalities are always present.  As far as specific influences, they range from [Anthony] Braxton to Strauss to Radiohead and Pink Floyd.\" She also loves Bollywood songs, and incorporates elements of this style in many works.\nAs a coloratura soprano, Sankaram has starred in many of her own works, and performed with Anthony Braxton, Meredith Monk, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and the Wooster Group.  She is also the leader of Bombay Rickey, a five-piece band that evokes 1960’s movie soundscapes through a fusion of surf music, cumbia, Bollywood, film noir jazz, Spaghetti Western, and opera.\nSankaram teaches musical composition at State University of New York-Purchase, and is co-Artistic Director of Experiments in Opera, a New York-based company that believes in \"re-writing the history of opera\" through producing new works that are \"adventurous and fun, focused on strong and intimate storytelling.\" With regard to the latter role, she said, \"We tend to hire those that we can think of quickly, and we tend to be able to think of people who are most similar to us more quickly than people who are not.  As both a woman and a person of South Asian descent, my worldview and my network are different than many people in the field.  Therefore, as a gatekeeper, I see my role as inviting people to the table who may not have had an invitation before.\"\n\n\nSelected commissions and awards\n\n\nCommissions\nWashington National Opera\nHouston Grand Opera\nBeth Morrison Projects\nPrototype Festival\nOpera on Tap (for The Parksville Murders)\nOpera Memphis\nBrooklyn Youth Chorus\n\n\nAwards\nAmerican Theater Wing: Jonathan Larson Award\nNew York Innovative Theatre Awards: Outstanding Production of a Musical (Miranda)\nIndependent Music Awards Vox Pop: Best Eclectic Award (Bombay Rickey’s Cinefonia)\n\n\nGrants\nNational Endowment for the Arts\nOpera America\nKevin Spacey Foundation\nThe MAP Fund\n\n\nResidencies and fellowships\nMacDowell Colony\nThe Watermill Center\nThe Civilians\nHERE Arts Center (for the musical Miranda)\nCAP21\nCon Edison/Exploring the Metropolis\nThe Hermitage\nAmerican Lyric Theater\n\n\nBibliography\nSuzanne G.

A single dose requires three separate injections, which are given under the skin.\nEcallantide does not appear to be efficacious for the treatment of angioedema due to ACE inhibitors.\n\n\nAdverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects are headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. Less common, but observed in more than 5% of patients in clinical trials, are respiratory tract infections, fever, vomiting, itching and upper abdominal pain. Up to 4% of patients showed anaphylaxis, which led to a black box warning in the US.\n\n\nInteractions\nAs of 2011, no interaction studies have been conducted.\n\n\nMechanism of action\nHAE is caused by a mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene. Defective or missing C1-inhibitor permits activation of kallikrein, a protease that is responsible for liberating bradykinin from its precursor kininogen. An excess of bradykinin leads to fluid leakage from blood vessels, causing swelling of tissues typical of HAE.\nEcallantide suppresses this pathogenetic mechanism by selectively and reversibly inhibiting the activity of plasma kallikrein. Ecallantide's inhibitory constant (Ki) for kallikrein is 25 picoMolar, indicating high affinity.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Crash at Crush",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=7785928",
    "text": "The Crash at Crush was a one-day publicity stunt in the U.S. state of Texas that took place on September 15, 1896, in which two uncrewed locomotives were crashed into each other head-on at high speed. William George Crush, general passenger agent of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, conceived the idea in order to demonstrate a staged train wreck as a public spectacle. No admission was charged, and train fares to the crash site – called Crush, set up as a temporary destination for the event – were offered at the reduced rate of US$3.50 in 1896 (equivalent to $132.36 in 2025) from any location in Texas.\nAs a result, an estimated 40,000 people – more people than the second-largest city in state at the time – attended the event. Unexpectedly, the impact caused both engine boilers to explode, resulting in a shower of flying debris that killed two people and caused numerous injuries among the spectators.\n\n\nPreparations\nThe Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (popularly known as the \"Katy\", from its \"M-K-T\" initials) had first reached the Crush area in the 1880s, during the construction of a route between Dallas and Houston. As the railroad expanded, the Katy replaced its 30-ton steam engines with newer, more powerful 60-ton engines, and subsequently a stockpile of the older units, for which the railroad now had no use, began to accumulate.\nIn 1896, Katy agent William Crush proposed a publicity stunt that could make use of the obsolete Katy trains to be held along the Dallas–Houston route at a site 14 miles (23 km) north of Waco and 3 miles (4.8 km) south of the town of West, in McLennan County.\nA locomotive crash staged by the Columbus and Hocking Valley Railroad at Buckeye Park near Lancaster, Ohio, on May 30, 1896, had been a huge success. Buckeye Park was established and owned by the railroad to entice residents of nearby Columbus to take weekend excursions. The locomotive crash was planned for the park's annual opening day and drew approximately 20,000 spectators. While no admission was charged, money was made on the railroad passenger traffic to and from the park.\nCrush imagined a similar spectacle for which Katy could advertise to thousands of potential passengers. Crush's superiors agreed to his proposal and put him in charge of the project. As with the crash at Buckeye Park, the event would be free of charge, instead profiting from the sale of tickets on special excursion trains that would run to and from the site.\n\nTwo water wells were drilled at the site and a circus tent from Ringling Brothers was erected, as well as a grandstand, three speakers' stands, a platform for reporters, two telegraph offices, and a special train depot, over which a giant sign proclaimed the new town as \"Crush, Texas\". Events from the Midway Plaisance, including lemonade stands, carnival games, medicine shows, cigar vendors and other sideshows were highly anticipated, with a construction foreman saying that \"This feature alone will be worth going to Crush to see.\" A separate four-mile segment of track was built for the event alongside the Katy railroad so that there was no chance a runaway train could end up on the main line; each end of the track was situated atop a low hill on opposite sides of a bowl-shaped valley in which the trains would meet. The locomotives to be used were two 35-short-ton (32 t) decommissioned Baldwin engines, No. 999 and No. 1001.\n\n\nSafety precautions\nOn the day before the exhibition, railroad officials staged a speed test of the engines to help predict the precise point of collision. Katy engineers assured Crush that his grand idea was safe, specifically that the boilers on the steam engines had been designed to resist ruptures and that, even in a very high-speed crash, they were unlikely to explode. Each engine would pull six boxcars behind it; because the couplers used to link the cars were considered unreliable, the cars were chained together to prevent them from coming apart during the impact.\nCrush insisted on restricting the general public to a minimum of 200 yards (180 m) away from the track, but allowed members of the press to be within 100 yards. Katy officials expected a crowd of between 20,000 and 25,000 people to attend, but the clever marketing ploy was an overwhelming success and the railroad sold out more than 30 special excursion trains to the event.\n\n\nCrash\n\nThe crash was delayed for an hour because the crowd resisted being pressed back by the police to what was supposedly a safe distance. At about 5 pm, the two trains, pulling cars loaded with railroad ties, slowly met in the middle of the track to be photographed. They were then rolled to their starting points at the opposite ends of the track. Crush, riding a white charger, signaled the start of the main event. The engineers and crew aboard each train opened the steam to a prearranged setting, rode for exactly four turns of the driving wheels, and then jumped from the trains. The September 16 issue of The Dallas Morning News described what happened next:\n\nThe rumble of the two trains, faint and far off at first, but growing nearer and more distinct with each fleeting second, was like the gathering force of a cyclone. Nearer and nearer they came, the whistles of each blowing repeatedly and the torpedoes which had been placed on the track exploding in almost a continuous round like the rattle of musketry...\nThey rolled down at a frightful rate of speed to within a quarter of a mile of each other. Nearer and nearer as they approached the fatal meeting place the rumbling increased, the roaring grew louder...\nEach train reached a speed of about 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) by the time they met near the anticipated spot, though some observers believed they were traveling much faster. As the trains collided, there was a large explosion:\n\nA crash, a sound of timbers rent and torn, and then a shower of splinters... There was just a swift instance of silence, and then as if controlled by a single impulse both boilers exploded simultaneously and the air was filled with flying missiles of iron and steel varying in size from a postage stamp to half of a driving wheel...\n\nDebris was blown hundreds of feet into the air. Panic quickly broke out as the crowd turned and ran. Some of the debris came down among the spectators, killing two and seriously injuring at least six others. A photographer, Jarvis \"Joe\" Deane of Waco, lost one eye to a flying bolt. The locomotives and their boxcars were reduced to scraps of wood and steel:\n\nAll that remained of the two engines and twelve cars was a smoking mass of fractured metal and kindling wood, except one car on the rear of each train, which had been left untouched. The engines had both been completely telescoped, and contrary to experience in such cases, instead of rising in the air from the force of the blow, were just flattened out. There was nothing about the cars big enough to save except pieces of wood, which were eagerly seized upon and carried home as souvenirs.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nThe story made national headlines, and Crush was immediately fired from the Katy Railroad. In light of a lack of negative publicity, however, he was rehired the next day and continued to work for the company until his retirement, in a career spanning six decades. The Katy Railroad quickly settled several lawsuits from the victims' families with cash and lifetime rail passes; the injured photographer received damages amounting to US$10,000 in 1896 (equivalent to more than $370,000 in 2025). Though the incident had resulted in tragedy, the Katy benefited enormously from the attention it received, including international recognition. Despite the disaster, many railroads continued to stage locomotive collisions in the following years.\nRagtime composer Scott Joplin, who was performing in the region at the time, composed a piano piece he called the \"Great Crush Collision March\" to commemorate the crash; the composition was dedicated to the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway. It was copyrighted on October 15, 1896, a month after the event. The piece was notable because it included instructions in the score for how to replicate the sounds of the trains' collision through playing techniques, specific notes, and the use of dynamics.\nIn 1976, the Texas Historical Commission erected a historical marker (number 5315) a few miles from the site in West, Texas.\n\n\nSee also\nList of train songs\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\"Retired Katy Engineer Tells of Wreck at Crush\".

    "text": "The hypocotyl (short for \"hypocotyledonous stem\", meaning \"below seed leaf\") is the stem of a germinating seedling, found below the cotyledons (seed leaves) and above the radicle (root).\n\n\nEudicots\nAs the plant embryo grows at germination, it sends out a shoot called a radicle that becomes the primary root, and then penetrates down into the soil. After emergence of the radicle, the hypocotyl emerges and lifts the growing tip (usually including the seed coat) above the ground, bearing the embryonic leaves (called cotyledons), and the plumule that gives rise to the first true leaves. The hypocotyl is the primary organ of extension of the young plant and develops into the stem. The most massive hypocotyl is that of Myrmecodia lamii which can be 70 cm (28 in) in height by 45 cm (18 in) wide, and is filled with chambers and passageways used by their ant symbionts\n\n\nMonocots\nThe early development of a monocot seedling like cereals and other grasses is somewhat different. A structure called the coleoptile, essentially a part of the cotyledon, protects the young stem and plumule as growth pushes them up through the soil. A mesocotyl—that part of the young plant that lies between the seed (which remains buried) and the plumule—extends the shoot up to the soil surface, where secondary roots develop from just beneath the plumule. The primary root from the radicle may then fail to develop further. The mesocotyl is considered to be partly hypocotyl and partly cotyledon (see seed).\nNot all monocots develop like the grasses. The onion develops in a manner similar to the first sequence described above, the seed coat and endosperm (stored food reserve) pulled upwards as the cotyledon extends. Later, the first true leaf grows from the node between the radicle and the sheath-like cotyledon, breaking through the cotyledon to grow past it. \n\n\nStorage organ\nIn some plants, the hypocotyl becomes enlarged as a storage organ. Examples include cyclamen, gloxinia and celeriac. In cyclamen this storage organ is called a tuber.\n\n\nHypocotyl elongation assay\nOne of the widely used assays in the field of photobiology is the investigation of the effect of changes in light quantity and quality on hypocotyl elongation. It is frequently used to study the growth promoting vs. growth repressing effects of application of plant hormones like ethylene. Under normal light conditions, hypocotyl growth is controlled by a process called photomorphogenesis, while shading the seedlings evokes a rapid transcriptional response which negatively regulates photomorphogenesis and results in increased rates of hypocotyl growth. This rate is highest when plants are kept in darkness mediated by a process called skotomorphogenesis, which contrasts photomorphogenesis.\n\n\nSee also\nEpicotyl\nMonocotyledon\nDicotyledon\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "In optoelectronics, an opto-electronic oscillator (OEO) is a circuit that produces a repetitive electronic sine wave and/or modulated optical continuous wave signals.\nAn opto-electronic oscillator is based on converting the continuous light energy from a pump laser to radio frequency (RF), microwave or mm-wave signals. The OEO is characterized by having very high quality factor (Q) and stability, as well as other functional characteristics that are not readily achieved with electronic oscillators. Its unique behavior results from the use of electro-optical (E/O) and photonic components, which are generally characterized with high efficiency, high speed, and low dispersion in the microwave frequency regime.\nIn an OEO, the phase noise of the oscillator does not increase with the frequency that is subject to other implementations by electronic oscillators such as quartz crystal oscillators, dielectric resonators, sapphire resonators or air-dielectric resonators.\n\n\nHistory\nOEO was introduced in the early 1990s.\nSince then, the device’s key properties have been continuously improved.\n\n\nOperation\nMost OEOs utilize the transmission characteristics of an optical modulator together with a fiber-optic delay line to convert light energy into stable, spectrally pure RF/microwave reference signals. Light from a laser is introduced into an electro-optic (E/O) modulator, the output of which is passed through a long optical fiber and detected with a photodetector.  The output of the photodetector is amplified and filtered and fed back to the electric port of the modulator.  This configuration supports self-sustained oscillations, at a frequency determined by the fiber delay length, the bias setting of the modulator, and the band pass characteristics of the filter.  It also provides for both electric and optical outputs.  The conditions for self-sustained oscillations include coherent addition of partial waves each way around the loop and a loop gain exceeding losses for the circulating waves in the loop.  The first condition implies that all signals that differ in phase by some multiple of 2π from the fundamental signal may be sustained.  Thus the oscillation frequency is limited only by the characteristic frequency response of the modulator and the setting of the filter, which eliminates all other sustainable oscillations.  The second condition implies that, with adequate light input power, self-sustained oscillations may be obtained without the need for the RF/microwave amplifier in the loop.\nChip-scale OEOs utilize whispering gallery mode optical resonators rather than a delay line. Whispering gallery mode optical resonators are axially symmetric dielectric structures ranging in size from tens of micrometers to a few millimeters, and can trap light in a small volume. The modes are solutions of Maxwell's equation and represent waves that propagate close to the surface of the resonator structures, along the perimeter.\n\n\nTheory\nQuality factor (Q) of OEO is determined from a resonator's centre frequency f0 and group delay τ\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Q\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                ω\n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n              τ\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        π\n        \n          f\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              L\n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q={\\omega _{0}\\tau  \\over 2}=\\pi f_{0}{nL \\over c_{0}},}\n  \n\nwhere n is the refractive index, L is the optical fibre length and c0 is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n\nUses\nA high-performance OEO is a key element in a variety of applications, such as \n\nmodern radar technology,\naerospace engineering,\nsatellite communication links,\nnavigation systems,\nprecise metrological time and frequency measurements,\nreference clock distribution, and\nhigh-bitrate, optically supported, communication wireless links, including radio over fiber technology.\n\n\nSee also\nDelay-line oscillator\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nKey properties and design issues for an opto-electronic oscillator, 2015\nHighly Oblate Microspheroid as an Optical Resonator\nCrystalline resonators add properties to photonic devices, 2010 February 17",

According to Herodotus, this movement started when the Massagetae or the Issedones migrated westwards, forcing the Scythians to the west across the Araxes and into the Caspian Steppe, from where they displaced the Cimmerians.\nUnder Scythian pressure, the Cimmerians migrated to the south through the Klukhor, Alagir and Darial passes in the Greater Caucasus mountains and reached Western Asia, where they would remain active for much of the 7th century BCE.\n\n\nReign\nAround 680 BC, the Cimmerians separated into two groups, with their bulk having migrated into Anatolia, while a smaller group remained in the area near the kingdom of Mannai and later migrated into Media.\nTeušpâ was the king of the western Cimmerian horde, who had moved into Anatolia. In 679 BC, Teušpâ led a Cimmerian incursion against the western borderlands of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and was defeated and killed by the Assyrian king Esarhaddon near Ḫubušna in Cappadocia. Despite this victory, the military operations of the Assyrians were not fully successful and they were not able to firmly occupy the areas around Ḫubušna, nor were they able to secure their borders.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources",

The main language of instruction is English while Arabic is supplemented for other subjects.\n\n\nOverview\nJordanian Senator Leila A. Sharaf presented the school with a sizable fund to establish its first library.\nDr. Sue Dahdah and husband, engineer Farid Dahdah, founded the school in 1980. It was among the first of many modern, private, non-parochial schools to open in Amman, Jordan in the early eighties. Starting with 18 students in a small rented villa, the school soon outgrew the location and moved to its current premises in the summer of 1991. The school currently has capacity for 800 students in kindergarten through twelfth grades.\nThe school is located in the affluent neighbourhood of Deir Ghbar in West Amman, not far from the American Embassy, the British Embassy and The French School. The easiest ways to reach the school are to exit from the airport highway or to come from the sixth circle.\nAHSS was reaccredited in spring 2019 by Cognia formerly known as North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI) a division of AdvancED. Among the advantages of accreditation, graduates of the American high school program at AHSS can obtain equalization for their school diploma from the Jordanian Ministry of Education. Equalization is necessary for students who plan to do their college or university studies in Jordan. AHSS is an associate member of the Near East South Asia Council of Overseas Schools (NESA). Dr. Sue Dahdah has been a member since 1971 while AHSS has been since 1980. School representatives attend the annual administrators' and teachers' conferences organized by NESA throughout the Near Eastern and South Asian regions.\nUniform is worn by grades one through seven, comprising navy blue pants or culottes, white shirts and turquoise or navy blue cardigans and pullovers. Neckties and scarves are worn for formal occasions. For physical education, white school T-shirt, shorts and training suit are worn. Uniform is not required for students in grades eight through twelve although a dress code is in effect.\n\n\nCurriculum\nThe school teaches two curricula: \n\nAn American curriculum is taught which prepares students to write the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and the Scholastic Aptitude Subject Tests (SAT II). This curriculum is aimed at the students who are from the United States and plan to return there for their post-secondary education. Although completion of the SAT stream and passing marks in the SAT and SAT II tests is recognized by Jordanian universities as proof of secondary education it is not looked favorably upon.\nThe International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) curriculum is also taught. This prepares students for the O-levels and A-levels exams which are internationally recognized as proof of secondary education. Passing marks in the O and A level exams are recognized as completion of secondary education by most Jordanian Universities. This stream is often chosen by students who plan to continue into post-secondary education outside of Jordan or in a Jordanian university which teaches in English.\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of schools in Jordan\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nSchool website",

As a true freshman in 1992, the Gators coaching staff decided to redshirt him.  During his four seasons as a Gator, Mitchell was a starter for three seasons and the Gators won four consecutive Southeastern Conference (SEC) titles in 1993 through 1996 and the Bowl Alliance national championship in 1996.  Mitchell earned academic honors for four consecutive seasons.  As a senior team captain in 1996, he started eight games at center for the Gators' offense that averaged 503.9 yards per game.  As a junior in 1995, he was a first-team All-SEC selection by Football News.  During his junior year, he started every game at center and was named the team's Comeback Player of the Year after missing spring practice following arthroscopic surgery.  In the 1996 game against the Georgia Bulldogs, he suffered a broken right ankle, forcing him to undergo surgery and ending his season.\nIn one of a series of articles published in 2006, the sportswriters of The Gainesville Sun rated him as the No. 41 all-time greatest Gator from the first century of Florida football.\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Baltimore Ravens selected Mitchell in the fifth round (134th pick overall) in the 1997 NFL draft. He played for the Ravens for four seasons from 1997 to 2000.  He saw no action as a rookie in 1997, but became a regular starter in 1998.  Mitchell earned a Super Bowl ring with the Baltimore Ravens in 2000, starting at center for the Ravens in their victory against the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV.\nMitchell was the veteran anchor on the Carolina offensive line for five years, from 2001 to 2005.  He led the Panthers offensive line that allowed only twenty-six sacks in 2003, a team record for fewest sacks allowed in a season, and helped Panthers rush for a team-record 2,091 yards, including a team-individual mark of 1,444 yards by Stephen Davis.  Mitchell joined Jordan Gross as the only Panthers offensive linemen to start every game in 2004.\nMitchell was a starter in 118 of 119 regular season NFL contests in which he appeared during his eight-year professional football career.\nDuring the off-seasons, Mitchell served as the Vice President of Client Relations for Threadfin Business Solutions. He currently holds that position on a full-time basis.\n\n\nSee also\n\nFlorida Gators football, 1990–99\nList of Carolina Panthers players\nList of Florida Gators football All-Americans\nList of Florida Gators in the NFL draft\n\n\nReferences",

A week later, Rojansky was withdrawn from consideration, with senior officials voicing concerns that his appointment would be seen as a concession to Russia.\n\n\nViews\nRojansky has argued that Russian interference in the 2016 election is more plausibly explained by Putin wanting to \"send the message to Americans that... American democracy is just as vulnerable to foreign meddling\" rather than \"specifically picking sides.\"\nRojansky believes that Russia and China are inherently distrustful of each other, but that American policy is driving them to be natural partners.\nHe has written numerous articles on U.S. policy in regard to Russia and Ukraine.

It was written before Ocean Under the Ice, but is after it in the continuity.  This is the fourth book in the continuity. It is written from the perspective of crewmember Reiki LeRoux and revolves around the crew struggling to survive on the habitable moon Zuni after a crash landing maroons them there. \nThe crew nevertheless do their best to continue the mission without technology, learning to communicate with the moon's inhabitants and eventually building a home and raising families. It is the only book in the series written from a first person perspective.\n\n\nCharacters in Marooned on Eden\n\n\nCrew\n\nThe initial crew of the Barnard's Star Expedition consisted of twenty people when it left the solar system in 2026.  One of the crew, Dr. William Wang, during the long process of curing the rest of the crew from an infectious type of cancer, died from the same cancer while en route to Barnard.  Although the crew spent forty calendar years traveling from the solar system to Barnard's Star, their aging rate during the long journey was slowed by a factor of four by the use of the drug No-Die.  As a result, upon the arrival at Barnard in 2066, the effective biological age of the crew had only increased ten years over their age at the start of the mission.  The crew spent the next two years decelerating to a halt in the Barnard planetary system, then three years surveying the entire system from space, exploring the two lobes of the double-planet Rocheworld,  and exploring the surface of the Gargantuan moon Zulu, before moving on to the surface exploration of Zuni.  The ages for the humans are given in terms of their effective biological age at the time of their crash landing on Zuni, now known as Eden, in 2073.\n\n\nMajor General Virginia \"Jinjur\" Jones\n\nCommander of the Barnard's Star Expedition.\n\n\nAliens: 'Jolly Blue-Green Giants'\nThe 'Jolly Green Giants', as named by the humans, are large, intelligent, tree-like creatures.  They use some tools, such as knives, and move very slowly as compared to the humans.\n\nThe 'Jollies' use six hydraulically operated roots to move, walking by holding the front middle and left and right rear roots on the ground and moving the other three roots forward.  They then hold those to the ground and move the front middle and left and right rear roots forward, then repeating the process.  They are said to look slightly like palm trees by George, when a picture is sent to him aboard the Prometheus.\n\n\nEyes\nThe 'Jolly Green Giants' have eyes that are very birdlike, in that they can fly.  They are not permanently attached to the main body, but need to come back to it for guidance, nourishment, and to 'transfer' the 'data' they have gathered while flying around.  The main body provides them with guidance, as is seen in the book, when the main body of the plant gives them flight patterns.\n\nThey have large brains, and almost no digestive system.  They are feathered, and have a hole in their head that is used for 'data transfer', and getting nourishment.  They have a single large eye.  It was shown in the book that they can remain in the 'nest', and look out, acting like human eyes, in that they provide a 'live feed' of information.\n\n\nGatherers\nThe gatherers of the 'Jolly Green Giants' have systems very like that of the eyes, but serve a different purpose.  They are used as the hands for the gatherer, and are for more delicate tasks than the 'roots' of the main body can perform.  they are also used for speaking, as they are the only part of the 'Jollies' that can generate a sound suitable for the purpose.\n\n\nSee also\nRoche lobe for an explanation of the underlying gravitational principle.\nRocheworld\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick William Nicholas McCracken,  (18 August 1859 – 8 August 1949) was a British Army officer who saw regimental service in Africa during the late nineteenth century, and later held senior command during the First World War. He commanded an infantry brigade in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) of 1914, was appointed to command 15th (Scottish) Division in the New Armies from 1915 to 1917, and then briefly commanded XIII Corps on the Western Front before being posted to a home command in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nMilitary career\nBorn on 18 August 1859, the youngest son of R. de Crez McCracken of Kent, he studied at Royal Military College, Sandhurst and then took a commission as a second lieutenant in the 49th Regiment of Foot on 13 August 1879. He was promoted to lieutenant the following year on 28 July 1880, and served in the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882 with his regiment, which had since become the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment. After Egypt he was appointed the battalion adjutant, and promoted to captain on 15 December 1884. He saw service during the Mahdist War in 1885, at Tofrek, where he was mentioned in despatches and given a brevet promotion to major on 14 August 1885. Serving on the Egyptian frontier later in the year, he saw action at the Battle of Ginnis.\nHe married Ann Liston Glover in 1887; the couple had a son and two daughters before Ann's death in 1923.\nIn April 1892 he was seconded to the staff and appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General in Barbados. He received a full promotion to Major on 27 March 1897, and when his term on the staff expired in April that year he returned to his regiment.\nAt the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, he fought in South Africa with the 1st Berkshires throughout 1900, and in 1901 took command of the 2nd Berkshires. In 1902 he commanded a garrison force of several battalions. For his services in the war, he was again mentioned in despatches and given a brevet-promotion to lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1900. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), as well as the Queen's medal with three clasps, and the King's medal with two. After the end of the war in June 1902, McCracken and the rest of the 2nd battalion was sent to Egypt, where they arrived on the SS Dominion in November 1902.\n\nAfter the Boer War, McCracken received a full promotion to lieutenant colonel in April 1903, then a brevet promotion to colonel in February 1905. He commanded a battalion of his regiment until 1907, when he was placed on half-pay. He was promoted to colonel in July that year. He was also made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1910.\nHe held staff postings in India until March 1911 when he vacated his appointment and went on half-pay. This only lasted until April, when he was made a temporary brigadier general on the staff at Irish Command. In October 1912 he took over command of the 7th Infantry Brigade from Major General Laurence Drummond, and was again promoted to temporary brigadier general, a position he was holding on the outbreak of the First World War over two years later.\nHe commanded the 7th Brigade when it was sent to France in 1914 as part of Major General Hubert Hamilton's 3rd Division. At the Battle of Le Cateau in August, McCracken was briefly disabled by an artillery shell on the 26th and was relieved by Colonel W. D. Bird, one of his battalion commanders. The 7th Brigade covered the retreat of II Corps, and after a personal recommendation to the corps commander by Major-General Edmund Allenby, who was commanding the Cavalry Division, McCracken was promoted to major-general in October, and appointed inspector of infantry.\nIn March 1915 he took command of the 15th (Scottish) Division, a New Army formation, and led it through the Battle of Loos, the Battle of the Somme, and the Battle of Arras. Whilst he had been praised for his resilience in command of 7th Brigade, reports on his command of the 15th Division were less favourable, with one observer describing him as \"weak and lazy\". These failings did not stop him being promoted to temporary lieutenant general to command XIII Corps in June 1917. He remained with the corps until March 1918, when he was sacked and sent home to take over Scottish Command from Lieutenant General Sir Spencer Ewart and managed to retain his temporary lieutenant general's rank.\nDuring the war, he was mentioned in despatches a further seven times, and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in June 1917.\nHe retired from the army in 1922, and died in August 1949, a few days before his ninetieth birthday.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nHistory of the Great War: Military Operations, France and Belgium 1914, by J.

It sat for a while, but everybody felt strongly about it. It had a, dare I say, 'modern-feeling' to it, but still in the style of guitar that I like to play. Ultimately, I just sat down and wrote the song on the piano. Sometimes, when you've got a riffy song, it helps to just play the chords with no rhythm, and then you hear the 'song' in it. It's those very Paul McCartney/Wings-type chords – Broadway-type chords. What I'm most proud of from a songwriting standpoint is how it goes from D major to A minor. It goes from a very 'majorly' feel into something sorrowful, almost a Spanish feel. I don't know how the heck I did that, but it's one of my favorite things in the song, how you can keep the key but change the emotion.\"\n\n\nReception\nNME described the song as \"elegant and dreamy\". Consequence of Sound declared that it was \"heroic\". Spin magazine's review of Oceania focused on Byrne's drumming on Panopticon, stating \"the impressive, tom-heavy rumble of \"Panopticon\" quickly asserts his lithe, explosive, decidedly Jimmy Chamberlain-esque ferocity, a deft balance of muscle and sinew.\" Artistdirect also emphasized Byrne's contribution by describing his drumming as \"flawless percussive propulsion\".\nThe Seattle Post-Intelligencer noted Nicole Fiorentino's \"highly musical bass lines\".\n\n\nReferences",

D..\nAfter the death of Edward Story, Abbot of Dundrennan, on 28 November 1516, Hay was provided to the now vacant abbacy; he became abbot sometime between 2 June and 9 August 1517.\nIn 1523, following the death of Robert Cockburn, Bishop of Ross, the regent John Stewart, Duke of Albany, nominated Hay to become the new bishop there, a nomination which seems to have been accepted by Pope Adrian VI before the latter died on 14 September 1523.\nIt was not, however, until 16 September 1524, that the temporalities of the bishopric of Ross were given into Hay's possession, and he had still not received consecration by 25 February 1525.\nAmong the few things known of his episcopate, Hay was one of the commissioners who held parliament on 11 March 1538; one William of Johnstoun was convicted of heresy in Hay's court in April of the same year.

D..\nAfter the death of Edward Story, Abbot of Dundrennan, on 28 November 1516, Hay was provided to the now vacant abbacy; he became abbot sometime between 2 June and 9 August 1517.\nIn 1523, following the death of Robert Cockburn, Bishop of Ross, the regent John Stewart, Duke of Albany, nominated Hay to become the new bishop there, a nomination which seems to have been accepted by Pope Adrian VI before the latter died on 14 September 1523.\nIt was not, however, until 16 September 1524, that the temporalities of the bishopric of Ross were given into Hay's possession, and he had still not received consecration by 25 February 1525.\nAmong the few things known of his episcopate, Hay was one of the commissioners who held parliament on 11 March 1538; one William of Johnstoun was convicted of heresy in Hay's court in April of the same year. Hay appears to have died in this year, by 3 October at the latest. He was succeeded by Robert Cairncross.",

The episode was written by executive producers/show runners Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse and directed by \"The Man Behind the Curtain\" director Bobby Roth.\nIn 1977, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) goes to extreme measures to save young Benjamin Linus (Sterling Beaumon) when Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) refuses to help. In flashbacks, Kate takes care of Sawyer's (Josh Holloway) favor and begins to tell the truth to protect Aaron (William Blanchette).\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nFlashbacks\nShortly after the Oceanic six's rescue, Kate Austen and a baby Aaron visit Cassidy, who is an ex-girlfriend of James \"Sawyer\" Ford. Kate gives Cassidy and Sawyer's daughter Clementine (Olivia Vickery) money from the severance pay from Oceanic. Cassidy deduces that Aaron is not Kate's baby, prompting her to tell her the truth about everything that happened on the island. Cassidy eventually leads Kate to realize that the reason she took Aaron as her own, is because Kate needed him in order to get over her emotional attachment to Sawyer. After the survivors' confrontation with Ben, Kate momentarily loses Aaron in a supermarket. She recovers him from a woman who bears a strong resemblance to Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), Aaron's mother. After this, she decides to return to the island with the others who left. She leaves Aaron in the care of Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), Aaron's biological grandmother. Kate also tells Carole that she is returning to the island to find Carole's daughter, Claire, and bring her home.\n\n\n1977\nAfter Sayid shoots a young Ben, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) wakes up and notices the situation. He brings Ben to the barracks so that his injuries can be treated by Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). Juliet is unable to perform the necessary surgery on Ben and sends James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway) to retrieve Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a spinal surgeon. Meanwhile, Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) debate the nature of time travel. Hurley is convinced that they have changed the past, as in Back to the Future, but Miles tells him that these events always happened in the past. Hurley, however, points that an older Ben didn't recognize Sayid when he was tortured in 2004, as the man who shot him as a kid. Jack, knowing what Ben does in the future, refuses to help, saying that \"he already saved him once\". This drives Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to do everything she can to help Ben.\nKate goes to the sick bay where Ben is being treated and donates her blood because she is a universal donor. She strikes up a conversation with Ben's father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is upset that Ben stole his keys and freed Sayid from the jail. Once it becomes clear that Ben will succumb to his injuries without further intervention, Kate decides to take Ben to the Others, the island's native population. Sawyer comes to Kate's aid and they bring Ben to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who warns them that if he treats Ben, he will not remember what has happened and will never be the same again. They agree anyway. Another Other urges Richard to inform \"Ellie\" of his intentions and implies that \"Charles\" will not be pleased if he finds out, but Richard says he doesn't answer to either of them. Richard then carries Ben into the temple.\n\n\n2007\nAfter being knocked out unconscious by Sun, Ben (Michael Emerson) wakes up in the infirmary, and is greeted by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who welcomes him back to \"the land of the living\".\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Whatever Happened, Happened\" at ABC\n\"Whatever Happened, Happened\" at IMDb",

    "text": "High Street is a fell in the English Lake District. At 828 metres (2,717 ft), its summit is the highest point in the far eastern part of the national park. The fell is named after the Roman road that ran over the summit.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nRoman road\nA Roman road, a scheduled monument, crosses the fell between Roman forts at Brougham (Brocavum) near Penrith and Ambleside (Galava). Although the route takes the road higher than any other Roman road in England, the High Street range has quite gentle slopes and a flat summit plateau, characteristics that may have persuaded Roman surveyors to build the road over the fell tops rather than through the valleys which were densely forested and marshy making them susceptible to ambush. There has been speculation that the Romans made use of a prehistoric trackway.\nThe nature of the Roman road remains problematic, as much of it is sunken in a hollow, rather than being built on top of an embankment or agger in the usual Roman fashion. Funding was obtained for an archaeological excavation to investigate the Roman road in 2022. The investigation focussed on a stretch of the road at Bampton Common.\n\n\nFairs\nThe fell's flat summit was used as a venue for summer fairs by the local population in the 18th and 19th centuries. People from the surrounding valleys gathered annually on 12 July to return stray sheep to their owners. Games and wrestling also took place as well as horse racing. The summit of High Street is known as Racecourse Hill, and is so named on maps, and fell ponies can be found grazing occasionally on its summit. The last of the summer fairs was held in 1835.\n\n\nTopography\nThe River Kent, which flows south through the town of Kendal before emptying into Morecambe Bay, has its source on High Street's southern slopes. Dropping 300 m in 40 km (980 ft in 25 miles), the Kent is reputed to be the fastest-flowing river in England.\nHigh Street's eastern side is craggy and precipitous as it falls away towards Haweswater Reservoir. There are two tarns underneath the eastern crags – Blea Water and Small Water; Blea Water, in a classic mountain corrie at 200 feet (61 m) is the deepest tarn in the Lake District. (But note that Wast Water with a depth of 258 feet (79 m) is the deepest lake.)\n\n\nSummit\nA wall follows the ridge over the flat summit, the highest point is marked by an Ordnance Survey triangulation column which has been painted white. The view stretches from the Pennines in the east to a great arc of Lakeland hills filling the western horizon. The Helvellyn range and Southern Fells are particularly striking.\n\n\nAscents\nThe climb from Mardale is an exhilarating ridge walk, with views down into Riggindale which at one time might have been supplemented by the sight of a golden eagle. Riggindale had the only bird of this kind left in England, a solitary male, which had been on its own there since 2004, but has not been seen since 2016. High Street can also be climbed from Patterdale, Kentmere and Troutbeck. The full south-to-north traverse of the High Street ridge from Ings near Windermere to the Eamont valley at the northern end of Ullswater is a 30-kilometre (19-mile) hike over twelve summits, and should be undertaken only by experienced walkers.\n\n\nSee also\nHardknott Roman Fort\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nComputer generated summit panorama High * [http://www.lakedistrictwalks.net/high-street-walk Lake District Walks – High Street walk] Street index",

    "text": "Luis Banchero Rossi (Tacna; October 11, 1929 — Chaclacayo; January 1, 1972) was an important Peruvian businessman dedicated to the export of fishmeal and fish oil, who became one of the main promoters of the Peruvian fishing industry until his murder.\n\n\nEarly life\nBanchero was born into a family of low-income Italian immigrants. He finished his high school studies at the Colegio Nacional de Varones (today the I. E. E. Coronel Bolognesi) in Tacna and graduated as a chemical engineer at the National University of Trujillo.\nHe began to amass his fortune as a seller of countless products: wines from his father's small winery, socks, records, cars, tractors, shipments of pineapples from Trujillo to Tacna. Later, he sold alcohol and motor oil. This is how he discovered the city of Chimbote, when it was not yet the industrial zone that he helped create.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1955, with business profits, he bought his first canned fish factory and named it Florida. By then, he already had a net worth of S/. 1 million. Later, he acquired his own ships to reduce production costs. In this way, his company grew exponentially: he acquired factories producing fish flour and oil that were bankrupt and transformed them. He owned ten fishing complexes and more than three hundred and twenty boats of all sizes, whose function was to fill the warehouses of his factories with raw materials. Near them, he built houses for his workers and schools for their children. Likewise, he established medical posts in the places where his fishing emporium extended.\nIn 1970, the gross income from its fishing industries alone was around US$ 60 million a year. He diversified his activities and created companies in other areas: the Picsa Shipyards (in Callao and Chimbote). Thus, he ventured into sectors such as mining, aviation, soccer (with the Club Atlético Defensor Lima) and the media.\nIn 1962, he founded the newspaper Correo in Tacna, which was published in several provinces of Peru, and the newspaper Ojo. However, he never acquired his own house in Lima, since he lived in an entire apartment that he had rented in the Hotel Crillón in the capital.\nAt the time of his death, Banchero was the Peruvian who had created the most jobs in Peru at that time and had managed to build an entire emporium.\nIn 1968, he was appointed president of the National Fisheries Society. From this position, he promoted oceanographic scientific research and donated equipment to encourage fish consumption among the population. Likewise, he was director of the Banco de Crédito del Perú. He also wanted to run for the presidency of Peru.\n\n\nMurder\nBanchero had gone to his country house in Chaclacayo to spend New Year's Eve with his secretary Eugenia Sessarego. There the son of his gardener, Juan Vilca Carranza, murdered him on January 1, 1972. His murderer confessed to the crime and declared that he did it for money. However, some facts cast doubt on his version. Juan Vilca was only 20 years old and was 1.50 m tall compared to the businessman's 1.80 m. Although he used a German Luger pistol to subdue Banchero and Sessarego, the difference in size raised doubts about the role of the boy, who beat and stabbed Banchero to death.\nNor was it fully clarified what the participation of his secretary, Eugenia Sessarego, was, who was first branded as a lover and, during the trial of the case, ended up being accused as Vilca's accomplice. She spent five years in prison until she was pardoned on December 21, 1977. Like Vilca once he was released, she maintained a life withdrawn from the public.\nAfter Banchero's assassination, his companies were nationalized by the military dictatorship of Juan Velasco Alvarado.\nAnother hypothesis about the crime pointed to the trail of Klaus Barbie, a Gestapo officer and fugitive war criminal. According to the hypothesis of historian Nelson Manrique, Barbie was in Chaclacayo on a stopover on his way to Bolivia, when he was identified by Herbert John, Banchero's German collaborator, and both of them blew the whistle on him. Jewish investigator Serge Klarsfeld stated that between November and December 1971, he received a letter signed by both of them confirming Barbie's identity. Banchero was murdered just days after this information was made public.\nHis remains were buried in the El Ángel Cemetery in Lima.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Windsor Theatre, originally the German Winter Garden, was a theatre in Manhattan located at 43-47 Bowery, New York, New York, United States during 1855–1910. It was on the stretch between Bayard and Canal Streets, across the street from the Thalia Theatre.\nIn 1855 it was constructed as the German Winter Garden (aka Volks Garden). At this time the Bowery street was a cultural hub of German immigrants. In 1864 it was rebuilt and renamed to the New Stadt Theatre, in 1878 it was renamed to Windsor Theatre, after being briefly named The City Theatre.  In 1883 it burned down and a new, smaller building was erected for it in 1886. It was demolished in 1910.\n\n\nHistory\nThe German Winter Garden ad 35 Bowery was oval in shape, designed by Henry Hoffmann. It was a beer hall, also licensed as a theatre. It had a second-floor balcony all around the interior.\nT. Allston Brown gives the following chronology of the management of the venue since 1964.\n\nAt 43, 45, 47 Bowery, east side, directly opposite the Old Bowery Theatre [46 Bowery], was the \"New Stadt Theatre.\" It was erected in 1864 by a company of Germans, and opened Tuesday, Sept. 6, 1864. It was five stories high, used as a hotel, with a wide entrance to the theatre, which was in the rear of the hotel.\nThe auditorium was the largest of any theatre in the country, having a parquet and three tiers, with a capacity for thirty-five hundred persons. Otto von Hoym was the acting manager.\nStarting with the season of August 31, 1868 Hamann & Rosenberg were the managers. Robert W. Butler leased the house July 4, 1878. \"This house was christened \"THE CITY THEATRE \" on Sept. 16 <...> Its name was changed to the \"WINDSOR THEATRE\" Nov. 11. The first business manager of the house was\nBobby Newcomb. <...> After having remained without a permanent manager for some months, it was reopened March 1, 1880, John A. Stevens and Frank J. Murtha as managers.\"\n\n\"The house was totally destroyed by fire Thursday, Nov. 29, 1883. The fire began at the entrance of the theatre. <...> Nothing was done towards rebuilding the theatre for over two years. Finally Mr. Martin, the former owner of the property, erected a new theatre much smaller than the other. It was leased\nto Frank Murtha, who opened it Feb. 8, 1886, on a five years' lease.\nOn March 25, 1893 the season of the theatre was closed, but the theatre was reopened March 27, 1893, as a Hebrew theatre under the management of Sigmund Mogulesko, Isidore Lindeman, and Joseph Levy. Mogulesko managed the theatre during the 1893-1894 season. In 1896 Mogulesko left the theatre due to a conflict with the theatre management.\n\n\nSee also\nStadt Theatre\nWinter Garden (disambiguation)\nBowery Theatre\n\n\nReferences",

It was on the stretch between Bayard and Canal Streets, across the street from the Thalia Theatre.\nIn 1855 it was constructed as the German Winter Garden (aka Volks Garden). At this time the Bowery street was a cultural hub of German immigrants. In 1864 it was rebuilt and renamed to the New Stadt Theatre, in 1878 it was renamed to Windsor Theatre, after being briefly named The City Theatre.  In 1883 it burned down and a new, smaller building was erected for it in 1886. It was demolished in 1910.",

    "text": "The MON-90 (Russian: МОН-90) is a Claymore-shaped, plastic bodied, directional type of anti-personnel mine designed in the Soviet Union. It is designed to wound or kill by fragmentation. The mine is similar in appearance to the MON-50, but is approximately twice the size with a much greater depth.\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe MON-90 has an attachment point on the bottom for connecting a special clamp which can be attached to wood, metal etc. but it has no scissor type legs. It has a sight centered on the top which is flanked by two detonator cavities. The mine contains 6.2 kg of RDX (PVV-5A) to propel approximately 2000 steel rod fragments to a lethal range of 90 meters in a 54° arc (60 m wide spread at 90 m range). \nThe MON-90 is usually command actuated using a PN manual inductor and an EDP-R electric detonator (ZT non-electric detonator also available). It can also be actuated by a variety of booby trap (BT) switches including:\n\nMUV series pull\nMVE-72 electric breakwire\nVP13 seismic controller.\nThe MON-90 is usually mounted above ground level on the surface or up in a tree to give the greatest dispersion of fragments. It is waterproof and will function effectively from temperatures of +50 to −50 °C. Due to its large size the MON-90 is effective against unarmored vehicles and it may have applications as an anti-helicopter mine. \nIt can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions. Depending on its actuation method the MON 90 may be resistant to blast overpressure from explosive breaching systems like the Giant Viper and M58 MICLIC.\n\n\nSpecifications\nCountry of origin: Soviet Union\nMine action:\nMaterial: Plastic casing\nShape: Claymore\nColour: Green, olive\nTotal weight: 12.1 kg\nExplosive content: 6.2 kg RDX (PVV-5A) explosive\nOperating pressure (kg):\nLength: 345 mm\nWidth: 153 mm\nHeight: 202 mm\nFuze #1: Command detonated using PN manual inductor attached by demolition cable to an EDP-R electric detonator\nFuze #2:\nMUV Series Mechanical Pull\nMVE-72 Electric Breakwire (battery powered)\nVP13 Seismic Controller (battery powered)\n\n\nDisarming (demining) hazards\n\nThe MON-90 is known to be used with the VP13 seismic controller which prevents close approach for any clearance operations. If the mine is encountered with any type of electrical wires running from it, secure both ends of the wire before approaching the mine, because it could be linked to another mine or other booby trap device.\nOn detonation the mine will normally propel lethal fragmentation to a range of 90 meters. The actual hazard range for these types of mines can be as high as 300 metres based on US Army tests of the M18A1 Claymore (this is directly in front of the mine, fragmentation range and density drop off to 125 meters to the sides and rear of these mines).\n\n\nSee also\nMON-50, similar but smaller claymore shaped AP mine.\nMON-100\nMON-200\nM18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=40741644",
    "text": "\"Manila\" is a song by Filipino band Hotdog. The song is written about love for the Philippines, most specifically its capital, and tells about a man who misses his home country while living in another country for years. The upbeat song was inspired by Tony Bennett's hit single, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\". It topped the radio charts in 1976.\nThe song was used as the entrance of the Philippine delegates during the Parade of Nations on the opening ceremony of 2019 Southeast Asian Games held at the Philippine Arena in November 30, 2019.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nPlot\nThe song centers on the story of an unnamed protagonist who left the Philippines for a foreign country to work and became homesick after living out for long, while also narrating of his many adventures outside the country and his eventual return to the Philippines.\nIn the beginning, the protagonist tells of a time he left the Philippines and its capital, Manila, to work in a foreign country in hopes of finding greener pastures, stating that he will never forget the place he came from but promises that he will eventually return someday. This process repeats itself during the times he left and returned to the country. \nThe lyrics are mostly a mix of literal and metaphorical meanings. \"I walked the streets of San Francisco\" tells of the protagonist's daily life overseas while \"I've tried the rides in Disneyland\" alludes to his love of visiting tourist spots and places of interest in his adopted homeland and other countries, which includes but not limited to natural spots, amusement and theme parks, and other places popular to tourists, Disneyland being one of them. He eventually makes a lasting friendship with foreigners and different nationalities including his fellow overseas Filipinos (\"dated a million girls in Sydney\"), but states that although he has experienced the attractions, social life, and offerings of other places as part of his love for overseas life and that he had gained the satisfaction he wanted, he felt the need for more and what he had wasn't enough (\"somehow I feel that I don't belong\"). \nThe protagonist eventually realizes that the Philippines can only give him the best everlasting satisfaction and enjoyment, which starts in \"Hinahanap-hanap kita Manila\", stating that he misses the country's atmosphere and lifestyle as well as its culture and people (\"ang ingay mong kay-sarap sa tenga, mga jeepney mong nagliliparan, mga babaeng mong nag-gagandahan\") before expressing his desire to return to the Philippines and its capital for good (\"Take me back in your arms Manila, Promise me you'll never let go\", \"miss you like hell Manila\"). He then makes his decision to come home to his native country and settle down through the final lyrics \"no place in the world like Manila, I'm coming home to stay\".\n\n\nComposition\nIn the 70's, during the Martial Law era, the Manila sound genre was getting to a successful peak. That was when the Hotdogs formed with Ella Del Rosario as lead vocals, Rene Garcia on vocals/lead guitarist, Ramon \"Mon\" Torralba as 2nd lead guitarist, Tito Del Rosario on 3rd lead guitar, Dennis Garcia on bass guitar, Lorrie Ilustre on keyboards with Jess Garcia and Roy Diaz de Rivera as drummers and backing vocalists.\nAfter hearing Tony Bennett's hit single, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" and Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\" on radio during one of their daily routines, Garcia brothers, Rene and Dennis, found out that the Philippine capital, Manila should have a song of its own.\nDennis Garcia, Hotdog’s original bassist and main songwriter, has said in an interview that \"the band considers the song as “the mother of all Hotdog hits.” He added saying that he and his brother Rene \"felt our favorite city should also have an anthem of its own, a tune that will last forever. Looks like we got ourselves a self-fulfilling wish”.\n\n\nCover versions\nEver since Hotdog reunited and disbanded, the song has been covered by various artists like Gary Valenciano, Eraserheads, Side A, The CompanY, and REO Brothers.\nSide A gave the song a groovier sound and more of a soft rock ballad theme. This was included on their 1998 album \"Ang Ating Awitin\" made during the celebration of the Centennial Philippine Independence. The REO Brothers gave a more \"Beatles\" sound to their cover of the song, which was released as part of a fundraising campaign for victims of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan.\n\n\nSide notes\nThere is a possibility that this song was also inspired by Tayo Na Sa Antipolo, recorded by the Mabuhay Singers in their album Maligayang Araw, under the title Antipolo.\nContrary to suggestions that the song was inspired by the Mabuhay Singers’ “Tayo Na sa Antipolo,” Dennis Garcia (founding member of the Hotdogs) said that he had no idea how that story came about as “the song is 100 percent original and organic—borrowing from zero influences.”\n\n\nSee also\nList of songs about Manila\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "A trademark coexistence agreement is a contract made by two parties to use a similar trademark for marketing purposes without interfering in each other's enterprises.  Agreements of this nature are often made as parties only require regional use of their trademarks, and therefore other enterprises use of a trademark will not harm their business.\n\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a trademark coexistence agreement is that often marks are used by multiple enterprises in \"good faith\".  The absence of a formal agreement does not undermine any enterprise using the mark as they are in different global regions.  However, as the enterprises grow, overlaps can develop, and both parties can have substantial rights for using the trademark.  In certain cases, companies who are expanding and using the same or a similar trademark usually enter in a coexistence agreement for the purpose of avoiding usage of the trademark in a way which is undesirable or infringing.  Coexistence agreements can offer practical solutions to companies who are concerned about being sued for trademark infringement, as proactive agreements can avoid the large cost of litigation.\n\n\nFormal agreement\nA formal trademark coexistence agreement recognises the rights of both parties to use the trademarks contained in the agreement for marketing purposes.  The agreement can contain a division of regions in which enterprises party to the agreement may use the trademark, methods in which the trademark may be used, or classes of goods and services that the trademark may be used for (in conjunction with the Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks).\n\n\nPublic interest and antitrust regulations\nPublic interest must be considered when entering into a trademark coexistence agreement.  This often applies in situations such as if two medical companies bore the same trademark for unique products, as this could lead to confusion and have serious impacts on consumers.  Companies must also consider antitrust regulations.  Courts may find that similar trademarks may affect competition in the marketplace.\n\n\nJurisdictional differences\nIn China, courts and the China National Intellectual Property Administration have in recent years treated trademark coexistence agreements with caution. For example, the Beijing High People's Court guidelines state that such agreements may serve as prima facie evidence that confusion is unlikely, but do not by themselves guarantee registration where the two marks are highly similar. \n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Jiang Shuo (Chinese: 蔣朔; pinyin: Jiáng Shuò; born 1958 in Beijing, China) is a Chinese contemporary sculptor.\n\n\nBiography\nJiang Shuo was born in 1958 in Beijing, China. She studied sculpture at the Central Academy of Arts and Design, now the Academy of Fine Arts, Tsinghua University, Beijing, from 1978–1982, and was one of the few women to do so. She studied under the sculptor Professor Zheng Ke for three years, becoming the first woman sculptor in China to complete a post-graduate degree. Jiang then became a lecturer at the school from 1986–1989. In 1989, she immigrated to Austria with her sculptor husband, Wu Shaoxiang and their three-year-old son. They settled in Klagenfurt, Carinthia where they established a joint studio. In 2006, he set up a studio in Beijing. Due to her increasing popularity, 2012 saw the opening of a studio in Berlin. Since then Jiang has widely exhibited her sculptures around the world, including Austria, Indonesia, Singapore, and Switzerland. Her works are also regularly sold through galleries, and at auctions in Beijing, Hong Kong, Austria, and New York. Many of her works are included in major private and museum collections as well. Alternating Wu Shaoxiang lives today in Austria, Berlin and Beijing.\n\n\nEarly works\nJiang's earlier works in bronze possess a folk-like quality. These achieved recognition in China before she left for Austria in 1989. Such sculptures hint at blissful childhood memories of innocent children enjoying themselves in sport, playing music, and returning their mothers' warm embrace  – which suggest Jiang's strong family values.\n\n\nLater works\n\nHowever, Jiang became famous with her iconic \"Red Guard\" series begun in 2003. These anonymous, open-mouthed warriors who wear the Red Guard uniform, are cast in the ancient lost wax technique. They carry either a red flag or The Little Red Book, and reflect both her personal experience as a young Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, and her observations from abroad of China's emergence into a capitalistic machine.\nIn 1993, after her family gained Austrian citizenship, Jiang returned to China and witnessed first-hand the changes that were occurring, and the ironic situation that was taking place; the Red Guards who previously persecuted the \"bourgeois\" elements of society had now become the successful businessmen or capitalists driving China's burgeoning economy.\nAs Jiang's work progressed her Red Guard figures, for example, Cloud Rider - Terracotta Red (2008), and Run 2 (2006), began posing alongside material items that replaced The Little Red Book. They now sang karaoke, drank Coca-Cola, ate McDonald's, and rode atop flashy automobiles – all reflective of the lifestyles of rich businessmen pursuing a life filled with commercial luxury.\n\n\nSee also\nWu Shaoxiang\nCultural Revolution\nRed Guards\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nAlexandra A.

    "text": "Edward Evanson (21 April 1731 – 25 September 1805) was a controversial English clergyman.\n\n\nLife\nHe was born at Warrington, Lancashire. After graduating at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and taking holy orders, he spent several years as curate at Mitcham in Surrey. In 1768 he became vicar of South Mimms near Barnet; and in November 1769 he was presented to the rectory of Tewkesbury, with which he held also the vicarage of Longdon in Worcestershire. In the course of his studies he discovered what he thought important variance between the teaching of the Church of England and that of the Bible, and he did not conceal his convictions. In reading the service he altered or omitted phrases which seemed to him untrue, and in reading the Scriptures pointed out errors in the translation.\nA crisis was brought on by his sermon on the resurrection, preached at Easter 1773; and in November 1773 a prosecution was instituted against him in the consistory court of Gloucester. He was charged with depraving the public worship of God contained in the liturgy of the Church of England, asserting the same to be superstitious and unchristian, preaching, writing and conversing against the creeds and the divinity of our Saviour, and assuming to himself the power of making arbitrary alterations in his performance of the public worship. A protest was at once signed and published by a large number of his parishioners against the prosecution. The case was dismissed on technical grounds, but appeals were made to the court of arches and the court of delegates. Meanwhile, Evanson had made his views generally known by several publications.\nIn his later years he ministered to a Unitarian congregation at Lympston, Devonshire. In 1802 he published Reflections upon the State of Religion in Christendom, in which he attempted to explain and illustrate the mysterious foreshadowing of the Apocalypse. This he considered the most important of his writings. Shortly before his death at Colford, near Crediton, Devon, he completed his Second Thoughts on the Trinity, in reply to a work of the bishop of Gloucester.\n\n\nWorks\nIn 1772 he anonymously published his Doctrines of a Trinity and in the Incarnation of God, discussed Principles of Reason and Common Sense. This was followed in 1777 by a work addressed to Richard Hurd, A Letter to Dr. Hurd, Bishop of Worcester, wherein the Importance of the Prophecies of the old Testament and the Nature of the Grand Apostasy predicted in them are discussed. He also wrote some papers on the Sabbath, which brought him into controversy with Joseph Priestley, who published the whole discussion (1792). In the same year appeared Evanson's work entitled The Dissonance of the four generally received Evangelists, to which replies were published by Priestley and David Simpson (1793). Evanson rejected most of the books of the New Testament as forgeries, and of the four gospels he accepted only the Gospel of Luke.\nHis sermons (prefaced by a Life by G. Rogers) were published in two volumes in 1807, and were the occasion of Thomas Falconer's Bampton Lectures in 1810. A narrative of the circumstances which led to the prosecution of Evanson was published by N. Havard, the town-clerk of Tewkesbury, in 1778.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",

The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on July 10, 2007, and in the United Kingdom on August 6, 2007.\n\n\nPlot\nRetired CIA black-ops hitman James Jackson Dial (Wesley Snipes) is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins (Ralph Brown). Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure.\nNow Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity.\nMoments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones). Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding. Even though Jahar has been eliminated, the assignment is still considered to be failure by Collins because Dial was filmed fleeing the scene by a security camera.\nMeanwhile, Collins is being investigated in the US for running a CIA hit squad, and if the truth gets back about Dial and the death of Chief Superintendent Andrew Windsor (Charles Dance), which happened when Windsor apprehends Dial, Collins will be exposed. Stopping at nothing to keep his name clean, Collins frames Dial for the murder of the Chief Superintendent, even though Collins was actually the killer. Dial, now a wanted man by Collins and the British police, must do whatever it takes to prove his innocence, knowing that Inspector Annette Ballard (Lena Headey), Windsor's vengeful daughter, is also after him.\nWhile Dial is being pursued by Collins and his rogue hit squad, Dial fatally shoots Collins, saving the life of Inspector Ballard, who found herself in Collins' cross hairs. Having earned Ballard's trust, Dial is seen by Ballard bidding farewell to young Emily who played a key role in Dial's survival. Later on, it is shown that Dial sent Emily a letter, along with two tickets to America for her and her grandmother, to see him and his horse Beauty on his ranch. The last scene shows Emily and Dial at the ranch in Montana, watching Beauty run free.\n\n\nCast\nWesley Snipes as James Jackson Dial\nEliza Bennett as Emily Day\nLena Headey as Inspector Annette Ballard\nRalph Brown as Jeremy Collins\nCharles Dance as Detective Chief Superintendent Andrew Windsor\nGemma Jones as Emily's Grandmother\nIain Robertson as Cramston\nRichard Harrington as Terry Winchell\nRyan McCluskey as Purcell\nJohn Standing as Sir Anthony\nStanimir Stamatov as King\nMiroslav Emilov as Harris\nVelizar Binev as Beloit\nNikolay Sotirov as Ali Mahmud Jahar\nPeter Kelly Morgan as Newscaster\n\n\nProduction\nIt is set primarily in London and filmed mainly in Sofia, Bulgaria, and Cardiff, South Glamorgan, Wales, and partly in the US state of Montana.

    "text": "Cities of the Sun is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1995.\n\n\nContents\nCities of the Sun is a supplement which details the Khinasi people, who inhabit the south-eastern part of the continent of Cerilia. They gather in cities, and only sparsely settle the nearby plains and savannah. The domains of the Khinasi are called states instead of kingdoms, because they do not require noble blood for their rulers. All of their people are counted as free and equal, although individuals can acquire more money and greater influence, and the manners, hospitality, and honor of a character also valued. Magic is more common in Khinasi lands than other places, and spellcasters are greatly respected, while awnsheghlien are also much more common.\nThe set describes the many states and provinces of this land and how they relate to each other, as well as detailing the notable non-player characters. The set also contains new War Cards for the Khinasi military, including naval units.\nNew rules for the seafaring Khinasi are presented for trade and warfare at sea. Cities of the Sun gives rules for weather conditions, how to move shipping and handle shipwrecks, along with statistics for various vessels, and information on their costs and upkeep. The trade rules expand the simpler rules in the Birthright Campaign Setting booklet, and the rules for combat are handled similarly to land-based combat. The rules account for ranged and magical attacks, and include boarding maneuvers. The combat rules are also summarized on the naval battle mat intended to be used with the ship cards, while the reverse side of the mat contains a map of the entire region. Reference cards present both information and rules relevant to additional aspects of the Khinasi lands.\nCities of the Sun also includes a brief adventure for 4 to 8 player characters of levels 3–5, who get caught up in a conspiracy involving one of the awnsheghlien and a dangerous noble.\nCities of the Sun outlines states for player characters to govern, explore, and conquer. This book covers the Khinasi states, a region inspired by the Moorish culture of Spain.\n\n\nPublication history\nCities of the Sun was written by Rich Baker, and was published by TSR in 1995.  The cover and conceptual art was by Tony Szczudlo, with interior art by John Dollar and Les Dorscheid, and war card art by Doug Chaffee.\n\n\nReception\nCliff Ramshaw reviewed Cities of the Sun for British magazine Arcane, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. He felt that the set adds \"some Arabian spice\" to the \"pseudo-European mediaeval feudalism permeating most of Cerilia\". He felt that the additions to the combat rules add up to \"a simple yet robust system that should enable referees to resolve sea battles with speed and excitement\". Ramshaw found the adventure included in the set to be \"a highly linear affair\", and elaborates his feelings about the adventure: \"Besides lacking in imagination and freedom of movement, the adventure is crippled by situations where intelligent or merely wild character play will scupper the plot. To prevent this, the referee is forced into taking drastic measures. For instance, the bad guys arrive with sufficient force to overcome the players' naval expedition, whatever their precautions and backup. Worse, one chance for testing the naval combat rules will be missed [...] unless a character sits around doing nothing while everyone else goes exploring. Saldy, the adventure lets down an otherwise solid product.\"\n\n\nReviews\nDragon #233\nCasus Belli #92\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal is a ferry terminal and heliport located in Sheung Wan on Hong Kong Island. It is also known as the Macau Ferry Terminal, the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Pier or the Shun Tak Heliport, and has an ICAO code of VHST.\nThe terminal is one of the several in Hong Kong that provide ferry services to Macau and cities in southern China. Scheduled helicopter service is provided to Macau, with charter services to other regional destinations.\nThe terminal is located immediately to the west of Hong Kong's main business district, on the north shore of Hong Kong Island. It is connected to the territory's Mass Transit Railway, and well served by other forms of public transport. The terminal forms part of the Shun Tak Centre, a commercial and transport complex.\n\n\nHistory\nScheduled ferries have run between Hong Kong and Macau since the earliest days of the Hong Kong colony. Ferries to Macau departed from the old Macau Ferry Piers at this location from at least the mid-20th century, although in the 1960s the steamships – Tak Sing, Dai Loy, Fat Shan and the (more luxurious) Macao – would take around four hours for the trip. Also part of the present site was the famous Western Market.\nIn 1971, the Fat Shan sunk as the result of Typhoon Rose while on its way to Macau. 92 out of 96 aboard died, with most of them being crew members. It was carrying no passengers.\nThe ferry terminal, including ferry routes, was temporarily suspended from 4 February 2020 until 8 January 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nFerry facilities\n\nThe terminal utilises two island piers, each with several ferry docks, linked by enclosed pedestrian bridges to the ticketing and departure/arrival hall facilities in the lower levels of the Shun Tak Centre on the shore. The heliport is located above the inner pier, whilst the Hong Kong Vessel Traffic Centre, which monitors and regulates vessels navigating in the waters of Hong Kong, is located above the outer pier.\nThe terminal is the main point of departure for ferries to Macau, although services also operate from the Hong Kong-China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui and from Hong Kong International Airport (for transiting passengers only).\nFerry services are provided to Macau by two companies, both of which use a variety of designs of fast ferries, including catamarans and Boeing Jetfoils. TurboJET provides services to the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal in central Macau. Cotai Water Jet operates to the Taipa Ferry Terminal on the Taipa island, which enables easy access to The Venetian Macao casino and Macau International Airport. Both operators run services every 30 minutes, or more frequently, during the day, with TurboJET providing a limited overnight service. The journey time is approximately one hour.\nSeveral companies also provide limited service to ports within China's Guangdong, with destinations served including Shekou and Nansha. Other services to Guangdong destinations operate from the Hong Kong-China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui and Hong Kong International Airport (for transiting passengers only).\n\n\nAccident on 29 November 2013\nOn 29 November 2013, Madeira, a Boeing 929-100 Jetfoil of TurboJET with 105 passengers and 10 crew members onboard collided with an unknown object off Hei Ling Chau. 87 people were injured in the crash. The ferry crashed on Friday morning at 1:15 AM, on the way to Macau. Madeira then made its way to Kau Yi Chau and was hauled back to the ferry pier by a tugboat. Later that morning, it was hauled to Stonecutters shipyard for inspection. To this day, it’s still unknown what did Madeira collide with.\n\n\nHeliport\n\nThe heliport is formally known as the Shun Tak Heliport (IATA: HHP, ICAO: VHST). It is located above the inner pier of the ferry terminal, at an elevation of 107 feet (33 m) above sea level, and provides two helipads and a customer lounge. There is no refuelling service available. Use of the heliport is restricted to multi-engine helicopters with a maximum overall length, including rotor disk, of 16 metres (52 ft) and a maximum all up weight not exceeding 5,350 kilograms (11,790 lb).\nThe original heliport at the Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal was built in 1990, and provided a single helipad situated over the western end of the inner pier. The Hong Kong Heliport Expansion Project commenced in April 2008, when a new helipad was built over the eastern end of the same pier linked to a new passenger lounge. Once this was operational, the original helipad was replaced and two helipads linked, with project completion in October 2009.\nMacau-based Sky Shuttle helicopters use the heliport to provide a scheduled service to a corresponding heliport above the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal in Macau. Services operate between 09:00 and 23:00, with flights departing every 30 minutes or more frequently if traffic demands it, using AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters. The journey time is approximately 16 minutes.\nSky Shuttle also provides charter services on the same route, and from the heliport to other locations in neighbouring regions, including Macau International Airport, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport, and Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.\n\n\nDestinations\n\n\nImprovement fee\nEach ferry passenger is charged for 19 HKD regardless of their age. Each helicopter passenger aged 12 or above is charged for 120 HKD for improvement fee and 30 MOP for aviation service fee. Starting from 1 April 1999, the improvement fee for airport transiting passengers who arrive or depart on the same day is waived.\n\n\nGround transport\nApart from being a ferry terminal and heliport, it is also a public transport hub to various parts of Hong Kong. Adjacent to the terminal is the Sheung Wan MTR station, several bus termini are nearby the ferry terminal together with a minibus and taxi pick-up area at Shun Tak Centre. The Hong Kong Tramway has tram stops in either direction across the street.\nBuses terminate at Hong Kong-Macau Ferry, Rumsey Street, Man Kat Street and Sheung Wan, nearby Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal:\n\nBuses go to parts of Hong Kong Island such as Aldrich Bay, Island Resort and South Horizons\nBuses go to parts of Kowloon and New Territories such as City One Shatin, Ho Man Tin, Ping Shek Estate, Choi Fook Estate, Kowloon City Ferry\nBuses also go to and from: Yu Chui Court, Cross-Harbour Tunnel Toll Plaza, Tsz Wan Shan, Wan Tau Tong Estate, Luen Wo Hui, Po Tat Estate, Shun Lee, Kai Ching Estate, Ma On Shan, Hong Kong International Airport, Ngau Tau Kok, Yuen Long, Tiu Keng Leng.\n\n\nSee also\nTransport in Hong Kong\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nMacau Ferry Information\nCotai Water Jet Website\nTurboJET Website",

    "text": "Waterwolf, or Water-wolf is a Dutch word that comes from the Netherlands, which refers to the tendency of lakes in low lying peaty land, sometimes previously worn-down by men digging peat for fuel, to enlarge or expand by flooding, thus eroding the lake shores, and potentially causing harm to infrastructure, or death. The term waterwolf is an example of zoomorphism, in which a non-living thing is given traits or characteristics of an animal (whereas a non-living thing given human traits or characteristics is personification). The traits of a wolf most commonly given to lakes include \"something to be feared\", \"quick and relentless\", \"an enemy of man\".\nThe Netherlands, meaning 'low countries', is a nation where 18% of the land is below sea level, and half of the land under one meter above sea level, and is prone to flooding. Before modern flood control, severe storms could cause flooding that could wipe out whole villages in the area of the waterwolf. Much of the land in the Netherlands consists of peat bogs. Peat is organic matter consisting of 10% carbon and 90% water, usually found in colder climates where the plant growth and decay are slow. Peat is considered a form of carbon sequestration, and when dried can be burned as a fuel. Historically peat was the primary source of fuel in the Netherlands, and farmers would mine the peat to burn or sell, thus contributing to the erosion of the landscape.\nThe first great step to reclaiming land taken by the waterwolf was made with the creation of windmills that could pump water out of the surrounding area, allowing for the creation of polders, or areas inhabited below sea level with an artificially managed water table. Modern flood control in the Netherlands consists of maintaining polders and levees, and is highlighted by the world's largest dam project: The Delta Works.

It has an extensive distribution across the northern United States and southern Canada, with its native range stretching east-to-west from New Hampshire to Minnesota, and north-to-south from Ontario to Virginia.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nMordellistena pallipes was first described by American entomologist John Bernhardt Smith in 1882, based on a specimen collected in Ithaca, New York. The holotype specimen is held in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's entomology collection.\nIt has been suggested that Mordellistena pallipes and its congener Mordellistena pratensis, which is known from South Carolina and Florida, may represent geographically separated forms of the same species. If they were to be formally merged into one species, Mordellistena pallipes would hold precedence as the valid name.\n\n\nDescription\nMordellistena pallipes is a small, darkly-colored beetle measuring 2.5–3.2 mm (0.10–0.13 in) in length from its head to the tip of its elytra. Its leg ridge formula has been variably listed as either 2-3-1 or 2(3)-3-1, either of which allow it to be distinguished from its close relative Mordellistena pratensis, which has a leg ridge formula of 2-2-2. Its common name, the \"pale-legged tumbling flower beetle,\" is derived from its pale-colored legs, which were declared to be a diagnostic characteristic of the species in Smith's original description. However, later research conducted by Emil Liljeblad in 1945 determined that the middle and posterior legs are often significantly darker or even black in coloration.\nJ.B. Smith's original description of the species is as follows: \"All the legs pale testaceous—an unusual character in the genus—this point and the darker margins of elytra render the species easily recognizable. The rudiment of the third ridge is very short, having but two or three spinules but the pale color of the legs renders it easily noted, as the spinules are black. One specimen, Ithaca, N. Y.; my collection.\"\n\n\nDistribution and range\nMordellistena pallipes is native to the northeastern United States and southern Canada. It has been recorded in the U.S. states of Minnesota, Michigan (Grand Ledge), New Hampshire (Tamworth), Massachusetts (Framingham, Natick), New York, Maryland (Edgewater), and Virginia (Dyke Marsh), and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Manitoba (Aweme), and Saskatchewan.\n\n\nConservation status\nThe conservation status of this species is not well-documented, likely due to its rarity in nature. It has not been evaluated by the IUCN Red List, and is unranked by NatureServe. It is known to occur in several protected areas, including the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve in Virginia and Criddle/Vane Homestead Provincial Park in Manitoba.\n\n\nReferences",
