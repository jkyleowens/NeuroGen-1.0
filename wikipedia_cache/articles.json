    "text": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an umbrella term used to group together the related technical disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It represents a broad and interconnected set of fields that are crucial for innovation and technological advancement. These disciplines are often grouped together because they share a common emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. The term is typically used in the context of education policy or curriculum choices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area), and immigration policy, with regard to admitting foreign students and tech workers.\nThere is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular, whether or not the science in STEM includes social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, and political science. In the United States, these are typically included by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Labor's O*Net online database for job seekers, and the Department of Homeland Security. In the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym HASS (humanities, arts, and social sciences), rebranded in 2020 as SHAPE (social sciences, humanities and the arts for people and the economy). Some sources also use HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) as the counterpart of STEM.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nHistory\nIn the early 1990s the acronym STEM was used by a variety of educators. Beverly P. Schwartz developed a STEM mentoring program in the Capital District of New York State, and was using the acronym as early as November, 1991. Charles E. Vela was the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE) and started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, D.C. area called the STEM Institute. Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics, and engineering education. Previously referred to as SMET by the NSF, it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM. One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which was founded in 1998.\nIn 2001, at the urging of Dr. Peter Faletra, the Director of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists at the Office of Science, the acronym was adopted by Rita Colwell and other science administrators in the National Science Foundation (NSF). The Office of Science was also an early adopter of the STEM acronym.\n\n\nOther variations\neSTEM (environmental STEM)\nGEMS (girls in engineering, math, and science); used for programs to encourage women to enter these fields.\nMINT (mathematics, informatics, natural sciences, and technology)\nSHTEAM (science, humanities, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics)\nSMET (science, mathematics, engineering, and technology); previous name\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics)\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and mathematics); add agriculture\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, and applied mathematics); has more focus on applied mathematics\nSTEEM (science, technology, engineering, economics, and mathematics); adds economics as a field\nSTEMIE (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, invention, and entrepreneurship); adds inventing and entrepreneurship as a means to apply STEM to real-world problem-solving and markets.\nSTEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine)\nSTM (scientific, technical, and mathematics or science, technology, and medicine)\nSTREAM (science, technology, robotics, engineering, arts, and mathematics); adds robotics and arts as fields\nSTREAM (science, technology, reading, engineering, arts, and mathematics); adds reading and arts\nSTREAM (science, technology, recreation, engineering, arts, and mathematics); adds recreation and arts\n\n\nGeographic distribution\n\nBy the mid-2000s, China surpassed the United States in the number of PhDs awarded and is expected to produce 77,000 PhDs in 2025, compared to 40,000 in the US.\n\n\nBy country\n\n\nAustralia\nThe Australian Curriculum, Assessment, and Reporting Authority 2015 report entitled, National STEM School Education Strategy, stated that \"A renewed national focus on STEM in school education is critical to ensuring that all young Australians are equipped with the necessary STEM skills and knowledge that they must need to succeed.\" Its goals were to:\n\n\"Ensure all students finish school with strong foundational knowledge in STEM and related skills\"\n\"Ensure that students are inspired to take on more challenging STEM subjects\"\nEvents and programs meant to help develop STEM in Australian schools include the Victorian Model Solar Vehicle Challenge, the Maths Challenge (Australian Mathematics Trust), Go Girl Go Global and the Australian Informatics Olympiad.\n\n\nCanada\nCanada ranks 12th out of 16 peer countries in the percentage of its graduates who studied in STEM programs, with 21.2%, a number higher than the United States, but lower than France, Germany, and Austria. The peer country with the greatest proportion of STEM graduates, Finland, has over 30% of its university graduates coming from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering programs.\nSHAD is an annual Canadian summer enrichment program for high-achieving high school students in July. The program focuses on academic learning, particularly in STEAM fields.\nScouts Canada has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015.\nIn 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist Seymour Schulich established the Schulich Leader Scholarships, $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields. The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in Israel.\n\n\nChina\n\nTo promote STEM in China, the Chinese government issued a guideline in 2016 on national innovation-driven development strategy, \"instructing that by 2020, China should become an innovative country; by 2030, it should be at the forefront of innovative countries; and by 2050, it should become a technology innovation power.\"\n\"[I]n May 2018, the launching ceremony and press conference for the 2029 Action Plan for China's STEM Education was held in Beijing, China. This plan aims to allow as many students to benefit from STEM education as possible and equip all students with scientific thinking and the ability to innovate.\" \"In response to encouraging policies by the government, schools in both public and private sectors around the country have begun to carry out STEM education programs.\"\n\"However, to effectively implement STEM curricula, full-time teachers specializing in STEM education and relevant content to be taught are needed.\" Currently, \"China lacks qualified STEM teachers and a training system is yet to be established.\"\nSeveral Chinese cities have made programming a mandatory subject for elementary and middle school students. This is the case of the city of Chongqing. However, most students from small and medium-sized cities have not been exposed to the concept of STEM until they enter college.\n\n\nEurope\n\nSeveral European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge project used a social media contest and student-generated content to increase the motivation of pre-university students for STEM education and careers. The Erasmus programme project AutoSTEM used automata to introduce STEM subjects to very young children.\n\n\nFinland\nThe LUMA Center is the leading advocate for STEM-oriented education. Its aim is to promote the instruction and research of natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, and technology across all educational levels in the country. In the native tongue luma stands for \"luonnontieteellis-matemaattinen\" (lit. adj. \"scientific-mathematical\"). The short is more or less a direct translation of STEM, with engineering fields included by association. However, unlike STEM, the term is also a portmanteau from lu and ma. To address the decline in interest in learning the areas of science, the Finnish National Board of Education launched the LUMA scientific education development program. The project's main goal was to raise the level of Finnish education and to enhance students' competencies, improve educational practices, and foster interest in science. The initiative led to the establishment of 13 LUMA centers at universities across Finland supervised by LUMA Center.\n\n\nFrance\nThe name of STEM in France is industrial engineering sciences (sciences industrielles or sciences de l'ingénieur). The STEM organization in France is the association UPSTI.\n\n\nHong Kong\nSTEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document titled Promotion of STEM Education, which proposes strategies and recommendations for promoting STEM education.\n\n\nIndia\n\nIndia is next only to China with STEM graduates per population of 1 to 52. The total number of fresh STEM graduates was 2.6 million in 2016. STEM graduates have been contributing to the Indian economy with well-paid salaries locally and abroad for the past two decades. The turnaround of the Indian economy with comfortable foreign exchange reserves is mainly attributed to the skills of its STEM graduates. In India, women make up an impressive 43% of STEM graduates, the highest percentage worldwide. However, they hold only 14% of STEM-related jobs. Additionally, among the 280,000 scientists and engineers working in research and development institutes in the country, women represent a mere 14%\nIn India, OMOTEC is providing an innovative curriculum based on STEM, and their students are also performing and developing products to solve the new age problems. Two students also won the Microsoft Imagine Cup for developing a non-invasive method to screen for skin cancer using artificial intelligence.\n\n\nNigeria\nIn Nigeria, the Association of Professional Women Engineers Of Nigeria (APWEN) has involved girls between the ages of 12 and 19 in science-based courses in order for them to pursue science-based courses in higher institutions of learning. The National Science Foundation (NSF) In Nigeria has made conscious efforts to encourage girls to innovate, invent, and build through the \"invent it, build it\" program sponsored by NNPC.\n\n\nPakistan\nSTEM subjects are taught in Pakistan as part of electives taken in the 9th and 10th grades, culminating in Matriculation exams. These electives are pure sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), mathematics (Physics, Chemistry, Maths), and computer science (Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science). STEM subjects are also offered as electives taken in the 11th and 12th grades, more commonly referred to as first and second year, culminating in Intermediate exams. These electives are FSc pre-medical (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), FSc pre-engineering (Physics, Chemistry, Maths), and ICS (Physics/Statistics, Computer Science, Maths). These electives are intended to aid students in pursuing STEM-related careers in the future by preparing them for the study of these courses at university.\nA STEM education project has been approved by the government to establish STEM labs in public schools. The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication has collaborated with Google to launch Pakistan's first grassroots-level Coding Skills Development Program, based on Google's CS First Program, a global initiative aimed at developing coding skills in children. The program aims to develop applied coding skills using gamification techniques for children between the ages of 9 and 14.\nThe KPITBs Early Age Programming initiative, established in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has been successfully introduced in 225 Elementary and Secondary Schools. Many private organizations are working in Pakistan to introduce STEM education in schools.\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, STEM is a two-year program and strand that is used for Senior High School (Grades 11 and 12), assigned by the Department of Education or DepEd. The STEM strand is under the Academic Track, which also includes other strands like ABM, HUMSS, and GAS. The purpose of the STEM strand is to educate students in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, in an interdisciplinary and applied approach, and to give students advanced knowledge and application in the field. After completing the program, the students will earn a Diploma in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In some colleges and universities, they require students applying for STEM degrees (like medicine, engineering, computer studies, etc.) to be a graduate of STEM, if not, they will need to enter a bridging program.\n\n\nQatar\nIn Qatar, AL-Bairaq is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions. AL-Bairaq makes use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions. Research has so far shown positive results for the program.\n\n\nSingapore\nSTEM is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) has been promoting since 2013, and currently, all secondary schools have such a program. It is expected that by 2023, all primary schools in Singapore will have an ALP. There are no tests or exams for ALPs. The emphasis is for students to learn through experimentation – they try, fail, try, learn from it, and try again. The MOE actively supports schools with ALPs to further enhance and strengthen their capabilities and programs that nurture innovation and creativity.\nThe Singapore Science Centre established a STEM unit in January 2014, dedicated to igniting students' passion for STEM. To further enrich students' learning experiences, their Industrial Partnership Programme (IPP) creates opportunities for students to get early exposure to real-world STEM industries and careers. Curriculum specialists and STEM educators from the Science Centre will work hand-in-hand with teachers to co-develop STEM lessons, provide training to teachers, and co-teach such lessons to provide students with early exposure and develop their interest in STEM.\n\n\nThailand\nIn 2017, Thai Education Minister Teerakiat Jareonsettasin said after the 49th Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO) Council Conference in Jakarta that the meeting approved the establishment of two new SEAMEO regional centers in Thailand. One would be the STEM Education Centre, while the other would be a Sufficient Economy Learning Centre.\nTeerakiat said that the Thai government had already allocated Bt250 million over five years for the new STEM center. The center will be the regional institution responsible for STEM education promotion. It will not only set up policies to improve STEM education, but it will also be the center for information and experience sharing among the member countries and education experts. According to him, \"This is the first SEAMEO regional center for STEM education, as the existing science education center in Malaysia only focuses on the academic perspective. Our STEM education center will also prioritize the implementation and adaptation of science and technology.\"\nThe Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology has initiated a STEM Education Network. Its goals are to promote integrated learning activities improve student creativity and application of knowledge, and establish a network of organations and personnel for the promotion of STEM education in the country.\n\n\nTurkey\nTurkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum. Maintaining a citizenry that is well-versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the public education agenda of the United States. The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States work visas for immigrants who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas. The term tends not to refer to the non-professional and less visible sectors of the fields, such as electronics assembly line work.\n\n\nNational Science Foundation\nMany organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the National Science Foundation on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broad definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of chemistry, computer and information technology science, engineering, geoscience, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, social sciences (anthropology, economics, psychology, and sociology), and STEM education and learning research.\nThe NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences. Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, and fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and information science and engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geoscience, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.\n\n\nImmigration policy\nAlthough many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the National Science Foundation on what constitutes a STEM field, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy. In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM-designated degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States can stay in the country and receive up to twelve months of training through work experience. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can stay for an additional seventeen months on an OPT STEM extension.\nAs of 2023, the U.S. faces a shortage of high-skilled workers in STEM, and foreign talents must navigate difficult hurdles to immigrate. Meanwhile, some other countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, have introduced programs to attract talent at the expense of the United States. In the case of China, the United States risks losing its edge over a strategic rival.\n\n\nEducation\n\nBy cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved.\nSTEM supports broadening the study of engineering within each of the other subjects and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the \"Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)\" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.\n\nIn the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading, and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees.\nSTEM education often uses new technologies such as 3D printers to encourage interest in STEM fields. STEM education can also leverage the combination of new technologies, such as photovoltaics and environmental sensors, with old technologies such as composting systems and irrigation within land lab environments.\nIn 2006 the United States National Academies expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:\n\nIncrease America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education\nStrengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics, and technology\nEnlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.\nIndividual states, such as California, have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success. Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where Florida Polytechnic University, Florida's first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), was established. During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S. Some states include New Jersey, Arizona, Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and Ohio.\nContinuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program as well as the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\nRacial gap in STEM fields\n\nIn the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than for white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders. In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black. Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender-diverse field. Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.\n\n\nGender gaps in STEM\nAlthough women make up 47% of the workforce in the U.S., they hold only 24% of STEM jobs. Research suggests that exposing girls to female inventors at a young age has the potential to reduce the gender gap in technical STEM fields by half. Campaigns from organizations like the National Inventors Hall of Fame aimed to achieve a 50/50 gender balance in their youth STEM programs by 2020. The gender gap in Zimbabwe's STEM fields is also significant, with only 28.79% of women holding STEM degrees compared to 71.21% of men.\n\n\nIntersectionality in STEM\nSTEM fields have been recognized as areas where underrepresentation and exclusion of marginalized groups are prevalent. STEM poses unique challenges related to intersectionality due to rigid norms and stereotypes, both in higher education and professional settings. These norms often prioritize objectivity and meritocracy while overlooking structural inequities, creating environments where individuals with intersecting marginalized identities face compounded barriers.\nFor instance, individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups may experience a phenomenon known as \"chilly climates\" which refers to incidents of sexism, isolation, and pressure to prove themselves to peers and high level academics. For minority populations in STEM, loneliness is experienced due to lack of belonging and social isolation.\n\n\nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative\nIn the State of the Union Address on January 31, 2006, President George W. Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced R&D programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through DOE) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.\nThe NASA Means Business competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.\nThe National Science Foundation has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some Arizona schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.\nProject Lead The Way (PLTW) is a provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called Pathway To Engineering, a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called Gateway To Technology. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President Barack Obama and United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan as well as various state, national, and business leaders.\n\n\nSTEM Education Coalition\nThe Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Coalition works to support STEM programs for teachers and students at the U.S. Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies that offer STEM-related programs. Activity of the STEM Coalition seems to have slowed since September 2008. \nFounded in 2001, STEM.org Educational Research™ is a private organization that operates a global trustmark framework for STEM education. Its credentialing system, which includes distinctions for educational programs, products, and professionals, is used to verify STEM authenticity and quality in over 80 countries.\n\n\nScouting\nIn 2012, the Boy Scouts of America began handing out awards, titled NOVA and SUPERNOVA, for completing specific requirements appropriate to the scouts' program level in each of the four main STEM areas. The Girl Scouts of the USA has similarly incorporated STEM into their program through the introduction of merit badges such as \"Naturalist\" and \"Digital Art\".\nSAE is an international organization, and provider specializing in supporting education, award, and scholarship programs for STEM matters, from pre-K to college degrees. It also promotes scientific and technological innovation.\n\n\nDepartment of Defense programs\n\neCybermission is a free, web-based science, mathematics, and technology competition for students in grades six through nine sponsored by the U.S. Army. Each webinar is focused on a different step of the scientific method and is presented by an experienced eCybermission CyberGuide. CyberGuides are military and civilian volunteers with a strong background in STEM and STEM education, who can provide insight into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to students and team advisers.\nSTARBASE is an educational program, sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Students interact with military personnel to explore careers and make connections with the \"real world\". The program provides students with 20–25 hours of experience at the National Guard, Navy, Marines, Air Force Reserve, and Air Force bases across the nation.\nSeaPerch is an underwater robotics program that trains teachers to teach their students how to build an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in an in-school or out-of-school setting. Students build the ROV from a kit composed of low-cost, easily accessible parts, following a curriculum that teaches basic engineering and science concepts with a marine engineering theme.\n\n\nNASA\n\nNASAStem is a program of the U.S. space agency NASA to increase diversity within its ranks, including age, disability, and gender as well as race/ethnicity.\n\n\nLegislation\nThe America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110–69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology laboratories, and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.\n\n\nJobs\nIn November 2012 the White House announcement before the congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign. The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are \"projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to the economy or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers.\" The identified sectors were as follows: advanced manufacturing, Automotive, construction, financial services, geospatial technology, homeland security, information technology, Transportation, Aerospace, Biotechnology, energy, healthcare, hospitality, and retail.\nThe Department of Commerce notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.\nIn 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing by around 9% percent per year. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.\nAccording to Pew Research Center, a typical STEM worker earns two-thirds more than those employed in other fields.\n\n\nRecent progress\nAccording to the 2014 US census \"74 percent of those who have a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering and math — commonly referred to as STEM — are not employed in STEM occupations.\"\nIn September 2017, several large American technology firms collectively pledged to donate $300 million for computer science education in the U.S.\nPEW findings revealed in 2018 that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is the lack of students' concentration in learning.\nThe recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) report card made public technology as well as engineering literacy scores which determines whether students can apply technology and engineering proficiency to real-life scenarios. The report showed a gap of 28 points between low-income students and their high-income counterparts. The same report also indicated a 38-point difference between white and black students.\nThe Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) announced the release of a five-year strategic plan by the Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and Technology Council on December 4, 2018. The plan is entitled \"Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education.\" The objective is to propose a federal strategy anchored on a vision for the future so that all Americans are given permanent access to premium-quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In the end, the United States can emerge as a world leader in STEM mastery, employment, and innovation. The goals of this plan are building foundations for STEM literacy; enhancing diversity, equality, and inclusion in STEM; and preparing the STEM workforce for the future.\nThe 2019 fiscal budget proposal of the White House supported the funding plan in President Donald Trump's Memorandum on STEM Education which allocated around $200 million (grant funding) for STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth $20 million for career as well as technical education programs.\n\n\nEvents and programs to help develop STEM in US schools\nFIRST Tech Challenge\nVEX Robotics Competitions\nFIRST Robotics Competition\n\n\nVietnam\nIn Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations have STEM education initiatives.\nIn 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM Day, followed by many similar events across the country.\nin 2015, the Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area that needed to be encouraged in the national school year program.\nIn May 2017, the Prime Minister signed a Directive No. 16 stating: \"Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; \" and asking \"Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.\n\n\nWomen\n\nWomen constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs. In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014). In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.\n\nThe gender ratio depends on the field of study. For example, in the European Union in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business, and law, 42% of the science, mathematics, and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing, and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.\nIn a study from 2019, it was shown that part of the success of women in STEM depends on the way women in STEM are viewed. In a study that researched grants given based primarily on a project versus primarily based on the project lead there was almost no difference in the evaluation between projects from men or women when evaluated on the project, but those evaluated mainly on the project leader showed that projects headed by women were given grants four percent less often.\nImproving the experiences of women in STEM is a major component of increasing the number of women in STEM. One part of this includes the need for role models and mentors who are women in STEM. Along with this, having good resources for information and networking opportunities can improve women's ability to flourish in STEM fields.\nA 2018 study suggested the propensity for women to pursue college degrees in STEM fields declines consistently as countries become more wealthy and egalitarian. However, a 2019 correction to the study outlined that the authors had created a previously undisclosed and unvalidated method to measure \"propensity\" of women and men to attain a higher degree in STEM, as opposed to the originally claimed measurement of \"women's share of STEM degrees.\" Harvard researchers were unable to recreate the results of the study, thus highlighting problems with the interpretation of the data in the original paper.\n\n\nLGBTQ+\n\nPeople identifying within the group LGBTQ+ have faced discrimination in STEM fields throughout history. Few were openly queer in STEM; however, a couple of well-known people are Alan Turing, the father of computer science, and Sara Josephine Baker, an American physician and public-health leader.\nDespite recent changes in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, discrimination still permeates throughout STEM fields. A recent study has shown that sexual minority students were less likely to have completed a bachelor's degree in a STEM field, having opted to switch their major. Those that remained in a STEM field were however more likely to participate in undergraduate research programs. According to the study sexual minorities did show higher overall retention rates within STEM related fields as compared to heterosexual women. Another study concluded that queer people are more likely to experience exclusion, harassment, and other negative impacts while in a STEM career while also having fewer opportunities and resources available to them.\nMultiple programs and institutions are working towards increasing the inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ+ people in STEM. In the US, the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals (NOGLSTP) has organized people to address homophobia since the 1980s and now promotes activism and support for queer scientists. Other programs, including 500 Queer Scientists and Pride in STEM, function as visibility campaigns for LGBTQ+ people in STEM worldwide.\n\n\nCriticism\nThe focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article \"The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage\" in The Atlantic, demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, \"No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher\", and that \"Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations.\" Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since World War II to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in \"mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts\"; including one driven by the Space Race of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to \"a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s.\"\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, various STEM occupational outlooks have shown slowing growth or declines for several years.\nIEEE Spectrum contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article \"The STEM Crisis Is a Myth\", also noting that there was a \"mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job\" in the United States, with only around 1⁄4 of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.\nEconomics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings in the United States for FiveThirtyEight, wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, \"many sciences, particularly the life sciences, pay below the overall median for recent college graduates.\"\nA 2017 article from the University of Leicester concluded, that\n\"maintaining accounts of a 'crisis' in the supply of STEM workers has usually been in the interests of industry, the education\nsector and government, as well as the lobby groups that represent them. Concerns about a shortage have meant the allocation of significant additional resources to the sector whose representatives have, in turn, become powerful voices in advocating for further funds and further investment.\"\nA 2022 report from Rutgers University stated:\n\"In the United States, the STEM crisis theme is a perennial policy favorite, appearing every few years as an urgent concern in the nation's competition with whatever other nation is ascendant, or as the cause of whatever problem is ailing the domestic economy. And the solution is always the same: increase the supply of STEM workers through expanding STEM education. Time and again, serious and empirically grounded studies find little evidence of any systemic failures or an inability of market responses to address whatever supply is required to meet workforce needs.\"\nA study of the UK job market, published in 2022, found similar problems, which have been reported for the USA earlier: \"It is not clear that having a degree in the sciences, rather than in other subjects, provides any sort of advantage in terms of short- or long-term employability... While only a minority of STEM graduates ever work in highly-skilled STEM jobs, we identified three particular characteristics of the STEM labour market that may present challenges for employers: STEM employment appears to be predicated on early\nentry to the sector; a large proportion of STEM graduates are likely to never work in the sector; and there may be more movement out of HS STEM positions by older workers than in other sectors... \"\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nDavid Beede; et al.

    "summary": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an umbrella term used to group together the related technical disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It represents a broad and interconnected set of fields that are crucial for innovation and technological advancement. These disciplines are often grouped together because they share a common emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. The term is typically used in the context of education policy or curriculum choices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area), and immigration policy, with regard to admitting foreign students and tech workers.\nThere is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular, whether or not the science in STEM includes social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, and political science. In the United States, these are typically included by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Labor's O*Net online database for job seekers, and the Department of Homeland Security. In the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym HASS (humanities, arts, and social sciences), rebranded in 2020 as SHAPE (social sciences, humanities and the arts for people and the economy). Some sources also use HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) as the counterpart of STEM.",

    "title": "Islam in Lebanon",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=38294453",
    "text": "Islam  has a long, continuous history in Lebanon. The majority of the Lebanese population is Muslim, although the precise percentage is difficult to ascertain. The Lebanese constitution officially guarantees freedom of religion for government-registered religions, including five denominations of Islam, although a blasphemy law and restrictions on religious groups that \"disturb the public order\" exist as well. Under the Taif Agreement, Muslims are allocated proportional representation across multiple governmental positions.\nThe Lebanese Druze community are sometimes counted as a branch of Islam within Lebanon, though most Druze followers do not consider themselves Muslim and do not follow the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nDemographics\n\nIt is difficult to obtain precise demographic information within Lebanon, as the country has not had an official census since 1932. In that census, Muslims amounted to 42% of the population (with slightly more Sunni than Shia Muslims), but Christians (primarily Maronites) composed a small majority of the population. Lebanon was a French mandate between World War I and World War II, and was founded in part to serve as a home for Christians within West Asia.\nDemographic estimates since the 1932 census have found a significantly higher proportion of Muslims than the census did. This increase is not generally believed to be a result of population changes, but rather due to less biased estimation processes.\nCurrent demographic estimates generally agree that Muslims represent the majority of the Lebanese population, though estimates range from 60 to 70% of the Lebanese population. According to the May 2025 edition of the CIA World Factbook, the Muslim population is estimated to be 67.8%, of which approximately 47% are Sunni, 47% are Shia, and the remainder are Alawite or Ismaili. Pew Research estimated the 2020 proportion of Muslims in Lebanon in 2020 at 61.2%. Statistics Lebanon, a non-governmental research firm, estimated that 69.3% of Lebanese people Muslims, with approximately 45% of these Muslims being Shia, 45% being Sunni, and 10% being Alawite or Ismaili. A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) study in 1985 put the numbers of Muslims at 68% of the population in 1985.\nThe Druze are sometimes designated as one of the five Lebanese Muslim communities (Sunni, Shia, Druze, Alawi, and Ismaili), even though most Druze do not identify as Muslims, and they do not accept the five pillars of Islam.\nIn Lebanon, the different Muslim sects are spread across distinct regions. Sunnis are mainly concentrated in West Beirut, Tripoli in the north, Sidon in the south, and parts of the Bekaa Valley such as Arsal. Shias are largely based in South Lebanon, particularly around Tyre, Nabatieh, and Bint Jbeil, as well as in the Bekaa Valley around Baalbek and Hermel, and in Beirut’s southern suburbs known as Dahieh. Alawites, who make up a very small community, are mostly found in the Jabal Mohsen neighborhood of Tripoli.\n\nIn 2014, according to *وقائع إنتخابية عن لبنان، حسب لوائح الناخبين الرسمية الصادرة عن وزارة الداخلية اللبنانية لسنة ٢٠١٤* , Muslims made up 56.9% of registered voters aged 21 and above: 28.26% Sunnis, 27.83% Shias, and 0.81% Alawites.\nIn 2022 , based on the registered voters aged 21+ for the elections, Muslims represented 56.83%: 28.21% Sunnis, 27.77% Shias, and 0.84% Alawites.\nThe overall proportions remained very stable between 2014 and 2022, with only slight increases in all three groups.\n\n\nCurrent political and religious issues\n\nAlthough Lebanon is officially a secular country, religious identity and religious leadership play significant roles for the Lebanese government. Religious groups must register with the Lebanese government, and citizens report their religious identity to the Ministry of Interior’s (MOI’s) Personal Status Directorate. The government considers the Druze a sect of Islam. Religious identities play a critical role in maintaining the balance of power within the Lebanese government; the National Pact of 1943 guarantees that the Prime Minister must be a Sunnite, and the Speaker of Parliament must be a Shiite, and the President must be a Maronite Christian. Under the National Pact, 45% of the governmental and parliamentary positions were reserved for Muslims. Since the Taif Agreement in 1990, this has been revised to a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians.\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith. Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities but civil marriages conducted in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.\nAtheism is not recognized by the state. However, the Minister of the Interior Ziad Baroud made it possible in 2009 to have the religious sect removed from one’s Lebanese identity card. This does not, however, deny religious authorities complete control over civil family issues inside the country.\n\n\nBranches\nLebanese Muslims are divided into many branches like Shiites, Sunnis, Alawites, and Ismailis.\nThe Druze are sometimes considered a fifth branch of Islam for governmental purposes, despite significant religious differences between the faiths most don't identify as Muslims.\n\n\nShia Islam\n\nThe Lebanese Shia Muslims are around 29%-31% of the total population. Twelvers are the predominant Shia group, followed by Alawites and Ismailis. The Speaker of Parliament is always a Shi'a Muslim, as it is the only high post that Shi'as are eligible for. The Shiites are largely concentrated in northern and central Beqaa, Southern Lebanon, in south Beirut (southern parts of Greater Beirut).\n\n\nSunni Islam\n\nThe Lebanese Sunni Muslims constitute around 27%–29% of the total population with the Hanafi and Shafiʽi madhhab being the predominant Sunni groups. Sunni notables traditionally held power in the Lebanese state together, and they are still the only ones eligible for the post of Prime Minister Sunnis form the majority in west Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon, Central and Western Beqaa and hasbaya, ikleem al kharroub, Miniyeh, and Danniyeh districts, and Akkar in the north.\nSeveral large Sufi orders are active in the country, including the Naqshbandi and Qadiriyya tariqas.\n\n\nDruze\n\nThe Lebanese Druze constitute 5% of the population and can be found primarily in Mount Lebanon and the Shouf District. Under the Lebanese political division (Parliament of Lebanon Seat Allocation) the Druze community is designated as one of the five Lebanese Muslim communities (Sunni, Shia, Druze, Alawi, and Ismaili). Most Druze do not identify as Muslims.\n\n\nSee also\n\nReligion in Lebanon\nSecularism in Lebanon\nChristianity in Lebanon\nShia Islam in Lebanon\nSunni Islam in Lebanon\nDruze in Lebanon\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Naproxen",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=501250",
    "text": "Naproxen, sold under the brand name Aleve among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, menstrual cramps, and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and fever. It is taken orally. It is available in immediate and delayed release formulations. Onset of effects is within an hour and lasts for up to twelve hours. Naproxen is also available in salt form, naproxen sodium, which has better solubility when taken orally.\nCommon side effects include dizziness, headache, bruising, allergic reactions, heartburn, and stomach pain. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomach ulcers. The heart disease risk may be lower than with other NSAIDs. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy.\nNaproxen is a nonselective COX inhibitor. As an NSAID, naproxen appears to exert its anti-inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called prostaglandins. It is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites.\nNaproxen was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. In the United States it is available over-the-counter and as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 103rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. Naproxen is a therapeutic alternative on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\n\n\nMedical uses\nNaproxen's medical uses are related to its mechanism of action as an anti-inflammatory compound. Naproxen is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and symptoms that are due to excessive inflammation, such as pain and fever (naproxen has fever-reducing, or antipyretic, properties in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity). Naproxen's anti-inflammatory properties relieve pain caused by inflammatory conditions such as migraine, osteoarthritis, kidney stones, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual cramps, tendinitis, and bursitis.  Naproxen has also proven effective for acute post-operative pain.\nNaproxen sodium is used as a \"bridge therapy\" in medication-overuse headache to slowly take patients off other medications.\n\n\nAvailable formulations\nNaproxen sodium is available as both an immediate-release and an extended-release tablet. The extended-release formulations (sometimes called \"sustained release\", or \"enteric coated\") take longer to take effect than the immediate-release formulations and therefore are less useful when immediate pain relief is desired. Extended-release formulations are more useful for the treatment of chronic, or long-lasting, conditions, in which long-term pain relief is desirable.\n\n\nPregnancy and lactation\nAs with all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), naproxen use should be avoided in pregnancy due to the importance of prostaglandins in vascular and renal function in the fetus. NSAIDs should especially be avoided in the third trimester. Small amounts of naproxen are excreted in breast milk. However, adverse effects are uncommon in infants breastfed from a mother taking naproxen.\n\n\nAdverse effects\nCommon adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, bruising, and gastrointestinal upset. Heavy use is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease and kidney failure. Naproxen may cause muscle cramps in the legs in 3% of people.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescribing information to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.\n\n\nGastrointestinal\nAs with other non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs, naproxen can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers and stomach bleeding. Naproxen should be taken orally with, or just after food, to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Persons with a history of ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease should consult a doctor before taking naproxen. In U.S. markets, naproxen is sold with boxed warnings about the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding. Naproxen poses an intermediate risk of stomach ulcers compared with ibuprofen, which is low-risk, and indometacin, which is high-risk. To reduce stomach ulceration risk, it is often combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (a medication that reduces stomach acid production) during long-term treatment of those with pre-existing stomach ulcers or a history of developing stomach ulcers while on NSAIDs.\n\n\nCardiovascular\nCOX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs have been linked to increases in the number of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Naproxen is, however, associated with the smallest overall cardiovascular risks. Cardiovascular risk must be considered when prescribing any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The drug had roughly 50% of the associated risk of stroke compared with ibuprofen and was also associated with a reduced number of myocardial infarctions compared with control groups.\nA study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet thromboxane throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet COX-1 and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard. Conversely, naproxen was associated with higher rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding complications compared with other NSAIDs.\n\n\nDrug-drug interactions\nNaproxen may interact with antidepressants, lithium, methotrexate, probenecid, warfarin and other blood thinners, heart or blood pressure medications, including diuretics, or steroid medicines such as prednisone.\nNSAIDs such as naproxen may interfere with and reduce the efficacy of SSRI antidepressants, as well as increase the risk of bleeding greater than the individual bleeding risk of either class of agent, when taken together. Naproxen is not contraindicated in the presence of SSRIs, though concomitant use of the medications should be done with caution. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with NSAIDs like naproxen in a dose-dependent manner (that is, the higher the dose of naproxen, the higher the risk of bleeding). The risk is highest for people who are heavy drinkers.\n\n\nPharmacology\n\n\nMechanism of action\nNaproxen works by reversibly inhibiting both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as a non-selective coxib.\n\n\nPharmacokinetics\nNaproxen is a minor substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, and both the parent drug and the desmethyl metabolite undergo further metabolism to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. An analysis of two clinical trials shows that naproxen's time to peak plasma concentration occurs between 2 and 4 hours after oral administration (the naproxen sodium formulation of the medication reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours).\n\n\nPharmacogenetics\nThe pharmacogenetics of naproxen has been studied to better understand its adverse effects. In 1998, a small pharmacokinetic (PK) study failed to show that differences in a patient's ability to clear naproxen from the body could account for differences in a patient's risk of experiencing the adverse effect of a serious gastrointestinal bleed while taking naproxen. However, the study failed to account for differences in the activity of CYP2C9, a drug-metabolizing enzyme that is necessary for clearing naproxen. Studies on the relationship between CYP2C9 genotype and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds have shown that genetic variants in CYP2C9 that reduce the clearance of major CYP2C9 substrates (like naproxen) increase the risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds, especially for homozygous defective variants.\n\n\nChemistry\nNaproxen is a member of the 2-arylpropionic acid (profen) family of NSAIDs. The free acid is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. Naproxen free base is lipid-soluble and practically insoluble in water, while naproxen sodium and many other salts are freely soluble in water, often soluble in methanol, and sparingly soluble in alcohol; check the specific solubility of each salt before use. Naproxen has a melting point of 152–155 °C, while naproxen salts tend to have higher melting points.\n\n\nSynthesis\nNaproxen has been industrially produced by Syntex starting from 2-naphthol as follows:\n\n\nSociety and culture\n\n\nBrand names\nNaproxen and naproxen sodium are marketed under various brand names, including Accord, Aleve, Anaprox, Antalgin, Apranax, Feminax Ultra, Flanax, Inza, Maxidol, Nalgesin, Naposin, Naprelan, Naprogesic, Naprosyn, Narocin, Pronaxen, Proxen, Soproxen, and Xenifar. It is also available as the combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium in delayed-release tablets under the brand name Vimovo.\n\n\nAccess restrictions\nSyntex first marketed naproxen in 1976, as the prescription drug Naprosyn. They first marketed naproxen sodium under the brand name Anaprox in 1980. It remains a prescription-only drug in much of the world. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug in 1994. OTC preparations of naproxen in the U.S. are mainly marketed by Bayer HealthCare under the brand name Aleve and generic store brand formulations in 220 mg tablets. In Australia, packets of 275 mg tablets of naproxen sodium are Schedule 2 pharmacy medicines, with a maximum daily dose of five tablets or 1375 mg. In the United Kingdom, 250 mg tablets of naproxen were approved for OTC sale under the brand name Feminax Ultra in 2008, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea in women aged 15 to 50. In the Netherlands, 220 mg and 275 mg tablets are available OTC in drugstores, 550 mg is OTC only at pharmacies. Aleve became available over the counter in some provinces in Canada on 14 July 2009, but not British Columbia, Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador; it subsequently became available OTC in British Columbia in January 2010 and Quebec in 2023. \n\n\nEcological effects\nNaproxen has been found in groundwater and drinking water in concentrations high enough to have adverse effects on invertebrates including fungi, algae, bacteria and fishes. Naproxen is not thoroughly removed by conventional water treatment methods, and its degradation pathways in the environment are limited. Some methods more successfully remove naproxen from wastewater, including metal-organic complexes and porous carbon. Although the levels are generally low enough to not be acutely toxic, sub-lethal effects may still occur, such as reduced photosynthetic ability.\n\n\nResearch\nNaproxen may have antiviral activity against influenza. In laboratory research, it blocks the RNA-binding groove of the nucleoprotein of the virus, preventing the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex—thus taking the viral nucleoproteins out of circulation.\n\n\nVeterinary use\n\n\nHorses\nNaproxen is given by mouth to horses at a dose of 10 mg/kg and has shown to have a wide safety margin (no toxicity when given at three times the recommended dose for 42 days). It is more effective for myositis than the commonly used NSAID phenylbutazone, and has shown especially good results for treatment of equine exertional rhabdomyolysis, a disease of muscle breakdown; it is less commonly used for musculoskeletal disease.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",
    "summary": "Naproxen, sold under the brand name Aleve among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, menstrual cramps, and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and fever. It is taken orally. It is available in immediate and delayed release formulations. Onset of effects is within an hour and lasts for up to twelve hours. Naproxen is also available in salt form, naproxen sodium, which has better solubility when taken orally.\nCommon side effects include dizziness, headache, bruising, allergic reactions, heartburn, and stomach pain. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomach ulcers. The heart disease risk may be lower than with other NSAIDs. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy.\nNaproxen is a nonselective COX inhibitor. As an NSAID, naproxen appears to exert its anti-inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called prostaglandins. It is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites.\nNaproxen was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. In the United States it is available over-the-counter and as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 103rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. Naproxen is a therapeutic alternative on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.",

    "text": "The Chamorro Nation (Chamorro: Nasion Chamoru) is a political movement seeking sovereignty for the island of Guam, founded by Angel Leon Guerrero Santos.  The Chamorro Nation was formed on July 21, 1991, comprising numerous grassroots organizations which advocated for the protection of Chamorro land, culture, and political rights. As a political movement, the Chamorro Nation is recognized as a key turning point in changing Chamorro attitudes toward the United States and increasing the desire for Chamorro rights, particularly the return of lands seized from Chamorros by the US federal government.\n\n\nOrigins\nOn July 21, 1991, a group of approximately twenty people gathered at Latte Stone Park in the village of Hagåtña. Santos called the members to join him in the middle of the eight large latte stones in the park. “Stay within the latte, this is where the power of our ancestors, the spirit of our ancestors lives and it is important that we share this with them,” Santos said.\n\n\nProclamation for independence\nThe group was composed of Chamorros from various grassroots organizations. At the gathering, Santos,  who was then the president of the Chamorro Chelus for Independence Association, read a proclamation declaring the existence of a Chamorro nation:\n“It is our inalienable right to exist as a people whose ancestors were brought into this nation to live on this land and survive off its resources. With the mass influx of immigrants into our island, the destruction of our environment, and the raping of our ocean resources, it is imperative that we claim the rights and responsibility to protect and preserve our land and resources.”\nGroup members signed the proclamation declaring Guam's independence, and non-Chamorro supporters signed a separate document that identified them as witnesses. During the first gathering, Santos noted that the possibility for securing political independence was open through a United Nations Charter. Santos also stated that Chamorros have not been acknowledged to exist as a nation of people for over 400 years, since Guam's initial colonization.\n\n\nChamorro activism in the 1980s and 1990s\n\n\nOrganization of People for Indigenous Rights\nIn 1981, the Organization of People for Indigenous Rights (OPI-R), a Chamorro nationalist organization dedicated to achieving self-determination, was formed. OPI-R utilized the United Nations as a tool for achieving political self-determination, and in 1982 the group conducted community fundraising efforts and successfully sent three representatives to New York City to testify in front of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) of the United Nations on Guam's behalf. This marked the first time that Chamorros testified in front of the UN and brought the struggle for Chamorro rights to the international stage. OPI-R is recognized for framing Chamorro self-determination as an \"inalienable right\".\n\n\nChamorro veterans and political activism\nOPI-R's membership was made up of Chamorros who were educated or came from prominent, established Chamorro families. In contrast, most members of the Chamorro Nation came from low-income backgrounds. Membership in the Chamorro Nation also differed from OPI-R due to the number of Chamorro veterans who joined the Chamorro Nation after experiencing racism while serving in the US military. Furthermore, some members were critical of the US military after being drafted by the US, which had taken ancestral Chamorro lands after World War II, and did not allow Chamorros to participate in US presidential elections.\n\n\nChamorro Nation political activities\n\n\nThe Chamorro Land Trust\nIn response to Guam's unique history of land loss and militarization, the Chamorro Land Trust Act was passed in 1974, with a mandate to \"advance the social, cultural and economic development and well-being of the Chamorro people by way of residential, agricultural and commercial land distribution and economic assistance programs\". The Chamorro Land Trust Act was modeled after the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921. However, the Chamorro Land Trust Act was not implemented until Santos, with the support of the Chamorro Nation, challenged the issue in court in 1992. The Chamorro Nation pressured Guam governor Joseph F. Ada to implement the act, and staged two camp outs which lasted for over a month, on the front lawn of the governor's complex.  As a result, Governor Ada appointed commissioners to the newly formed Chamorro Land Trust Commission, which was the implementation of the Chamorro Land Trust Act.\nMembers of the Chamorro Nation were often accused by other Guam residents of being exclusionary and divisive. Santos stated in response: \"We're not racist. We're nationalists and there is a big difference. We are not anti-Filipino or anti-Korean or anti-American. We're pro-Chamorus, and there is a big difference\".\n\n\nNaval air station protest\nIn 1992, Santos and other Chamorro Nation members staged a protest outside of Naval Air Station Agana. The protest was staged in response to the danger of frequent low-altitude US military training flights that disturbed Chamorros living near the Naval Air Station. At the protest, Santos read a statement criticizing the US military and their operations. The protest escalated when Santos and others jumped the fence surrounding the Naval Air Station, in front of gathered local media and members of the US military. When Santos was apprehended by US military guards, he spit in the face of his captor.\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nThe Chamorro Nation is credited with changing the public debate regarding Guam's quest for sovereignty and political independence. As result of the Chamorro Nation's political work and public protests, politicians on Guam are now expected to have an opinion on Guam's political future, and discussions around decolonization are now considered mainstream.\n\n\nReferences",

The North Stars were eliminated in the first round by the Detroit Red Wings in seven games.\n\n\nOffseason\nThe North Stars officially adopted a new logo for the 1991–92 season, retiring their original N logo. The new logo, featuring the word STARS set across the top of a slanted 5-pointed star, with the A forming the outline of the top point, had been introduced as a secondary mark during the prior season. Along with the new logo came new uniforms, with black as the primary color, with green and metallic gold trim.

After moving to Naples, in September 2018 the defender joined Afro Napoli United, a local amateur club that also acts as a pro-integration organization. Due to the Italian federation's rules regarding the registration of under-aged non-EU players, he could not feature in official league matches, being only available for youth tournaments and friendlies.\n\n\nRoma\nIn the first months of 2019, Ndiaye was scouted by Roma, subsequently joining the Serie A club on trial. With the outcome turning out to be successful, the defender officially entered Roma's youth academy in August 2019, although he was officially registered to play in official competitions in October of the same year. Following his performances for the club's under-19 squad, during the 2021–22 season Ndiaye started training with the first team under manager José Mourinho. On 4 December 2021, he featured on the bench in a 0–3 league loss against Inter Milan: in the occasion, Ndiaye was supposed to make his senior debut in the injury time, but referee Marco Di Bello blew the final whistle before the substitution could take place, as the ball was not sent off the field on time. In May 2022, he helped Roma reach the final of the under-19 national championship.\n\n\nCremonese\nOn 4 July 2022, Ndiaye joined newly-promoted Serie A club Cremonese on a permanent deal. The transfer included an undisclosed sell-on clause in favor of Roma.\n\n\nLoan to Vicenza\nHaving not found game time during the first half of the 2022–23 campaign, on 15 January 2023, Ndiaye was sent on loan to Serie C side Vicenza until the end of the season. One week later, on 22 January, the defender made his professional debut for the club, coming in as a substitute for Nicola Dalmonte in the 87th minute of a 3–0 league win against AlbinoLeffe.\n\n\nLoan to Železničar Pančevo\nOn 6 September 2023, Ndiaye joined Serbian SuperLiga side Železničar Pančevo on loan until the end of the season, with the deal including an option-to-buy.\n\n\nLoan to Turris\nOn 30 August 2024, Ndiaye joined Serie C club Turris on a season-long loan.\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAs of match played 18 May 2023\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMaissa Ndiaye at Soccerway\nMaissa Ndiaye at WorldFootball.net",

    "text": "The Bear Dances: A Play in Three Acts is a political drama about the Soviet Union set in 1930, written by British playwright F. L. Lucas in 1931, and first staged in 1932. It was his first play; he went on to write five more.\n\n\nCharacters (and actors in first production)\nGrigori Stepanovitch Orlov — Maurice Browne\nAndrey Grigorovitch Orlov — Henry Hewitt\nElizaveta Leontievna Orlov — Olga Lindo\nLeonti Levine — Abraham Sofaer\nVera Levine — Elena Miramova\nFather Anton Kirillitch — Henry Vibart\nVladimir Blok — Gyles Isham\nFydor Ivanov — Frederic Sargent\nDomna Vassilievna Ivanova — Dorothy Edwards\nPolice, travellers, vendors, workers, etc.\n\n\nPlot summary\nMoscow, Spring 1930. Two OGPU officers search the room of Father Anton Kirillitch, who has been banned from his church and ordered to stop preaching. He shares the room with Grigori Orlov, ejected from his chair at the university for a \"reactionary\" refusal to give a Marxist slant to his literature lectures. Both live in poverty, in half a room of Grigori's former house, now seized by the State. To visit Grigori come his son, Andrey, and his son's wife, Elizaveta, both 35, who eloped to England in 1914 and are now naturalised British. Andrey, a left-wing writer in London, is horrified by his father's treatment and by the workings of the Soviet régime. Elizaveta, a doctor in London, has tried the West and found it wanting. She is more open-minded about the USSR, and finds a non-sentimental attraction in the work to be done. Their marriage is in trouble: she no longer loves Andrey. Vera Levine, 19, Elizaveta's sister whom she last saw before the War, arrives, an \"agricultural expert\" full of youthful enthusiasm for the New Russia, along with Leonti Levine, their father, a former antiques-dealer now Inspector of Collective Farms in northern Ukraine. With the Levines is Vladimir Blok, 30, an OGPU official and Revolutionary Judge. Vera suggests that the returned émigrés visit \"her\" collective farm in Ukraine. Vladimir gives permission (Orlov son might perhaps be pressured to write positively about the USSR when he returns to London) and allows Grigori to accompany them. Act One closes with the arrest by the OGPU of Father Anton, who knows this means the Lubyanka and liquidation.\nAct Two takes place three days later at a railway station in western Russia, where the travelling party are waiting for a connection. Behind the political arguments, Elizaveta and Vladimir are sexually attracted; Andrey and Vera are falling in love. Leonti loathes Grigori from pre-Revolution days (they quarrelled over their children's elopement). When Leonti briefly leaves his luggage unattended, Grigori glances at Levine's pocket-book, finds something compromising inside, darts to the cloakroom to make a copy, then returns the book to the frantic Leonti, who thought it had been stolen.\nOn the collective farm in Act Three, in the Soviet House, Vera is in her element and full of pride. We witness a workers' wedding where the Soviet girls dance with spirit. Elizaveta tells Andrey their marriage is over: she has chosen Vladimir and will stay on in the USSR. The atmosphere darkens with a series of peremptory trials presided over by Vladimir: crimes against the individual are punished leniently, crimes against property (and therefore the State) with terrible vengeance. When some peasants are accused of being kulaks and sentenced to the Gulag for \"hoarding\" small quantities of grain, Andrey, watching, can take no more. He snatches Blok's pistol and shoots him dead. He is seized and knows he will be executed. Grigori, to save his son, tells Elizaveta what he found in her father's pocket-book: Leonti has been smuggling goods across the nearby Polish frontier (an \"anti-Soviet\" activity). Elizaveta, he insists, must blackmail her father with the threat of telling the fanatical Vera, to smuggle Andrey across the frontier. Andrey, however, will only attempt the escape if his father comes too. Elizaveta confronts Levine, who, terrified of Vera, caves in. The telephone line is cut. After delivering Vladimir's funeral oration offstage (which we hear), a tearful Vera enters to say goodbye to Andrey before he is carried off to Kiev. After a minute or two, she realises that the muffled figure in the dark room she has been addressing is not Andrey, but Elizaveta. The Orlovs have escaped. Elizaveta hints at what has happened; we guess Levine will not return. Vera raises the alarm – in vain. The play ends with Elizaveta attempting to console her weeping sister.\n\n\nProductions and publication\nThe Bear Dances  was premiered by the People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1932. The first dramatisation of the Soviets on London's West-end stage, it was directed later that year at the Garrick by Leon M. Lion, with designs and décor by Robert Lutyens. The first night in London was attended by some serving members of the British Cabinet, among them Walter Runciman, by prominent MPs, and by various ambassadors to the UK. The play ran from 31 October to 5 November 1932 (only eight performances), closing early. It was, however, with cuts, revived with more success by various repertory theatres in the North of England in the later 1930s, including the Manchester Repertory, with Katherine Hynes in the leading role. The text was published in May 1933 by Cassell and Company of London. To it was added a long Introduction, 'The Gospel According to St Marx', in which Lucas discussed the shortcomings of Soviet Communism and defended his play against the reviewers' criticism. The original manuscript of the play is in the Leon M. Lion Collection, River Campus Libraries, University of Rochester, USA.\n\n\nPolitical background\nAdulation of the Soviet Union has been described as \"the fashionable trahison des clercs\" of the interwar years. The Bear Dances was an attempt at ideological disinfectant, written at the start of a decade in which Cambridge University (in Lucas's words) \"grew full of very green young men going very Red\". Though Lucas strives for objectivity (the play was vetted by an ex-member of the British Embassy in Moscow), with Vera and Vladimir acting as spokesmen for the new order, his verdict on the Soviet system is damning. Fear, inhumanity, injustice abound. The play's title suggests captivity, pain and submission. \"The intolerable thing about Moscow,\" wrote Lucas, \"is not that it is Communist; it is that it is not Communist. Genuine Communism, while one might disagree with it, one could respect. But this pseudo-Communism of the Kremlin is perhaps the most gigantic sham in history. It has waded through seas of blood – for what? That a régime where the rich were powerful might be replaced by a régime where the powerful are rich.\"\n\n\nReception\nDespite approval of its subject-matter (\"Any study of conditions in Soviet Russia is certain at the moment to command attention,\" noted The Spectator) and praise for the directing, acting, and designs, the reviewers found The Bear Dances \"overladen with pamphleteering argument, on both sides\". \"The play's weakness lies in its tendency to repeated pleading,\" observed Ivor Brown  in The Week-end Review. \"Heavy blue pencilling would have given this play a chance of life,\" agreed John Pollock in The Saturday Review. The Stage conceded that the trial scene, the fatal firing, the bargaining with Levine, and the escape \"were all more or less interesting and effective\", as did Harold Hobson in one of his earliest play-reviews. Henri Barbusse in The Daily Worker, however, condemned the playwright for peddling \"slanderous caricatures\" of the Soviet Union. (\"Too unnerving,\" was Lucas's comment on this.) Komisarjevsky, calling it the only authentic play on the USSR by an Englishman that he had seen, told Lucas that he would have liked to have produced it himself.\n\n\nLater writing on Russia and the Soviets\nLucas returned to the subject of the Soviet Union in a two-part essay, 'A Week of Berlin', published in the Manchester Guardian in October 1948 and enlarged in The Greatest Problem, and Other Essays (1960), about his visit to Berlin as British Council lecturer during the Blockade. Here he recalled his dismay at being shown at Bletchley Park, months before the fall of Berlin in 1945, a confidential map of the areas of Germany that Roosevelt had agreed to leave in Russian hands. \"Thinking men and women were feeling passionately,\" he wrote of Berliners in 1948, \"that Berlin had become for Europe what Verdun once was for France... Berlin, as they saw it, was not only a breakwater for the West; it was also a beacon for the East. With its surrender a still deeper gloom would fall on decent men in all the other lands in the Valley of the Shadow of the Kremlin. Time could no longer be gained by selling space – only by holding it. Bargains with Moscow were useless. Reasoning with Moscow was useless. One must hold.\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nNicholson, Steve, British Theatre and the Red Peril: The Portrayal of Communism, 1917–45 (Exeter University Press, 1999)",

    "text": "In mathematics, a zero element is one of several generalizations of the number zero to other algebraic structures. These alternate meanings may or may not reduce to the same thing, depending on the context.\n\n\nAdditive identities\nAn additive identity is the identity element in an additive group or monoid. It corresponds to the element 0 such that for all x in the group, 0 + x = x + 0 = x. Some examples of additive identity include:\n\nThe zero vector under vector addition: the vector whose components are all 0; in a normed vector space its norm (length) is also 0. Often denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {0} }\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              0\n              →\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\vec {0}}}\n  \n.\nThe zero function or zero map defined by z(x) = 0, under pointwise addition (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)\nThe empty set under set union\nAn empty sum or empty coproduct\nAn initial object in a category (an empty coproduct, and so an identity under coproducts)\n\n\nAbsorbing elements\nAn absorbing element in a multiplicative semigroup or semiring generalises the property 0 ⋅ x = 0. Examples include:\n\nThe empty set, which is an absorbing element under Cartesian product of sets, since { } × S = { }\nThe zero function or zero map defined by z(x) = 0 under pointwise multiplication (f ⋅ g)(x) = f(x) ⋅ g(x)\nMany absorbing elements are also additive identities, including the empty set and the zero function. Another important example is the distinguished element 0 in a field or ring, which is both the additive identity and the multiplicative absorbing element, and whose principal ideal is the smallest ideal.\n\n\nZero objects\nA zero object in a category is both an initial and terminal object (and so an identity under both coproducts and products). For example, the trivial structure (containing only the identity) is a zero object in categories where morphisms must map identities to identities. Specific examples include:\n\nThe trivial group, containing only the identity (a zero object in the category of groups)\nThe zero module, containing only the identity (a zero object in the category of modules over a ring)\n\n\nZero morphisms\nA zero morphism in a category is a generalised absorbing element under function composition: any morphism composed with a zero morphism gives a zero morphism. Specifically, if 0XY : X → Y is the zero morphism among morphisms from X to Y, and f : A → X and g : Y → B are arbitrary morphisms, then g ∘ 0XY = 0XB and 0XY ∘ f = 0AY.\nIf a category has a zero object 0, then there are canonical morphisms X → 0 and 0 → Y, and composing them gives a zero morphism 0XY : X → Y. In the category of groups, for example, zero morphisms are morphisms which always return group identities, thus generalising the function z(x) = 0.\n\n\nLeast elements\nA least element in a partially ordered set or lattice may sometimes be called a zero element, and written either as 0 or ⊥.\n\n\nZero module\nIn mathematics, the zero module is the module consisting of only the additive identity for the module's addition function. In the integers, this identity is zero, which gives the name zero module. That the zero module is in fact a module is simple to show; it is closed under addition and multiplication trivially.\n\n\nZero ideal\nIn mathematics, the zero ideal in a ring \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is the ideal \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        0\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{0\\}}\n  \n consisting of only the additive identity (or zero element). The fact that this is an ideal follows directly from the definition.\n\n\nZero matrix\n\nIn mathematics, particularly linear algebra, a zero matrix is a matrix with all its entries being zero.

In a matrix ring, the zero matrix serves the role of both an additive identity and an absorbing element. In general, the zero element of a ring is unique, and typically denoted as 0 without any subscript to indicate the parent ring. Hence the examples above represent zero matrices over any ring.\nThe zero matrix also represents the linear transformation which sends all vectors to the zero vector.\n\n\nZero tensor\nIn mathematics, the zero tensor is a tensor, of any order, all of whose components are zero. The zero tensor of order 1 is sometimes known as the zero vector.\nTaking a tensor product of any tensor with any zero tensor results in another zero tensor. Among tensors of a given type, the zero tensor of that type serves as the additive identity among those tensors.\n\n\nSee also\nNull semigroup\nZero divisor\nZero object\nZero of a function\nZero — non-mathematical uses\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Le Gorafi (French pronunciation: [lə ɡɔʁafi]; anagram of Le Figaro) is a news satire website. It was created in May 2012 during the French presidential campaign in the style of The Onion, a satirical newspaper of fake information. It has also been compared with Infos du Monde and L'Examineur.\nSince 2014, the site is also offered in a televisual form on channel Canal+ as a humoristic segment on the program Le Grand Journal. The identity of the creators was unknown until January 2014, when the two creators, Pablo Mira and Sébastien Liebus, became known in the media.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nSources\nCaricatures of the press or pamphlet have existed for centuries; the drawing is generally grotesque which means that the reader has no possible doubt on the fact that it is a parody and not reality.\nIn October 1996, producer and television presenter Karl Zéro was suspended by his employer; after that most of his parodies included the mention \"produced with fakery\".\nIn March 2010, the marketing director of Apple Inc. Ken Segall founded Scoopertino, a fake agency of parodical press dedicated to promoting the Apple brand in a strange way. The disruptive innovation is that at no moment is it mentioned that it is a parody, which is judicially a counterfeit.\n\n\nBeginnings\nThe articles of Le Gorafi comment real or imaginary events in a satirical and offbeat way, taking again most of the press codes. Le Gorafi was first an element on Twitter that began in February 2012, during the French presidential campaign, before being transformed as a blog in May, and then becoming in September 2012 a website. Since then, many of its articles were relayed in the press, especially the one stating about a supposed new challenge undertaken by Felix Baumgartner who would have decided to cross alone the entire region of Île-de-France taking the RER B.\n\n\nInstitution of the web\nThe site presents the newspaper as dating of 1826, from a scission after a conflict of interest at the redaction of Le Figaro and named Le Gorafi due to the dyslexia of its founder Jean-René Buissière. The contents are compared to the \"Page Pute\" of Brain Magazine, or other humoristic and satirical sites like Bilboquet Magazine and L'Humour de droite, which reacts on Twitter and Facebook. Le Gorafi claims more than 400,000 viewers in February 2013 and regularly more than 900,000 viewers per month stated by Les Inrocks.\nIn January 2014, the book L'année du Gorafi 2013 was released at the Éditions Denoël. In November of that year, the following book titled L'année du Gorafi 2 was released, and the creators were invited at the radio program of media criticism L'Instant M broadcast on France Inter for 15 minutes.\nOn 31 August 2015 in the morning, Le Gorafi created a \"fake bad buzz\" posting a temporary redirection with a message \"Le Gorafi, c'est fini, merci de votre fidélité\" (\"Le Gorafi, it's over, thank you for your fidelity\"). It was in fact an \"advertising attempt for its new platform\".\n\n\nFormats\nThe articles of Le Gorafi are mainly published on its website, and distributed between different themes (politics, society, science, economy, etc.) like some sites of authentic information. It is also possible to read fake horoscopes and watch small videos. The site also has Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube accounts. The latter is not active anymore but published 40 videos between September 2016 and August 2017, which totaled 292,000 views in November 2019. Every year since 2014, a selection of articles is published in books titled L'Année du Gorafi, but the 2017 edition only contains unpublished articles.\nThe incomes of the company are insured by the book sales, the presence of several advertisements on the site, as well as sponsored advertising articles.\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nLe Grand Journal\nIn spring 2014, Le Gorafi presents a chronicle in Le Grand Journal, twice or three times a week, often on Monday, Wednesday or Friday. The programs are based on one or two chronicles developed around one theme for each. The first theme is the object of the treatment of twisted news presented in a satirical tone by one of the two co-founders Pablo Mira, of a length between two and four minutes. He sometimes talks about a second subject, which is expanded of an enquiry shown as a report with video pictures, illustrated by micro-sidewalks or expert advice.\n\n\nL'Année du Gorafi\nIn January 2016, Le Gorafi presents a parodical program retrospective of the news from the previous year. Presented by Pablo Mira, the program is a caricature of the news broadcasting from a continuous news channel, alternating fake reports and television stage launches.\n\n\nBibliography\nJean-François Buissière (Pablo Mira, Sébastien Liebus) (2014).

    "text": "Sociomapping is a method developed for processing and visualization of relational data (e.g. social network data). It is most commonly used for mapping the social structure within small teams (10-25 people). Sociomapping uses the landscape metaphor to display complex multi-dimensional data in a 3D map, where individual objects are localized in such way that their distance on the map corresponds to their distance in the underlying data.\nThanks to its visual coding Sociomapping engages our evolved skills for spatial orientation and movement detection, thus making the interpretation of complex data easy and accessible for everyone.\n\n\nHistory\nThe sociomapping method was developed in 1993–1994 by R. Bahbouh as a tool that would facilitate understanding of data about social relations and help preventing conflicts within teams of military professionals. The first major application of sociomapping took place in 1994–1995 during the HUBES experiment (Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight) – a 135-day-long simulation of a spaceflight with three crew members organized by European Space Agency. Sociomapping was then regularly used in other spaceflight simulations (1995–1996: EKOPSY, 1999: Mars105, 2010–2012: Mars500). Since 2005, sociomapping has been extensively used in business environment to analyze relationships within senior management teams. In 2012, C. Höschl jr. developed Real Time Sociomapping® software that enables instant visualization of the team dynamics and monitoring of the teams and social groups over time.\n\n\nBasic principle\nThe basic principle of Sociomapping is transforming original data concerning a set of objects in such a way that the distance of each pair of objects on the map corresponds to the distance between the two objects in the underlying data. Transformation of the data is a matter of 1) choosing some metric that could be reasonably interpreted as distance, and 2) translating the multi-dimensional distance matrix into 2D coordinate system so that the correlation between map-distances and data-distances is maximized. \nThe algorithm for data-transformation, developed by C. Höschl jr., is a dimensionality-reduction technique, such as PCA, and its goodness of fit can be measured by Spearman correlation between the map-distances and data-distances. \nSociomapping takes into account that, particularly in case of social relations, relational data may be asymmetrical (e.g. John like Mary more than she likes him) and preserves this information by mapping the objects in such a way that for each object the closest other object is the one closest to it according to the metric of choice in the underlying data, and so on for other objects ordered by distance.\n\n\nApplication\nThere are two main areas of application for Sociomapping – groups (small systems) and populations (large systems). For each area a different method of visualization and data transformation is used in order to facilitate people’s ability to understand and interpret the analyzed data.\n\n\nGroups and small systems\nSociomapping for small systems produces Sociomaps of subjects. These subjects (in most cases people) are placed on the Sociomap reflecting their distance measured in various ways:\n\nsocial distance\npsychological distance (psychological similarity)\ncommunication distance\nother relation measures\nBesides the distances between the group members, Sociomap shows additional variable coded in the height (or color) of the subject. Typical variables used for the height are: social status, performance indicators of the subjects, average communication frequency, etc.\nUnderstanding the relative distances between the people helps to understand the structure of the group, find subgroups formed by groups members and discover functions of the group members. In connection to the height Sociomap enables complex and comprehensive insight into the groups and small systems. This is particularly beneficial for workplace strategists.\nSociomapping of small systems produces similar results to social network analysis with additional visualization features. \n\n\nProfile analysis\nBesides the small systems analysis based on various relational data, Sociomapping can be used to visualize the profiles of unrelated subjects. This is done by transformation of subjects' profiles, computing the distances between the profiles and visualizing them in a Sociomap.\nThere is a software to compute Profile analysis (see section Sociomapping software).\n\n\nPopulations and large systems\nFor large systems and populations, different type of Sociomaps is used. Data used for these types of maps are rectangular matrices, where for each subject there is a preference vector of selected objects (such as political parties, brands, products, and so on). \nIn order to create a Sociomap, for each subject a position in the map is determined, and a small piece of mass representing this subject is placed on the map according to its vector of preferences to an object.  As a result, there are places on the Sociomap where more subject are placed (hills) and where there are no subject (valleys). Therefore, hills are formed on the places representing typical preference configurations and this allows for visual cluster analysis, or segmentation.\nIn this sense, Large systems Sociomapping is a data mining approach based on visual pattern recognition).\nTypical uses for Large systems Sociomapping are:\n\npolitical research (preferences and polls)\nmarketing research (attitudes and product preferences)\ncustomer segmentation (behavioral patterns)\nand other research concerned with preferences and/or attitudes.\n\n\nBroader scope of application\nSociomapping has broader scope of application, including the following fields:\n\nHistorical events analysis (e.g.  RMS Titanic survival rate)\nInternet community tools (e.g.  Last.fm [1] profile similarity)\nLiterature analysis (e.g.  analysis of communication in Shakespeare plays)\nMilitary units and human spaceflight crews analysis\nSport analysis and forecast (e.g. cooperation of sport teams)\nPolitics analysis and forecast\nTeam building\nTeam analysis (communication, cooperation, decision-making)\nLeadership development\nTeam collaboration – remote collaboration or hybrid teams\nPrevention of socio-pathological behavior among children at schools\n\n\nSoftware\nSo far only one software tool based on Sociomapping was released.\nTeam profile analyzer is a tool for psychologists, consultants, managers and HR specialists. It enables integration of various sources of information about team from personality, performance or knowledge tests and biographical data. It can be used for team analysis and development: team coaching, team building, recruitment etc.\n\n\nSee also\nParticipatory rural appraisal\nHigh-performance teams\nHuman resources\nMarketing research\nSociometry\nTeam management\n\n\nReferences\nSociomapping Portal with information and resources about Sociomapping\nThe Application of Sociomapping to Executive Team Development\nUtilization of multilayer network data of team for Sociomapping analysis",

It was occupied in 1999 and provided a range of mostly free activities for local people until its eviction in 2009 by Southwark Council.\n\n\nOccupation\nThe Spike Surplus Scheme was established in 1999 when a fly-tipped, vandalised site at 39b Consort Road in the London Borough of Southwark was squatted. The building had in the past been a doss-house or \"spike\" (a shelter of last resort) serving the unemployed, homeless, and urban poor for over a century. At the time of the occupation, the exterior grounds had been used for fly-tipping. On arrival, the members of the scheme immediately cleared them using a JCB digger.\n\n\nActivities\nThe social centre provided rehearsal/recording facilities, health/martial arts space and a community garden. Running on a \"do it yourself\" and free-where-possible or donations level, the facilities were used by a wide variety of local people. Other users were community garden permaculture groups, martial arts, and various alternative therapy groups. Alongside other squatted projects such as 121 Centre, 491 Gallery, 56a Infoshop and RampART, the Spike developed into an alternative institution promoting social movements and local initiatives.\n\n\nEviction\nHaving established a peppercorn rent contract, Southwark Council decided not to renew the contract in 2008, giving the centre until September 26 to raise £440,000 to buy the plot.\nDespite various fundraising drives, including selling 'Peckham diamonds' which were bits of glass from broken car windows filed down and sold in plastic wallets, the centre was unable to buy the site. In December 2008, the council gave notice of eviction, saying they would give two weeks' notice of the actual date. The centre was then evicted without notice on 12 February 2009. People were forced to negotiate with bailiffs to regain musical equipment.\n\n\nSee also\nHomelessness in the United Kingdom\nSelf-managed social centres in the United Kingdom\nSt Agnes Place\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nArchived blog\nArchived website",

While Lanzi and others claim he was a disciple of Pietro Perugino, the first we know of Doni was that in 1530 he was an assistant to Giovanni di Pietro (lo Spagna) at San Giacomo in Spoleto.\nIn the church of San Francesco, at Perugia, is a picture depicting the Last Judgment by Doni;' and one of the Adoration of the Kings is in San Pietro in the same city. \nHe worked chiefly at Assisi. For the church of San Crispolto of Bettona, he painted an Adoration of the Shepherds (1543), now at the Pinacoteca Civica of the town.  For the Ciccoli family chapel at the church of San Francesco in Bevagna, he painted a Madonna and Child (ca. 1565), now in the city picture gallery. In Foligno, he painted a fresco depicting the Nativity with St Lucy (1544) for the monastery of Sant'Anna; a frieze for the Sala Papale (attributed, ca. 1545) of Palazzo Trinci; and a fresco depicting the Martyrdom of St Catherine of Alexandria for the nunnery of Santa Caterina Vecchia, now detached and in the Pinacoteca Civica. In Gubbio, he painted a Pietà (after 1560) and a Road to Calvary (ca. 1564)  now in the Duomo. He also worked with Lattanzio Pagani and Cristofano Gherardi at the no longer-extant Rocca Paolina of Perugia.\nIn the Lower Church of the Franciscan Convent at Assisi there are Doni frescoes depicting the Preaching and Martyrdom of St Stephen, and in the small refectory is the Last Supper (1573),  probably his last work. Doni died at Assisi in 1575. Vasari errs in stating that he was a nephew of Taddeo Bartoli. In the Berlin Gallery there is by him a 'Madonna with the Infant Jesus,' who is represented as reaching after a book which is in the Virgin's hand.\n\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution:\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bryan, Michael (1886). \"Doni, Adone\".

    "text": "Ikrima ibn Amr ibn Hisham (Arabic: عكرمة بن عمرو بن هشام, romanized: ʿIkrima ibn ʿAmr ibn Hishām; c. 598–634 or 636) was an opponent-turned companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a military commander in the Ridda wars and the Muslim conquest of Syria. In the latter campaign, he was killed fighting the Byzantine forces.\n\n\nLife\nIkrima's father was Amr ibn Hisham ibn al-Mughira, a leader of the polytheistic Quraysh tribe's Banu Makhzum clan who was called \"Abu Jahl\" (father of ignorance) by the Muslims for his stringent opposition to Muhammad. Ikrima's father was slain fighting the Muslims at the Battle of Badr in 624. At the Battle of Uhud, where the Quraysh defeated the Muslims, Ikrima commanded the tribe's left wing; his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded the right wing. The Makhzum's losses at Badr had diminished their influence and gave way to the Banu Abd Shams under Abu Sufyan to take the helm against Muhammad. However, the influence of Ikrima, by then the preeminent leader of the Makhzum, in Mecca had increased toward the end of the 620s. He opposed the negotiations with Muhammad at al-Hudaybiya and broke the agreement when he and some Quraysh attacked the Banu Khuza'a. When Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630, Ikrima escaped as a fugitive for the Yemen where the Makhzum had commercial connections. \nMuhammad later pardoned Ikrima, apparently after being petitioned by Ikrima's wife and paternal first cousin Umm Hakim bint al-Harith, who had converted to Islam. According to the historian al-Waqidi, Muhammad appointed Ikrima as a tax collector of the Hawazin tribal confederation in 632. Ikrima was in the Tihama region between Yemen and Mecca when Muhammad died. According to Blankinship, after he embraced Islam, Ikrima devoted to his new religion's cause \"much of the energy that had characterized his earlier opposition\" to Islam. After Muhammad's death, his close associate Abu Bakr became caliph (leader of the Muslim community) and appointed Ikrima to lead a campaign against rebel Arab tribes in the Ridda wars (632–633), which saw him command expeditions around the entire Arabian Peninsula, with particular focus in Yemen. By 634, Abu Bakr reassigned Ikrima and his troops, who hailed from the Tihama, northern Yemen, Bahrayn and Oman, to reinforce Khalid's army in the Muslim conquest of Syria. Ikrima was most likely martyred fighting the Byzantines in the Battle of Ajnadayn in Palestine in 634, though it is also held that it may have been during the Battle of the Yarmuk in 636.\n\n\nFamily\nAccording to the historian al-Ya'qubi (d. 898), Ikrima was married to Qutayla bint Qays ibn Ma'dikarib, the sister of the chieftain of the Kindite Banu Mu'awiya clan, al-Ash'ath ibn Qays. She was sent from Yemen to marry Muhammad but arrived after he died and afterward was wed to Ikrima. The Islamic tradition mostly agrees that Ikrima died childless, though the 8th-century historian Sayf ibn Umar mentions a son named Amr and Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), possibly deriving his information from Sayf, calls this same son Umar. The modern historian Michael Lecker holds that Ikrima's marriage to Qutayla proved problematic for later Muslim scholars as the remarriage of Muhammad's wives was forbidden. Lecker holds the Islamic tradition censored out the original report used by the traditional Muslim authors that Qutayla bore Ikrima \"a feeble-minded son\", which he considers to be the \"more trustworthy\" version. Ikrima was also married to Asma bint al-Nu'man ibn Abi al-Jawn, another Kindite wife of Muhammad whose marriage had never been consummated. He married her after a relatively short marriage to Ikrima's Makhzumite kinsman al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya. Ikrima's wife Umm Hakim married Caliph Umar (r. 634–644) sometime after Ikrima's death.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nDonner, Fred M., ed. (1993).

    "text": "The Justice Party (Turkish: Adalet Partisi, AP) was a Turkish political party prominent in the 1960s and 1970s. A descendant of the Democrat Party, the AP was dominated by Süleyman Demirel, who served six times as prime minister, and was in office at the time of the military coup on 12 September 1980. Along with all other political parties in Turkey, the Justice Party was suppressed in the immediate aftermath of the coup. It was subsequently re-established as the True Path Party in 1983.\nThe Justice Party was a Turkish nationalist and liberal conservative party. It advocated Kemalist principles, parliamentary democracy and a market economy. It strongly supported membership in NATO and close relations with the United States.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEstablishment\nWith the 1960 coup d'état, Turkey's generals disbanded the formerly dominant Democrat Party. They could not, however, entirely dismantle the vast grassroots organization that this party had left behind. Democrat Party officials were based in many of the squatter neighborhoods in Turkey's larger cities, and would quickly incorporate newly arrived Anatolian migrants into the party's fold. A number of parties soon emerged to reclaim this newly partyless Democrat voting bloc. The Justice Party was one of these neo-Democratic parties, first established by retired general Ragıp Gümüşpala in 1961.  It immediately adopted the galloping horse logo of the Democrat Party.\nThe Justice Party quickly proved the most successful in consolidating the existing Democrat Party provincial organizations, particularly in the western regions of the country. The New Turkey Party, however, was initially more successful in eastern Turkey. In the 1961 elections, the two post-Democrat parties combined to win a very impressive 48.5% of the vote, 34.8% of which went to the Justice Party alone. The ruling generals, however, would not allow for a neo-Democrat government to replace the old order they had brought down. Instead they asked İsmet İnönü, whose Republican People's Party was the largest party with 36.7% of the vote, to form a coalition government.\n\n\nRise\nİnönü's various coalitions would form the government until 1964, but in the meantime the Justice Party continued to grow, steadily gaining votes at the expense of the smaller post-Democrat parties. The Republican People's Party eventual turn towards left of centre would also help to give the military a somewhat more favorable view of the Justice Party. In this political climate, the 1963 nationwide local elections gained increased importance, and eventually came to be seen as a political referendum on the newly established parties. The Justice Party ultimately emerged as a triumphant winner, winning around 46% of the vote and establishing itself as the most popular party in the country.\nWith its popular appeal well established, the Justice Party turned to issues of leadership. Gümüşpala died in 1964, and questions soon emerged over who would succeed him as the party's leader. Sadettin Bilgiç, a doctor by training, had become acting party president following Gümüşpala's death, and initially emerged as the favorite for the position. But the Turkish press tarnished Bilgiç's reputation, accusing him of political and religious conservatism. Party leaders soon started to worry that he would ruin the party's image with the Turkish intelligentsia and, more importantly, the army. Indeed, the military head of state, Cemal Gürsel, began pushing for a more progressive candidate to take charge - Süleyman Demirel.\nDemirel came from a modest village background, and climbed up the social latter by the way of his education. He had studied in the United States as an Eisenhower fellow and then worked in a US multinational construction company. He appealed to the party's base of newly urbanized rural migrants, who could identify with his modest beginnings and status as a self-made man. At the Justice Party's national convention in December 1964, Demirel ultimately defeated Bilgiç for the party's general-president post.\nOnce firmly in charge, Demirel began his assault on İnönü's fragile coalition, making sure it failed to win a vote of confidence in early 1965. Parliamentary bickering finally led to the triumphant 1965 elections, in which the Justice Party received nearly 53% of the vote and promptly formed a majority government with 240 seats. The party had achieved this result by appealing to small-holder peasants emerging from poverty, small commercial and industrial groups as well as the newly rich farmers; it performed most strongly in the relatively rich western provinces of Turkey, along the Aegean coast and in Thrace. This Justice Party victory was simultaneously a historical loss for the Republican People's Party, which suffered the worst defeat in its political history so far by winning only 134 seats and 29% of the vote.\n\n\nDecline\nThe Justice Party's good fortune, however, did not last for long. The small Anatolian enterprises that had formed a key part of the party's constituency couldn't compete with the Istanbul area's large, modern corporations. These entrepreneurs felt betrayed, and defected from the Justice Party to smaller rightist alternatives. Meanwhile, the country suffered through increasing socio-political strife, as conflicts between leftist and rightist groups turned increasingly violent. Since Demirel symbolized a pro-Western capitalist current in the Turkish establishment, he became an easy target for both the far left and the religious right. The party was still able to win the 1969 elections, carrying 256 seats with around 46.5% of the vote, but the overall situation grew increasingly chaotic. The near-constant street violence escalated, threatening the Turkish economy and ultimately provoking the military to intervene once again in 1971. With the power once again firmly in its hands, the military forced Demirel to resign.\nThe Justice Party was not able to win the elections held in 1973 and 1977, but Demirel was able to serve as prime minister three more times between 1975 and 1980, albeit with coalition partners. On 12 September 1980, the military once again staged a coup d'état, and this time banned Demirel and the Justice Party from the country's politics. After an extended pause, the party eventually reemerged as the True Path Party, complete with the galloping horse logo, in 1983.\n\n\nSee also\n\nSüleyman Demirel\nNationalist Front\nTurkish nationalism\nLiberalism in Turkey\nConservatism in Turkey\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nAhmad, Feroz. \"Turkey: The Quest for Identity\".

    "summary": "The Justice Party (Turkish: Adalet Partisi, AP) was a Turkish political party prominent in the 1960s and 1970s. A descendant of the Democrat Party, the AP was dominated by Süleyman Demirel, who served six times as prime minister, and was in office at the time of the military coup on 12 September 1980. Along with all other political parties in Turkey, the Justice Party was suppressed in the immediate aftermath of the coup. It was subsequently re-established as the True Path Party in 1983.\nThe Justice Party was a Turkish nationalist and liberal conservative party. It advocated Kemalist principles, parliamentary democracy and a market economy. It strongly supported membership in NATO and close relations with the United States.",

This war followed the First Indochina War (1946–1954) and was fought between North Vietnam—supported by Communist nations such as the Soviet Union and China—and the government of South Vietnam—supported by the United States, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and other anti-communist allies. The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a South Vietnamese communist common front, aided by the North, fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region which was won militarily.

This war followed the First Indochina War (1946–1954) and was fought between North Vietnam—supported by Communist nations such as the Soviet Union and China—and the government of South Vietnam—supported by the United States, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and other anti-communist allies. The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a South Vietnamese communist common front, aided by the North, fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region which was won militarily. The People's Army of Vietnam, also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in a more conventional war, at times committing large units to battle.",

    "text": "In French spelling, aspirated \"h\" (French: h aspiré) is an initial silent letter that represents a hiatus at a word boundary, between the word's first vowel and the preceding word's last vowel. At the same time, the aspirated h stops the normal processes of contraction and liaison from occurring.\nThe name of the now-silent h refers not to a contemporary aspiration but to its former pronunciation as the voiceless glottal fricative [h] in Old French and in Middle French.\n\n\nExamples\n\nThis example illustrates how the aspirated h-word héros prevents the liaison, in which the otherwise-silent word-final consonant would be pronounced before the first vowel of the following word. Because the h is an aspirated h, the second entry is incorrect, as the hiatus prevents the final /z/ from being phonetically realised. The pronunciation /no.ze.ʁo/ would be understood as meaning nos zéros (our zeroes), something totally different.\n\nThis example illustrates how the aspirated-h word hibou has no elision, in which the vowel of the le would be dropped. The second entry is incorrect because elision is not allowed in the word hibou because of the hiatus imposed by its aspirated h.\n\n\nHistorical and sociolinguistic aspects\nOne part of the major phonological changes between Latin and Early Old French was the loss of the consonant /h/, which would later return with the introduction of Germanic words into the language. The aspirate h ceased to be pronounced once more in either the 16th or the 17th century, but some grammarians kept insisting for it be pronounced into the early part of the twentieth century. Since the phonological behavior of aspirate h words cannot be predicted through spelling, usage requires a considerable amount of memorisation. It is often used to demonstrate one's education and social status. As early as the 17th century, noted grammarian \nClaude Favre de Vaugelas described the incorrect pronunciation of aspirated h words as typical of French spoken on the southern side of the Loire. Further discussion of the phenomenon is found in almost every collection of remarks on language to the present day, with mistakes generally being ascribed to class differences or inattention.\nIn modern usage, the blocking of liaison and elision with aspirated h words appears to be gaining ground in formal French but is losing ground in less guarded speech.\n\n\nList of French words which begin with an aspirated h\nThe following list contains only the dictionary head entries and not all the forms that can be derived from them. For example, it does not contain past participles or transitive verbs when used as adjectives or nouns. It does not include composite words unless the omission might cause confusion among homonyms distinguished only by diacritic signs.\n\nIn all French words that begin with h, the following letter is a vowel.\nMost aspirated-h words are derived from Germanic languages.\nThe h is generally not aspirated in words of Latin and Greek origin.\nThe h is aspirated in onomatopoeia.\nThere are numerous exceptions, and etymology often cannot explain them satisfactorily.\nIn French dictionaries, words with an initial aspirated h are traditionally prefixed with an asterisk but with no effect on their alphabetical arrangement. The following list is compiled from the Dictionnaire du Trésor de la langue française and the Dictionnaire de l'Académie française. It lacks many proper names and recent borrowings. In general, if a borrowed word is pronounced with an [h] in its language of origin, the h will be conserved in French orthography and be aspirated.\n\n\nWords beginning with ha\n\n\nWords beginning with he\n\n\nHélas\nHélas is not aspirated in classical poetry.\n\nHélas ! Que cet hélas a de peine à sortir (Pierre Corneille).\nThat is indicated here by the use of cet rather than ce.\n\n\nWords beginning with hi\nThe aspiration of h is often optional in words beginning with hi, and the liaison (with a mute h) is generally accepted, except in recent anglicisms of current usage, interjections or homophones with another word. Beside the very productive and learned Greek root hiéro-, most words are quite recent and of Germanic origin (German, Dutch, Modern English), or the h is lightly pronounced.\n\n\nWords beginning with ho\nMost have an aspirated h. The exceptions are mostly Latin roots that are most widely used in which the h has lost its voicing through assimilation to common language (in hôte, hospice or hôpital all derived from hospes/hospitis. Also if the h has been assimilated to the following ⟨s⟩ heure/horo-, taken from hora in which the h has been assimilated to the preceding adjectives, make the h mute.\n\n\nWords beginning with hu\nAlmost all words beginning with hu have an aspirated h. The exceptions are some terms for which the h is not etymological but was introduced for orthographic reasons with the purpose of distinguishing different roots that begin with a u or a v  but were homographs in Latin writing (therefore, huile, huis, or huître are not aspirated).\n\n\nSee also\nHiatus (linguistics)\nSandhi\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Curaçao, officially the Country of Curaçao, is a constituent island country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, located in the southern Caribbean Sea (specifically the Dutch Caribbean region), about 65 km (40 mi) north of Venezuela and 80 km (50 mi) southeast of Aruba. Curaçao includes the main island of Curaçao, and the much smaller, uninhabited island of Klein Curaçao (\"Little Curaçao\").\nCuraçao has a population of 158,665 (January 2019 estimate), with an area of 444 km2 (171 sq mi); its capital is Willemstad. Together with Aruba and Bonaire, Curaçao forms part of the ABC islands. Collectively, Curaçao, Aruba, and other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. It is the largest of the ABC islands in terms of both area and population.\nThe island's name \"Curaçao\" may originate from the indigenous autonym of its people; this idea is supported by early Spanish accounts referring to the inhabitants as \"Indios Curaçaos\". Curaçao's history begins with the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians; the island becoming a Spanish colony after Alonso de Ojeda's 1499 expedition. Though labelled \"the useless island\" due to its poor agricultural yield and lack of precious metals, it later became a strategic cattle ranching area. When the Dutch colonized the island in 1634, they shifted the island's focus to trade and shipping, and later made it a hub of the Atlantic slave trade. Members of the Jewish community, fleeing persecution in Europe, settled here and significantly influenced the economy and culture.\nBritish forces occupied Curaçao twice during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars but it was returned to Dutch rule. The abolition of slavery in 1863 led to economic shifts and migrations. Dutch remains the official language, though Papiamentu, English, and Spanish are widely spoken, reflecting the island's diverse cultural influences. Curaçao was formerly part of the Curaçao and Dependencies colony from 1815 to 1954, and later the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 2010, as Island Territory of Curaçao.\nThe discovery of oil in the Maracaibo Basin in 1914 transformed Curaçao into a major refinery location, altering its economic landscape. There were efforts towards becoming a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands; the island achieved autonomy in 2010.\n\n\nEtymology\nOne explanation for the island's name is that Curaçao was the autonym by which its indigenous peoples identified themselves. Early Spanish accounts support this theory, referring to the indigenous peoples as Indios Curaçaos.\nFrom 1525, the island was featured on Spanish maps as Curaçote, Curasaote, Curasaore, and even Curacaute. By the 17th century, it appeared on most maps as Curaçao or Curazao. On a map created by Hieronymus Cock in 1562 in Antwerp, the island was called Qúracao.\nA persistent but undocumented story claims the following: in the 16th and 17th centuries—the early years of European exploration—when sailors on long voyages got scurvy from lack of vitamin C, sick Portuguese or Spanish sailors were left on the island now known as Curaçao. When their ship returned, some had recovered, probably after eating vitamin C-rich fruit there. From then on, the Portuguese allegedly referred to the island as Ilha da Curação (Island of Healing) or the Spanish as Isla de la Curación.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nPre-colonial\n\nThe original inhabitants of Curaçao were the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians. Their ancestors had migrated to the island from the mainland of South America, probably hundreds of years before Europeans' first arrival.\n\n\nSpanish colonization\nThe first Europeans recorded as seeing the island were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of Alonso de Ojeda in 1499. The Spaniards enslaved most of the Caquetios (Arawak) for forced labour in their Hispaniola colony, but paid little attention to the island itself. In 1515, almost all of the 2,000 Caquetios living there were also transported to Hispaniola as slaves.\nEstablished in 1499 as a Spanish launchpad for exploring northern South America, Curaçao was officially settled by Spain in 1527. It functioned as an island extension of Venezuela throughout the 1500s. As mainland colonization advanced, Spain slowly withdrew from the island. The city registry of Caracas, Venezuela, holds one of the earliest written mentions of Curaçao. A document dated 9 December 1595, states that Francisco Montesinos, priest and vicar of \"the Yslas de Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire\" conferred his power of attorney to Pedro Gutiérrez de Lugo, a Caracas resident, to collect his ecclesiastic salary from the Royal Treasury of King Philip II of Spain.\nThe Spanish introduced numerous tree, plant and animal species to Curaçao, including horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle from Europe and other Spanish colonies. In general, imported sheep, goats and cattle did relatively well. Cattle were herded by Caquetios and Spaniards and roamed freely in the kunuku plantations and savannas.\nNot all imported species fared equally well, and the Spanish also learned to use Caquetio crops and agricultural methods, as well as those from other Caribbean islands. Though historical sources point to thousands of people living on the island, agricultural yields were disappointing; this and the lack of precious metals in the salt mines led the Spanish to call Curaçao \"the useless island\".\nOver time, the number of Spaniards living on Curaçao decreased while the number of aboriginal inhabitants stabilized. Presumably through natural growth, return and colonization, the Caquetio population then began to increase. In the last decades of Spanish occupation, Curaçao was used as a large cattle ranch. At that point, Spaniards lived around Santa Barbara, Santa Ana and in the villages in the western part of the island, while the Caquetios are thought to have lived scattered all over the island.\n\n\nDutch colonial rule\n\nIn 1634, during the Eighty Years' War of independence between the Republic of the Netherlands and Spain, the Dutch West India Company under Admiral Johann van Walbeeck invaded the island; the Spanish surrendered in San Juan in August. Approximately 30 Spaniards and many indigenous people were then deported to Santa Ana de Coro in Venezuela. About 30 Taíno families were allowed to live on the island while Dutch colonists started settling there.\nThe Dutch West India Company founded the capital of Willemstad on the banks of an inlet called the Schottegat; the natural harbour proved an ideal place for trade. Commerce and shipping—and piracy—became Curaçao's most important economic activities. Later, salt mining became a major industry, the mineral being a lucrative export at the time. From 1662, the Dutch West India Company made Curaçao a centre of the Atlantic slave trade, often bringing slaves from West Africa to the island, before selling them elsewhere in the Caribbean and Spanish Main.\nSephardic Jews fleeing persecution in Spain and Portugal sought safe haven in Dutch Brazil and the Dutch Republic. Many settled in Curaçao, where they made significant contributions to its civil society, cultural development, and economic prosperity. In 1674 the island became a free port.\nIn the Franco-Dutch War of 1672–78, French Count Jean II d'Estrées planned to attack Curaçao. His fleet—12 men-of-war, three fire ships, two transports, a hospital ship, and 12 privateers—met with disaster, losing seven men-of-war and two other ships when they struck reefs off the Las Aves archipelago. The serious navigational error occurred on 11 May 1678, a week after the fleet set sail from Saint Kitts. To commemorate its narrow escape from invasion, Curaçao marked the events with a day of thanksgiving, which was celebrated for decades into the 18th century.\n\nMany Dutch colonists grew affluent from the slave trade, building impressive colonial buildings in the capital of Willemstad; the city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1795, a major slave revolt took place under the leaders Tula Rigaud, Louis Mercier, Bastian Karpata, and Pedro Wakao. Up to 4,000 slaves in northwest Curaçao revolted, with more than 1,000 taking part in extended gunfights. After a month, the slave owners were able to suppress the revolt.\n\nCuraçao's proximity to South America resulted in interaction with cultures of the coastal areas more than a century after the independence of the Netherlands from Spain. Architectural similarities can be seen between 19th century Willemstad neighborhoods and the nearby Venezuelan city of Coro in Falcón State, which has also been designated a World Heritage Site. Netherlands established economic ties with the Viceroyalty of New Granada that included the present-day countries of Colombia and Venezuela. In the 19th century, Curaçaoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Brión were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of both Venezuela and Colombia. Political refugees from the mainland, such as Simón Bolívar, regrouped in Curaçao.\nDuring the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, British forces twice occupied Curaçao; the first occupation lasted from 1800 to 1803, and the second occupation from 1807 to 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic wars stable Dutch rule returned in 1815. After the signing of the Treaty of London, the island was incorporated into the colony of Curaçao and Dependencies.\nThe Dutch abolished slavery in 1863, causing vast changes in the economy with the shift to wage labour. Some Curaçao inhabitants emigrated to other islands, such as Cuba, to work in sugarcane plantations. Other former slaves had nowhere to go and continued working for plantation owners under the tenant farmer system, in which former slaves leased land from former masters, paying most of their harvest to owners as rent. The system lasted until the early 20th century.\nHistorically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of the colonial administration, but its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Students on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish until the early 19th century, when the British occupied all three islands. Teaching of Spanish was restored when Dutch rule resumed in 1815. Also, efforts were made to introduce widespread bilingual Dutch and Papiamentu education in the late 19th century.\n\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nWhen oil was discovered in the Venezuelan Maracaibo Basin town of Mene Grande in 1914, Curaçao's economy was dramatically altered. In the early years, both Shell and Exxon held drilling concessions in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to refineries in Aruba and Curaçao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. Both Shell and Exxon were vertically integrated and controlled the entire industry, from pumping, transporting, and refining to sales. The refineries on Aruba and Curaçao operated in global markets and were profitable partly because of the margin between the production costs of crude oil and the revenues the sale of oil products. This provided a safety net for losses incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at the refineries.\nIn 1929, Curaçao was attacked by Venezuelan rebel commander Rafael Simón Urbina, who, with 250 soldiers, captured the fort. The Venezuelans plundered weapons, ammunition, and the island's treasury. They also managed to capture the Governor of the island, Leonardus Albertus Fruytier (1882–1972), and hauled him off to Venezuela on a stolen American ship, Maracaibo. Fruytier was criticized and had to resign as governor. After returning to the Netherlands, he settled for a position as chief inspector in Maastricht. The Dutch increased their military presence on the island.\nIn 1936 a burning bale of cotton thrown overboard by the crew of MS Colombia, which lay anchored in the Schottegat, caused the oil floating on the water to catch fire. It took days to get the fire under control; houses had to be evacuated, but there were no casualties.\nDuring the Second World War, the island played an important role in the supply of fuel for the Allied forces. In 1940, before the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany, the British occupied Curaçao and the French Aruba. The presence of powers other than the Netherlands alarmed the Venezuelan government given the proximity of these islands at the entrance to the Gulf of Venezuela and the fact they had historically been used as bases to launch incursions against Venezuelan territory. In 1941, US troops occupied the island and built the military airport \"Hato\". The main purpose was this deployment was to fight against expected future attacks by Axis submarines and potentially long-distance German bomber aircraft. The United States was also concerned over the potential threat of a German invasion of the continental US launched with the aid of German settlers in South America.\nIn 1942 the port of Willemstad, one of the main sources of fuel for the Allied operations, was besieged by German submarines on several occasions under Neuland Operation. In August 1942, the Germans returned to Curaçao and attacked a tanker before receiving fire from a Dutch shore battery and slipping away. The United States Navy established the Fourth Fleet, which was responsible for countering enemy naval operations in the Caribbean and in the South Atlantic. The United States Army also sent aircraft and personnel to help protect the oil refineries and bolster the Venezuelan Air Force.\n\nIn 1954, Curaçao and other Dutch Caribbean colonies were joined to form the Netherlands Antilles. Discontent with Curaçao's seemingly subordinate relationship to the Netherlands, ongoing racial discrimination, and a rise in unemployment owing to layoffs in the Shell refinery led to a series of riots in 1969.\nA state of emergency was declared after rioters set fire to the Willemstad downtown and the bankers mansions. Protestors had to face the Dutch Navy marines dispatching from the local military base on the island, to quell the rebellion led by charismatic politicians such as Papa Godett and Stanley Browne. The riots resulted in two deaths, numerous injuries and severe property and infrastructural damage in Willemstad. In response, the Dutch government introduced far-reaching reforms, allowing Afro-Curaçaoans greater influence over the island's political and economic life, and increased the prominence of the local Papiamentu language.\nCuraçao experienced an economic downturn in the early 1980s. Shell's refinery on the island operated with significant losses from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1982 to 1985. Persistent losses, global overproduction, stronger competition, and low market expectations threatened the refinery's future. In 1985, after 70 years, Royal Dutch Shell decided to end its activities on Curaçao. This came at a crucial moment. Curaçao's fragile economy had been stagnant for some time. Several revenue-generating sectors suffered even more during this period: tourism from Venezuela collapsed after the devaluation of the bolivar, and a slowdown in the transportation sector had deleterious effects on the Antillean Airline Company and the Curaçao Dry Dock Company. The offshore financial services industry also experienced a downturn due to new U.S. tax laws.\nIn the mid-1980s, Shell sold its refinery for the symbolic amount of one Antillean guilder to a local government consortium. In recent years, the aging refinery has been the subject of lawsuits alleging that its emissions, including sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, far exceed safety standards. The government consortium leases the refinery to the Venezuelan PDVSA state oil company.\nContinuing economic hardship in the late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in much emigration to the Netherlands.\nOn 1 July 2007, Curaçao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, like Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. On 28 November 2006, the change was delayed when the island council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process. A new island council ratified this agreement on 9 July 2007. On 15 December 2008, Curaçao was again scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. A non-binding referendum on the move was held in Curaçao on 15 May 2009; 52% of voters supported it.\n\n\nSince the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles\nThe dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles came into effect on 10 October 2010. Curaçao became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy. The kingdom was also tasked with overseeing the island's finances under a debt-relief arrangement agreed upon between the two. Curaçao's first prime minister was Gerrit Schotte. He was succeeded in 2012 by Stanley Betrian, ad interim. After the 2012 elections, Daniel Hodge became the third prime minister on 31 December 2012. He led a demissionary cabinet until 7 June 2013, when a new cabinet under the leadership of Ivar Asjes was sworn in.\nAlthough Curaçao is autonomous, the Netherlands has intervened in its affairs to ensure that parliamentary elections are held and to assist in finalizing accurate budgets. In July 2017, Curaçaoan Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath said he wanted Curaçao to take full responsibility over its affairs, but asked for more cooperation and assistance from the Netherlands, with suggestions for more innovative approaches to help Curaçao succeed and increase its standard of living. The Dutch government reminded the Curaçaoan government that it had provided assistance with oil refinery negotiations with the Chinese \"on numerous occasions\".\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic resulted in austerity measures. Curaçao had to impose spending cuts to qualify for additional aid from the Netherlands. As part of the austerity package, the Government of Curaçao announced a 12.5% cut in benefits for civil servants. On 24 June 2020, a group of civil servants, together with waste collectors from Selikor, marched to Fort Amsterdam and demanded to speak with Rhuggenaath. The demonstration turned into a riot, and police cleared the square in front of Fort Amsterdam with tear gas. The city centre of Willemstad was later looted. 48 people were arrested, the city districts of Punda and Otrobanda were placed under lockdown for the night, and a general curfew was declared from 20:30 to 06:00.\n\n\nGeography\n\nCuraçao lies on the continental shelf of South America and features a hilly topography with its highest point, named Christoffelberg, reaching 372 m (1,220 ft) above sea level. Curaçao has a diverse range of beaches from its coastline's bays, inlets, lagoons, seasonal lakes, rough seas at its northshore, and spring water. In addition, Curaçao has upwelling, which is an oceanographic phenomenon that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler and nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean moving towards the ocean surface, contributing to its source of natural minerals, thermal conditions, and seawater used in hydrotherapy and mesotherapy, making the island one of many balneoclimateric areas in the region. Furthermore, off the southeast coast of the main island of Curaçao lies the tiny unhabitated Isle of Klein Curaçao, which boasts a long stretched beach.\n\n\nFlora\nCuraçao's flora differ from typical tropical island vegetation. The arid Guajira–Barranquilla xeric scrub ecoregion is most notably different, with various forms of cacti, thorny shrubs, evergreen, and watapana trees (Libidibia coriaria; called divi-divi on Aruba), which are characteristic of the ABC islands and the national symbol of Aruba. Brassavola nodosa is a drought-tolerant species of Brassavola, one of the few orchids present in the ABC islands. Cacti include Melocactus and Opuntia species such as Opuntia stricta.\n\n\nFauna\n\nCuraçao is semi-arid, and as such has not supported the numerous tropical species of mammals, birds, and lizards most associated with rainforests. Dozens of species of hummingbirds, bananaquits, orioles, and the larger terns, herons, egrets, and even flamingos make their homes near ponds or in coastal areas. The turpial, a black bird with a bright orange underbelly and white swatches on its wings, is common to Curaçao. The mockingbird, called chuchubi in Papiamentu, resembles the North American mockingbird, with a long white-grey tail and a grey back. Near shorelines, big billed brown pelicans feed on fish. Other seabirds include several types of gulls and large cormorants.\nOther than field mice, small rabbits, and cave bats, Curaçao's most notable animal is the white-tailed deer. This deer is related to the American white-tailed deer, or Virginia deer, found in areas from North America through Central America and the Caribbean, and as far south as Bolivia. It can be a large deer, some reaching six feet (2 m) in length and three feet (0.9 m) in height and weighing as much as 300 pounds (140 kg). It has a long tail with a white underside and is the only type of deer on the island. It has been a protected species since 1926, and an estimated 200 live on Curaçao. They are found in many parts of the island, but most notably at the west end's Christoffel Park, where about 70% of the herd resides. Archaeologists believe the deer were brought from South America to Curaçao by its original inhabitants, the Arawaks.\nThere are several species of iguana, light green in colour with shimmering shades of aqua along the belly and sides, found lounging in the sun across the island. The iguanas found on Curaçao serve not only as a scenic attraction but, unlike many islands that gave up the practice years ago, remain hunted for food. Along the west end of the island's north shore are several inlets that have become home to breeding sea turtles. These turtles are protected by the park system in Shete Boka Park and can be visited accompanied by park rangers.\nHistorically, Curaçao contained a diverse ecosystem of stygofauna, including members from relictual crustacean groups such as Thermosbaenacea. However, this network of aquatic species, involving numerous endemic taxa, have not been detected since the 1970s. Their abrupt disappearance is hypothesized to have resulted from a combination of habitat destruction and contamination of groundwater by oil and discharge, the result of oil industry activities in the late 1900s.\n\n\nClimate\nCuraçao has a hot, semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with a dry season from January to September and a wet season from October to December. Rainfall is scarce, only 450 millimetres (18 in) per year; in particular, the rainy season is drier than it normally is in tropical climates; during the dry season, it almost never rains. Owing to the scarcity of rainfall, the landscape of Curaçao is arid; especially on the north coast of the island. Temperatures are relatively constant, with small differences measured throughout the year. The trade winds cool the island during the day and warm it at night. The coolest month is January with an average temperature of 26.6 °C or 80 °F; the hottest is September with an average temperature of 29.1 °C or 84 °F. The year's average maximum temperature is 31.4 °C or 89 °F. The year's average temperature is 25.7 °C or 78 °F. The seawater around Curaçao averages around 27 °C (81 °F) and is coolest (avg. 25.9 °C [78.6 °F]) from February to March, and hottest (avg. 28.2 °C [82.8 °F]) from September to October.\nBecause Curaçao lies North of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and in an area of low-level divergence where winds flow parallel to the coast, its climate is much drier than expected for the northeastern side of a continent at its latitude. Rainfall is also extremely variable from year to year, being strongly linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation. As little as 200 millimetres or 8 inches may fall in a strong El Niño year, but as much as 1,150 millimetres or 45 inches is not unknown in powerful La Niña years.\nCuraçao lies outside the Main Development Region for tropical cyclones, but is still occasionally affected by them, as with Hurricanes Hazel in 1954, Anna in 1961, Felix in 2007, and Omar in 2008. No hurricane has made landfall in Curaçao since the US National Hurricane Center started tracking hurricanes. Curaçao has, however, been directly affected by pre-hurricane tropical storms several times; the latest being Hurricane Tomas in 2010, Cesar in 1996, Joan in 1988, Cora and Greta in 1978, Edith and Irene in 1971, and Francelia in 1969. Tomas brushed past Curaçao as a tropical storm, dropping as much as 265 mm (10.4 in) of rain on the island, nearly half its annual precipitation in a single day. This made Tomas one of the wettest events in the island's history, as well as one of the most devastating; its flooding killed two people and caused over NAƒ50 million (US$28 million) in damage.\nAccording to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, average carbon dioxide emissions per person on the island were 52 tonnes in 2018, the second highest in the world.\nMeteo, the Curaçao weather department, provides up-to-date information about weather conditions via its website and mobile apps for iOS and Android.\n\n\nGeology\n\nThe northern seabed drops steeply within 60 m (200 ft) of the Curaçaoan shore. This drop-off is known as the \"blue edge\".\nOn Curaçao, four major geological formations can be found: the lava formation, the Knip formation, the Mid-Curaçao formation and limestone formations.\nCuraçao lies within the Caribbean large igneous province (CLIP) with key exposures of those lavas existing on the island consisting of the Curaçao Lava Formation (CLF). The CLF consists of 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) of pillow lavas with some basalt intrusions. The ages of these rocks include 89 Ma for the lavas and 75 Ma for the poikilitic sills, though some sequences may have erupted as late as 62–66 Ma, placing them in the Cretaceous period. Their composition includes picrite pillows at the base, followed by tholeiitic lavas, then hyaloclastites, then the poikilitic sills. The CLF was gradually uplifted until Eocene-Miocene limestone caps formed, before final exposure above sea level. Christoffelberg and the Zevenbergen (Seven Hills) portion of the island have exposures of the Knip Formation. This formation includes deepwater deposits of calcareous sands and fine clays, capped by siliceous chert containing radiolarians. Middle Curaçao contains alluvial soils from eroded CLF and limestone.\n\n\nBeaches\n\nCuraçao has 37 beaches. Most are on the south side of the island. The best known are:\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe island has diverse architectural styles reflecting the influence of the various historical rulers over the region, including Spain, the Netherlands, with more modern elements under Western influence primarily including the United States and other European countries. This ranges from ruins and colonial buildings to modern infrastructure.\n\n\nForts\n\nWhen the Dutch arrived in 1634, they built forts at key points around the island to protect themselves from foreign powers, privateers, and pirates. Six of the best-preserved forts can still be seen today:\n\nFort Amsterdam (1635)\nFort Beekenburg (1703)\nFort Nassau (1797)\nWaterfort (1826)\nRif Fort (1828)\nFort Piscadera (built between 1701 and 1704)\nIn 1957, the hotel Van der Valk Plaza Curaçao was built on top of the Waterfort.\nThe Rif Fort is located opposite of the Waterfort, across the Otrobanda harbour entrance. It contains restaurants and shops, and in 2009, the Renaissance Curaçao Resort and Casino opened next to it.\n\n\nPolitics\nAfter being part of the Netherlands Antilles, Curaçao became autonomous, along with Sint Maarten island, while the less populated islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba remained special municipalities governed by the Netherlands.\n\n\nGovernment\n\nCuraçao is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its governance takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. The King of the Netherlands is the head of state, represented locally by a governor, with the Prime Minister of Curaçao serving as head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.\nThe judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Convicted felons are held at the Curaçao Centre for Detention and Correction.\nCuraçao has full autonomy over most matters; the exceptions are outlined in the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the title \"Kingdom affairs\".\n\n\nMilitary\n\nDefence of the island is the responsibility of the Netherlands. The Netherlands Armed Forces deploy both ground and naval units in the Caribbean with some of these forces based on Curaçao. These forces include:\n\na company of the Royal Netherlands Army on Curaçao on a rotational basis;\na Fast Raiding Interception and Special Forces Craft (FRISC) troop (fast boats);\na guardship, normally a Holland-class offshore patrol vessel, from the Royal Netherlands Navy on station in the Caribbean on a rotational basis;\nthe Royal Netherlands Navy support vessel HNLMS Pelikaan;\nCurmil (Curaçaoan) militia elements;\nElements of a Royal Marechaussee brigade of the Armed Forces.\nTwo Dutch naval bases, Parera and Suffisant, are located on the island of Curaçao. Officers of the Arubaanse Militie complete additional training on Curaçao. The Curaçao Volunteer Corps is also stationed at the Suffisant Naval Barracks.\nOn the west side of Curaçao International Airport are hangars for the two Bombardier Dash 8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft and two AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Until 2007, the site was a Royal Netherlands Navy air base which operated for 55 years with a wide variety of aircraft, including Fireflies, Avengers, Trackers, Neptunes, Fokker F-27s, P-3C Orions, Fokker F-60s and several helicopter types. After the political decision to sell off all Orions, the air base was not needed anymore.\nThe west end of the airport is a United States Air Force (USAF) Forward Operating Location (FOL). The base hosts airborne early warning and control systems (AWACS), cargo aircraft, aerial refueling planes, and reconnaissance aircraft. Until 1999, the USAF operated a small fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft from the FOL. The PAE corporation runs base operations at the FOL.\n\n\nConscription\nSuffisant Naval Base has facilities used for conscription in the Caribbean. There has been no military conscription since 1997, but a form of civil conscription has replaced it, compelling underprivileged young Antilleans to undertake professional training.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nCuraçao has an open economy; its most important sectors are tourism, international trade, shipping services, oil refining, oil storage and bunkering, and international financial services. Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA's lease on the island's oil refinery expired in 2019; the facility employs 1,000 people, refining oil from Venezuela for export to the United States and Asia. Schlumberger, the world's largest oil field services company, is incorporated in Curaçao. The Isla oil refinery is said to be responsible for Curaçao's position as one of the world's top five highest per capita CO2 emission-producing countries.\nAlong with Sint Maarten, Curaçao uses two co-circulating currencies: the Netherlands Antillean guilder and its successor, the Caribbean guilder; the former will be withdrawn as legal tender on 1 July 2025. Its economy is well-developed, supporting a high standard of living, ranking 46th in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita and 27th in the world in terms of nominal GDP per capita. Curaçao possesses a high-income economy as defined by the World Bank.\nActivities related to the port of Willemstad, such as the Free Trade Zone, make significant contributions to the economy. To achieve greater economic diversification, the Curaçaoan government is increasing its efforts to attract more foreign investment. This policy, called the \"Open Arms\" policy, features a heavy focus on attracting information technology companies.\nSince 2016, reduced foreign demand for goods due to the ongoing unrest and political uncertainty in Venezuela has led to decreased exports and increased domestic demand for goods and services, resulting in economic stagnation. While many economic sectors contracted, expansion took place in the construction, financial intermediation, and utilities sectors.\n\n\nTourism\n\nWhile tourism plays a major role in Curaçao's economy, the island is less reliant on tourism than many other Caribbean countries. Most tourists come to Curaçao from the Netherlands, the eastern United States, South America and other Caribbean islands. Curaçao was a Caribbean leader in cruise ship tourism growth, with 610,186 cruise passengers in 2013, a 41.4% increase over the previous year. Hato International Airport received 1,772,501 passengers in 2013 and announced capital investments totaling US$48 million aimed at transforming the airport into a regional hub by 2018.\nThe Curaçaoan insular shelf's sharp drop-off known as the \"Blue Edge\" is often visited by scuba diving tourists. Coral reefs for snorkeling and scuba diving can be reached without a boat. The southern coast has calm waters as well as many small beaches, such as Jan Thiel and Cas Abou. At the westernmost point of the island is Watamula and the Cliff Villa Peninsula which are good locations for drift diving. The coastline of Curaçao features numerous bays and inlets which serve as popular mooring locations for boats.\nIn June 2017, the island was named the Top Cruise Destination in the Southern Caribbean by Cruise Critic, a major online forum. The winners of the Destination Awards were selected based on comments from cruise passengers who rated the downtown area of Willemstad as \"amazing\" and the food and shopping as \"excellent\". The historic centre of Willemstad is a World Heritage Site. Another attraction is the town's colourful street art. The Blue Bay Sculpture Garden with works from known Curaçao artists is situated in a nearby resort. Landhuis Bloemhof is an art museum and gallery located in Willemstad.\nSome of the coral reefs are affected by tourism. Porto Marie Beach is experimenting with artificial coral reefs to improve the reef's condition. Hundreds of artificial coral blocks that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish. It is now under investigation to see if the sewer waste of hotels is a partial cause of the dying of the coral reef.\nEcotourism is a growing segment of Curaçaoan tourism. One site in particular – Mambo Beach, also known as \"Seaquarium Beach\" – is a popular destination due to the calm tides for children, frequent viewing of marine life, and vibrant coral reefs – some of which have been artificially planted to improve reef health.\n\n\nLabour\nIn 2016, a Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicated that the unemployment rate was 13.3%. For residents ages 15–64, the employment rate was 70.4%.\n\n\nFinancial services\nCuraçao's history in financial services dates back to the First World War. Prior to this period, the financial arms of local merchant houses functioned as informal lenders to the community. However, at the turn of the 20th century, Curaçao underwent industrialization, and a number of merchant houses established private commercial banks. As the economy grew, these banks began assuming additional functions eventually becoming full-fledged financial institutions.\nThe Dutch Caribbean Securities Exchange is located in the capital of Willemstad, as is the Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten; the latter of which dates to 1828. It is the oldest central bank in the Western Hemisphere. The island's legal system supports a variety of corporate structures and is a corporate haven. Though Curaçao is considered a tax haven, it adheres to the EU Code of Conduct against harmful tax practices. It holds a qualified intermediary status from the United States Internal Revenue Service. It is an accepted jurisdiction of the OECD and Caribbean Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.\n\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\n\nOn 30 June 2014, Curaçao was deemed to have an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to the \"Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act\" of the United States of America. The Tax Information Exchange Agreement signed in Washington, D.C., on 17 April 2002 between the U.S. and the Kingdom of the Netherlands includes Curaçao, and was updated with respect to Curaçao in 2014, taking effect in 2016.\n\n\nTrade\nCuraçao trades mainly with the United States, Venezuela, and the European Union. It has an Association Agreement with the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via Curaçao to export products to European markets, free of import duties and quotas. It is also a participant in the US Caribbean Basin Initiative allowing it to have preferential access to the US market.\n\n\nProstitution\n\nProstitution in Curaçao is legal only for foreign women who get a temporary permit to work in the large open-air brothel called \"Le Mirage\" or \"Campo Alegre\". Using prostitution services is legal for men (locals included). The brothel has operated near the airport since the 1940s. Curaçao monitors, contains and regulates the industry. The government states that the workers in these establishments are thereby given a safe environment and access to medical practitioners. However this approach does exclude local women (or men) to legally make a living from prostitution and does lead to loss of local income, as the foreign prostitutes send or take most of their earnings home.\n\n\nDevelopments of Campo Alegre (2020–2024)\nSince its closure in 2020 after 71 years of operation, Campo Alegre, Curaçao's largest open-air brothel, has been at the center of significant developments. Following the closure, a government-appointed working group proposed three scenarios for the site: transforming it into a regulated prostitution area, repurposing it for commercial use, or converting it into a residential area.\nIn 2023, the property was put up for auction, attracting various potential buyers. In a significant move, the Curaçao government purchased the Campo Alegre property, aiming to have more control over its future use.\nThe current ruling political party, Movement for the Future of Curaçao (MFK), had made an election promise to reopen Campo Alegre as a regulated prostitution center. This promise aligns with the recommendations of the working group and reflects the party's stance on creating a controlled environment for sex work.\nAs of 2024, the government is evaluating scenarios to ensure that the chosen path will benefit the local economy and social landscape.\nThe U.S. State Department has cited anecdotal evidence claiming that, \"Curaçao...[is a] destination island... for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, according to local observers. At least 500 foreign women reportedly are in prostitution throughout the five islands of the Antilles, some of whom have been trafficked.\" The US Department of State has said that the government of Curaçao frequently underestimates the extent of human trafficking problems.\n\n\nDemographics\n\nOwing to the island's colonial past, the majority of Curaçao's population is of full or partial African descent. There are also minorities of Dutch, Portuguese, Jewish, Latin American, South Asian, East Asian and Lebanese descent.\nPortuguese laborers, namely from Madeira, migrated to Curaçao to work in the island's oil and agricultural industries in the 20th century.\nAccording to 2022 data from the CIA, Curacao has a total of only 92 men for every 100 women.\n\n\nReligion\n\nThe religious breakdown of the population of Curaçao, according to a 2011 estimate:\n\nRoman Catholic; 69.8%\nAdventist; 9%\nEvangelical; 8.9%\nPentecostal; 7.6%\nOther Protestant; 3.2%\nJehovah's Witnesses; 2%\nOther; 3.8%\nNone; 10%\nUnspecified; 0.6%\nThere has been a shift towards the Charismatic movement in recent decades. Other denominations include the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Methodist Church. Alongside these Christian denominations, some inhabitants practise Montamentu and other diaspora African religions. As elsewhere in Latin America, Pentecostalism is on the rise. There are also practising Muslims and Hindus.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Willemstad encompasses all the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean which includes Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and the islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba. The diocese is also a member of the Antilles Episcopal Conference.\nWhile small, Curaçao's Jewish community has had a significant impact on the island's history. Curaçao has the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Americas, dating to 1651. The Curaçao synagogue is the oldest synagogue of the Americas in continuous use, since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue. Additionally, there are both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish communities. As of the year 2000 there were approximately 300 Jewish people living on the island.\n\n\nLanguages\nAccording to the 2023 census by language most used at home by Curaçao's population; 78% speak Papiamentu, 8.4% speak Spanish, 7.9% speak Dutch, 3.8% speak English and 2% speak other languages.\nCuraçao is a multilingual society. The official languages are Dutch, Papiamentu and English. However, Dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters. Most of Curaçao's population is able to converse in at least two, though more commonly in all four of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and Spanish.\nThe most widely spoken language is Papiamentu, a Portuguese-creole with African, Dutch and Spanish influences, which is spoken in all levels of society. Papiamentu was introduced as a language of primary school education in 1993, making Curaçao one of a handful of places where a creole language is used as a medium to acquire basic literacy.\nSpanish and English also have a long historical presence in Curaçao. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish territories in what are now Venezuela and Colombia and several Venezuelan TV networks are received. Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British occupied Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials already noted the widespread use of the English language.\n\n\nLocalities\nCuraçao was divided into five districts from 1863 to 1925, after which it was reduced to the two outer districts of Bandabou and Bandariba and the city district of Willemstad. Over the years, the capital, Willemstad, encompassed the entire area surrounding the large natural harbour, the Schottegat. As a result, many formerly isolated villages have grown together to form a large urbanised area. The city covers approximately one third of the entire island in the east. Willemstad's most famous neighbourhoods are:\n\nPunda, the historic city centre with the Handelskade on St. Anna Bay.\nOtrobanda, on the other side of St. Anna Bay\nPietermaai, east of Punda\nScharloo, north of Punda and Pietermaai, across the Waaigat\nJulianadorp, a suburb on the west side of the city, built around 1928 on behalf of Shell for its personnel\nEmmastad, built for Shell in the 1950s, after Julianadorp was full.\nSaliña is situated next to Punda and has many shops and restaurants.\nBrievengat, a suburb in the north of the city.\n\n\nStructure of the population\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\nEducation\n\nPublic education is based on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools, private and parochial schools are also available. Since the introduction of a new public education law in 1992, compulsory primary education starts at age six and continues for six years; secondary lasts for another four.\nThe main institute of higher learning is the University of Curaçao (formerly University of The Netherlands Antilles), enrolling 2,100 students. The comprehensive model of education is influenced by both the Dutch and American education systems. Other higher education offerings on the island include offshore medical schools, universities, language schools and academies for fine art, music, police, teacher and nurse-training.\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nVisual art\nVisual art in Curaçao encompasses painting, sculptures, and street art.\nCuraçao promotes street art with a festival, Kaya Kaya, held in the Otrabanda neighborhood of Willemstad. The streets of Willemstad are filled with murals from multiple versions of the festival.\n\n\nLiterature\nDespite the island's relatively small population, the diversity of languages and cultural influences on Curaçao have generated a remarkable literary tradition, primarily in Dutch and Papiamentu. The oral traditions of the Arawak indigenous peoples are lost. West African slaves brought the tales of Anansi, thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature. The first published work in Papiamentu was a poem by Joseph Sickman Corsen entitled Atardi, published in the La Cruz newspaper in 1905. Throughout Curaçaoan literature, narrative techniques and metaphors best characterized as magic realism tend to predominate. Novelists and poets from Curaçao have contributed to Caribbean and Dutch literature. Best known are Cola Debrot, Frank Martinus Arion, Pierre Lauffer, Elis Juliana, Guillermo Rosario, Boeli van Leeuwen and Tip Marugg.\n\n\nCuisine\nLocal food is called Krioyo (pronounced the same as criollo, the Spanish word for \"Creole\") and boasts a blend of flavours and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine. Dishes common in Curaçao are found in Aruba and Bonaire as well. Popular dishes include stobá (a stew made with various ingredients such as papaya, beef or goat), guiambo (soup made from okra and seafood), kadushi (cactus soup), sopi mondongo (intestine soup), funchi (cornmeal paste similar to fufu, ugali and polenta) and fish and other seafood. The ubiquitous side dish is fried plantain. Local bread rolls are made according to a Portuguese recipe. All around the island, there are snèks which serve local dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English pub.\nThe ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi: fried pastry with fillings of cheese, tuna, ham, or ground meat. Around the holiday season special dishes are consumed, such as the hallaca and pekelé, made out of salt cod. At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served: kokada (coconut sweets), ko'i lechi (condensed milk and sugar sweet) and tentalaria (peanut sweets). The Curaçao liqueur was developed here, when a local experimented with the rinds of the local citrus fruit known as laraha. Surinamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian and Dutch culinary influences also abound. The island also has a number of Chinese restaurants that serve mainly Indonesian dishes such as satay, nasi goreng and lumpia (which are all Indonesian names for the dishes). Dutch specialties such as croquettes and oliebollen are widely served in homes and restaurants.\n\n\nSports\n\nIn 2004, the Little League Baseball team from Willemstad, Curaçao, won the world title in a game against the United States champion from Thousand Oaks, California. The Willemstad lineup included Jurickson Profar, the standout shortstop prospect who is currently on the Atlanta Braves roster of Major League Baseball, and Jonathan Schoop.\nCuraçaoan players Andruw Jones, Ozzie Albies, and Kenley Jansen have made multiple Major League Baseball All-Star Game appearances.\nThe 2010 documentary film Boys of Summer details Curaçao's Pabao Little League All-Stars winning their country's eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series, then going on to defeat other teams, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and earning a spot in Williamsport.\nThe prevailing trade winds and warm water make Curaçao a location for windsurfing.\nThere is warm, clear water around the island. Scuba divers and snorkelers may have visibility up to 30 metres (98 feet) at the Curaçao Underwater Marine Park, which stretches along 20 kilometres (12 miles) of Curaçao's southern coastline.\nCuraçao participated in the 2013 CARIFTA Games. Kevin Philbert stood third in the under-20 male Long Jump with a distance of 7.36 metres (24.15 feet). Vanessa Philbert stood second the under-17 female 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) with a time of 4:47.97.\nThe Curaçao national football team won the 2017 Caribbean Cup by defeating Jamaica in the final, qualifying for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They then traveled to Thailand and participated in the 2019 King's Cup for the first time, eventually winning the tournament by beating Vietnam in the final.\n\n\nInfrastructure and transportation\n\n\nAirport\nCuraçao International Airport (also called Hato International Airport) is located on the northern coast of the island and offers connections to the Caribbean region, South America, North America and Europe. Curaçao Airport is a fairly large facility, with the third longest commercial runway in the Caribbean region after Rafael Hernández Airport in Puerto Rico and Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport in Guadeloupe. Curaçao international airport served as a main base for Insel Air, and for Air ALM, the former national airlines of Curaçao.\n\n\nRailways\nIn 1887 a horse drawn street tramway opened in Punda, the part of the capital Willemstad on the eastern side of Sint Annabaai. It had a U-shaped route about 2 km (1.2 mi) in length. In 1896, a tramway opened in Otrabanda on the opposite side of the bay, but it ceased operations within a few months. The Punda line was rebuilt in 1911, regauged to metre gauge, and the horse-drawn trams replaced by petrol engined ones. The line closed in 1920.\n\n\nPublic transportation\nABC (Auto Busbedrijf Curaçao, \"Curaçao Bus Company\") provides bus transportation in and around Willemstad with 21 lines, all departing from either Otrabanda and Punda bus stations, including lines 4A, 2A, 2B and 2C serving the airport. Fares range from 2.00 to 2.50 guilders.\n\n\nBridges\n\nThe Queen Emma Bridge, a 168-metre (551 ft)-long pontoon bridge, allows pedestrians to walk between the Punda and Otrobanda districts. The bridge swings open to allow the passage of ships to and from the port. The bridge was originally opened in 1888 and the current bridge was installed in 1939. It is best known and, more often than not, referred to by the locals as \"Our Swinging Old Lady\".\nThe Queen Juliana Bridge carries motor vehicle traffic between the same two districts and its 1974 opening allowed the Queen Emma Bridge to become a pedestrian-only bridge. At 185 feet (56 m) above the sea, the Queen Juliana Bridge is one of the highest bridges in the Caribbean.\n\n\nUtilities and sanitation\nAqualectra, a government-owned company and a full member of CARILEC, delivers potable water and electricity to the island. Rates are controlled by the government. Water is produced by reverse osmosis or desalinization. It services 69,000 households and companies using 130,000 water and electric meters. The power generation company NuCuraçao opened wind farms in Tera Kora and Playa Kanoa in 2012, and expanded in Tera Kora in 2015. There is no natural gas distribution grid; gas is supplied to homes by pressurized containers.\nCurbside trash pickup is provided by the Selikor company. There is no recycling pickup, but there are drop-off centers for certain recycled materials at the Malpais landfill, and various locations operated by Green Force; private haulers recycle construction waste, paper, and cardboard.\n\n\nNotable residents\n\n\nSee also\n\nLeeward Antilles\nTelecommunications in Curaçao\nReligion in Curaçao\nHistory of the Jews in Curaçao\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nHabitantenan di Kòrsou, sinku siglo di pena i gloria: 1499–1999.

    "summary": "Curaçao, officially the Country of Curaçao, is a constituent island country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, located in the southern Caribbean Sea (specifically the Dutch Caribbean region), about 65 km (40 mi) north of Venezuela and 80 km (50 mi) southeast of Aruba. Curaçao includes the main island of Curaçao, and the much smaller, uninhabited island of Klein Curaçao (\"Little Curaçao\").\nCuraçao has a population of 158,665 (January 2019 estimate), with an area of 444 km2 (171 sq mi); its capital is Willemstad. Together with Aruba and Bonaire, Curaçao forms part of the ABC islands. Collectively, Curaçao, Aruba, and other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. It is the largest of the ABC islands in terms of both area and population.\nThe island's name \"Curaçao\" may originate from the indigenous autonym of its people; this idea is supported by early Spanish accounts referring to the inhabitants as \"Indios Curaçaos\". Curaçao's history begins with the Arawak and Caquetio Amerindians; the island becoming a Spanish colony after Alonso de Ojeda's 1499 expedition. Though labelled \"the useless island\" due to its poor agricultural yield and lack of precious metals, it later became a strategic cattle ranching area. When the Dutch colonized the island in 1634, they shifted the island's focus to trade and shipping, and later made it a hub of the Atlantic slave trade. Members of the Jewish community, fleeing persecution in Europe, settled here and significantly influenced the economy and culture.\nBritish forces occupied Curaçao twice during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars but it was returned to Dutch rule. The abolition of slavery in 1863 led to economic shifts and migrations. Dutch remains the official language, though Papiamentu, English, and Spanish are widely spoken, reflecting the island's diverse cultural influences. Curaçao was formerly part of the Curaçao and Dependencies colony from 1815 to 1954, and later the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 2010, as Island Territory of Curaçao.\nThe discovery of oil in the Maracaibo Basin in 1914 transformed Curaçao into a major refinery location, altering its economic landscape. There were efforts towards becoming a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands; the island achieved autonomy in 2010.",

His brother was the namesake of the infamous Egan's Rats.\nThe son of an Irish-American saloonkeeper, Egan was born and raised in the Kerry Patch, then known as the riverfront Irish ghetto of St. Louis. By his teens, Willie had followed his older brother Thomas into the Kinney Gang. By the time Tom took over the street gang in 1904, nineteen-year-old Willie was one of his best men. The Rats, at this point in time, specialized in political terrorism, armed robbery, extortion, and bootlegging. With the murder of Egan gangster Sam Young on April 4, 1909, Willie Egan inherited his saloon at the corner of Fourteenth and Franklin streets, which would remain a gang headquarters for over ten years.\nGenerally quiet and reserved, Willie was nonetheless a tough street fighter who proved himself time and time again in action. However, Willie wasn't as passionate and gregarious as his older brother Tom was. When original Egan's Rat William \"Skippy\" Rohan was gunned down in Tom's saloon on January 8, 1916, Tom Egan made plans to kill the shooter, Rat gangster Harry \"Cherries\" Dunn. Willie successfully argued from Dunn's life, only to have \"Cherries\" go berserk later that year, killing Egan allies for trivial reasons. Willie tracked his former pal to the Typo Press Club on the night of September 19, 1916 and watched as two of his men shot and killed Dunn. This touched off a gang war with the remnant of the old Bottoms Gang, a longtime rival of the Egan's Rats. The Egans would ultimately prevail, eliminating the Bottoms Gang once and for all.\nUpon Tom Egan's 1919 death, Willie took control of the Egan mob. He served as a constable under Judge Andy Gazzolo and a member of the Democratic City Committee. His right-hand man, William \"Dint\" Colbeck, served as his sergeant-at-arms. While Willie tried to maintain the gang's bootlegging rackets, the younger members, known as \"red hots\", began looking to high-risk robberies as a source of income.\nWillie Egan split with his long-time friend, Max Greenberg, when Maxie chiseled Egan out of a whiskey shipment. While the two conversed on a downtown street corner on March 11, 1921, a gunman appeared out of nowhere and began shooting. Greenberg was shot through the face and another man, John Sweeney, was killed. Willie Egan himself was shot in the arm. It was widely believed that Willie engineered the attempt of Maxie's life. After recovering and boasting connections to New York bootlegger Arnold Rothstein, Max Greenberg signed on with the Hogan Gang.\nWhile standing out in front of his Franklin Avenue saloon on Halloween night, 1921, Willie Egan was fatally shot by gunmen in a passing automobile. It was said he gasped the names of his killers to Dint Colbeck, who rushed to his aid just after the shooting. Colbeck announced to his men that the shooters were James Hogan, John Doyle, and Luke Kennedy. The ensuing gang war rocked St. Louis and claimed well over a dozen lives (including those of Doyle and Kennedy).\n\n\nFurther reading\nWaugh, Daniel.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=55878828",
    "text": "Every year, dozens of derelict boats from North Korea wash up on Japanese shores, some carrying the remains of their crew. These \"ghost ships\" are believed to result when North Korean fishermen are lost at sea and succumb to exposure or starvation. The fishermen often have to travel far out to sea to catch fish due to China's overfishing in North Korean waters.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nFishing is a dangerous occupation worldwide; for example, the work-related fatality rate for Australian fishermen in one study was 143 per 100,000 man-hours, which was 18 times the Australian national average work-related fatality rate. During the winter, North Korean fishing boats go out searching for king crab, squid and sandfish. Some of the boats appear to be either operated by soldiers or rented by the army to civilians. Fish is one of the main exports from North Korea to China. Wreckage from North Korean boats often washes ashore in northern Japan during winter due to seasonal winds.\nShips washing up without living crewmen typically are old, lack powerful modern engines, and have no GPS. A lack of food may play a role in crew death; with little food on board, exposure and starvation can become significant dangers. Sources in Wajima said the unclaimed bodies are cremated and their ashes stored in a Buddhist compound. The boats are dismantled, destroyed and incinerated.\nScholars such as John Nilsson-Wright of Chatham House find it unlikely that the boats resulted from attempts to defect; given that South Korea has closer cultural and linguistic ties, and is closer to North Korea by boat than Japan is, defection via Japan rather than South Korea by boat is uncommon. An analyst quoted by the South China Morning Post said it is unlikely vessels are being used to infiltrate North Korean agents into Japan, as it would be easier for them to use fake passports and put the agents aboard a flight or a ferry ship to Japan. \nFishing boats with living crew have also washed up on Japanese shores. In November 2017, eight North Korean men and a broken boat were found on Japan's northern coast; the men said they had washed ashore after their boat broke down. There are a few, rare, precedents for defectors ending up near Japan. In 1987, eleven defectors drifted from North Korea to west Japan. In 2006, four defectors floated to northern Japan. In September 2011, nine defectors accidentally made a five-day voyage to Japanese waters in a small boat while attempting to travel to South Korea.\n\n\nChinese illegal fishing explanation\n\nChinese commercial fishermen have engaged in large-scale squid fishing in North Korean waters in violation of U.N. sanctions which prohibit foreign fishing vessels from fishing in North Korean waters. The Chinese squid fishing fleet in North Korean waters has at times numbered up to 800 vessels and has caused a 70% decline in squid stock in those waters. According to Global Fisheries Watch “This is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation’s waters.” The decline in the squid stocks as a result of this illegal fishing is also believed to be a contributing factor to the increase in North Korean ghost ships. This is believed to have forced North Korean fishermen to venture further from shore and stay out longer, greatly increasing the risks of an already risky job. The so-called “dark fleet” of Chinese vessels has harvested half a billion dollars' worth of squid in North Korean waters since 2017.\n\n\nStatistics\n2011 – First year for which official data is available from the Japanese Coast Guard; the counts from previous years may be similar, but no pre-2011 data is currently available. 57 boats reported in 2011; number of bodies is not disclosed. Because each piece of wreckage is counted as a separate incident, the number of boats may be overstated. Most are believed to be North Korean in origin, due to the typical lettering, the primitive nature of the boats, and occasionally other clues; however, it cannot be ruled out that some of the boats could be from South Korea or elsewhere.\n2012 – 47 boats reported.\n2013 – 80 boats reported.\n2014 – 65 boats reported.\n2015 – 34 boats reported for the year to date, as of November 27 2015. According to the NHK, the wrecks reported in October and November contain the remains of 25 bodies total. The coast guard stated that the bodies were badly decomposed; one boat contained six skulls, suggesting the boat had been adrift a long time.\n2016 – Around 24 boats reported to reach the Japanese coast, according to Fox News. Sky News reported 66 or more boats, including boats found drifting off the coast.\n2017 – A record 104 boats with at least 31 bodies (and at least 42 survivors) were reported, including a 22-foot wooden boat containing eight skeletonized bodies found in late November. Analysts quoted by Fox News attributed the increase in North Korean ghost ships to North Korean food shortages and to mounting sanctions against Kim Jong Un.\n2018 – 89 boats with 12 bodies were reported for the year to date, as of 13 November 2018.\n2019 – At least 156 boats were reported. In one case, seven bodies washed up on the island of Sado on December 28, 2019.\nNorth Korean ghost ships have also been reported in the Russian Far East.\n\n\nSee also\nFishing industry in North Korea\nFushin-sen\nGhost ships\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\nChina's dark fleet\nIran's ghost fleet\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nTwelve images of derelict North Korean shipwrecks in Russia (2018, www.vl.ru via RFE/RL)",

    "text": "Star Kid (originally titled The Warrior of Waverly Street) is a 1997 American superhero film directed and written by Manny Coto and starring Joseph Mazzello, Richard Gilliland, and Corinne Bohrer.\nIn the film, an ordinary schoolboy acquires an extraterrestrial exoskeletal-suit with its own  artificial intelligence. He melds with the suit and has to adjust to his new superhuman abilities. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $7 million against a $12M budget.\n\n\nPlot\nThe life of a shy, seventh-grader Spencer Griffith, who has a crush on a schoolmate named Michelle Eberhardt, changes one night when he sees a mysterious meteorite, as it crashes down into a nearby junkyard. Sneaking out of his house to investigate, he discovers the meteorite to actually be a small rocket carrying a \"Cybersuit\", a prototype exoskeletal-suit with artificial intelligence from another galaxy. He decides to try it on and melds with it, but requires some time to adjust to the experience, including the new speed and strength, and then starts testing out its various primary functions and abilities, deciding to call it \"Cy\".\nHe proceeds to go around town doing whatever he wants, starting with getting back at bully Manfred \"Turbo\" Bruntley, then saving Michelle and her friends from a damaged Rock-O-Plane and ordering food from a fast-food restaurant drive-thru. He also endures the hilarious antics of trashing part of his house after getting his head stuck inside the refrigerator, discovering the unappealing way that it will allow him to eat his take-out food, and finding a way to pee when it won't let him out to do so.\nMeanwhile, Earth is visited by a Broodwarrior, a member of an alien race of world-conquering insectoids that are currently waging a war against Cy's creator, Tenris De'Thar, and his fellow Trelkins, who developed it as a weapon to turn the tide of the war, but was forced to launch it into space due to a Broodwarrior attack. The Broodwarrior's mission is to find and capture it so his race can analyze it. After first encountering the Broodwarrior, Spencer escapes, forces Cy to let him out, and abandons it, afraid he might not \"live to see his next birthday\" if he \"engages\" the Broodwarrior. Back home, after looking over one of his comic books titled MidKnight Warrior and thinking about what the title character, in his situation, would do, he goes back out to find Cy. He unexpectedly finds himself accompanied by Turbo, who gradually becomes his friend, only to find the Broodwarrior has taken Cy. They head to the junkyard, where it is about to be taken off-world by the Broodwarrior, and create a plan to distract it long enough to allow Spencer to rescue Cy. Spencer does so and begins battling the Broodwarrior.\nDuring the battle, the Broodwarrior gets the upper hand, and Cy is bashed multiple times by the Broodwarrior's mace, severely damaging it, and forcing it to eject Spencer before it goes completely offline. Spencer covers it with scrap metal to hide it from the Broodwarrior, takes a piece of it, and continues to fight the Broodwarrior, who had started trying to chase down Turbo. Spencer confronts the Broodwarrior before getting chased himself and is suddenly cornered inside a junked ice cream truck. Just when the Broodwarrior is about to dispose of Spencer, Turbo finds a control panel and activates the car crusher the truck is sitting in, revealing the chase into it to be part of a trap. Spencer escapes while the truck is compressed into a solid metal cube, killing the Broodwarrior.\nWith the Broodwarrior now destroyed, Spencer and Turbo return to Cy but it appears that they were too late to save it. Just as Spencer begins to lose hope, Tenris De'Thar and a small group of Trelkin soldiers appear from a giant UFO orbiting Earth and quickly repair Cy, reviving it. After Spencer says goodbye to Cy, the head alien soldier gives him a badge for his bravery and courage before their departure back to their home-world, and the long, eventful night finally comes to an end. The next day at school, a now confident Spencer, encouraged by Turbo, starts up a conversation with Michelle.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\nThe film was part of an effort by Trimark to enter into larger films. At the 1995 American Film Market, it was positioned as Trimark's flagship product when it was previewed to foreign distributors under its original title, The Warrior of Waverly Street.\n\n\nRelease\nThe film grossed a domestic total of $7,029,025, making it a box office bomb from its estimated $12 million budget.\n\n\nCritical reception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 43% with an average rating of 5.37/10 based on 14 reviews. In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert (who gave it 3 out of 4 stars) said, \"Star Kid, written and directed by Manny Coto, has a sweet heart and a lot of sly wit, and the symbiosis between boy and cyborg is handled cleverly. For kids of a certain age, it pushes the right buttons.\"\n\n\nHome media\nIn the United States, the film was released on VHS and DVD format in 1998. It was also released on VHS in the UK and is now available on DVD.\n\n\nSoundtrack\nAll tracks (with the exception of the first two tracks) were composed by Nicholas Pike. The soundtrack was released on compact disc by Sonic Images (January 27, 1998) and further released for download through BSX Records (January 29, 2013) with modified cover art.\n\n\nComic\nA prequel was released in comic book form, written by Manny Coto with art by John Stokes. It was published by Dark Horse Comics, first as a two-issue miniseries under the film's original title of The Warrior of Waverly Street in 1996 and later as a one-shot titled Star Kid in 1998.\n\n\nSee also\nList of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nStar Kid at IMDb\nStar Kid at Box Office Mojo\nStar Kid at Rotten Tomatoes",

The tour also saw Malcolm Young step out from the North American legs due to an alcohol problem. During this period, he was replaced by his nephew (and subsequent permanent replacement in 2014), Stevie Young. This was AC/DC's last tour and studio album during the 1980s, and it put them back in the limelight after a small streak of commercially disappointing albums.\nEvery show on the North American leg of the tour began with a heatseeking missile pod rising up into the stage; as the band would open with the song \"Heatseeker\", off the Blow Up Your Video album.\n\n\nReception\nAaron Roberts from the Observer Reporter gave the performance in Pittsburgh a positive review. He opened his review, stating that the energetic band treated the screaming teenage audience to non-stop rock and roll which he claimed was rare in the age of high-tech shows, as Brian Johnson got the audience involved in nearly every song, even the old favorites. He noted that there were mixing problems present earlier at the show, but had gone unnoticed by the audience.

She was 6 years his junior.\n\n\nLife\n\n\nFamily background\nConsort Yi's personal name was Nalanzhu (Chinese: 納蘭珠, pinyin: Nà lán zhū) .She was a Booi Aha of the Plain Yellow Banner by birth.Her family was later a part of  Bordered Yellow Banner.\n\nFather:  Sanguanbao (三官保), served as third rank literary official (侍郎)\nPaternal grandfather: Antamu (安塔穆)\nNine brothers\nDaobao (道保), served as second rank military official (副都统)\nDuopuku (多普库), served as fourth rank military official (左领)\nTepuku (特普库),served as fourth rank military official (左领)\nEpuku (鄂普库), served as fifth rank literary official (郎中)\nTapuku (他普库)\nJinengte (及能特)\nSister:\nBuyinzhu  (Chinese: 布音珠 , pinyin: Bù yīn zhū), Noble Lady (貴人) of the Gorolo clan (郭絡羅氏), Kangxi's concubine and the mother of Princess Kejing and Yinju.\n\n\nKangxi era\nLady Gorolo entered the Forbidden City in 1677 and became a lady-in-waiting.In August of the same year, Lady Gorolo was favoured by Kangxi and became a part of his harem with rank of Concubine Yi. On 5 January 1680, Concubine Yi gave birth to the emperor's 5th son Yinqi. In December 1681, Noble Consort Tong was elevated to Imperial Noble Consort (Chinese: 皇貴妃; Pinyin: huángguìfēi), furthermore Concubine Rong, Concubine Yi, Concubine Hui and Concubine De were elevated to the rank of Consort. On 17 October 1683, Consort Yi gave birth to the emperor's 9th son Yuntang.On  8 June 1685, Consort Yi gave birth to 11th prince Yinzi, her last child, who would die prematurely on 22 August 1696.\nOn 20 August 1699, Concubine Min died and Consort Yi took care of Princess Wenke of the Second Rank. She also raised Princess Kejing, her sister's daughter and Kangxi's 6th daughter.\n\n\nYongzheng era\nThe Kangxi Emperor published an edict during his lifetime that after his death, the princes could bring their elderly mothers to live in their homes, but they still had to go to the palace every month to greet Emperor Yongzheng in person and meet the empress. Therefore, Consort Yi moved to her son, Prince Heng, Yinqi's mansion in June of the first year of Yongzheng.\nOn October 2nd in the eleventh year of Yongzheng (1783), Connsort Yi died in Prince Heng's Mansion. Later, in 1786 she was buried in the Jing Mausoleum, Eastern Qing tombs.\n\n\nTitle\nDuring the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1643–1661)\nLady Gorolo  (郭絡羅氏; from 1660)\nDuring the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722)\nCourt Lady (宮女; from 1677)\nConcubine Yi (宜嬪 ; from August 1677)\nConsort Yi (宜妃; from December 1681)\n\n\nIssue\nAs Concubine Yi:\n\nYunqi, Prince Hengwen of the First Rank (恆溫親王 允祺; 5 January 1680 – 10 July 1732), The emperor's 5th son\nAs Consort Yi:\n\nYuntang, Prince of the Fourth Rank (貝子 允禟; 17 October 1683 – 22 September 1726), the emperor's 9th son\nYinzi (胤禌; 8 June 1685 – 22 August 1696), The emperor's 11th son\n\n\nSee also\nRoyal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty\nImperial Chinese harem system\n\n\nReferences\n\"Manuscripts of Qing History · Biography I · Empresses\"",

He received his Sc.B. from  Brown University in 1962, and his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1966.\nHis work was mainly on the representation of information for storage and transmission, and the placement and movement of such information in computer systems. Specific areas include  constrained coding, compression algorithms, I/O architectures, switching networks, disk defragmentation algorithms, concurrency control techniques, operating system schedulers, and compression techniques and architectures for systems with memory compression. Franaszek's coding research determined fundamental aspects of constrained coding, and obtained algorithms for code construction.  In early work associated with his \"principal\nstate\" technique for block code construction, he designed MS43, a ternary code for data transmission, a modified version of which, MMS43, became a European standard.   His work also served as a basis for key components in the proliferation of disk drives, compact disks (CDs), and digital versatile disks (DVDs). Specific codes he developed have been widely used in commercial data storage and transmission products. His (2,7) RLL code found widespread application in disk drives in the 1980s and later in magnetic and optical recording applications. Together with Albert Widmer, he designed 8b/10b encoding used in gigabit telecommunication systems.  As an emeritus, he, along with B.Abali and L.
