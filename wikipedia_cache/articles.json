    "text": "The Apollo program was a United States human spaceflight program carried out from 1961 to 1972 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which landed the first astronauts on the Moon. The program used the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles to lift the Command/Service Module (CSM) and Lunar Module (LM) spacecraft into space, and the Little Joe II rocket to test a launch escape system which was expected to carry the astronauts to safety in the event of a Saturn failure. Uncrewed test flights beginning in 1966 demonstrated the safety of the launch vehicles and spacecraft to carry astronauts, and four crewed flights beginning in October 1968 demonstrated the ability of the spacecraft to carry out a lunar landing mission.\nApollo achieved the first crewed lunar landing on the Apollo 11 mission, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their LM Eagle in the Sea of Tranquility and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the CSM Columbia, and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969. Five subsequent missions landed astronauts on various lunar sites, ending in December 1972 with twelve men having walked on the Moon and 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil samples returned to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history.\nTwo Apollo missions were failures: a 1967 cabin fire killed the entire Apollo 1 crew during a ground test in preparation for what was to be the first crewed flight; and the third landing attempt on Apollo 13 was aborted by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, which disabled the CSM Odyssey's electrical power and life support systems, and made the propulsion system unsafe to use. The crew circled the Moon and were returned safely to Earth using the LM Aquarius as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions.\n\n\nUncrewed test flights\nFrom 1961 through 1967, Saturn launch vehicles and Apollo spacecraft components were tested in uncrewed flights.\n\n\nSaturn I\nThe Saturn I launch vehicle was originally planned to carry crewed Command Module flights into low Earth orbit, but its 20,000-pound (9,100 kg) payload capacity limit could not lift even a partially fueled Service Module, which would have required building a lightweight retrorocket module for deorbit. These plans were eventually scrapped in favor of using the uprated Saturn IB to launch the Command Module with a half-fueled Service Module for crewed Earth orbit tests. This limited Saturn I flights to Saturn launch vehicle development, CSM boilerplate testing, and three Pegasus micrometeoroid satellite missions in support of Apollo.\n\nThere was some incongruity in the numbering and naming of the first three uncrewed Apollo-Saturn (AS) or Apollo flights. This is due to AS-204 being renamed to Apollo 1 posthumously. This crewed flight was to have followed the first three uncrewed flights. After the fire which killed the AS-204 crew on the pad during a test and training exercise, uncrewed Apollo flights resumed to test the Saturn V launch vehicle and the Lunar Module; these were designated Apollo 4, 5 and 6. The first crewed Apollo mission was thus Apollo 7. Simple \"Apollo\" numbers were never assigned to the first three uncrewed flights, although renaming AS-201, AS-202, and AS-203 as Apollo 1-A, Apollo 2 and Apollo 3, had been briefly considered.\n\n\nSaturn IB\nThe Saturn I was converted to the Uprated Saturn I, eventually designated Saturn IB, by replacing the S-IV second stage with the S-IVB, which would also be used as the third stage of the Saturn V with the addition of on-orbit restart capability. This increased the payload capacity to 46,000 pounds (21,000 kg), enough to orbit a Command Module with a half-fueled Service Module, and more than enough to orbit a fully fueled Lunar Module.\nTwo suborbital tests of the Apollo Block I Command and Service Module, one S-IVB development test, and one Lunar Module test were conducted. Success of the LM test led to cancellation of a planned second uncrewed flight.\n\n\nLaunch escape system tests\nFrom August 1963 to January 1966, a number of tests were conducted at the White Sands Missile Range for development of the launch escape system (LES). These included simulated \"pad aborts\", which might occur while the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle was still on the launch pad, and flights on the Little Joe II rocket to simulate Mode I aborts which might occur while the vehicle was in the air.\n\n\nSaturn V\nPrior to George Mueller's tenure as NASA's Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight starting in 1963, it was assumed that 20 Saturn Vs, with at least 10 unpiloted test flights, would be required to achieve a crewed Moon landing, using the conservative one-stage-at-a-time testing philosophy used for the Saturn I. But Mueller introduced the \"all-up\" testing philosophy of using three live stages plus the Apollo spacecraft on every test flight. This achieved development of the Saturn V with far fewer uncrewed tests, enabling a Moon landing by the 1969 goal. The size of the Saturn V production lot was reduced from 20 to 15 units.\nThree uncrewed test flights were planned to human-rate the super heavy-lift Saturn V which would take crewed Apollo flights to the Moon. Success of the first flight and qualified success of the second led to the decision to cancel the third uncrewed test.\n\n\nAlphabetical mission types\nThe Apollo program required sequential testing of several major mission elements in the runup to a crewed lunar landing. An alphabetical list of major mission types was proposed by Owen Maynard in September 1967. Two \"A-type\" missions performed uncrewed tests of the CSM and the Saturn V, and one B-type mission performed an uncrewed test of the LM.  The C-type mission, the first crewed flight of the CSM in Earth orbit, was performed by Apollo 7.\nThe list was revised upon George Low's proposal to commit a mission to lunar orbit ahead of schedule, an idea influenced by the status of the CSM as a proven craft and production delays of the LM. Apollo 8 was reclassified from its original assignment as a D-type mission, a test of the complete CSM/LM spacecraft in Earth orbit, to a \"C-prime\" mission which would fly humans to the Moon.  Once complete, it obviated the need for the E-type objective of a medium Earth orbital test.  The D-type mission was instead performed by Apollo 9; the F-type mission, Apollo 10, flew the CSM/LM spacecraft to the Moon for final testing, without landing.  The G-type mission, Apollo 11, performed the first lunar landing, the central goal of the program.\nThe initial A–G list was expanded to include later mission types:  H-type missions—Apollo 12, 13 (planned) and 14—would perform precision landings, and J-type missions—Apollo 15, 16 and 17—would perform thorough scientific investigation.  The I-type objective, which called for extended lunar orbital surveillance of the Moon, was incorporated into the J-type missions.\n\n\nCrewed missions\nThe Block I CSM spacecraft did not have capability to fly with the LM, and the three crew positions were designated Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot, based on U.S. Air Force pilot ratings. The Block II spacecraft was designed to fly with the Lunar Module, so the corresponding crew positions were designated Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot regardless of whether a Lunar Module was present or not on any mission.\nSeven of the missions involved extravehicular activity (EVA), spacewalks or moonwalks outside of the spacecraft. These were of three types: testing the lunar EVA suit in Earth orbit (Apollo 9), exploring the lunar surface, and retrieving film canisters from the Scientific Instrument Module stored in the Service Module.\n\n\nCanceled missions\n\nSeveral planned missions of the Apollo program were canceled for a variety of reasons, including changes in technical direction, the Apollo 1 fire, hardware delays, and budget limitations.\n\nBefore the Apollo 1 fire, two crewed Block I spacecraft missions were planned, but then it was decided that the second one would give no more information about the spacecraft performance not obtained from the first, and could not carry out extra activities such as EVA, and was canceled.\nThe Saturn V's all-up testing strategy and relatively good success rate accomplished the first Moon landing on the sixth flight, leaving ten available for Moon landings through Apollo 20, but waning public interest in the program led to decreased Congressional funding, forcing NASA to economize. First, Apollo 20 was cut to make a Saturn V available to launch the Skylab space station whole instead of building it on-orbit using multiple Saturn IB launches. Eight months later, Apollo 18 and 19 were also cut to further economize, and because of fears of increased chance of failure with a large number of lunar flights.\n\n\nSee also\nThere were two NASA post-Apollo crewed spaceflight programs that used Apollo hardware:\n\nSkylab § Mission designations – space laboratory missions lasting up to 83 days\nApollo–Soyuz – first joint US / Soviet crewed spaceflight\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\nBibliography\nHallion, Richard P.; Crouch, Tom D.

    "text": "Crime Boss: Rockay City is a 2023 cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Ingame Studios and published by 505 Games. The player assembles a team of criminals and is sent on missions to infiltrate, steal, and defeat enemies in shooter gameplay. The game features a cast of prominent actors including Michael Madsen (in his final performance for a video game), Chuck Norris, Danny Trejo, Danny Glover, Michael Rooker, Kim Basinger, Vanilla Ice, and Damion Poitier.\nThe game was initially released for Windows through the Epic Games Store on 28 March 2023. It was later released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 June 2023 and for Steam on 18 June 2024. It received mixed reviews from critics. \n\n\nGameplay\nCrime Boss: Rockay City is focused around missions undertaken by teams of four criminals.  The player controls one of the criminals and cooperates with either other players or AI-controlled teammates to pull off heists in a first-person perspective.  The gameplay has frequently been compared to the Payday series of games.  The players need to collect enough loot from the target (banks, trucks, jewelry stores, etc.), but the longer they take, the greater the likelihood of police reinforcements arriving.  \nThere are several ways that the missions are set up.  The simplest option is as quick play one-offs.  There are also six mini-campaigns of three missions chained in a row with a loose connecting story for each called \"Urban Legends\". There is a single-player campaign with roguelike elements where the player attempts to expand their territory across Rockay City after the previous leader of the underground dies.  The player allocates gang members to fight turf wars, buys new weapons, and goes on missions to attempt to take new territory—but if the player character dies in a mission, their quest to become Crime Boss is over.  In the same way, hired crew members who die or are arrested on missions are also lost forever.\nThe feel of the game is consciously imitative of 1990s crime movies such as Heat.  Rockay City itself is set in a Florida reminiscent of Miami Vice.\n\n\nDevelopment and release\nCrime Boss is the first game produced by Ingame Studios, a new developer of around 70 employees based in Brno, Czech Republic.\nThe game released in late March 2023 exclusively to the Epic Games Store for PC.  It was later released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2023.  The game was released on Steam on 18 June 2024, alongside the \"Cagnali's Order\" DLC that features a corporation's robot cops helping the police.\n\n\nReception\n\nCrime Boss: Rockay City received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics for the PC and Xbox Series X/S versions, while the PS5 version received \"generally unfavorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Metacritic listed the PlayStation 5 version the sixth worst game of 2023. In Japan, four critics from Famitsu gave the game a total score of 30 out of 40.\nMany of the reviews wrote that most of the hired voice cast, despite their fame in movies, put in underwhelming performances.  Another complaint common to most reviews was that the stealth system to the game was overly finicky and not well-supported, with the game eventually prompting players to get to the shooting regardless of how carefully an attempt at a stealthy approach was made.  Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun said the game was a worse Payday, already a twelve-year old game in 2023. Wesley LeBlanc of Game Informer was harsh, saying the gameplay was buggy and boring, and that the plot and characters were poorly written. He gave the game a mere 3/10 overall score.   Cory Wells of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a cautiously positive review, warning that the game was neither exactly like Payday nor an open-world freeform game in the vein of the Grand Theft Auto series that many expected, but that gamers who didn't mind repetition would find a solid basic gameplay experience in the heists. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku was derisive, writing that Crime Boss \"gets absolutely everything it sets out to do wrong\".  Writing a month after the PC release in April 2023, he said that the game had attracted little comment and notice on the Internet, even negative, and noted the lack of a Steam release as a potential reason why.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Ballygar (Irish: Béal Átha Ghártha) is a village in County Galway, Ireland. It is 19 km from Roscommon town.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nName and origins\nThe name Ballygar, historically Beallagarr, comes from Irish: Béal Átha Ghártha. The settlement has been a meeting point of the McDermott clan and trading centre throughout the centuries and was recorded as a townland and farm as far back as 1585.\nAlthough the townland and farm are recorded as far back as 1585, it was not until the 1820s that it became a centre of population. On 6 August 1585, the chieftains and landowners of Galway and Roscommon were summoned to a meeting with the Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot, in Galway city. The object of the meeting was to get the landowners and chieftains to surrender their lands to Elizabeth I and then receive them back from the Crown at a rent of one penny an acre. The landowners accepted the terms, and one of the signatories to that document of surrender was Francis Shane, gent, of Ballygar, possibly the proprietor of Ballygar Castle at the time.\n\n\nBallygar Castle\nThe next mention of Ballygar is in the Book of Survey Distribution; this shows the Earl of St Albans as being the beneficial owner of the land of Bealagara in Killeroran Parish in 1641. He was dispossessed of this land and Ballygar Castle. It was subsequently granted to the Earl of Clanricarde. A garrison was stationed in Ballygar Castle during the rebellion of the 1640s. Ballygar Castle seems to have disappeared from the scene in the early 18th century. A document, dated 1704, shows the Clanricarde family as having leased Ballygar Farm plus parts of Drinaun and Killeroran, 800 acres (3.2 km2) in all, to Edward Donnellan of Streamstown, Co Westmeath, for two lives i.e. sixty-two years at a rent of two shillings per acre per year. In 1820, a toll market was established near the main entrance to Castle Kelly by Denis Henry Kelly who owned 13,500 acres (55 km2) of the surrounding countryside.\n\n\nA Market Town - 1840\nThe market was a success from the beginning and around this, the thriving market town of Ballygar grew. By 1840 Ballygar market was said to be second only to the Athlone market in the volume of trade. According to the census of 1841, there was a population of 5,300 living on the Kelly estate. As the market grew, so did the demand for shops and dwellings. Denis had these built and leased them to suitable tenants. Twenty years after its foundation Ballygar had 52 houses and a population of 363. It is not known whether Denis was a teetotaller or not, but there were only two public houses in Ballygar in 1839. One of these was located near J. Curley's shop, the other was situated where T. Hanley's drapery shop is now. The town was planned in an orderly fashion, a wide main street, a market square, a diamond at the main entrance to his estate and two back streets to give access to the rear of all premises.\nDenis believed in keeping his town tidy, and, to this end, he visited every house in town on the first day of the month. If the house or shop was being kept clean and tidy he issued the tenant with a cleanliness ticket, and at the end of the year the tenant with the most tickets received a prize of £1.10s; the next prize was 10s.6d. All the tenants who had received tickets were invited to have dinner with him in Castle Kelly\nAnother innovation introduced to Ballygar in 1835 was the Reproductive Loan Fund. This was a non-profit-making organisation, and tenants had access to the fund in times of hardship. It was run on much the same lines as the Credit Union. In 1844, £1,000 of the loan fund was in circulation in the locality. The loan office was situated on Main Street where Clarke's Hardware is now.\n\n\nKilleroran Graveyard and other developments\nThe Great Famine, 1845–1850, with all its hardships, hunger and deprivation brought a halt to the rapid development of the town, but not for long. Griffith's Valuation 1855 shows Ballygar as having 67 houses, Police Barracks, a Parochial School House, Dispensary and Protestant Church. The late 1850s saw further building development in the town and locality. A new Parochial School was built in the market square and a new Catholic Church a year later. About this time also the market house, a six-storey building of cut stone was erected on the market square. By the end of the decade, a 93-foot stone tower was erected in Killeroran Graveyard, the Courthouse was built, also the Grand Bridge, a magnificent cut-stone structure which spans the river that flows through Castle Kelly. The construction of the bridge alone is said to have cost £1,000 in 1859.\nThe building programme mustn't have been as rewarding as Denis Kelly expected, for in 1863 we find the entire Kelly estate being offered for sale by the courts, under the Encumbered Estates Act. Denis retired to Araghty Grange, a small estate he owned near Athleague. He died in 1877 and is buried in the old Church in Killeroran. The Kelly estate, 12,000 acres (49 km2) complete with Castle and town, was bought by Christopher Neville Bagott for £105,000.\n\n\nBagott family\nThe Bagott family seemed to have played a very passive role in the life of the area, other than to collect rents due. The owner, Christopher, spent very little time on the estate and left the management to his two brothers, Charlie and John. Christopher himself bought a house in a fashionable part of London and entertained fairly lavishly. Through these parties, he came to know a young society lady of great charm and beauty by the name of Alice Verner. Within a short time, they were married – believed to be in 1874. In due course, a son was born to them. Mrs Christopher Bagott continued to have a high life and relations between herself and her husband soon became strained. They returned to Castlekelly in 1876, and sometime later he banished her and their young son from his home. He now drew up a will leaving his entire estate to his brother John Bagott. His health failed rapidly and he died in May 1877. Mrs Bagott contested the last will made by her husband, and a much-publicised trial ensued at the Probate Court in Dublin. The trial lasted for a month and the court found in favour of Mrs Bagott and her son. The Court administered the estate on their behalf until the young heir came of age. The entire estate was offered for sale in 1903. The Land Commission was the purchaser, and later the Forestry Commission acquired Castlekelly and the 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) surrounding it.\n\n\nThe Great Famine (An Gorta Mór)\nThe population structure of Ballygar Parish (Killeroran and Killian) has been like most other parts of rural Ireland in steady decline since the Great Famine of 1845. The Great Famine or An Gorta Mór as it has become known, of 1845 had a devastating effect on Ireland, and Ballygar didn't escape the horror that resulted from the failure of the main food crop, the potato, throughout the years of 1845 to 1849. Few details survive of An Gorta Mór even though it is of relatively recent origin, one hundred and sixty years ago. For it would seem that the details were too horrific and painful for the local people to recall even in local folklore stories. The story of how hundreds of local people, mostly peasant rural dwellers, died of starvation, remains unrecorded. Probably the greatest tragedy of all surrounding An Gorta Mór was the sale by farming communities of large amounts of eggs and animals in order to pay rent to their local landlord, while they themselves, and their neighbours, were dying of starvation.\nThe Gorta Mór for the first time ever forced Ballygar people to think about large-scale emigration. From the years 1845 to 1850, local farming communities started to emigrate en masse. It would seem that initially they left not just in ones and twos, but in large groups, mainly for America and Australia. It now seems that it must have been on a par with some of the emigration we see from famine-torn regions in Africa during the present time.\nIn a well-researched piece on Trihill National School, Norma Hoilean records how the residents of one townland Bohill all emigrated on the same day. It must have been a horrific day in Bohill – with the entire community of old and young taking with them their meagre belongings and heading off to locate one of the coffin ships in Cobh or Galway. Unfortunately, nobody has any idea of whatever happened to them, but it can only be assumed that some of them at least reached \"the promised land\". As an illustration of this, it is recorded that thirteen entire families from Cork Unitarian Church left Cork on the same boat to Australia in 1847.\nThe exodus from the area to the U.S. continued throughout the latter part of the 19th century and indeed for much of the first part of the twentieth. It was this exodus of people from Ballygar, which resulted in virtually every family in the parish of today having a set of relatives in some part of America.\nA feature of the Gorta Mór was that few people were prepared to talk about it afterwards, and few stories survive even in local folklore about the event. It would seem that the death of families or family members from starvation was associated with poverty that relatives refused to talk about afterwards. In a field owned by Martin \"Prince\" Kelly in the village of Ballinacor, there are five simple graves adjacent to a sandpit – one of the graves has a number of simple field stones surrounding it. It seems likely that famine victims were buried here without ceremony and possibly without a priest being present.\n\n\n1860 to 1890\nPractically no expansion took place in Ballygar town from 1860 to 1891. The census of 1891 shows it as having 69 houses and a population of 289. Then for some reason, the first decade of this century saw a great increase in the population of the town, from 289 to 403, an increase of about 35%. Eleven houses were built in the town in that decade.\n\n\nAmenities\nThe village is the home of a number of businesses, shops, grocers, and butchers. One of these shops, in existence for many generations, is now the property of the Kilgarriff family. The shop was a general store and meeting place in the village.\nMany families can be traced back to having been living in the area as far back as 1749 (as far back as reliable records go). These families include Lohan, Martin, Egan, Finneran, Flynn, Galvin, Keane, Mulrey, Mulvey, Geraghty, Healy, Nolan, Kelly, Fischer, Devine, Doyle, Brannelly and Hannon, families.\nIn 2003 the village welcomed the Afghanistan Special Olympics team whilst they competed in the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games.\nBallygar Carnival has been an annual event since 1945. Entertainment events and the carnival include dancing, discos, a fun fair, street entertainment, fancy dress, country fair, pig races, and sports tournaments.\n\n\nEconomy and culture\nEstablished in 1977, Murray Timber Products Limited has grown to become one of the largest sawmills in Ireland.\nThe public library in Ballygar is open every Tuesday and Saturday morning and on Fridays in the afternoon. It provides a reference and local studies collection with information on the heritage and history of the area.\n\n\nNotable residents\nMattie McDonagh, Galway footballer, and the only Connacht man to win four All-Ireland Senior Football medals.\nPatrick Sarsfield Gilmore who wrote many songs, including When Johnny Comes Marching Home\n\n\nTownlands\nTownlands in Ballygar include Mucanagh (the ford of the pigs) on the Galway side of the River Suck. \nKnown for its coarse fishing and wildlife hunting, the local River Suck is the home to bream, perch and pike fishing while the faster moving Shiven is regarded for wild trout.\nMucanagh is liable to flooding though this is disregarded by many locals who use tractors or four-wheel drives into or out of the townland. The dredging of the Suck in the 1970s never had the anticipated results.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Sandwich (1928 – after 1941) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse that won the classic St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in 1931, for owner Earl of Rosebery. By 1931, Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery had died, making this a win for his son, Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery.  Sandwich was a half-brother to Manna, winner of the 1925 Epsom Derby, and as well as his 1931 St Leger success also won the Chester Vase and King Edward VII Stakes.\n\n\nBackground\nSandwich was a bay stallion, bred in Great Britain by the Irish breeder, James J. Maher. He was sired by the 1924 Epsom Derby winner, Sansovino. His dam Waffles was unraced but had previously produced the Derby winner Manna. As a yearling, he was purchased by Lord Rosebery for 3,600 guineas and was sent to trainer Jack Jarvis.\n\n\nRacing career\n\n\nTraining\nAs part of the Rosebery stable, Sandwich was trained by Jack Jarvis. Jarvis was noted for being the first trainer to be knighted for his service and contribution to horse racing. Jarvis' reputation for training horses was to work them hard, and he found success with his approach.\n\n\nRacing\nSandwich was slow to mature and after finishing unplaced in his only races as a juvenile in 1930 he was well beaten in both the Craven Stakes and the 2000 Guineas the following spring. When moved up in distance he showed immediate improvement: in May, ridden by Billy Nevett, he won the Chester Vase, a major trial race for the Epsom Derby.\nIn June Sandwich, ridden by Harry Wragg he started at odds of 8/1 for the Derby. After being hampered early in the race and losing his position he finished strongly to take third behind Cameronian and Orpen. Jarvis said that the colt was \"beaten by the bad draw\". Later that month he won the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot at odds of 1/3. When matched against older horses for the first time in the Eclipse Stakes he finished third behind the 25/1 outsider Caerleon.\nThe St. Leger race is the oldest of the five British Classic races, the last in the year to be run, and it is also the longest. In this race in 1931, Sandwich was again ridden by Wragg, nicknamed \"The Head Waiter.\" Sandwich's win in the St Leger was considered by some to be an upset as he bested the favorite, Cameronian, who was at the time making a run at the final leg of the British Triple Crown. Cameronian finished last in the field.\nSandwich remained in training as a four-year-old and was expected to be a leading contender in the \"Cup races\" (major weight-for-age staying events). He failed to live up to expectations but did win The Whip at Newmarket Racecourse and finished third under a weight of 131 pounds in the Cesarewitch.\n\n\nStud record\nAt the end of his racing career, Sandwich was retired to stud but was a complete failure as a breeding stallion. He was sold and exported to Brazil in 1941.\n\n\nNamesake\nThe London & North Eastern Railway A3 class locomotive 2504 was named after the horse. Built at Doncaster Works in September 1934, it was withdrawn by British Rail in March 1963.\n\n\nPedigree\n\nSandwich was inbred 4 × 4 to Isinglass and Pilgrimage, meaning that these stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. Furthermore, there is a 3 × 4 inbreeding to St Simon.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nGondolette at Thoroughbred Heritage\nSansovino at Thoroughbred Heritage\nSwynford at Thoroughbred Heritage",

Fuchs had been working with John Almen on new applications for shot peening of automobiles and military equipment companies produced before and during World War II. Fuchs and Almen worked at the Research Laboratory of General Motors Corporation before the start of MIC. The Almen strip or Almen system, a tool for duplicating the shot peening process, was named after John Almen.\nFuchs started in his garage accompanied by his son-in-law, Fred Landecker. The aircraft industry first began to use the shot peening processes.\nHenry Fuchs died in 1989. He was a Professor Emeritus of Stanford University. The Society of Automotive Engineers named an award \"Henry O. Fuchs\" in his honor.\nIn the 1950s, the company worked on the wing skins of Lockheed Super Constellation aircraft and the Douglas DC-3 aircraft. In 1968 the company was acquired by Curtiss-Wright which had begun an expansion program at its Buffalo extrusion facility, adding new forging and machining equipment for building aircraft and aerospace components.\nAt the end of the 1990s Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, working under a government contract for a laser to illuminate passing satellites, developed a process of peening with light with enough power to use it also for commercial purposes. Metal Improvement Company, under a CRADA agreement with Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, began to develop  this technology for commercial customers and in 2003 the company introduced the laser peening to the market.

    "title": "DeBoer v. Snyder",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=39983631",
    "text": "DeBoer v. Snyder is a lawsuit that was filed by April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse on January 23, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, challenging Michigan's ban on adoption by same-sex couples so they can jointly adopt their children. In August 2012, Judge Bernard A. Friedman invited the couple to amend their suit to challenge the state's ban on same-sex marriage, \"the underlying issue\". Following a hearing on October 16, 2013, Friedman scheduled a trial that ran from February 25 to March 7, 2014. On March 21, Judge Friedman issued his ruling overturning the ban. On March 22, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit placed a temporary hold on Judge Friedman's ruling. The appeal was argued on August 6. On November 6, the Sixth Circuit reversed Judge Friedman and upheld Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage.\nThe decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which, on January 16, 2015, consolidated this case with three others and agreed to review the case. Oral arguments were heard on April 28, 2015, and the Supreme Court struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban on June 26, 2015.\n\n\nBackground\nOn January 23, 2012, a lesbian couple filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of themselves and three children, challenging the state's ban on adoption by same-sex couples so they can jointly adopt their children. The women are April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, both nurses. One has an adopted son and the other two adopted daughters, all with special needs. At the time of filing, Michigan law restricted second-parent adoption to married couples and did not license or recognize same-sex marriages.\nIn August 2012, Judge Bernard A. Friedman invited the couple to amend their suit to challenge the state's ban on same-sex marriage, \"the underlying issue\". They did so on September 7, 2012. To the original defendants, the governor and attorney-general of Michigan, they added the Oakland County Clerk.\nThe plaintiffs were originally represented by three private attorneys, Dana Nessel, Carole Stanyar and Kenneth M. Mogill, along with Wayne State University Distinguished Professor of Law Robert A. Sedler, an experienced litigator in civil rights cases. In January 2014, attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders joined them.\n\n\nHearing and trial\nOn March 7, 2013, after hearing arguments in the case, Friedman announced that he would delay ruling pending the outcome of two same-sex marriage cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. National LGBT advocacy groups had recommended the delay. On July 1, citing the recent Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, he denied the state officials' motion to dismiss the suit. Friedman heard arguments on motions in the case on October 16, 2013, and said he was unable to rule on the basis of the arguments. He said: \"I'm in the middle. I have to decide this as a matter of law. I intend to do so.\" An attorney for one of the defendants, Oakland County Clerk Lisa Brown, said she was eager to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples as soon as the law allowed her to do so. At the end of that hearing, Friedman scheduled the trial for February 25, 2014. On a motion by the plaintiffs, and over the objections of the defense, Friedman agreed on January 3, 2014, to divide the trial in two, reserving for a second phase, if needed, all discussion of the level of scrutiny appropriate to Michigan's denial of adoption and marriage rights to same-sex couples.\n\n\nWitnesses for the plaintiffs\nThe plaintiffs called witnesses from February 25, 2014, to February 28, 2014.\n\nDr. David Brodzinsky\nA psychologist in the San Francisco Bay Area whose research and scholarly writings have focused on psychological issues in gay and lesbian parenting and adoption, adoption and foster care, stress and coping in children, non-traditional family life, child custody issues, and children's cognitive development. He was a founding director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York and currently serves as the Research Director of the Institute's West Coast Office. He has testified in a number of previous cases, including the Baby M contested adoption case in New Jersey, the Baby Jessica case, the Woody Allen and Mia Farrow contested adoption and custody case in New York, and Baehr v. Miike. Brodzinsky testified on February 25, 2014 that there are no \"discernible differences\" in children who are raised by same-sex couples and youth raised by heterosexuals. Under cross-examination by Michigan Assistant Attorney General Joseph Potchen, Brodzinsky acknowledged that studies on the stability of same-sex couples were mixed, with some showing a higher breakup rate among same-sex couples.\nDr. Nancy Cott\nA professor of American history at Harvard University specializing in the history of gender and sexuality has researched gender roles and marriage trends for decades. Dr. Cott has testified for the plaintiffs in both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. Cott offered several examples of discriminatory practices involving marriages over the years which are no longer accepted, among them interracial marriages once being banned, American women who married foreigners once lost their citizenship and property, and the U.S. government at times not acknowledging Native American and Japanese marriages. Cott testified on February 28, 2014 that “The trend is moving toward same-sex gender neutrality/gender equality marriages; and the trend is moving toward same-sex marriages.” She also testified that “The Michigan Marriage Amendment obstructs that trend from continuing.” In explaining how marriage has evolved, Cott cited the 300-year ban on interracial marriage, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. Cott said marriage is a “civil contract” that only be legally sanctioned by legislatures and the courts. In addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage, she said religious authorities have no legal standing over marriages even though they are allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies. Cott testified that there have been no laws in U.S. history that made procreation a requirement for marriage, an argument used by opponents of same-sex marriage. Under cross-examination by state attorney Michelle Brya, Cott admitted the state of Michigan does have an interest in marriage between a man and a woman for population purposes and sometimes economic reasons but did not believe those two issues should stand in the way of same-sex couples legally marrying.\nDr. Gary Gates\nServes as the Williams Distinguished Scholar at the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. His doctoral dissertation included the first significant research study using United States Census data to explore characteristics of same-sex couples. Dr. Gates has been an expert witness in several cases involving LGBT issues. He wrote a brief in support of the plaintiffs in the United States v. Windsor. He has also testified before the United States House Committee on Armed Services on repealing \"Don't ask, don't tell\" and before the United States Senate on LGBT inclusion in federal immigration law reforms. Gates testified on February 27, 2014 that 8.3 million people in the United States identify themselves as LGBT, including 287,000 Michigan residents whose numbers are growing, particularly among individuals under the age of 30 years. He also cited surveys which found 43% of Americans “see nothing wrong” with same-sex relationships compared to 13% in 1990.\nDr. Michael Rosenfeld\nAn associate professor of sociology at Stanford University and a social demographer who studies race, ethnicity, and family structure, the family's effect on children, and the history of the family. Dr. Rosenfeld has examined the study by defense witness Regnerus. Some of the work by defense witness Allen is based on Rosenfeld's work which was based on the United States Census. Rosenfeld testified on February 26, 2014 that \"there is no basis\" for believing that kids develop better in a household led by a man and a woman. Broadly summarizing research in the field, he said \"it’s clear that being raised by same-sex parents is no disadvantage to children.\" While cross-examining Rosenfeld, Assistant Attorney General Kristin Heyse suggested it was rational for voters to approve the same-sex marriage ban nearly 10 years ago because same-sex marriage in the U.S. was just emerging. Rosenfeld’s method of research was questioned by Heyse regarding the sample size used.\nDr. Vivek Sankaran\nA clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan in the Child Advocacy Law Clinic, and Director of the Detroit Center for Family Advocacy. Dr. Sankaran has litigated numerous cases before the Michigan Supreme Court on behalf of parents. He also was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder to the Child Abuse Prevention Board. Sankaran testified on February 26, 2014 that more children would be adopted if same-sex couples had the same joint-adoption rights as married heterosexual couples. He noted that nearly 14,000 children in Michigan’s foster care system need homes, saying that allowing joint adoption by same-sex couples would expand the pool of potential parents for those children, which includes about 3,500 orphans. Sankaran added that if one of them adopts a child as a single person, which the state allows, the other has no legal rights to custody of the child if the other parent dies or is incapacitated.\nDr. George Chauncey, who as a professor of history and American studies at Yale University and co-director of the Yale Research Initiative on the History of Sexualities had previously testified in the LGBT case Hollingsworth v. Perry, was expected to testify but had to cancel. He submitted written testimony.\n\n\nWitnesses for the defense\nThe defense called witnesses from March 3, 2014, to March 6, 2014.\n\nDouglas W. Allen\nAn economist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia who makes ties between same-sex parenting and childhood instability by looking at couples from unstable homes and comparing them to those who have been raised consistently by two heterosexual parents. Allen takes a 2010 study by Michael Rosenfeld - who testified for the plaintiffs, and re-examines it by adding in the outliers. \"We re-examine Rosenfeld's (2010) study on the association between child outcomes and same-sex family structure. Using the same data set, we replicate and generalize Rosenfeld's findings and show that the implications of his study are different when using either alternative comparison groups or alternative sample restrictions. Compared with traditional married households, we find that children being raised by same-sex couples are 35 percent less likely to make normal progress through school; this difference is statistically significant at the one percent level,\" states the brief for Allen's report. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Price and Regnerus urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Allen was the defense's final witness and testified on March 6, 2014 that the state \"should be very cautious in making such a fundamental change to such a fundamental institution when there really isn’t any evidence on the child outcomes.\" Allen argued that although U.S. psychology and sociology organizations have expressed consensus opinions that children of same-sex couples suffer no measurable disadvantages, conflicting results and limited data show that there's no such certainty on the matter. While maintaining he has no bias, he admitted that his religious views lead him to believe that homosexual acts are grounds for being sent to Hell.\nLisa Brown\nA Democrat who was elected Oakland County Clerk & Register of Deeds, a defendant in the case, on November 6, 2012. Brown was previously a member of the Michigan House of Representatives. Brown represented the 39th State House District, located in Central Oakland County since 2009. Although a defendant, Brown testified on March 3, 2014 in favor of same-sex marriage and said her office is ready to issue same-sex marriage licenses.\nSherif Girgis\nAuthor of a book What is Marriage? Man and Woman: A defense and a Ph.D. candidate in philosophy at Princeton University and a law student at Yale University. When Girgis was called to testify on March 3, 2014, Friedman ruled he was not an expert and not qualified to testify.\nLoren Marks\nWorks for the Louisiana State University School of Social Work, and whose research focuses primarily on the role of faith in families. He is known for his criticism of the many studies that look at same gender parenting. He suggests that the American Psychological Association is wrong for citing studies with less than 100 participants. Marks pre-released his study in order for it to be included in Hollingsworth v. Perry, and though he was scheduled to testify in favor of California's Proposition 8, he was not called. Marks testified on March 5, 2014 and criticized a 2005 American Psychological Association study that found there was no difference in the outcomes of children raised by gay and lesbian parents. He said the studies the APA used to frame its report did not include enough heterosexual couples and there were too few gay fathers represented. Under cross-examination by attorney Carole Stanyar, the co-counsel for the DeBoer-Rowse family, Marks admitted that finding a large enough sample to study gay and lesbian parents is like trying to find a \"needle in a haystack.\" Marks also testified under cross-examination that he is \"not in favor of redefining marriage at present\" but “neutral” on whether there is a difference in outcomes for children raised by gay couples.\nJoseph Price\nEconomics professor from Brigham Young University who worked with Allen. Price also did his own study on the number of people who are gay or bisexual. This was his first study on same-sex parenting. Previous research involved healthy eating, the National Basketball Association, pornography and marriage and media impact on families, among other projects. Price signed onto an amicus brief with both Allen and Regnerus urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Price testified on March 4, 2014 about his 2012 study that reached a different conclusion than Rosenfeld using the same data set. He said his study concluded that children raised in a home with a married father and mother have 35 percent greater odds of \"making normal progress in school\" than children of same-sex parents.\nMark Regnerus\nAn associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) who conducted research called \"New Family Structures Study\" that looked at children in stable, long-term two parent homes compared to those in less-stable homes. An internal audit by the journal that published Regnerus’ study found his conclusions to be flawed and the American Sociological Association have condemned its results. Regnerus himself has admitted that the study doesn’t address same-sex parenting. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Allen and Price urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Regnerus testified on March 3, 2014 that it is too early for social scientists to make far-reaching conclusions about families headed by same-sex couples. \"We aren't anywhere near saying there's conclusive evidence\" that children with same-sex parents grow up with no differences when compared to kids with heterosexual parents, he said. \"Until we get more evidence, we should be skeptical. ...It's prudent for the state to retain its definition of marriage to one man, one woman,\" testified Regnerus. Christine L. Williams, chair of the sociology department at the UT-Austin, released a statement following Regnerus' testimony stating that his views \"do not reflect the views of the Sociology Department of The University of Texas at Austin. Nor do they reflect the views of the American Sociological Association, which takes the position that the conclusions he draws from his study of gay parenting are fundamentally flawed on conceptual and methodological grounds and that findings from Dr. Regnerus' work have been cited inappropriately in efforts to diminish the civil rights and legitimacy of LBGTQ partners and their families. We encourage society as a whole to evaluate his claims.\" The university's College of Liberal Arts had also distanced itself from Regnerus' views.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe nine-day trial concluded on March 7 after Kenneth M. Mogill provided the plaintiffs' summation and Kristin Heyse, an assistant attorney general, spoke for the defense. Attorney Michael Pitt spoke separately for defendant Brown, the county clerk, and joined the defense in urging Friedman, should he rule for the plaintiffs, to stay his ruling pending appeal. Judge Friedman said he hoped to rule within two weeks.\n\n\nDecision\nOn March 21, after 5 p.m. EDT, Judge Friedman ruled for the plaintiffs without staying enforcement of his decision. In ruling that the Michigan Marriage Amendment violated equal protection, Friedman found it unnecessary to address the Due Process Clause or levels of scrutiny higher than rational review. The state defendants asserted that the same-sex marriage ban furthered legitimate state interests in providing an optimal environment for child rearing, proceeding with caution before altering the traditional definition of marriage, and upholding tradition and morality. Friedman wrote that the first interest could logically be used to \"require that only rich, educated, suburban-dwelling, married Asians may marry, to the exclusion of all other heterosexual couples.\" He wrote that an interest in proceeding with caution can be asserted in any setting and that \"any deprivation of constitutional rights calls for prompt rectification\".\nRegarding morality, Friedman wrote:\n\nMany Michigan residents have religious convictions whose principles ... inform their own viewpoints about marriage. Nonetheless, these views cannot strip other citizens of the guarantees of equal protection under the law. The same Constitution that protects the free exercise of one’s faith in deciding whether to solemnize certain marriages rather than others, is the same Constitution that prevents the state from either mandating adherence to an established religion ... or enforcing private moral or religious beliefs without an accompanying secular purpose.\nThe state defendants cited Windsor v. United States to maintain that states still hold exclusive power to define marriage. Friedman wrote that Windsor \"noted that this power ... must respect the constitutional rights of persons,\" citing Loving v. Virginia. He wrote that Windsor and Loving \"stand for the proposition that, without some overriding legitimate interest, the state cannot use its domestic relations authority to legislate families out of existence.\"\nAt the time the ruling was handed down, most county clerks offices in the state had closed. Michigan Attorney General Schuette announced he was filing an emergency request for a stay of the decision pending appeal. Marriages for same-sex couples began the following morning.\n\n\nStay and appeal\nDeBoer v. Snyder was appealed to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit on March 21, 2014. The next day, after 323 marriage licenses had been issued in four Michigan counties, the appellate court placed a temporary hold on the district court's order allowing same-sex marriage through March 26. After hearing arguments on March 25, an appellate court panel voted 2–1 to approve the state attorney general's motion to extend the stay indefinitely until appeals have concluded. The court also decided to expedite the appeal. A three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit heard the appeal on August 6 along with similar cases from Kentucky (Bourke v. Beshear and Love v. Beshear), Ohio (Henry v. Himes and Obergefell v. Himes), and Tennessee (Tanco v. Haslam).\n\n\nCourt of Appeals decision\nOn November 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit ruled 2–1 that Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage does not violate the constitution. It said it was bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 action in a similar case, Baker v. Nelson, which dismissed a same-sex couple's marriage claim \"for want of a substantial federal question\".\nThe majority ruling said the case was about \"change\" and \"how best to handle it under the Constitution\". It noted that the question seemed to be not if, but when and how, this would happen for same-sex marriage. The ruling concluded that Baker had not yet been explicitly overturned and until addressed by the Supreme Court in some future case, there were no legal grounds at present to allow it to be ignored or deemed redundant, since the court could not attempt to anticipate what the changing position of society or the Supreme Court might be in future. Quoting Tully v. Griffin Inc and Hicks, the court noted that it was also not for them to engage in new \"doctrinal development\" without a basis in new guidance from the Supreme Court. Nor could the court draw conclusions that contradict precedents in previous rulings on the matter.\nThe ruling noted that the rejection of some past appeals by the Supreme Court were not necessarily a sign that the appeal was ill-founded, and such meaning should not be read into them (\"this kind of action - or inaction - imports no expression upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times\"). The ruling examined various dubious bases often allowed by States for marriage, and the extent of sanctimonious expressions used in discussing and practicing marriage, and the deference owed to individual states' legislative power to examine such questions at their own pace, and the fact that just one year had passed from the first legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States to the matters leading to this case. It concluded that \"what we are left with, is [that] by creating a status (marriage) and subsidizing it (with privileges) the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for the purposes of rearing offspring\". The court also described the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Windsor as one that should be seen less as an affirmation of same-sex marriage, and instead, as a case concerning Federal law encroachment upon State law, in which it had been confirmed that it was not the place of the Federal legislation to effectively seek to determine for all States how they should each treat same-sex marriage. Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: \"Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters.\"\n\n\nDissenting opinion\nDissenting, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey wrote: \"Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of same-sex marriage that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens.\"\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\nThe same-sex couples filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 17. They presented a single question for the court's consideration: \"Whether a state violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by denying same-sex couples the right to marry.\" On November 24, Attorney General Schuette filed a brief with the Supreme Court supporting the same-sex couples' petition for certiorari.\nOn January 16, 2015, the Supreme Court consolidated this case as Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015), with three other same-sex marriage cases –  Tanco v. Haslam (Tennessee), Obergefell v. Hodges (Ohio), and Bourke v. Beshear (Kentucky) –  challenging state laws that prohibited same-sex marriage and agreed to review the case. It set a briefing schedule to be completed April 17 and scheduled oral argument for April 28, 2015. The court asked the parties to address two questions: \"1) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex? 2) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?\"\nThe United States Supreme Court had heard oral arguments on April 28, 2015.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held in a 5–4 decision that the Fourteenth Amendment requires all states to grant same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages granted in other states. The Court overturned its prior decision in Baker v. Nelson, which the Sixth Circuit had invoked as precedent.\nThe Obergefell v. Hodges decision came on the second anniversary of the United States v. Windsor ruling that struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal recognition of same-sex marriages. It also came on the twelfth anniversary of Lawrence v. Texas which struck down sodomy laws in 13 states. Each justice's opinion on Obergefell was consistent with their opinion in Windsor.  In both cases, Justice Kennedy authored the majority opinion and was considered the \"swing vote\".\n\n\nSee also\n\nAccidental Activists\nLGBT rights in Michigan\nSame-sex marriage in Michigan\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDeBoer v.

    "summary": "DeBoer v. Snyder is a lawsuit that was filed by April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse on January 23, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, challenging Michigan's ban on adoption by same-sex couples so they can jointly adopt their children. In August 2012, Judge Bernard A. Friedman invited the couple to amend their suit to challenge the state's ban on same-sex marriage, \"the underlying issue\". Following a hearing on October 16, 2013, Friedman scheduled a trial that ran from February 25 to March 7, 2014. On March 21, Judge Friedman issued his ruling overturning the ban. On March 22, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit placed a temporary hold on Judge Friedman's ruling. The appeal was argued on August 6. On November 6, the Sixth Circuit reversed Judge Friedman and upheld Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage.\nThe decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which, on January 16, 2015, consolidated this case with three others and agreed to review the case. Oral arguments were heard on April 28, 2015, and the Supreme Court struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban on June 26, 2015.",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=90901",
    "text": "Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome (WFS) is defined as adrenal gland failure due to hemorrhages in the adrenal glands, commonly caused by sepsis. Typically, the bacteria responsible for triggering the bleeding is Neisseria meningitidis.\nThe bacterial infection leads to massive bleeding into one or both adrenal glands. Bilateral adrenal gland hemorrhaging is more common. It is characterized by overwhelming bacterial infection meningococcemia leading to massive blood invasion, organ failure, coma, low blood pressure and shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with widespread purpura, rapidly developing adrenocortical insufficiency and death.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nWaterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome can be caused by a number of different organisms (see below). When caused by Neisseria meningitidis, WFS is considered the most severe form of meningococcal sepsis. The onset of the illness is nonspecific with fever, rigors, vomiting, and headache. Soon a rash appears; first macular, not much different from the rose spots of typhoid, and rapidly becoming petechial and purpuric with a dusky gray color. Low blood pressure (hypotension) develops and rapidly leads to septic shock. The cyanosis of extremities can be extreme and the patient is very prostrated or comatose. In this form of meningococcal disease, meningitis generally does not occur. Low levels of blood glucose and sodium, high levels of potassium in the blood, and the ACTH stimulation test demonstrate the acute adrenal failure. Leukocytosis need not be extreme and in fact leukopenia may be seen and it is a very poor prognostic sign. C-reactive protein levels can be elevated or almost normal. Thrombocytopenia is sometimes extreme, with alteration in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Acidosis and acute kidney failure can be seen as in any severe sepsis. Meningococci can be readily cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and can sometimes be seen in smears of cutaneous lesions. Difficulty swallowing, atrophy of the tongue, and cracks at the corners of the mouth are also characteristic features.\n\n\nCauses\nMultiple species of bacteria can be associated with the condition:\n\nMeningococcus is another term for the bacterial species Neisseria meningitidis; blood infection with said species usually underlies WFS. While many infectious agents can infect the adrenals, an acute, selective infection is usually meningococcus.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa can also cause WFS.\nWFS can also be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, a common bacterial pathogen typically associated with meningitis in the adult and elderly population.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis could also cause WFS.  Tubercular invasion of the adrenal glands could cause hemorrhagic destruction of the glands and cause mineralocorticoid deficiency.\nStaphylococcus aureus has recently also been implicated in pediatric WFS.\nIt can also be associated with Haemophilus influenzae.\nAdrenal hemorrhage characteristic of the Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome has been identified in several autopsies of patients who died of sepsis secondary to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. \nViruses may also be implicated in adrenal problems:\n\nCytomegalovirus can cause adrenal insufficiency, especially in the immunocompromised.\nEbola virus infection may also cause similar acute adrenal failure.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nDiagnostic criteria are based on clinical features of adrenal insufficiency as well as identifying the causal agent. If the causal agent is suspected to be meningitis a lumbar puncture is performed. If the causal agent is suspected to be bacterial a blood culture and complete blood count is performed. An adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test can be performed to assess adrenal function.\n\n\nPrevention\nRoutine vaccination against meningococcus is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all 11- to 18-year-olds and people who have poor splenic function (who, for example, have had their spleen removed or who have sickle-cell disease which damages the spleen), or who have certain immune disorders, such as a complement deficiency.\n\n\nTreatment\nFulminant infection from meningococcal bacteria in the bloodstream is a medical emergency and requires emergent treatment with vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotics. Benzylpenicillin was once the drug of choice with chloramphenicol as a good alternative in allergic patients. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic commonly employed today. Hydrocortisone can sometimes reverse the adrenal insufficiency. Amputations, reconstructive surgery, and tissue grafting are sometimes needed as a result of tissue necrosis (typically of the extremities) caused by the infection.\n\n\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis of Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome varies by severity of the illness. Around 15% of patients with significant acute bilateral adrenal bleeding experience a fatal outcome. In cases where diagnosis and appropriate treatment are delayed, the case fatality rate approaches 50%. Recovery is possible with appropriate, timely management of the illness. Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid treatments may be necessary depending on the recovering patient's electrolyte status and response to treatment. Research shows that people with adrenal hemorrhage can regain adrenal function to some degree.\n\n\nHistory\nWaterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome is named after Rupert Waterhouse (1873–1958), an English physician, and Carl Friderichsen (1886–1979), a Danish pediatrician, who wrote papers on the syndrome, which had been previously described.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Great Emigration (Polish: Wielka Emigracja) was the emigration of thousands of Poles, particularly from the political and cultural élites, from 1831 to 1870, after the failure of the November Uprising of 1830–1831 and of other uprisings such as the Kraków uprising of 1846 and the January Uprising of 1863–1864. The emigration affected almost the entirety of political elite in Congress  Poland. The exiles included artists, soldiers and officers of the uprising, members of the Sejm of Congress Poland of 1830–1831 and several prisoners-of-war who escaped from captivity.\n\n\nPolish emigration after the partitions\n\nFrom the end of the 18th century, a large portion of the Polish political landscape was dominated by those who carried out their activities outside of the country as émigrés. Their exile was the result of the Partitions of Poland, which completely divided the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth between the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy of Austria. \nBecause of the emigration of political elites, much of the political and ideological activity of Polish intelligentsia in the 18th and the 19th centuries took place outside of the regions of partitioned Poland. Most of the political émigrés based themselves in France.\n\n\nAfter the November Uprising\nThe most important wave of emigration came after the November Uprising of 1830–1831.\nAccording to Rolf Malte, in the fall of 1831, around 50,000 people were forced to emigrate from Congress Poland and about 5,000 people from the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. J. Zubrzycki estimates that the number of political refugees likely wasn't larger than 5,000–6,000 at any point in the period between 1831 and the last quarter of the 19th century. \nThose Poles later fought and provided valuable support during the 1846 and 1848 revolutions in Poland. Their resistance was not limited to Polish revolutionary activity, as they also participated in various lands during the Revolutions of 1848, including France, the small principalities of Germany and Italy, Austria, Hungary, and the Danubian principalities Wallachia and Moldavia, the South American countries Argentina and Uruguay (participating in the \"Guerra Grande\" of 1839–1852) and in the Crimean War of 1853–1856. Additional waves of émigrés left the Polish lands after the failures of the attempted 1848 revolution and the January Uprising of 1863–1864.\nNotable Poles of the Great Emigration included Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, leader of the Polish government-in-exile in Paris (with embassies in London and Istanbul); politician Joachim Lelewel; national bards Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki, Cyprian Kamil Norwid, and Zygmunt Krasiński; as well as Leonard Chodźko, Ignacy Domeyko, Maurycy Mochnacki, Piotr Michałowski, Seweryn Goszczyński, Jozef Bohdan Zaleski, Aleksander Mirecki, Emil Korytko, Antoni Patek, Casimir Gzowski, Aleksander Jełowicki, Ignacy Szymanski and Adolf Zytogorski.\n\n\nSee also\nHôtel Lambert\nPolish Legions\nPolish minority in France\nUnion of National Unity\nAgnieszka Baranowska\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Nicolas Grenon (c. 1375 – October 17, 1456) was a French composer of the early Renaissance. He wrote in all the prevailing musical forms of the time, and was a rare case of a long-lived composer who learned his craft in the late 14th century but primarily practiced during the era during which the Renaissance styles were forming.\n\n\nLife\nThe earliest records of Grenon are from Paris, where he worked first in the Notre Dame Cathedral, and on the death of his brother moved to a job at the St Sépulchre as a canon. He rose in the ecclesiastical hierarchy at St Sépulchre, and then left Paris, moving first to Laon in 1403, and then Cambrai in 1408. In 1409 he took a post for the Duke of Berry as the \"master of the boys\", the music teacher and caretaker of the choirboys, at Bourges; and in 1412 he began his career with the Burgundian court of John the Fearless (Duke of Burgundy). In 1419 he returned to Cambrai, and from 1425 to 1427 worked in Rome as the master of the choirboys in the papal chapel under Pope Martin V.\nHe retired to Cambrai, where in the 1440s he worked with Guillaume Dufay on a complete revision of the polyphonic liturgical music of the cathedral. He died in Cambrai in 1456 after an unusually long life.\n\n\nMusic and influence\nGrenon's music shows aspects of both medieval and early Renaissance practice. His secular music is the most up-to-date, and includes examples of each of the prevailing formes fixes, the ballade, the virelai, and the rondeau. The melody is always in the topmost voice, and all are for three voices.\nThe motets by Grenon are unusual in their use of strict isorhythmic technique, usually in all voices. In some aspects they are similar to motets of Dufay, except for the strictness of the isorhythmic principle. One is datable to 1414, since it praises the antipope John XXIII, and probably corresponds to the opening of the Council of Konstanz. Grenon also wrote masses, but none survive complete; only a fragment of a Gloria remains, not enough to establish his stylistic technique for this type of composition.\n\n\nWorks\nGrenon's complete surviving works are edited in Gilbert Reaney, Early Fifteenth-Century Music, vol. 7 ([Rome]: American Institute of Musicology, 1983.  The only piece transmitted in more than two sources at the time of that publication was Se je vous ay bien. Several copies of Je ne requier de ma dame, however, have been discovered since Reaney's publication. The pieces are, in Reaney's order:\n\nSe je vous ay bien loyaulment amée (rondeau)\nLa plus jolie et la plus belle (rondeau or through-composed chanson)\nJe suy defait se vous ne me refaites (rondeau or unknown form)\nJe ne requier de ma dame (ballade)\nLa plus belle et doulce figure (virelai)\nEt in terra (Gloria; missing tenor?)\nAve virtus virtutum, caritas / Prophetarum fulti suffragio / Infelix, propera (motet)\nAd honorem sancte trinitatis / Celorum regnum sempiternum / Isti semper celestibus (motet)\nPlasmatoris humani generis / Verbigine mater ecclesia  (motet)\nNova obis gaudia (motet)\nCraig Wright (Grove, 2001) argues for the ascription of Argi vices/Cum Pilemon (attributed in the Aosta codex to \"Nicolao\") to Grenon as well.\n\n\nReferences and further reading\nWright, Craig (1980). \"Nicolas Grenon\".

    "text": "A Beautiful Child (ISBN 978-0425204405) is a best selling non-fiction book by author Matt Birkbeck, published by Berkley/Penguin in 2004 and in paperback in 2005. It tells the story of a young woman known by many names, including Sharon Marshall, who was kidnapped as a toddler and raised by a convicted felon, Franklin Delano Floyd. The book was also published in several foreign countries, including Denmark, Germany and Poland. \nA Beautiful Child spurred numerous websites dedicated to finding Sharon's true identity. Through suggestions from those sites along with reader suggestions from around the world, Birkbeck, in partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, conducted DNA testing on relatives of several girls who went missing in the early 1970s. World-wide interest in the book kept the Sharon Marshall story alive and led to the discovery by Birkbeck of her biological daughter, who had been placed for adoption in 1989.

    "summary": "A Beautiful Child (ISBN 978-0425204405) is a best selling non-fiction book by author Matt Birkbeck, published by Berkley/Penguin in 2004 and in paperback in 2005. It tells the story of a young woman known by many names, including Sharon Marshall, who was kidnapped as a toddler and raised by a convicted felon, Franklin Delano Floyd. The book was also published in several foreign countries, including Denmark, Germany and Poland. \nA Beautiful Child spurred numerous websites dedicated to finding Sharon's true identity. Through suggestions from those sites along with reader suggestions from around the world, Birkbeck, in partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, conducted DNA testing on relatives of several girls who went missing in the early 1970s. World-wide interest in the book kept the Sharon Marshall story alive and led to the discovery by Birkbeck of her biological daughter, who had been placed for adoption in 1989.

She received her B.S. in Cognitive Science at Stanford University in 1987; and her Ph.D. from the Department of History at University of Pennsylvania in 1999.\nAfter she graduated from Stanford University, Yuh worked as a reporter at the Omaha World-Herald, Omaha, NE from September 1987 to May 1989. Afterward, she had several engagements as a reporter with Newsday, New York, NY: from June to September 1987, May 1989 to July 1990. In 1991 from June to September, she was an editorial board member and writer at The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, PA.\nIn May 1990, after Yuh criticized an article by fellow Newsday columnist Jimmy Breslin as sexist, Breslin heatedly retorted with racial and sexual invective. Asian American and anti-hate groups forcefully decried Breslin's outburst. Breslin appeared on The Howard Stern Show to banter about his outburst and Koreans in general. Following this controversial radio broadcast, Newsday managing editor Anthony Marro suspended Breslin for two weeks, after which Breslin apologized.\nUpon Yuh's graduation from the University of Pennsylvania, she started her teaching and research career in Asian American Studies at Northwestern University and serves as a director at the Asian American Studies Program.\nShe is the author of the book Beyond the Shadow of Camptown: Korean Military Brides in America, which chronicled the history of Korean women who immigrated to the United States as the wives of U.S. soldiers and examines the dynamics of race, culture, gender, and nationalism from the perspective of Korean military brides.\n\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nBooks\nBeyond the Shadow of Camptown: Korean Military Brides in America, New York University Press, 2002\n\n\nSelected articles\n“Moved By War: Migration, Diaspora, and the Korean War.” Journal of Asian American Studies, Vol. 8, No. 3, Oct. 2005. pp. 277–292.\n“Imagined Community: Sisterhood and Resistance Among Korean Military Brides,” in Asian Pacific Islander American Women: A Historical Anthology, edited by Shirley Hune and Gail Nomura, New York University Press, 2003, pp. 221–236.\n\n\nAwards\nPeabody Award for the radio documentary, “Crossing East,” (consulting scholar), 2006\nMilestone Maker Award, Asian American Institute, 2004\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nthe Alliance of Scholars Concerned about Korea\nA Graduate Student’s Reflection on Studying Asian American History",

As a temporary measure, a one-lane Bailey bridge was erected while a permanent concrete bridge was constructed from 1997. The new bridge opened to traffic in March 1998 and the Bailey bridge was dismantled.\nIn the early days, this route only had two lanes. However, in 1995, the stretch between the traffic lights junction at Teluk Intan town center to the traffic lights junction to Federal Route 109 was upgraded into a four-lane, dual carriageway road. In 2004, the stretch between Federal Route 109 to Selabak Estate was also upgraded into a four-lane, dual carriageway, as was the stretch between the traffic lights junction to Jalan Kampung Banjar and the traffic lights junction at Federal Route 5.\n\n\nFeatures\nThe road is mainly a two-lane road except sections of the road several kilometers from Teluk Intan where it features a 4-lane dual carriageway road.\nAt most sections, the Federal Route 58 was built under the JKR R5 road standard, allowing maximum speed limit of up to 90 km/h.\nThere is one alternate route: Bidor Bypass.\n\n\nJunction and town lists\nThe entire route is in Perak.\nLegend:\n\nI/C - Interchange, I/S - Intersection, RSA - Rest and service area, OBR - Overhead bridge restaurant, R/R - Restaurant and rest plaza, L/B - Layby, V/P - Vista point, TN - tunnel, T/P - Toll plaza, BR - Bridge\n\n\nReferences",

In 1654, a postern gate was built at the northern end of Aldermanbury or the larger Cripplegate and Fore Street soon became an important shopping street until the middle of the nineteenth century.\nIn the nineteenth century, Joseph Todd established his drapery business in Fore Street. James Morrison, who subsequently became a millionaire and MP started work for Todd and married his daughter. The firm became known as Morrison, Dillon & Co, and later was converted into the Fore Street Limited Liability Company.\nBefore bombing during the Second World War, the street extended from Redcross Street to Finsbury Pavement.\nFore Street, on 25 August 1940, was the first place in the City of London to be hit by a German bomb during the Second World War, just before the start of the London Blitz proper. A plaque on the wall of Roman House, on the corner with Wood Street, marks the spot.\nUp to the 1970s a Post Office telephone exchange stood between Moor Lane and Fore Street Avenue with a Post Office on the corner between Fore Street and Fore Street Avenue.\n\n\nBuildings\nSt Giles-without-Cripplegate, a Church of England church, is located in Fore Street. When built in the 11th century it stood without (that is, outside) the city wall, near the Cripplegate. The church is dedicated to St Giles, patron saint of beggars and cripples. It is one of the few medieval churches left in the City of London, having survived the Great Fire of 1666, but it has been extensively altered and rebuilt over the years and was badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War. Oliver Cromwell married Elizabeth Bourchier there in 1620. Martin Frobisher, John Speed and John Milton were all buried there.\nSalters' Hall, home of the Worshipful Company of Salters, is at 4 Fore Street.

Advance Base Sectional Dock-2 (Auxiliary Floating Dock Big-2) was constructed in sections during 1942 and 1943 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California for World War II. Her official commissioning ceremony took place on 14 August 1943 with CDR Joseph J. Rochefort in command. With all ten sections joined, she was 927 feet (283 m) long, 28 feet (8.5 m) tall (keel to welldeck), and with an inside clear width of 133 feet 7 inches (40.72 m). ABSD-2 had a traveling 15-ton capacity crane with an 85-foot (26 m) radius and two or more support barges. The two side walls were folded down under tow to reduce wind resistance and lower the center of gravity. ABSD-2 had 6 capstans for pulling, each rated at 24,000 lbf (110,000 N) at 30 ft/min (0.15 m/s), 4 of the capstans were reversible. There were also 12 ballast compartments in each section.\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe ABSD-2 floating drydock departed 2 May 1944 and made the voyage across the Pacific Ocean in convoys. USS ABSD-2 sections arrived 22 June 1944 and then were reassembled at Espiritu Santo Naval Base, Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), in the South Pacific Ocean. Once assembled on 13 September 1944 she was moved for operation at Seeadler Harbor (also called Port Seeadler), at Admiralty Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, to the north of New Guinea also called the Manus Islands, after the largest island there at Manus Naval Base. USS ABSD-2 sister ship USS ABSD-4 also worked at Seeadler Harbor during the war. ABSD-2 repaired the large ships in the US Navy and United Kingdom's Royal Navy during World War II. Able to lift 90,000 tons ABSD-2 could raise large ships like aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and large auxiliary ships, out of the water for repair below the ship's waterline. She was also used to repair multiple smaller ships at the same time. Ships in continuous use during war need repair both from wear and from war damage from naval mine and torpedoes. Rudders and propellers are best serviced on dry docks. Without ABSD-2 and her sister ships at remote locations, months could be lost in ships returning to a home port for repair. ABSD-2 had provisions for the repair crew, such as bunk beds, meals, and laundry. ABSD-2 had power stations, ballast pumps, repair shops, machine shops, and mess halls to be self-sustaining. ABSD-2 had two rail track moveable cranes able to lift tons of material and parts for removing damaged parts and installing new parts.\n \nSome of the ships repaired:\nUSS ABSD-2 repaired the battleship USS Mississippi BB-41 on 12 October 1944. On 2 December 1944 the USS Claxton (DD-571) a Fletcher-class destroyer entered ABSD-2 for repair of after a kamikaze attack that damaged her off Leyte on 1 November 1944. ABSD-2 repaired the USS Canberra (CA-70) a  Baltimore-class cruiser after an attack on 13 October 1944 from an aerial torpedo. ABSD-2 repaired USS Killen (DD-593) also a  Fletcher class destroyer with kamikaze damage from an attack off Leyte on 1 November 1944. ABSD-2 reapied the USS Sumter (APA-52) a Sumter-class attack transport on 15 February 1945 for normal repairs. The USS Trinity (AO-13) a Patoka replenishment oiler was in her dry dock from 11 April 1945 to April 18 for normal repairs as she was in continuous use though the war.\nAFDB-2 repaired the USS Iowa (BB-61) in 1945 before she returned to the States for refit. Due to the Iowa 37 ft 2 in (11.33 m) draft when full loaded, the battleships had to unload much of her ammunition and fuel oil before entering AFDB-2. The torpedo damaged USS Houston and USS Reno were both repaired at the same time on 8 Jan. 1945.\n\n\nAttacked\nNear the end of the war, on April 22, 1945, at 2pm, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero two seater plane piloted by Shimbo, with Ensign Chuhei Okubo in the second seat, overflew Seeadler Harbor at 14,000 feet (4,300 m). They saw what they thought were two \"aircraft carriers\", but were actually empty floating dry docks ABSD-2 and ABSD-4. On April 27, 1945, at 11:15pm a Nakajima B5N piloted by Takahashi dropped an aerial torpedo. It hit one of the pontoon tanks in section G, damaging the dry dock. She was repaired and returned to service.\nAfter the war ABSD-2 was decommissioned in January 1947\n\n\nPost-war\nFive of ABSD-2 sections, A, B, C, E, F, G, and I were disposed of in various manners in 1990. At the time of this writing, three of her sections, D, F, and H, are still in service.\n\nSections A and G were sold for scrapping on 13 July 1990.\nSection B and C were disposed of in support of a fleet training exercise on 13 July 1990.\nSection D was reclassified as a Miscellaneous ship IX-522 om 16 August 1996 and now is currently disposition of NAVSEA as an inactive ship at the On-Site Maintenance Office of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In September 2020 it was listed for sale as excess inventory.\nSection F was reclassified as a Miscellaneous ship IX-524 on 19 July 1990, currently disposition at the Pacific Missile Range Facility at  Kekaha, Hawaii.\nSections E and I were sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for reuse and conversion on 13 July 1990.\nSection H was reclassified a Miscellaneous ship IX-535 on 10 October 2002 and is currently disposition at Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) as an inactive ship at the On-Site Maintenance Office, Pearl Harbor, HI.\nSection J was disposed of in support of Fleet training exercise on 13 July 1990.\n\n\nCommanding officers\nCommander Rochefort, Joseph John, USN from 14 August 1943 to 25 June 1944\nCaptain Richardson, George Victor, USNR from 25 June 1944 to 1 April 1945\nCommander.

    "summary": "USS ABSD-2, later redesignated as AFDB-2, was a ten-section, non-self-propelled, large auxiliary floating drydock of the US Navy. Advance Base Sectional Dock-2 (Auxiliary Floating Dock Big-2) was constructed in sections during 1942 and 1943 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California for World War II. Her official commissioning ceremony took place on 14 August 1943 with CDR Joseph J. Rochefort in command. With all ten sections joined, she was 927 feet (283 m) long, 28 feet (8.5 m) tall (keel to welldeck), and with an inside clear width of 133 feet 7 inches (40.72 m). ABSD-2 had a traveling 15-ton capacity crane with an 85-foot (26 m) radius and two or more support barges. The two side walls were folded down under tow to reduce wind resistance and lower the center of gravity. ABSD-2 had 6 capstans for pulling, each rated at 24,000 lbf (110,000 N) at 30 ft/min (0.15 m/s), 4 of the capstans were reversible. There were also 12 ballast compartments in each section.",

Ramos returned to América de Cali for the 2008 season and was one of the key players in their 2008 Finalizacion championship, scoring in their 4–1 aggregate victory over Independiente Medellín in the finals. \n\n\nHertha Berlin\nOn 30 August 2009, he joined Hertha BSC in Germany after the clubs agreed a fee in the region of €2 million.\nHis first goal for Hertha came in the second round of the DFB Pokal on 22 September 2009, helping the club come back from 0–2 down to level at 2–2, only to lose in a penalty shoot-out. His first Bundesliga goal came against Stuttgart on 12 November, putting his side ahead before a late Zdravko Kuzmanović strike ensured a 1–1 draw. On 13 December 2013, Ramos scored two goals in nine minutes as Hertha came from 0–1 down to defeat Werder Bremen 3–2. In the 2013–14 Bundesliga season, he had his best season to date with Hertha, contributing 16 goals, the joint fourth most in the league.\n\n\nBorussia Dortmund\nOn 9 April 2014, it was announced that Ramos would sign for Borussia Dortmund, joining them on 1 July 2014, moving for an undisclosed fee and penning a four-year contract with the club.

On 19 May 2024, he conquered Mount Everest at 8:35 am Bangladesh time. In the same expedition, he became the first ever Bangladeshi to conquer another eight-thousander, Lhotse (8,516 m), on 21 May 2024. He has become the first Bangladeshi to reach the summit of Annapurna I. Babar Ali reached on the top of Mount Manaslu as the 1st Bangladeshi mountaineer to summit without the help of supplementary  oxygen.  [1]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBabar Ali is a physician by profession. He was born, raised and educated in Chittagong. Babar is the second child of Leyakat Ali and Lutfunnahar Begum of Burishchar area of Hathazari, Chittagong. He was born on 16 October 1990.\nBabar passed his HSC from Ispahani Public School and College, Chittagong. He received his MBBS degree from Chittagong Medical College. He worked for IOM for a long time. Later, he worked as a public health officer in ICDDRB.।\n\n\nMountaineering\nBabar started his mountaineering journey in 2010. He has climbed various peaks of the Himalayas since 2014. In 2017, he completed basic mountaineering training from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering.\n\n\nAma Dablam Expedition\nOn October 24, 2022, Babar Ali ascended from Camp 1 to Camp 2, reaching an altitude of 6,100 meters. Camp 2 is situated on the Yellow Tower. While Camp 3 occupies a relatively flat area compared to the camps following the base camp, many climbers deem it unsafe for overnight stays due to an accident in 2006. Consequently, Babar Ali commenced his summit push from Camp 2. On October 25, 2022, at 9:03 AM Nepal time, he successfully summited Ama Dablam, a mountain standing at 22,349 feet (6,812 meters), thereby becoming the first individual from Bangladesh to achieve this feat.\n\n\nSummit of Everest\nOn May 19, at 08:35 Bangladesh Standard Time, Babar Ali reached the summit and remained there for 1 hour and 10 minutes. During his descent, a snowstorm struck, forcing Ali to endure hazardous conditions for 2.5 hours before safely surviving the ordeal.\n\n\nLhotse\nOn May 21, 2024, Babar Ali summited Lhotse, the world's fourth-highest peak, at 5:50 am Nepal Standard Time (6:05 am Bangladesh Standard Time), following his successful ascent of Mount Everest on May 19, 2024. This marked the first time a Bangladeshi climber had conquered Lhotse and the first instance of a Bangladeshi mountaineer scaling two eight-thousander peaks in a single expedition (double-header).\n\n\nReferences",

It can be described as a \"castle of props\", as if it were the set of a theatre. The most original stylistic building of la Plana Novella is the courtyard in the Gaudi style, but one of the most characteristic and eye-catching elements is the lavatory, known as \"the throne\".\nRural depopulation has left many farmhouses in the area deserted, and the Park is almost uninhabited.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=60090384",
    "text": "The Battle of Orange Walk took place on 1 September 1872 when a force of Icaiche Maya led by Marcus Canul attacked the town of Orange Walk in Belize.  Canul had previously been involved in conflict with the British authorities over infringements of his people's land rights and non-payment of rent and one motive for the raid may have been to seize the district magistrate for ransom.  Canul and his men crossed the border from Mexico the day before the battle and were able to reach the town undetected by the British.  They launched a surprise attack that caught the small garrison unaware – the British commanders were in the bath at the time the battle started.  The British forces – a small detachment of the West India Regiment – successfully defended their barracks building for a number of hours, inflicting heavy casualties on the Maya and fatally wounding Canul. The Maya then withdrew into Mexico.\n\n\nBackground\nMarcus Canul was a chief of the Icaiche Maya.  The Icaiche were on friendly terms with the government of neighbouring Mexico but had a history of conflict with the colony of British Honduras; Mexico itself had a disputed claim over land in the colony.  Canul had fought the British in 1866, capturing for ransom a number of woodcutters working for the British Honduras Company in the Rio Bravo region. Canul and his men routed a detachment of British troops on December 21, 1866, at the Battle of San Pedro Yalbac. In 1867 the British mounted a counter-offensive, equipped with newly-arrived Congreve rockets. This counter-offensive burned down the villages of San Pedro, Santa Teresa, San José, Naranjal, Cerro, Santa Cruz, and Chunbalche. A small force of Icaiche Maya advanced into British Honduras again in 1868 and made demands for rent on land over which they claimed ownership; however Canul disavowed the actions of this force.\nOrange Walk Town located around 10 miles (16 km) from the Mexican border in northern British Honduras had its origin as a logging camp on the New River.  In 1872 the town had a population of around 1,200 – largely mixed race Native American or mixed race European-Native American workers and a small British garrison.\n\n\nBattle\nOn 31 August or early 1 September 1872 Canul led a force of the Maya across the Rio Hondo from Mexico; this has been described as being 150–180 strong with around 100 non-combatant camp followers.  On 1 September he launched an attack on Orange Walk, to further his aim of collecting rent payments and returning lands he claimed were seized from his people.  A British press report of the time stated that Canul had intended to seize the town's magistrate with the intention of collecting a ransom.\nBritish forces comprised Lieutenant Joseph Graham Smith and 37 men of the West India Regiment, together with the unit's Assistant Surgeon John Dallas Edge.  At around 8 am Canul led about 180 armed Maya against the garrison's barracks, a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide and 60-foot (18 m) long structure built from 3\" wooden stakes and roofed in palm leaves, that was situated midway between the town and the river.  The Maya forces were able to approach the town undetected, a fact which led the British to suspect they had sympathisers in the local population.  Canul split his force into three equal portions: one that attacked and looted the town and two that converged upon the barracks.  Edge and Smith were out of the barracks bathing at the time of the attack and upon hearing the first shots had to make a desperate rush over the 60 yards (55 m) from their bathtubs to the building.  Edge was completely naked and Smith clothed only in his drawers.\nDetails of the subsequent battle are recorded in the West India regimental history published in 1885, an 1872 report in the Spectator and also in the personal correspondence of Edge; there are differences in some details. According to the Spectator, Smith was shot in the back during the run from his bath. The bullet is said to have struck near both his heart and spinal column and both he and Edge thought the wound to be fatal. Edge states that Smith was incapacitated and that he subsequently took over command of the garrison. The regimental history records instead that Smith and Sergeant Belizario made a dash back to his quarters, braving the Maya cross fire to retrieve the key for the garrison magazine.  Belizario then retrieved the portable magazine from an adjoining room and passed the contents through the wall to the garrison, all the while under heavy fire.  Smith is then said to have taken up a position in the door of the barracks and returned fire against the Maya when he was struck by a bullet.  By Edge's account he ordered the defenders to reinforce the walls of the barracks with their mattresses – which apparently were sufficient to stop bullets; in the regimental history this action is attributed to Smith.\nOne of the garrison, Private Bidwell, had been on detachment at a commissariat store in the town when the attack occurred.  He took position in a compound overlooking the barracks and fired off his ten rounds of ammunition at the Maya.  He then ran for the barracks to rejoin his comrades but was mortally wounded in doing so.\nThe garrison kept up a defence of the structure for some four to six hours, during which time the Maya set fire to the town.  At one point two American settlers – Price and Brudrow – joined the battle.  Arriving from an outlying ranch they found themselves to the rear of the Maya; by opening fire they were able to cause enough confusion to ride over to the barracks.  The Americans advocated a retreat over the river.  Edge disagreed, stating that the act would kill Smith and endanger the men – though he would permit the Americans to try on their own.  Both Price and Brudrow decided to remain in the barracks.  A number of civilian refugees from the town also joined Edge and his men.  Many of the others including all the European women and children escaped from the town by boat to nearby San Estevan.\nEventually Canul was mortally wounded and the Maya defeated, reportedly suffering some 30 to 50 men killed and an unknown number of wounded.  The survivors escaped into Mexico.  British losses were reportedly two men killed and 14 severely wounded.  More than 300 bullet holes were recorded in the walls of the barracks.\nThe morning after the attack a rumour spread that another force of Maya was forming to resume the assault.  A British patrol was sent out which found only a scattered few in the bush.  Edge claims to have spent the next three days in leading patrols to secure the town and extracting more than 26 bullets from the defenders.  A 20-man British relief force arrived on the third day with a more substantial reinforcement arriving on the fourth day.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe battle was the last conflict involving the Maya in British Honduras and also the last serious attack on the colony.  The Icaiche Maya thereafter maintained an uneasy peace with the British authorities.  The garrison was reinforced by a further 50 men of the West India Regiment from Jamaica on 25 September as a direct result of the attack.  In 1874 the British colonial government constructed a fort on the site on the battle.\nLieutenant Smith recovered from his wound and was promoted to command a company of the 97th Regiment.  Assistant Surgeon Edge was promoted to Staff Surgeon on 3 December 1872 for his role in the battle and later became a major-general in the Royal Army Medical Corps.  Belizario was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "The Battle of Orange Walk took place on 1 September 1872 when a force of Icaiche Maya led by Marcus Canul attacked the town of Orange Walk in Belize.  Canul had previously been involved in conflict with the British authorities over infringements of his people's land rights and non-payment of rent and one motive for the raid may have been to seize the district magistrate for ransom.  Canul and his men crossed the border from Mexico the day before the battle and were able to reach the town undetected by the British.  They launched a surprise attack that caught the small garrison unaware – the British commanders were in the bath at the time the battle started.  The British forces – a small detachment of the West India Regiment – successfully defended their barracks building for a number of hours, inflicting heavy casualties on the Maya and fatally wounding Canul. The Maya then withdrew into Mexico.",

    "text": "Bistorta vivipara (synonym Persicaria vivipara) is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the knotweed and buckwheat family Polygonaceae, commonly known as alpine bistort. Scientific synonyms include Bistorta vivipara and Polygonum viviparum. It is common all over the high Arctic through Europe,  North America, incl. Greenland, and temperate and tropical Asia. Its range stretches further south in high mountainous areas such as the Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees, Caucasus, Alaska and the Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nMolecular phylogenetic work has demonstrated  that the genus Bistorta represents a distinct lineage within the family Polygonaceae. The genus Bistorta contains at least 42 accepted species.\n\n\nDescription\n\nAlpine bistort is a perennial herb that grows to 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in) tall. It has a thick rhizomatous rootstock and an erect, unbranched, hairless stem. The leaves are hairless on the upper surfaces, but hairy and greyish-green below. The basal ones are longish-elliptical with long stalks and rounded bases; the upper ones are few and are linear and stalkless. The tiny flowers are white or pink in the upper part of the spike with five perianth segments, eight stamens with purple anthers and three fused carpels. The lower ones are replaced by bulbils. Flowers rarely produce viable seeds and reproduction is normally by the bulbils, which are small bulb-like structures that develop in the axils of the leaves and may develop into new plants. Very often, a small leaf develops when the bulbil is still attached to the mother plant. The bulbils are rich in starch and are a preferred food for rock ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus) and reindeer; they are also occasionally used by Arctic peoples. Alpine bistort flowers in June and July.\n\n\nHabitat\nAlpine bistort grows in many different plant communities, very often in abundance. Typical habitats include moist short grassland, yards, the edges of tracks, and nutrient-rich fens.\nAs with many other alpine plants, Alpine bistort is slow-growing and produces embryonic buds one year that  grow and open a few years after their formation (flower preformation), with an individual leaf or inflorescence taking three to four years to reach maturity from the time the buds are formed.\n\n\nMycorrhiza\nAlpine bistort has been shown to form an ectomycorrhizal root symbiosis with fungi.\n\n\nUses\nThe bulbils can be stripped from the lower flower stalks and eaten raw. The young roots are edible raw, while older ones must be cooked. The young leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.\nThe roots are eaten in Russia, especially by the Samoyed peoples.\n\n\nIn place names\nThe Kokolik River in Alaska is named after Qaqalik, the Iñupiaq name for alpine bistort.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Samba-canção (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɐ̃bɐ kɐ̃ˈsɐ̃w]; literally 'song samba') is, in its most common acceptance or interpretation, the denomination for a kind of Brazilian popular songs with a slow-paced samba rhythm.\n\n\nHistory\nIt appeared after the World War II, at the end of the 1940s, and practically disappeared in the middle of the 1960s when majority of composers began to present their songs without category denomination. The name is somewhat arbitrary, adopted by the music industry, that is, publishers and record companies, and some composers. Like many popular songs of the world, Samba-canção (plural 'sambas-canções')'s principal theme is the love relationship, typically moaning for a lost love. Tempo is moderate or a little slower. The denomination suggests that the song is more sophisticated, less earthy, than ordinary samba songs.\n\n\nComposition\nIt has, in most cases, two parts. They are repeated totally. It almost always has a small instrumental introduction, and sometimes a short additional ending (coda). Frequently in the repetition, the first part is played by musicians and the second sung. The musical accompaniment can be anything, from piano solo or guitar duet to jazz-style big band or philharmonic orchestra. In these cases, samba rhythm was provided mainly by a drum player.\nIt maintains a Brazilian flavor, more or less, but is strongly influenced by American popular songs in every way. Some were influenced by Argentine-Uruguayan tango and Cuban-Mexican bolero.\nUnder the denomination 'Samba-canção' there have been many hit tunes. Several have the 'classic' or 'standard' status in the history of Brazilian popular music. The name has become obsolete because the public prefers to call them sambas. Today they are a part of MPB.\n\n\nPopular songs\nThe most renowned tunes published officially with the denomination 'samba-canção' are as follows.\n\nYear 1945 - Dora (Lyrics and music by Dorival Caymmi/First public performance or recording by himself)\n46 - Saia do caminho (Custódio Mesquita & Eduardo Rui/Aracy de Almeida) - Copacabana (João de Barro & Albero Ribeiro/Dick Farney)\n47 - Marina (Dorival Caymmi/himself) / Nervos do aço (Lupicínio Rodrigues/Francisco Alves)\n48 - Caminhemos (Herivelto Martins/Francisco Alves) Also well known afterward by a Spanish-language version with the rhythm of bolero.\n50 - Errei sim (Ataulfo Alves/Dalva de Oliveira)\n51 - Vingança (Lupicínio Rodrigues/Linda Batista) Also well known afterward by a Spanish-language version with the rhythm of tango.\n52 - Ninguém me ama (Antônio Maria & Fernando Lobo/Nora Ney) - Risque (Ary Barroso/Hermínia Silva) Originally performed as 'fado'. Also well known afterward by a Spanish-language version with the rhythm of bolero.\n55 - Folha morta (Ary Barroso/Jamelão) / Duas contas (Garoto/Garoto-Fafá Lemos-Chiquinho do Accordion)\n56 - Só louco (Dorival Caymmi/himself) / Resposta (Maysa/herself) /\n57 - Ouça (Maysa/herself) / Por causa de você (Dolores Duran & Tom Jobim/Roberto Luna?) / Se todos fossem iguais a você (Tom Jobim & Vinicius de Moraes/Tito Madi or Sylvia Telles)\n58 - Estrada do sol (Dolores Duran & Tom Jobim/Agostinho dos Santos) / Meu mundo caiu (Maysa/herself)\n59 - A noite do meu bem (Dolores Duran/herself) / Dindi (Tom Jobim & Aloysio de Oliveira/Sylvia Telles) / Eu sei que vou te amar (Tom Jobim & Vinicius de Moraes/Albertinho Fortuna)\n\n\nOther forms\nThere had been another kind of Samba-canção. In the 1930s, 'samba-canção' was the denomination applied to some sentimental tunes written for musical reviews. They were not many. Some representative sambas-canções of this kind are: No rancho fundo (1931, lyrics and music by Ary Barroso and Lamartine Babo), Na batucada da vida (1934, Ary Barroso and Luiz Peixoto\") and Serra da Boa Esperança (1937, Lamartine Babo). \nReferring to the \"first\" samba-canção of this kind, Paulo Tapajós wrote in an LP jacket:\n\nThe old modinha has gotten out of fashion. In its place, a new type of Brazilian song appeared telling the misfortunes of love. That led Henrique Vogeler to compose, in 1928, a new musical expression, using the rhythm of samba, but in much slower and much more relaxed tempo. The tune was called Iaiá, but becoming better known as Ai, Ioiô or also Linda Flor. In the piano sheet music the author classified it as \"Samba Canção Brasileira\" (Samba Brazilian song), fusing the samba with traditional Brazilian song. Afterward the word \"Brasileira\" disappeared.\nHenrique Vogeler (Rio de Janeiro 1888–1944) was a composer-pianist with solid musical education, studied at the National Conservatory, but best known as the composer of popular tunes, and wrote this \"first\" Samba-canção as an opening number of a review.\nThe above-mentioned LP contains some oldies, one Cartola composition and contemporary songs usually associated with bossa nova style.\n\n\nReferences",

Its first single \"You Do What You Have To\" was named Record of the Week by BBC Radio 2. After his band, The Wil Seabrook Band, toured with Dave Matthews Band, Sister Hazel and Dishwalla, he ventured out again as a solo artist and released New EP in 2005.\nAlso in 2005, Wil appeared in the first season of Rock Star INXS. He performed two songs in the regular competition, Heroes and Right Here, Right Now. After his performance of Right Here Right Now was ranked in the bottom three, Seabrook became the second contestant to be eliminated from the show (July 13, 2005). For his elimination performance, Seabrook sang Need You Tonight.\nWil then signed with Mercy Records and began to record his second studio album One Dozen Summers in November 2006.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=25628243",
    "text": "A linear scale, also called a bar scale, scale bar, graphic scale, or graphical scale, is a means of visually showing the scale of a map, nautical chart, engineering drawing, or architectural drawing. A scale bar is common element of map layouts.\nOn large scale maps and charts, those covering a small area, and engineering and architectural drawings, the linear scale can be very simple, a line marked at intervals to show the distance on the earth or object which the distance on the scale represents. A person using the map can use a pair of dividers (or, less precisely, two fingers) to measure a distance by comparing it to the linear scale. The length of the line on the linear scale is equal to the distance represented on the earth multiplied by the map or chart's scale.\nIn most projections, scale varies with latitude, so on small scale maps, covering large areas and a wide range of latitudes, the linear scale must show the scale for the range of latitudes covered by the map. One of these is shown below.\nSince most nautical charts are constructed using the Mercator projection whose scale varies substantially with latitude, linear scales are not used on charts with scales smaller than approximately 1/80,000. Mariners generally use the nautical mile, which, because a nautical mile is approximately equal to a minute of latitude, can be measured against the latitude scale at the sides of the chart.\nWhile linear scales are used on architectural and engineering drawings, particularly those that are drawn after the subject has been built, many such drawings do not have a linear scale and are marked \"Do Not Scale Drawing\" in recognition of the fact that paper size changes with environmental changes and only dimensions that are specifically shown on the drawing can be used reliably in precise manufacturing.\n\n\nNomenclature\n\nThe terms \"bar scale\", \"graphic scale\", \"graphical scale\", \"linear scale\", and \"scale\" are all used. Bowditch defined only \"bar scale\" in its 1962 Glossary, but added a reference to \"graphic scale\" by its 2002 edition. Dutton used both terms in 1978. The International Hydrographic Organization's Chart No. 1 uses only \"linear scale\". The British Admiralty's Mariner's Handbook uses \"scale\" to describe a linear scale and avoids confusion by using \"natural scale\" for the fraction defined at scale (map).\n\n\nSee also\nEngineer's scale\nLogarithmic scale (useful e.g. when the data covers a large range of values)\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "A linear scale, also called a bar scale, scale bar, graphic scale, or graphical scale, is a means of visually showing the scale of a map, nautical chart, engineering drawing, or architectural drawing. A scale bar is common element of map layouts.\nOn large scale maps and charts, those covering a small area, and engineering and architectural drawings, the linear scale can be very simple, a line marked at intervals to show the distance on the earth or object which the distance on the scale represents. A person using the map can use a pair of dividers (or, less precisely, two fingers) to measure a distance by comparing it to the linear scale. The length of the line on the linear scale is equal to the distance represented on the earth multiplied by the map or chart's scale.\nIn most projections, scale varies with latitude, so on small scale maps, covering large areas and a wide range of latitudes, the linear scale must show the scale for the range of latitudes covered by the map. One of these is shown below.\nSince most nautical charts are constructed using the Mercator projection whose scale varies substantially with latitude, linear scales are not used on charts with scales smaller than approximately 1/80,000. Mariners generally use the nautical mile, which, because a nautical mile is approximately equal to a minute of latitude, can be measured against the latitude scale at the sides of the chart.\nWhile linear scales are used on architectural and engineering drawings, particularly those that are drawn after the subject has been built, many such drawings do not have a linear scale and are marked \"Do Not Scale Drawing\" in recognition of the fact that paper size changes with environmental changes and only dimensions that are specifically shown on the drawing can be used reliably in precise manufacturing.",

    "text": "WENN (1320 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Birmingham, Alabama.  It airs a classic hits format and is owned by SummitMedia, which also owns six other Birmingham stations, and all share studios and offices in the Cahaba neighborhood in southeast Birmingham, but is not related to the fictional radio WENN in the American Movie Classics sitcom Remember WENN, which ran from 1996 to 1998.\nBy day, WENN broadcasts at 5,000 watts.  To avoid interfering with other stations on 1320 AM, it reduces power to 111 watts at night.  The transmitter is in Hopper City on the city's northside.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nWEZB, WENN and WAGG\nThe station that now broadcasts at 1320 AM in Birmingham started in 1950 as WEZB, an easy listening music station licensed to Homewood, Alabama.  When WEZB changed frequencies, moving to 1220 AM in 1959, it was replaced by WENN, playing R&B and black gospel music that targeted Birmingham's African-American community.  During the turbulent 1960s, the new WENN was one of two stations that served black listeners; the other was WJLD.  Because of FCC restrictions, WENN was a daytimer, broadcasting only from sunrise until sunset.  Still, it enjoyed dominance over its main rival, WJLD.  In 1969, WENN launched an FM companion station on 107.7 FM.  The new WENN-FM was the first FM station in Birmingham aimed at the listening tastes of the community's African-American population.\nThe popularity of FM radio in Birmingham greatly increased during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  WENN-FM's audience growth in particular led the station management to seek a separate identity for the AM 1320.  In 1983, the AM station changed its call sign to WAGG, and it became an urban gospel music station.  This change in programming proved to be successful, and by the end of the 1980s, WAGG was one of the highest-rated AM stations in Birmingham.\n\n\nCox Radio\nIn 1998, Cox Radio, which already owned WZZK-FM, WODL-FM and WEZN, bought WAGG.  One year later, WEZN, at the time an adult standards-formatted station, and WAGG swapped dial positions in order for WAGG to take advantage of the superior nighttime signal on 610 AM. As a result, 610 would be the new station for gospel music, while 1320 would be the new home for adult standards.\nAfter WAGG and WEZN swapped dial positions, the 1320 AM frequency has changed both its call sign and its programming format several times.  In 2000, the adult standards programming was dropped, and the station was relaunched as WRJS (\"Rejoice 1320\"), another urban gospel station.  In 2002, the station changed formats again, becoming a regional Mexican music station known on the air as \"La Favorita.\"  In 2003, the station was reincarnated as WZZK (the call sign of 610 AM from 1985–1998), playing classic country music.\n\n\nUrban Talk and Regional Mexican\nThe station became WPSB in February 2006, with an urban talk format under the moniker \"The People's Station of Birmingham.\"\nOn January 29, 2007, the station began stunting with a loop of \"Oye Como Va\" by Santana. On February 1, the station was officially relaunched as a Regional Mexican music station branded as \"Radio Centro Birmingham\".  The station was run out of Cox Radio's Birmingham facilities but was operated under a local marketing agreement by KPI Latino.\nOn March 15, 2009, the legacy WENN call sign was returned to this station.  At about the same time, the station dropped the Regional Mexican music format and reverted to urban-oriented talk programming.\n\n\nUrban AC\nOn February 16, 2010, WENN changed its format to neo soul/urban AC, branded as \"WENN 101.9, Birmingham's Neo Soul Station\", with AM 1320 simulcasting on W270BW (101.9 FM).  After approved modifications, W270BW now broadcasts at 102.1 FM (as W271BN), and could be received over most of downtown Birmingham.\nOn December 12, 2011, WENN/W271BN flipped to old-school hip-hop and R&B, branded as \"Power 102.1.\"  It carried the syndicated Birmingham native comedian Rickey Smiley in morning drive.\n\n\nSports radio\nOn August 30, 2012, WENN changed formats again. The old-school music previously played on 1320 AM moved to WZNN-HD2, and WENN became a sports radio station as a full-time network affiliate of ESPN Radio.  At the same time, the station's programming began simulcasting on a new FM translator, W297BF (107.3 FM).\nOn July 20, 2012, Cox Radio, Inc. announced the sale of WENN and 22 other stations to Summit Media LLC for $66.25 million. The sale was consummated on May 3, 2013.\n\n\nSummit Media ownership\nOn July 2, 2013, Summit Media announced a format change for 107.3 FM/97.3 HD-2.  At Noon that day, the frequency became the over-the-air station for Birmingham Mountain Radio, a formerly internet-only radio station that had been receiving accolades in the market since its inception in 2010. On that same day, WENN reverted to their simulcast of W271BN.\nOn November 15, 2013, WENN and W271BN changed the format to adult hits, simulcasting WZNN, branded as \"102.1 Y'all FM\". The simulcast lasted until November 21, 2013, at midnight; at that time, the former WZNN became soft adult contemporary WEZZ, \"Easy 97.3\".\n\n\nGoing silent, subsequent formats\nOn October 3, 2014, WENN  went silent, with W271BN switching to a simulcast of gospel-formatted sister station WAGG.\nIn November 2014, WENN returned to the air, simulcasting WEZZ-FM's soft adult contemporary format.\nIn April 2015, WENN changed its format back to adult hits. The following month, WENN went silent, though it would later be reported to come back on air the following month with the same adult hits format, and would begin simulcasting on new FM translator W261BX (100.1 FM).\nOn September 25, 2015, WENN/W261BX began stunting with Christmas music, becoming the first station to change over for the season. The station was not selling any commercials during the stunt.\nOn December 28, 2015, WENN changed its format to hot adult contemporary, branded as \"All the Hits 100.1\".\nOn March 14, 2016, WENN changed their format to soft AC, branded as \"Easy 102.1\", and switched translators to W271BN (102.1 FM).\nAfter the sale of its translator to the Educational Media Foundation, WENN went dark in April 2017.\nOn May 4, 2017, WENN returned to the air with soft AC, branded as \"Easy 1320\".\nIn July 2017, WENN switched to a simulcast of urban adult contemporary-formatted WBHK. That simulcast gave way back to a simulcast of WAGG sometime later.\nOn November 23, 2024, WENN returned to the air with a beautiful music format, branded as \"Beautiful 1320\".\nOn October 1, 2025, WENN changed their format from beautiful music to classic hits, branded as \"Star 92\", targeting Shelby County.\n\n\nPrevious logo gallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFacility details for Facility ID 6411 (WENN)   in the FCC Licensing and Management System\nWENN in Nielsen Audio's AM station database\nFacility details for Facility ID 150836 (W222BK)   in the FCC Licensing and Management System\nW222BK at FCCdata.org\nFCC History Cards for WENN\nRadio/TV page of Birmingham Rewound",

    "text": "Turtle Mountain Provincial Park is a provincial park located in the southwestern portion of the Canadian province of Manitoba. Within it are the Adam Lake and Max Lake campgrounds. The park is known for its bike trails, fishing, back country cabins and canoe routes. The park is very popular with families and outdoor enthusiasts.\nThe park is named after the numerous painted turtles found in the area. The turtles can be seen throughout the warmer months sun bathing near permanent ponds or lakes in the park. In late spring and early summer the females can be seen laying eggs in sandy soil throughout the park.  The turtles live in the shallow lakes in the park.\nTurtle Mountain Provincial Park was designated a provincial park by the Government of Manitoba in 1961. The park is 186 square kilometres (72 sq mi) in size. The park is considered to be a Class II protected area under the IUCN protected area management categories.\nIt is adjacent to the international border between Canada and the United States. Its southeast corner is adjacent to the International Peace Garden which is located in both Manitoba and the U.S. state of North Dakota. To the east is the William Lake Provincial Park, home to the William Lake Campground, and the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration. To the north is the town of Boissevain, with the city of Brandon farther north. Most of the park is situated in the southwesternmost section of the Municipality of Boissevain – Morton, while the rest of it lies in the southeast corner of the Municipality of Deloraine – Winchester. \n\nThe park is nearly coterminous with the slightly larger Turtle Mountain Provincial Forest. The only difference is a small section of the forest lying east of Manitoba Highway 10 at the southeast corner of the forest (near the International Peace Garden), which is outside the park's territory. \n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEarly history\nFollowing the last ice age, Turtle Mountain Provincial Park became the first inhabited location in Manitoba. It is also the biggest remaining natural deciduous forest in southwestern Manitoba. Once coniferous forests grew and animals were attracted to the area, nomadic hunters soon followed. Stone tools have been found, confirming their presence. Based on the exhumed artifacts, archaeologists have concluded these people were hunter gatherers, not farmers.\nTurtle Mountain can be found on the Palliser map of 1865.\nIn 1875 George Mercer Dawson became the first geologist to travel through Turtle Mountain Provincial Park. Dawson noted the glacial deposits throughout the park.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples\nMétis from the Red River Colony travelled to Turtle Mountain Provincial Park for annual hunting trips between 1810 and 1870. After the buffalo hunt ended many Métis built homesteads within the park.  The location was known by the Métis as Tête de Tortue, seeing a resemblance to the buckler of a turtle, its head being represented by the conical mound standing out from one end (CPCGN files). Two notable cultural sites are the Dunseith Trail and Oskar Lake archeological site. The Dunseith Trail was the first trail across Turtle Mountain, and the archeological site was used by Cree hunters over 400 years ago.\n\n\nUse and activities\nFormerly, the park was predominantly used for agricultural purposes due to the presence of hardwoods. The area is no longer dependent on Turtle Mountain for timber, so it is now mainly used for recreation and ranching. There is a trail system used for biking, hiking, and horseback riding. There are also various beaches, playgrounds, and picnic areas for recreational use. The eutrophication of many of the water bodies can make it difficult for recreation in the summer. The most common type of farming is grain farming.\n\n\nGeography\n\nTurtle Mountain Provincial Park is situated on the Turtle Mountain (plateau), one of a number of significant geographic features located along the Manitoba Escarpment, the Canadian portion of the Pembina Escarpment.  It is located in the Southwest Manitoba Uplands Ecoregion, within the Canadian Prairies. The park is situated at an elevation of 245 metres. This region is covered by glacial till and fluvioglacial deposits, which remain from the pleistocene ice age. A study of dinoflagellates confirmed the paleocene age of the Turtle Mountain formation. Once deglaciation finished 14,000 years ago the irregular melting pattern left the area covered in hummocky terrain. The soils are mainly grey and black chernozems. There are grey luvisols at higher elevations. The bedrock in the park is composed of sandstone, shale, lignite coal. There are over 200 lakes and wetlands in this region. Many of the shorelines are covered in thick vegetation due to the littoral zone cattails. This park is home to the largest oak trees in Manitoba, which are the lone survivors of a fire that occurred in the early 20th century. Many of the water bodies are less than 15 feet deep, which often results in a winter decline in fish populations due to lack of oxygen.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nTurtle Mountain Provincial Park is located within the temperate deciduous forest, and is predominantly covered by Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen). Other vegetation species include balsam poplar and bur oak. Turtle mountain is home to many wildlife species such as moose, white-tailed deer, beaver, raccoons, and various types of birds. The lakes contain various fish species such as rainbow and brown trout.\n\n\nSee also\nList of protected areas of Manitoba\nPainted turtle\nTurtle Mountain (plateau)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nTurtle Mountain Provincial Park at the Manitoba Conservation Web site\nMap of Turtle Mountain Provincial Forest / Turtle Mountain Provincial Park\nTurtle Mountain Provincial Park Management Plan, Manitoba Natural Resources - Parks, 1985\niNaturalist: Turtle Mountain Provincial Park\neBird: Turtle Mountain Provincial Park",

    "text": "A Carnot heat engine is a theoretical heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857, work that led to the fundamental thermodynamic concept of entropy. The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. The efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates.\nA heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.\nEvery thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine.\nThe Carnot engine is a theoretical construct, useful for exploring the efficiency limits of other heat engines.  An actual Carnot engine, however, would be completely impractical to build.\n\n\nCarnot's diagram\nIn the adjacent diagram, from Carnot's 1824 work, Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, there are \"two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric. We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.\" Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power, i.e., \"work\", by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body A to body B.\nIt also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator.\n\n\nModern diagram\n\nThe previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine. The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine. In the diagram, the \"working body\" (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat Q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, air, etc. Although in those early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically QH was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; QC was typically removed by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work, W, is transmitted by the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which in turn was typically used to power a pulley so as to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as \"weight lifted through a height\".\n\n\nCarnot cycle\n\nThe Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:\n\nReversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the \"hot\" temperature, TH (isothermal heat addition or absorption). During this step (A to B) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings. The temperature of the gas (the system) does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermic. The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy QH and of entropy ΔSH = QH / TH from the high temperature reservoir.\nIsentropic (reversible adiabatic) expansion of the gas (isentropic work output). For this step (B to C) the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated, thus they neither gain nor lose heat. The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy. The gas expansion causes it to cool to the \"cold\" temperature, TC. The entropy remains unchanged.\nReversible isothermal compression of the gas at the \"cold\" temperature, TC (isothermal heat rejection) (C to D). Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it (such as through the return compression of a piston), while causing an amount of waste heat QC < 0 (with the standard sign convention for heat) and of entropy ΔSC = QC/TC < 0 to flow out of the gas to the low temperature reservoir. (In magnitude, this is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step 1. The entropy decreases in isothermal compression since the multiplicity of the system decreases with the volume.) In terms of magnitude, the recompression work performed by the surroundings in this step is less than the work performed on the surroundings in step 1 because it occurs at a lower pressure due to the lower temperature (i.e. the resistance to compression is lower under step 3 than the force of expansion under step 1). We can refer to the first law of thermodynamics to explain this behavior: ΔU= W+Q .\nIsentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input) (D to A). Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed. During this step, the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed. This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas, compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to TH. The entropy remains unchanged. At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1.\n\n\nCarnot's theorem\n\nCarnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          η\n          \n            I\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            W\n            \n              Q\n              \n                \n                  H\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              T\n              \n                \n                  C\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              T\n              \n                \n                  H\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta _{I}={\\frac {W}{Q_{\\mathrm {H} }}}=1-{\\frac {T_{\\mathrm {C} }}{T_{\\mathrm {H} }}}}\n  \n\n\nExplanation\nThis maximum efficiency ηI is defined as above:\n\nW is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work),\nQH is the heat put into the system (heat energy entering the system),\nTC is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir, and\nTH is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir.\nA corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.\nIt is easily shown that the efficiency η is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process. This means the total entropy of system and surroundings (the entropies of the hot furnace, the \"working fluid\" of the heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the \"working fluid\" completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general and more realistic case of an irreversible process, the total entropy of this combined system would increase.)\nSince the \"working fluid\" comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function, the change in entropy of the \"working fluid\" system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.\n\n\nEfficiency of real heat engines\nFor a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.\nThe internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system W is equal to the net heat put into the system, the sum of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n > 0 taken up and the waste heat \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q_{\\text{C}}}\n  \n < 0 given off:\n\nFor real engines, stages 1 and 3 of the Carnot cycle, in which heat is absorbed by the \"working fluid\" from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively, no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.\nDuring heat transfer from the hot reservoir at \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n, and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. \nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        \n          S\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta S_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat.\n\nwhere the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly lesser than \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n, in this process.\nSo, one would get:\n\nSimilarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        \n          S\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta S_{\\text{C}}}\n  \n< 0 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:\n\nwhere, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly greater than \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{C}}}\n  \n.\nWe have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here.

For the Carnot engine, the entire process is 'reversible', and Equation (7) is an equality. Hence, the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine.\nEquation (7) signifies that the total entropy of system and surroundings (the fluid and the two reservoirs) increases for the real engine, because (in a surroundings-based analysis) the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q_{\\text{C}}}\n  \n flows into it at the fixed temperature \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{C}}}\n  \n, is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n leaves it at its fixed temperature \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{H}}}\n  \n. The inequality in Equation (7) is essentially the statement of the Clausius theorem.\nAccording to the second theorem, \"The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance\".\n\n\nThe Carnot engine and Rudolf Diesel\nIn 1892 Rudolf Diesel patented an internal combustion engine inspired by the Carnot engine. Diesel knew a Carnot engine is an ideal that cannot be built, but he thought he had invented a working approximation. His principle was unsound, but in his struggle to implement it he developed a practical Diesel engine.\nThe conceptual problem was how to achieve isothermal expansion in an internal combustion engine, since burning fuel at the highest temperature of the cycle would only raise the temperature further. Diesel's patented solution was: having achieved the highest temperature just by compressing the air, to add a small amount of fuel at a controlled rate, such that heating caused by burning the fuel would be counteracted by cooling caused by air expansion as the piston moved. Hence all the heat from the fuel would be transformed into work during the isothermal expansion, as required by Carnot's theorem.\nFor the idea to work a small mass of fuel would have to be burnt in a huge mass of air. Diesel first proposed a working engine that would compress air to 250 atmospheres at 800 °C (1,450 °F), then cycle to one atmosphere at 20 °C (50 °F). However, this was well beyond the technological capabilities of the day, since it implied a compression ratio of 60:1. Such an engine, if it could have been built, would have had an efficiency of 73%. (In contrast, the best steam engines of his day achieved 7%.)\nAccordingly, Diesel sought to compromise. He calculated that, were he to reduce the peak pressure to a less ambitious 90 atmospheres, he would sacrifice only 5% of the thermal efficiency. Seeking financial support, he published the \"Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Engine to Take the Place of the Steam Engine and All Presently Known Combustion Engines\" (1893). Endorsed by scientific opinion, including Lord Kelvin, he won the backing of Krupp and Maschinenfabrik Augsburg. He clung to the Carnot cycle as a symbol. But years of practical work failed to achieve an isothermal combustion engine, nor could have done, since it requires such an enormous quantity of air that it cannot develop enough power to compress it. Furthermore, controlled fuel injection turned out to be no easy matter.\nEven so, the Diesel engine slowly evolved over 25 years to become a practical high-compression air engine, its fuel injected near the end of the compression stroke and ignited by the heat of compression, capable by 1969 of 40% efficiency.\n\n\nAs a macroscopic construct\nThe Carnot heat engine is, ultimately, a theoretical construct based on an idealized thermodynamic system.  On a practical human-scale level the Carnot cycle has proven a valuable model, as in advancing the development of the diesel engine.  However, on a macroscopic scale limitations placed by the model's assumptions prove it impractical, and, ultimately, incapable of doing any work. As such, per Carnot's theorem, the Carnot engine may be thought as the theoretical limit of macroscopic scale heat engines rather than any practical device that could ever be built.\nFor example, for the isothermal expansion part of the Carnot cycle, the following \ninfinitesimal conditions must be satisfied simultaneously at every step in the expansion:\n\nThe hot reservoir temperature TH is infinitesimally higher than the system gas temperature T so heat flow (energy transfer) from the hot reservoir to the gas is made without increasing T (via infinitesimal work on the surroundings by the gas as another energy transfer); if TH is significantly higher than T, then T may be not uniform through the gas so the system would deviate from thermal equilibrium as well as not being a reversible process (i.e. not a Carnot cycle) or T might increase noticeably so it would not be an isothermal process.\nThe force externally applied on the piston (opposite to the internal force on the piston by the gas) needs to be infinitesimally reduced externally. Without this assistance, it would not be possible to follow a gas PV (Pressure-Volume) curve downward at a constant T since following this curve means that the gas-to-piston force decreases (P decreases) as the volume expands (the piston moves outward). If this assistance is so strong that the volume expansion is significant, the system may deviate from thermal equilibrium, and the process fail to be reversible (and thus not a Carnot cycle).\nSuch \"infinitesimal\" requirements as these (and others) cause the Carnot cycle to take an infinite amount of time, rendering the production of work impossible. \nOther practical requirements that make the Carnot cycle impractical to realize include fine control of the gas, and perfect thermal contact with the surroundings (including high and low temperature reservoirs).\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\nEpisode 46.

    "text": "James Rivers Barrington Stewart (3 July 1913 – 6 February 1962) was a noted Australian archaeologist of Cyprus and Ancient south-west Asia at the University of Sydney.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nStewart was born in Sydney and died at Bathurst, New South Wales and was a descendant of a line of Bathurst landed gentry. He spent much of his childhood in Europe attended secondary school in Australia and enrolled at The Leys School in Cambridge in 1930, at the age of 17, then attended Cambridge University the following year. His mother died in January 1932, leaving him £7000. He visited Bagdad, Damascus, Aleppo, and Baalbeck on his way to England in 1932. He married Eleanor Neal in England on 1 July 1935 and the two travelled to Australia for a visit. James won a Wilkins Fellowship, which he used for them both to travel to the Near East with a short stay in Cyprus. They arrived in Istanbul in January 1936, and they spent time digging and collecting.\n\n\nWar service and first marriage\nJim volunteered to join the British army in May 1940 and requested to be posted in Cyprus. Before leaving England for a short trip to Australia with Eleanor he left £300 for the publication of his work and bequeathed his massive personal library to the Cyprus Museum. He reported for duty at Haifa on 30 January 1941, but was captured by the end of the year and spent the rest of the war as a German prisoner of war. After liberation by American troops he returned to England in April 1945.\n\n\nMove to Australia and marriage\nIn 1947 Stewart made what was intended to be a two-week visit to Australia via Cyprus, but there met Dorothy Evelyn (Eve) Dray (born August 1914), who grew up in Cairo and shared his interest in Cyprus having made her first trip in 1926 then returned after completing her education in 1937. Stewart arranged for Eve to come to Australia as his ‘technical assistant’.\n\n\nAcademic career in Australia and second marriage\nStewart obtained a position at the Sydney University, where he lectured in the History department, at the Nicholson Museum, becoming the first person to teach archaeology at an Australian university. He lobbied for the establishment of a Department of Archaeology, which was created in 1948. Stewart divorced Eleanor and married Eve in 1952, and they moved to Mount Pleasant at Bathurst, where he had his own laboratory and library. Stewart was appointed Professor of Near Eastern Studies in 1960 but died just 18 months into his tenure on 6 February 1962. Eve worked for nearly fifty years after his death to complete her husband's work. A large collection of his Cyprus material was donated to the Nicholson Museum in Sydney, while the  British Museum acquired the artefacts from two tomb groups as a result of his excavations at Bellapais-Vounous in 1937–1938.\nHe built up a large collection of coins from Rome, Byzantium, Cyprus, and the Crusades.\n\n\nPublications\nStewart, J.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1307208",
    "text": "James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos,  (6 January 1673 – 9 August 1744) was a British landowner and politician who represented Hereford in the English and British House of Commons from 1698 until 1714, when he succeeded to his father's peerage as Baron Chandos and started sitting in the House of Lords. He was subsequently created Earl of Carnarvon, and then Duke of Chandos in 1719.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nBrydges was born on the 6 January 1673 at Dewsall, Herefordshire, the fourth, but eldest surviving son of James Brydges, 8th Baron Chandos and his wife Elizabeth Barnard, daughter of Sir Henry Barnard, merchant of St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and of Bridgnorth, Shropshire.  He was educated at Westminster School in 1686, and at New College, Oxford, from 1690 to 1692. He was at the Wolfenbüttel academy from 1692 to 1694 and in 1694 he was elected to the Royal Society.\n\n\nPolitical career\nBrydges was a Freeman of Ludlow in 1697, and was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Hereford at the 1698 English general election. In 1700 he was a member of the Old East India Company. He was returned as MP for Hereford in contests at the two general elections of 1701 and unopposed at the 1702 English general election. From 1702 to 1703 he was Commissioner of public accounts and was a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral from 1703 to April 1705. He was returned unopposed at Hereford again at the 1705 English general election. From April 1705 Brydges was paymaster-general of the forces abroad during the War of the Spanish Succession. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned for Truro, and in a contest for Hereford, and opted to sit at Hereford. In 1710 he was admitted to the Inner Temple. He was returned in a contest for Hereford at the 1710 British general election. In 1711 he was a commissioner for taking subscriptions to the South Sea Company. He was returned unopposed at the 1713 British general election.\nBrydges succeeded his father as 9th Baron Chandos on 16 October 1714, and was created Earl of Carnarvon on 19 October 1714. He took up the role of joint clerk of hanaper in reversion in November 1714. In 1718 he became governor of the Levant Company until 1736. He was created Duke of Chandos on 29 April 1719. Brydges also served as Governor of the Royal African Company in the 1720s, recommending John Massey (who would later turn pirate) to serve as engineer for the RAC's fort at the River Gambia. In 1721 he became a governor of Charterhouse. He was Lord Lieutenant of the counties of Hereford and Radnor and steward of crown manors for Radnorshire. He became a member of the Privy Council on 11 November 1721. He was Chancellor of the University of St Andrews (where he established the Chandos Chair of Medicine and Anatomy in 1721)  from 1724 for the rest of his life.  In 1737 he was appointed ranger of Enfield chase 1737. He became one of the founding governors of the Foundling Hospital in 1739.\n\n\nTechnical interests\nAfter Brydges was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1694, he attended their scientific meetings when he could, and up to 1702 served four times on the Society’s Council. He was a friend of the Newtonian John Keill, and dedicatee of his book on Astronomy.  In 1716 Chandos appointed the experimental philosophy lecturer John Theophilus Desaguliers, who was Demonstrator at the Royal Society, to be his chaplain. He used Desaguliers more as a technical adviser than as a clergyman and their correspondence discusses issues that arose during the building of Canons such as ventilation and pipework for garden water features. Desaguliers helped with several technically based business ventures, such as Chandos’s scheme to manufacture soap using potash imported from Africa. His involvement with the York Buildings Company led to a project to use steam power to raise water from the Thames to supply parts of  London. At one time there was a furnace at Canons attempting to obtain traces of gold from various ores and minerals. Although none of his business ventures proved commercially viable his interest in new scientific ideas led the Duke of Chandos to build up an impressive collection of scientific equipment and an observatory at Canons.\n\n\nWealth\nBrydges amassed great wealth through his public offices. The ethics of his financial operations were called into question at the time, but it was generally accepted that people could profit from public office. He continued to engage in speculative investments after being made Duke of Chandos in 1719, but lost money in the South Sea Bubble and the York Buildings Company.\nBrydges built a magnificent house \"at vast expense\" at Cannons, an estate near Edgware in Middlesex. There he ran through several architects prominent in the English Baroque. He began in 1713 with William Talman, whom he dismissed in favour of John James in 1714; James had partly executed his designs before James Gibbs succeeded him in 1715. Howard Colvin (ref) concludes that the south and east elevations, as well as the chapel, were the designs of Gibbs. Brydges dismissed Gibbs in 1719, and completed the house under the supervision of John Price and, in 1723–25, Edward Shepherd. Cannons was demolished in 1747. On its site, now incorporated in Greater London, is Canons Park.\nBrydges is said to have considered building a private road across his own lands between this place and his never completed house in Cavendish Square, London, probably also designed by Gibbs.\n\n\nHandel and Pope\n\nThe Duke is chiefly remembered on account of his connections with George Frideric Handel, for whom he acted as a major patron, and with Alexander Pope, seen as having slandered Chandos in one of his poems. He served as an early patron to his relative George Rodney, later to become famous for his victory at the Battle of the Saintes, during his early career in the navy.\n\n\nChandos and Handel\nBefore Chandos was made a duke, he employed the young composer George Frideric Handel over a period of two years, 1717–18. Handel lived at Cannons, where he composed his oratorio Esther and his pastoral opera Acis and Galatea. Handel also composed the Chandos Anthems for his patron; they were first performed at the parish church of St Lawrence, Little Stanmore, with the composer playing the organ of 1716 which has survived there to the present day.\nIn 1719 Chandos was one of the main subscribers in the Royal Academy of Music, not the currently well-known conservatoire of that name but a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage in London.\n\n\nChandos and Pope\nAlexander Pope, who in one of his Moral Essays (the Epistle to Burlington) was alleged to have ridiculed Cannons under the guise of Timon's Villa, later referred to the Duke in the line, \"Thus gracious Chandos is belov'd at sight\"; but Jonathan Swift, less complimentary, called him \"a great complier with every court\". The poet was caricatured by Hogarth for his supposed servility to Chandos. Pope published a denial of his alleged satire of the Duke's estate, in which he said that the estate of the poem \"differs in every particular from\" Chandos's. According to Pope’s biographer Maynard Mack, Chandos thereafter assured Pope by letter that he believed him, i.e. that the Epistle to Burlington was not intended as a satire of his estate. The malice, indeed, was on the part not of Pope, but of the insinuators and slanderers, the hack writers whom Pope had ridiculed as dunces in his Dunciad; Mack calls the affair a \"falsehood of considerable damage to [Pope's] character\".\n\n\nMarriages and issue\n\nChandos was married three times. On 2 February 1695, he married Mary Lake, daughter of Sir Thomas Lake, of Cannons, Middlesex and his wife Rebecca Langham.\nThe marriage produced two sons who survived childhood:\n\nJohn Brydges, Marquess of Carnarvon (15 January 1703 – 8 April 1727)\nHenry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos (1 February 1708 – 28 November 1771).\nHis first wife Mary died on 15 September 1712. He then married Cassandra Willoughby of Wollaton Hall, the daughter of Francis Willoughby and Emma Barnard on 4 August 1713.\nHis second wife Cassandra died on 18 July 1735. On 18 April 1736, he married Lydia Catherine Van Hatten, the daughter of John Van Hatten and Lydia Davall.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nChandos died in Cannons on 9 August 1744. Chandos and several members of his family (his first two wives) are buried at the Chandos Mausoleum at the Church of St Lawrence, Whitchurch Lane, Little Stanmore, London. His third wife, who survived him, moved to Shaw House, Berkshire where she died in 1750.\nMrs. Elizabeth Montagu in a letter, dated Sandleford, 21 December 1750 to Miss Anstey, wrote: \"My dear Miss Anstey, ... A little before I went to London I lost my very good neighbour, the Dutchess of Chandos, a stroke of the palsy carried her off in a few days: her bodily pains were great, but her mind felt the serenity that gilds the evening of a virtuous life. She quitted the world with that decent fare-well which people take of it, who rather consider it as a place in which they are to impart good than to enjoy it Her character has made a great impression on me, as I think her a rare instance that age could not make conceited and stiff, nor retirement discontented, nor virtue inflexible and severe...\"\n\nIn a letter to Mrs. Donnellan dated Sandleford, 30 December 1750, Mrs. Montagu continued, \"My rich neighbours are dull, and my poor ones are miserable ... The Dutchess of Chandos is greatly missed by the poor in this rigorous season. There is a family at Donnington Castle who are very generous and charitable, but nothing can entirely avail in a part of the world where manufacture decays; daily labour must give daily bread; occasional alms like medicine to the diseased, but can hardly procure constant health. To make the poor happy one must make them industrious...\"\n\n\nSuccession\nChandos was succeeded by his son, Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos, who found the estate so encumbered by debt that a demolition sale of Cannons was held in 1747, which dispersed furnishings and structural elements, with the result that elements of Cannons survive in several English country houses, notably Lord Foley's house, Witley Court at Great Witley, with its chapel (ceiling paintings by Bellucci and stained glass by Joshua Price of York after designs by Francesco Sleter). The pulpit and other fittings from Chandos's chapel were reinstalled in the parish church at Fawley, Buckinghamshire, by John Freeman of Fawley Court.\nThe 1st Duke's sister, The Hon. Mary Brydges, married Theophilus Leigh. They were the great-grandparents of Jane Austen.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nHoward Colvin, 1995 (3rd ed.).

At that time, large quantities of charcoal were needed for the smelting of iron ores. Since the production of charcoal required large amounts of slowly-regenerating wood, the use of coal was studied. The use of pure coal was difficult because of the amount of liquid and solid by-products that were generated. In order to improve the handling the coal was initially treated as wood in kilns to produce coke.\nAround 1684, John Clayton discovered that coal gas generated from coal was combustible. He described his discovery in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.\n\n\nSee also\nBergius process\nClean coal technology\nCoal tar\nFischer–Tropsch process\nPetrochemistry\nSynthetic Liquid Fuels Program\nCoking factory\n\n\nReferences",

She was the 400 m gold medallist at the 1975 Pan American Games, where she also won relay medals. She twice represented Canada at the Summer Olympics (1972, 1976) and was a three-time Canadian national sprint champion.\n\n\nCareer\nBorn in Burnaby, British Columbia, she made her international debut at age seventeen at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games. She was eliminated in the heats of the 400 m, but managed to secure a bronze medal with the Canadian women's 4 × 100 m relay team, which included Joan Hendry, Patty Loverock and Stephanie Berto. She went on to attend the University of Victoria and broke several track records, including one for the 300 metres which remains unbeaten.\nYakubowich ran at the 1971 Pan American Games and made her first individual final, taking sixth in the 400 m. With the Canadian relay team she missed a medal, taking fourth some distance behind bronze medallists Jamaica. Her first national titles came at the 1972 Canadian Track and Field Championships, where she claimed both the 200 m and 400 m races – the latter in a championship record of 54.1 seconds. An Olympic debut came the following year at the 1972 Munich Games, but the 19-year-old failed to make it out of the heats. She gained her first individual medal a year later at the 1973 Pacific Conference Games, taking 400 m bronze.\nThe 1975 season proved to be the peak of her career. First, she won the third and final national title of her career in the 200 m. She was chosen to compete in four events at the 1975 Pan American Games. She placed sixth in the 200 m final, recording a lifetime best time of 23.34 seconds. She gave a dominant performance in the women's 400 m final, defeating American Debra Sapenter by over half a second to win the gold medal in 51.62 seconds – another lifetime personal record and also a games record. Another games record and gold medal came with the 4 × 400 m relay team of Margaret McGowen, Rachelle Campbell, and Joanne McTaggart, which she led off to victory to 3:30.36 minutes. A third medal of the games for Yakubowich came in the 4 × 100 metres relay: running the anchor leg off McTaggart and 100 m minor medallists Patty Loverock and Marjorie Bailey the team took the bronze.\nShe made two further high-profile international appearances in her career following her Pan American success. She returned to the Olympic stage at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, running in the 400 m quarter-finals and placing eighth in the relay final on home turf alongside fellow Canadians Margaret Stride, Campbell and Yvonne Saunders. Her last outing was for the Americas team at the 1977 IAAF World Cup: running with Cuba's Aurelia Pentón and Jamaicans Jacqueline Pusey and Helen Blake, she placed fifth.\n\n\nInternational competitions\n\n\nNational titles\nCanadian Track and Field Championships\n200 m: 1972, 1975\n400 m: 1972\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJoyce Yakubowich at World Athletics\nJoyce Yakubowich at Team Canada\nJoyce Yakubowich at Olympics.com\nJoyce Yakubowich at Olympedia",

Solomennaya shlyapka) is a 1974 Soviet musical comedy television film directed by Leonid Kvinikhidze based on a play by Eugène Marin Labiche and Marc-Michel. The film's music was composed by Isaac Schwartz.\nThe film tells of the extravagant life of a charming rentier who thinks nothing of consequences, but living on credit finally wakes him up, forcing to end his bachelor's life by marrying the daughter of a wealthy earl for her money. All goes well until a horse eats a certain straw hat, triggering a series of farcical events interwoven with the marriage.\n\n\nPlot\nCharming playboy and libertine Leonidas Fadinard plans a calculated marriage to the daughter of a wealthy provincial gardener, Nonancourt. As the wedding procession makes its way, the groom hurries ahead to his home for last-minute preparations. Along the way, he stops briefly, during which his horse eats the straw hat of Madame Beauperthuis, a married woman having a clandestine rendezvous with her military lover in the woods. Faced with the threat of exposure to her jealous husband, Madame and her lover storm into Fadinard’s home, occupy the bridal suite, and refuse to leave until he replaces the hat with an identical one.\nPressed by his provincial in-laws to proceed with the wedding, Fadinard scrambles to resolve the predicament. The seemingly ordinary hat turns out to be rare and difficult to replace. His first stop is a hat shop owned by a widow he had romanced and abandoned months earlier. Despite her bitterness, she directs him to a baroness who owns a similar hat.\nArriving at the baroness’s home, Fadinard is mistaken for an expected Italian tenor. He secures the hat as payment for his supposed performance, only to discover it’s the wrong one. The real tenor soon arrives, sparking chaos, and Fadinard learns the sought-after hat was gifted to the baroness’s godmother. Pursued by the increasingly confused wedding procession, he rushes to retrieve it.\nAs night falls, Fadinard discovers the hat's owner and Madame Beauperthuis are the same person, still at his house. Confiding in her husband, Fadinard triggers a dramatic confrontation when the man, armed with pistols, heads to Fadinard’s home. Meanwhile, the frustrated wedding party, having spent the day following Fadinard’s chaotic search, loses patience, declares the wedding void, and reclaims their gifts.\nIn a twist, one of the unwrapped presents reveals a straw hat identical to the original. Fadinard hands it to Madame Beauperthuis, who convinces her husband of her innocence. With the truth finally out, the bride’s family forgives Fadinard, and the wedding is back on track.\n\n\nCast\nAndrei Mironov - Leonidas Fadinard\nVladislav Strzhelchik - Antoine  Nonancourt\nZinovy Gerdt - Tardiveau\nYefim Kopelyan - Beauperthuis\nLyudmila Gurchenko - Bocardon\nYekaterina Vasilyeva - Anaïs Beaupertuis\nAlisa Freindlich - La baronne de Champigny\nMikhail Kozakov - Achille de Rosalba\nIgor Kvasha - Émile Tavernier\nAleksandr Benyaminov - Vezinet\nVladimir Tatosov - Félix\nIrina Maguto - Virginie\nMarina Starykh - Hélène\nSergey Migitsko - Bobin\nMikhail Boyarsky - Ninardi\nYevgenia Vetlova - minstrel\nAlexander Kolpashnikov - minstrel\n\n\nProduction\nThe idea of the film appeared to Leonid Kvinikhidze immediately after the filming of the film \"Failure of Engineer Garin\". Initially, Oleg Borisov was considered for the main role, but he needed urgent treatment, and Andrei Mironov received the role (Lyudmila Gurchenko later recalled: \"We gathered to frame the brilliant Andrew, and we did it\"). Nonna Terentyeva was originally invited to play the role of Clara, but Gurchenko turned out to be more convincing at the auditions. In the episodic role of a simple lamplighter, the playwright Mikhail Roshchin appears, who then had an affair with Ekaterina Vasilyeva, who starred in the film. Alisa Freindlich, known to the audience only for her dramatic roles, appeared in the cinema for the first time in a comedic image. Andrey Mironov learned to stay in the saddle right during the filming.\nThe film became the first notable role for Mikhail Boyarsky: \"The tenacious eye of the directors figured me out as a certain artist \"young, like an Italian.\" I was hairy, somewhat like an Italian, and in general I didn't spoil the picture.\" The actor spoke highly of Alisa Freindlich, who helped him with valuable advices: \"Behind her fan, you could hide any aspiring artist\".\n\nThere was a relaxed atmosphere on the set: the actors acted out each other, indulged in small playful escapades. Kvinikhidze, who appreciated improvisations, ordered not to turn off the camera, no matter what happened. As a result, the film included a lot of episodes that were not in the script — for example, scenes when a wig falls off the Mikhail Kozakov's character during a duel, or when Mironov kisses Freindlich in the presence of Boyarsky. Kozakov approached the image of the Vicomte de Rosalba with a certain freedom, creating the image of a dandy with an uncertain sexual orientation; hearing the actor's remark about \"a meadow with cows and a shepherd boy\", Mironov laughed: \"You're crazy! They'll ban everything to hell!\", but the scene was included in the film. Alexander Beniaminov (Vezinet) could not remember the author's text and constantly improvised.\nFilming was conducted in Tartu and in St. Petersburg.\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nSongs from the film were included in various albums and compilations. In 2009, almost all songs were included in Isaac Schwartz' compilation Песни из кинофильмов\nIn 2021, an official soundtrack was released by Bomba-Piter. However, it excluded the most famous song - \"Женюсь, женюсь\" (\"I'm Getting Married, I'm getting Married\") performed by Andrei Mironov.\n\nSee Songkino.ru for the text of the songs (in Russian)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Straw Hat at IMDb\nThe Straw Hat, Episode 1 on YouTube on 5TV.

    "text": "Jemdet Nasr (Arabic: جمدة نصر) (also Jamdat Nasr and Jemdat Nasr) is a tell or settlement mound in Babil Governorate, Iraq that is best known as the eponymous type site for the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 3100–2900 BC), under an alternate periodization system termed the Uruk III period, and was one of the oldest Sumerian cities. It is adjacent to the much larger Neo-Babylonian and Sassanian site of Tell Barguthiat (also Tell Bargouthiat) to the northeast. The site was first excavated in 1926 by Stephen Langdon, who found Proto-Cuneiform clay tablets in a large mudbrick building thought to be the ancient administrative centre of the site.\nA second season took place in 1928, but this season was very poorly recorded. Subsequent excavations in the 1980s under British archaeologist Roger Matthews were, among other things, undertaken to relocate the building excavated by Langdon. These excavations have shown that the site was also occupied during the Ubaid, Uruk and Early Dynastic I periods. Based on texts found there mentioning an ensi of NI.RU that is thought to be its ancient name. During ancient times the city was on a canal linking it to other major Sumerian centers.\n\n\nArchaeology\n\nIn 1925, the team that was excavating at Kish received reports that clay tablets and painted pottery had been found by locals at a site called Jemdet Nasr, some 26 kilometres (16 mi) northeast of Kish. The site was subsequently visited on 6 January 1926 by Langdon and Henry Field and it was decided that an excavation was necessary after several pictographic tablets were found. Some burnt grain were recovered and later determined to be cone wheat (Triticum turgidum) the earliest exemplar of that in the region. The first season at Jemdet Nasr took place in 1926, directed by Stephen Langdon, professor of Assyriology at Oxford University and director of the excavations at Kish. The excavation lasted over a month and employed between 12 and 60 workmen. Langdon was not an archaeologist, and even by the standards of his time, as exemplified by Leonard Woolley's work at Ur, his record-keeping was very poor. He contracted a fever at Jemdet Nasr from which he never fully recovered, which ended the excavation season. As a result, much information on the exact find spots of artefacts, including the tablets, was lost. A large, 4,500 square meter (92 meters by 48 meters) mudbrick building was excavated in which a large collection of proto-cuneiform clay tablets was found. The bricks used were of the Riemchen (20 X 8 5 x 8 cm) and Flachziegel (23 x 9 x 6 5 cm) types, with some of the former baked and all of the latter. All baked bricks were pierced with three one centimeter holes before baking. The finds from this season were divided between the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Field Museum in Chicago; the latter two co-sponsors of the excavations in Kish and Jemdet Nasr. A second season was organized in 1928, lasting between 13 and 22 March and directed by L.Ch. Watelin, the then-field director at Kish, accompanied by Henry Field. This time, some 120 workmen were employed. Excavation ended after 11 days (of the 20 planned) due to a plague of locusts. Watelin kept almost no records of his excavations at the site but from the few notes that survive he seems to have been digging in the same area as Langdon.\nIn 1988 and 1989, two further excavation seasons were carried out under the direction of British archaeologist Roger Matthews. The aims of the 1988 season were to conduct an archaeological survey of the site, to revisit the large building on Mound B that had been excavated by Langdon but very poorly published, and to explore a  Neo-Babylonian or later baked brick building that was visible on the surface of Mound A. During the 1989 season, again directed by Matthews, a dig-house was constructed on the site. Research focused on Mound B with the aim to further explore the ancient occupation in that area. No work was carried out on Mound A. Further excavation seasons, although planned, were prevented by the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990 and no fieldwork has been carried out at the site since then. The excavation archives for this dig are still in Baghdad but field photographs have now been digitized.\nThe importance of the findings at Jemdet Nasr were immediately recognized after the 1920s excavations. During a large conference in Baghdad in 1930, the Jemdet Nasr period was inserted into the Mesopotamian chronology between the Uruk period and the Early Dynastic period, with Jemdet Nasr being the eponymous type site. Since then, the assemblage characteristic for the Jemdet Nasr period has been attested at other sites in south–central Iraq, including Abu Salabikh, Fara, Nippur, Ur and Uruk. The period is now generally dated to 3100–2900 BC.\n\n\nJemdet Nasr and its environment\nThe name Jemdet Nasr translates as \"Small mound of Nasr\", named after a prominent sheikh in the early twentieth century. Jemdet Nasr is located in modern-day Babil Governorate in central Iraq, or ancient southern Mesopotamia. Before the implementation of the Musaiyib irrigation project in the 1950s, the site lay in a semi-desert area. Today, the site is located in an area that is heavily irrigated for agriculture. The tell consists of three mounds, A, B, and C, that are located adjacent to each other. Mound A is 160 by 140 metres (520 by 460 ft), 2.9 metres (9 ft 6 in) high and has a total area of 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres). Mound B, located immediately to the northeast of A, measures 350 by 300 metres (1,150 by 980 ft) for a total area of 7.5 hectares (19 acres), reaching up to 3.5 metres (11 ft) above the modern level of the plain. Mound C lies about 500 meters to the east of Mound B and is largely made up of baked brick fragments with a few Islamic period sherds found on the surface.\n\n\nOccupation history\nOccupation is thought to have started at least in the Ubaid period and occupied until the Early Dynastic I period. The Ubaid occupation of the site has not been explored through excavation but is inferred from pottery dating to that period, and clay sickles and a fragment of a clay cone, that were found on the surface of Mound A. Both the 1920s as well as the 1980s excavations have resulted in considerable quantities of Middle Uruk period (mid-4th millennium BC) pottery. It seems that during this period, both Mounds A and B were occupied. During the Late Uruk period (late 4th millennium BC), an extensive settlement must have existed at Mound B, but its nature is again hard to ascertain due to a lack of well-excavated archaeological contexts.\nThe Jemdet Nasr period settlement (3100–2900 BC) extended over an area of 4–6 hectares (9.9–14.8 acres) of Mound B. Some 0.4 hectares (0.99 acres) was occupied by the single, large mudbrick building that was excavated by Langdon, and where the clay tablets were found. In and around this building, kilns for firing pottery and baking bread were found, and other crafts like weaving. Many of these crafts, and also agricultural production, feature prominently in the proto-cuneiform tablets – indicating that much of the economy was centrally controlled and administered. In the texts from Jemdet Nasr, the term \"SANGA AB\" appears, which may denote a high official. The building was probably destroyed by fire. There is no evidence for far-reaching trade-contacts; no precious stones or other exotic materials were found. However, the homogeneity of the pottery that is typical for the Jemdet Nasr period suggests that there must have been intensive regional contacts. This idea is strengthened by the finding of sealings on the tablets of Jemdet Nasr that list a number of cities in southern Mesopotamia, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur, Uruk and Tell Uqair.\nAfter the destruction of the Jemdet Nasr building, occupation of the site seems to have continued uninterrupted, as pottery forms show a gradual transition from Jemdet Nasr forms into the Early Dynastic I repertoire. At least one building of this period has been excavated at Mound B. Based on the distribution of Early Dynastic pottery on the surface, the settlement seems to have been smaller than during the Jemdet Nasr period. A single Early Dynastic I grave was found on Mound A, but no further evidence for occupation during this period. The building that was visible on the surface of the mound was probably a Parthian fortress, but due to a lack of well-dated pottery from this area this dating could not be ascertained.\n\n\nMaterial culture\nApart from the proto-cuneiform tablets, Jemdet Nasr gained fame for its painted polychrome and monochrome pottery. Painted pots display both geometric motifs and depictions of animals, including birds, fish, goats, scorpions, snakes and trees. However, the majority of the pottery was undecorated, and the fact that most painted pottery seems to have come from the large central building suggests that it had a special function. Pottery forms included large jars, bowls, spouted vessels and cups.\n\nA number of cylinder seals, stamp seals and cylinder seal impressions on the clay tablets have been found at Jemdet Nasr. Stylistically, these seals are a continuation of the preceding Uruk period. The cylinder seals display humans as well as animals in a very crude style. Over 80 of the clay tablets bore a sealing, showing humans, animals, buildings, containers and more abstract designs. None of the sealings on the tablets was made by the seals that were found at the site, indicating that sealing either occurred outside Jemdet Nasr or that seals could also be made of perishable materials. One sealing, found on thirteen tablets, lists the names of a number of cities surrounding Jemdet Nasr, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur and Uruk.\nThe exact findspots of many objects retrieved during the 1920s excavations could no longer be reconstructed due to the poor publication standards, so that many can only be dated by comparing them with what has been found at other sites that do have a good stratigraphy and chronological control. Many of the objects found during the 1920s could be dated from the Uruk period to the Early Dynastic I period. Very few copper objects were found in Jemdet Nasr. These included an adze, a fish-hook and a small pendant in the shape of a goose. A particular type of stone vessel with ledge handles and a rim decorated by incised rectangles has so far not been found at any other site. The function of a number of flat polished stones incised with lines forming a cross is uncertain, but it has been suggested that they were used as bolas. They are common in Uruk period sites. Because clay as a raw material is widely available around Jemdet Nasr, clay objects are very common. Clay objects included baked clay bricks, clay sickles, fragments of drain pipes, spatulas, spindle whorls and miniature wagon wheels. Beads, small pendants and figurines were made of bone, shell, stone, clay and frit.\n\n\nProto-cuneiform texts\nThe clay tablets that were reported to the excavators of Kish in 1925 may not have been the first to come from Jemdet Nasr. Already before 1915, a French antiquities dealer had bought tablets that reportedly came from the site through looting. He sold them in lots to the French dealer Dumani Frères, the Louvre and the British Museum, while those resold to Dumani Frères were subsequently purchased by James Breasted for the Oriental Institute in Chicago. Another group of tablets was purchased in Kish in the 1930s and of these it was asserted that they came from Jemdet Nasr, although this is unlikely due to stylistic differences between these tablets and those excavated at Jemdet Nasr in 1926. During the first regular excavation season in 1926, between 150 and 180 tablets were found in Mound B; the error margin resulting from gaps in the administration kept by the excavators. Some of these tablets may actually have come from the 1928 excavations under Watelin. The tablets from the regular excavations are stored in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad. Two Uruk V period (c. 3500-3350 BC) clay tablets, called \"numerical tablets\" or \"impressed tablets\", were found at the site.\nThe Jemdet Nasr tablets are written in proto-cuneiform script. Proto-cuneiform is thought to have arisen in the second half of the 4th millennium BC. While at first it was characterized by a small set of symbols that were predominantly pictographs, by the time of the Jemdet Nasr period, there was already a trend toward more abstract and simpler designs. It is also during this period that the script acquired its iconic wedge-shaped appearance. While the language in which these tablets were written cannot be identified with certainty, it is thought to have been Sumerian. Contemporary archives have been found at Uruk, Tell Uqair and Khafajah.\nThe tablets from Jemdet Nasr are primarily administrative accounts; long lists of various objects, foodstuffs and animals that were probably distributed among the population from a centralized authority. Thus, these texts document, among other things, the cultivation, processing and redistribution of grain, the counting of herds of cattle, the distribution of secondary products like beer, fish, fruit and textiles, as well as various objects of undefinable nature. Six tablets deal with the calculation of agricultural field areas from surface measurements, which is the earliest attested occurrence of such calculations.\n\n\nSee also\nAncient City Seals\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nKullaba\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nEnglund, Robert K.; Grégoire, Jean-Pierre (1991), The Proto-Cuneiform Texts from Jemdet Nasr.

    "text": "Sir Robert Carr, 3rd Baronet (c. 1637 – 14 November 1682) was an English politician of the Restoration period who served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the reign of Charles II.\n\n\nEarly life and family\nCarr was the only surviving son of Sir Robert Carr, 2nd Baronet and Mary Gargrave, daughter of Sir Richard Gargrave. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a Fellow Commoner on 6 March 1654, matriculated in 1655, and took his master's degree the same year. His father had been a Royalist and a supporter of the exiled king, Charles II. At the Restoration in 1660, Carr was identified as one of the potential Knights of the Royal Oak with an estate valued at £4,000.\nIn 1662 he married his mother's maid, Isabel Falkingham, with whom he had one daughter, Elizabeth Carr. In March 1664 he then married, likely bigamously, Elizabeth Bennet, daughter of Sir John Bennet and Dorothy Crofts. His daughter by this marriage, Isabella, married John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol. Through Carr's second wife's brother, Sir Henry Bennet (later Lord Arlington), Carr was afforded useful connections to the royal court. He was knighted at some point prior to 1665.\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1665 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire on the anti-Presbyterian interest; he would hold the seat until his death in 1682. The same year he was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Lincolnshire. He became a very active member of the Cavalier Parliament, and was appointed to 391 committees and made over one hundred speeches.\nOn 14 August 1667 Carr inherited his father's baronetcy and estates, with an annual value of approximately £6,000. He established a London townhouse which became notorious for heavy drinking, and in 1667 Sir Henry Belasyse was killed in a duel after drinking with Thomas Porter and Carr.\nCarr was an opponent of the Earl of Clarendon and took an active part in his downfall in 1667. He supported the motion for Clarendon's impeachment, both in the debate and vote. Carr led an inquiry into the miscarriages of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In late 1669 he attended on the Duke of Albemarle to express the thanks of the Commons for the duke's service. From 1670 to 1671 he sat on a committee to consider the union of England and Scotland.\n\n\nMember of the Court faction\n\nIn November 1670 he was one of five prominent MPs who crossed the floor to support the Court faction. In 1671 he was appointed a gentleman of the privy chamber, likely in reward for his sustained support for the king's policies. On 22 February 1672 Carr was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and made a member of the Privy Council of England after his brother-in-law obtained a life patent for the role for Carr. Almost immediately, Carr was forced to support the Declaration of Indulgence to which he had previously been opposed. He later told the Commons that he \"Likes neither the Papists nor the dissenters. But the Papists have fought for the King, the others have not; therefore would have more kindness for them.\"\nIn 1674, the French embassy reported that Arlington hoped to use Carr's prestige in the Commons to win support for the continuance of the Anglo-French alliance against the Dutch Republic. Despite this, there is evidence that Carr's sympathies were with the Dutch at this time. Carr spent much of the 1674 session defending his brother-in-law, Arlington, from impeachment by the Commons. He was also appointed to the committees to inspect the Scottish Army Act and to inquire into the condition of Ireland. In 1676, he incurred heavy betting losses at Newmarket Racecourse which forced him to mortgage most of his estate for £20,000.\nCarr's support for the Court faction led to him being labelled \"doubly vile\" by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Carr spoke repeatedly in support of increased supply; he helped to prepare the addresses asking the King to withstand the danger from France and promising a credit of £200,000 for developing a naval programme. He also spoke in the Commons against encroaching on the royal prerogative by demanding an alliance with the Dutch Republic.\n\n\nLater career\nOn 12 June 1678 he was removed from the Privy Council after becoming caught in a scandal regarding the Earl of Lindsey's suspected use of militia to intimidate voters in Stamford. Nonetheless, following the Popish Plot, Carr defended giving commissions to Roman Catholic officers and supported allowing James, Duke of York to retain his seat in the House of Lords.\nCarr continued to represent Lincolnshire in the Habeas Corpus Parliament and Exclusion Bill Parliament, during which he was a moderately active member. On 7 May 1679 he helped to prepare reasons for invalidating the pardon given to Lord Danby. He did not speak in the exclusion debate, but two months later he snubbed the Duke of York, who passed through Grantham on his way to Scotland. In 1680, Carr was restored to the Privy Council, but refused to convey the king's message to the Commons that the Exclusion Bill would be vetoed. He made no significant impact during the Oxford Parliament and died on 14 November 1682.\n\n\nReferences",

They were first instituted by Tsar Ivan IV (r. 1533–1584) in 1581 as a temporary measure, but eventually became permanent.\n\n\nHistory\nUnder the provisions of Article 57 of the Sudebnik of 1497 promulgated by Grand Prince Ivan III, serfs were permitted to transfer from one estate to another \"once a year, during the week before and a week after St. George's Day in the autumn\" (November 26, the Feast of the Dedication of the Church of St. George in Kiev) provided they had fulfilled all corvée (barshchina, барщина in Russian) and/or quitrent (obrok, оброк in Russian) obligations and had paid a fee, the pozhiloe (пожилое), to the landlord they were leaving. In Ivan IV's Sudebnik of 1550, this right of transfer remained (Article 88), but the pozhiloe was increased and a tax (the transition fee or za povoz – за повоз) was added.\nDue to the hardships brought about by Ivan IV's Livonian War (1558–1582), the excesses of the oprichnina (1565–1572), Tatar raids (such as the one on Moscow in 1571) and a series of crop failures and other natural disasters, the tsar temporarily suspended this right of movement or transfer in an ukaz (decree) issued in 1581.  This move, in fact, proved permanent, as it was never lifted.  His son's government made this limitation permanent in an ukaz of September 1, 1597 (thought on November 24 of that year, it made the statute of limitations (called \"fixed years\" – urochniye leta, урочные лета) on the return of run-away serfs five years).  The Ulozhenie of 1649 did away with this statute of limitations, and this is often seen as the final element of full-blown serfdom in Russia.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "A pop gun (also written as popgun or pop-gun) is a toy gun that was made by American inventor Edward Lewis and uses air pressure to fire a small tethered or untethered projectile (such as cork or foam) out of a barrel, most often via piston action though sometimes via spring pressure. Other variants do not launch the obstruction, but simply create a loud noise. This mechanism consists of a hollow cylindrical barrel which is sealed at one end with the projectile and at the other with a long-handled plunger.\n\n\nConstruction\nVarious types of popguns have been described, such as popguns made of a hollowed-out alder, willow, or elder branch in Texas and in Appalachia in the early 1900s, used to fire a wad of paper. Similarly an 1864 American children's book advises using a piece of elder with an iron rod as the piston, shooting pieces of \"moistened tow\". a similar anecdote from Alabama in the early 20th century used an elder tube, oak piston, and fired peas or chinaberries. Similar tube-and-plunger toys, firing small stones, were used by the Plains Indians and Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest, though these may post-date European contact. Similar toys were found in other American Indian cultures.\n\n\nCommercial history\nDuring World War II, the American company Daisy Outdoor Products was unable to produce air rifles due to rationing of metal, so produced wooden popguns until the end of the war.  Currently, the largest producer of American-made popguns in the United States is Kraft-Tyme, Inc. located in Canton, TX.\n\n\nSee also\nPopgun Plot, an alleged 1794 conspiracy to assassinate George III using a poisoned dart fired by an airgun\nGun, a weapon that shoots bullets at high-speed.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Romania was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 with the song \"Liubi, Liubi, I Love You\", written by Vlad Crețu, Kamara Ghedi, and Bogdan Tașcău, and performed by the group Todomondo. The Romanian participating broadcaster, Televiziunea Română (TVR), held the national final Selecția Națională 2007 in order to select its entry for the contest. Controversy surrounded the event, as TVR disqualified several entries over the course of the competition.\nPrior to Eurovision, \"Liubi, Liubi, I Love You\" was promoted by a music video and a promotional tour in Belarus. Todomondo ultimately achieved 13th place in the contest's Grand Final on 12 May 2007, scoring 84 points. Their performance saw the use of pyrotechnics.\n\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to the 2007 contest, Televiziunea Română (TVR) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Romania nine times since its first entry in 1994. Its highest placing in the contest had been third place, achieved in 2005 with \"Let Me Try\" performed by Luminița Anghel and Sistem. In 2006, \"Tornerò\" by Mihai Trăistariu finished in fourth place.\n\n\nBefore Eurovision\n\n\nSelecția Națională 2007\n\n\nCompeting entries and shows\nTVR organized Selecția Națională 2007, a competition to select their entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. In early January 2007, the broadcaster published a provisory list of 24 songs shortlisted to compete in the two semi-finals of Selecția Națională on 27 January and 3 February, and the final on 10 February. They were selected on 17 January, out of 259 entries submitted to TVR until 15 January, by a jury panel consisting of music and entertainment professionals Ionel Tudor, Cornel Fugaru, Adi Despot, Dan Teodorescu, Mihai Ogășanu, Șerban Huidu and Titus Andrei.\n\"Do the Tango with Me\", \"Liubi, Liubi, I Love You\" and \"Love Is All You Need\" were appointed by TVR as replacement songs for the voluntarily withdrawn entries \"Hungry for Love\" and \"Prinde-mă, aprinde-mă\" by Andreea Bălan, as well as for \"Gozalo\" by Mandinga. The results in each show of Selecția Națională were determined by a 50/50 combination of votes from a jury panel—made up alternately of Andrei Partoş, Titus Munteanu, Gabriel Cotabiţă, Ogăşanu, Despot, Andrei Tudor, Teodorescu, Titus Andrei, Mirela Fugaru, Horia Moculescu, Cristian Faur, Mihai Georgescu, Sorin Vasile and Ionuț Radu—and a public televote. Cătălin Măruță and 3rei Sud Est were hired as hosts. Due to multiple requests from observers, TVR decided to establish a commission on 5 February to analyse several entries in regards to their compliance to the competition's regulations.\n\n\nSemi-final 1\n\nInterval acts for the first semi-final on 27 January included covers of the past Eurovision Song Contest entries \"Volare\" (Italy 1958), \"Congratulations\" (United Kingdom 1968), \"What's Another Year\" (Ireland 1980), \"Diva\" (Israel 1998) and \"Everyway That I Can\" (Turkey 2003) performed by Romanian artists such as Luminița Anghel and Taxi. Additionally, a boxing match between Anghel and native actress Luiza took place. Although scheduled to be performed in the fifth position at Selecția Națională, \"Make-It\" by Giulia Nahmany was disqualified due to accusations of plagiarising \"Risin'\" (2004) by Natalia. Todomondo, Rednex and Ro-Mania, and Morandi and Wassabi made up the top three of the televote. The results of the semi-final were:\n\n\nSemi-final 2\n\nThe second semi-final on 3 February had a television audience of 5,511,000 viewers and similarly had several covers of past Eurovision entries as interval acts, alongside another boxing match between two native celebrities. Although initially assigned to this semi-final, \"Love Struck\" by Indiggo was disqualified because the duo failed to attend rehearsals. Simplu and Andra were the televote's favorites, gathering more than 10,000 votes and around 8,000 more than the follow-up. The results of the event were:\n\n\nFinal\n\nRomanian group Sistem presented their single \"Soare\" as an interval act during the final of Selecția Națională on 10 February. \"Dracula, My Love\" by Simplu and Andra had been falsely suspected for plagiarising \"When Religion Comes to Town\" (1994) by E-Type, but was ultimately disqualified from the competition for having been partially performed by Simplu at the MTV Romania Music Awards 2006 prior to TVR's cutoff date of 1 October 2006. Similarly, New Effect and Moni-K's \"Sinada\" was disqualified for having received local radio airplay prior to the aforementioned date.\nIn addition, it was discovered that \"Well-o-wee\" by Rednex and Ro-Mania was a modified version of \"Călușul\", a song on the latter's 2001 album Lasă-mă să beau. This led to the entry's exclusion from Selecția Națională, alongside \"Crazy\" by Morandi and Wassabi, who failed to attend rehearsals. According to Marius Moga, the latter was a boycott due to the disqualification of \"Dracula, My Love\". The mass disqualification of songs generated controversy among observers. \"Liubi, Liubi, I Love You\" by Todomondo emerged as the winner, gathering the maximum 12 points from the public (11,243 televotes) and ten from the jury. The full results were as follows:\n\n\nAt Eurovision\n\nTo promote \"Liubi, Liubi, I Love You\" as Romania's Eurovision entry, a CD single was released in 2007 by TVR, followed by a promotional tour in Belarus. Additionally, Todomondo released a Dan Maoliu-directed music video and launched their own website in April 2007, in order to interact with fans and present them with news and biographical information. The Eurovision Song Contest 2007 took place at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki, Finland and consisted of one semi-final on 10 May and the final on 12 May 2007. According to the then-Eurovision rules, selected countries, except the host nation and the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom), were required to qualify from the semi-final to compete for the final; the top ten countries from the semi-final progressed to the final.\nIn Romania, the show was broadcast on TVR, with Manoliu as the country's head of delegation. Todomondo were scheduled for technical rehearsals on 7 and 8 May, experiencing considerable malfunctions with the sound and graphics. Manoliu stated: \"If the stage and the camera work will not fit our requirements, despite our efforts to help the team implement [them], we do not exclude the possibility of withdrawing from the competition\". Automatically qualified for the final due to Romania's top ten placement the previous year, the group performed 20th on the occasion, preceded by the United Kingdom and followed by Bulgaria. Their show made use of pyrotechnics worth €5,000.\n\n\nVoting\nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to Romania in the Grand Final, as well as by the country in the semi-final and Grand Final of the contest. On the latter occasion, Romania finished in 13th position, being awarded a total of 84 points including 12 awarded by both Moldova and Spain, ten by Andorra, and eight by Hungary. The country awarded its 12 points to Moldova in the semi-final and Grand Final of the contest. For the announcement of the points, TVR appointed Andreea Marin Bănică as its spokesperson to announce the Romanian voting results.\n\n\nPoints awarded to Romania\n\n\nPoints awarded by Romania\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The system of transport in Cambodia, was rudimentary in the past, severely damaged in the chaos that engulfed the nation in the latter half of the 20th century. The country's weak transport infrastructure hindered emergency relief efforts, exacerbating the logistical issues of procurement of supplies in general and their distribution. Cambodia received Soviet technical assistance and equipment to support the maintenance of the transportation network. In the last twenty years, however, significant improvements have been made, including an expressway, almost all of the major roads being paved, and two new major international airports - one in Siem Reap and one in Phnom Penh. Furthermore, ground has been broken on a canal that will allow cargo to go directly to the ocean, as well as planned new train lines.\n\n\nRoad transport\n\n\nHighway network\nTotal - 38,257 km (2004)\nPaved - 2,406 km (2004)\nUnpaved - 35,851 km (2004)\nOf the current total roadway network, only about 50% of the roads and highways are hard surfaced, all-weather, and in good condition. About 50% of the roads were constructed of crushed stone, gravel, or compacted earth. Secondary roads are of unimproved earth or were little more than tracks. In 1981 Cambodia opened a newly repaired section of National Route 1 which runs southeast from Phnom Penh to the Vietnamese border. The road, which suffered damage during the war years, was restored most probably by Vietnamese army engineers.\nIn the late-1980s, Cambodia's road network was both underutilized and unable to meet even the modest demands placed upon it by a preindustrial agrarian society. Commercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses, were insufficient in number and lacked the spare parts necessary to keep them running. Road construction and maintenance were ignored by a financially hard-pressed governments, while insurgents regularly destroyed bridges and rendered some routes unsafe for travel.\nCambodia is upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved. And now road construction is on going from the Thailand border at Poipet to Siem Reap (Angkor Wat). Funded by over $3 billion of Chinese loans, Chinese companies have built 3,000 km (1,900 mi) of roads as well as several major bridges.\nAn expressway network is being developed, the 190km Phnom Penh-Sikhanoukville expressway (E4) opened in October 2022, the construction to Bavet started in June 2023.\nChart of 01/2014\n\n\nOther transport\nMotorcycles are by far the most common transport medium in Cambodia. \"Cyclo\" (as hand-me-down French) or cycle rickshaws were popular in the 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques (carriages attached to motorcycles) and rickshaws imported from India. Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist sits behind the passenger(s) seat, as opposed to cycle rickshaws in neighbouring countries where the cyclist is at the front and pulls the carriage. With 78% mobile phone penetration rate, ride-hailing apps have become popular in recent years. The first locally owned ride-hailing app, ExNet taxi app, was launched in 2016, after which another locally developed PassApp taxi was also introduced. \nThe ExNet and PassApp use the same technology and architect for their application, except that ExNet is a taxi-based ride-hailing service while PassApp is more of rickshaw-based one. Uber and Grab joined the market in 2017. The entry and later merger of Uber and Grab did not negatively affect the local apps as the locals have the first-mover advantage and could secure a large number of patrons. As of today, PassApp is seen as an able competitor for the Singapore-based Grab in the Cambodian transport market. Thai Duong Bus Cambodia\nAside from the private-hire vehicles and ride-hailing service, public transport is also available but only in the capital. Phnom Penh city bus service started in 2015 with only three routes under the assistance of JICA. Today, Phnom Penh City Bus operates 13 routes.\n\n\nRailways\n\nTwo rail lines exist, both originating in Phnom Penh and totaling about 612 kilometers of 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge single track. \nThe first line or the northern line, built by The French colonial government, running from Phnom Penh to Poipet on the Thai border, between 1930 and 1940, with Phnom Penh Railway Station opening in 1932. \nThe final connection with Thailand was completed by Royal State Railways in 1942. The service from Bangkok to Battambang was suspended when the French Indochinese Government resumed sovereignty over Battambang and the Sisophon area from Thailand on 17 December 1946, as Thailand was seen as a supporter of Khmer Issarak, the anti-French, Khmer nationalist political movement. \nA third line is planned to connect Phnom Penh with Vietnam, the last missing link of the planned rail corridor between Singapore and the city of Kunming, China. A new north–south line is also planned. The lines from Phnom Penh to Sisophon and from Sisophon to Poipet have been rehabilitated; starting with Poipet to Srey Sisophon in April 2018 and Sisophon to Phnom Penh in early July (2018). \nThe active part, the southern line, of the network is the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville line, with stops at Takeo and Kampot. The first line to be re-opened in Cambodia was the 118 km long route from Phnom Penh to Touk Meas and the complete southern line in May 2011 (or Toll Royal Railway). Toll Royal Railway (Cambodia) had been given a 30-year concession from The Royal Government of Cambodia to operate Cambodia's railway network.\n\n\nRoutes\nPhnom Penh - Pursat - Moung Ruessei - Battambang - Sisophon - Poipet\nPhnom Penh - Takeo - Touk Meas - Damnak Chang'aeur - Veal Renh - Sihanoukville\n\n\nWaterways\nThe nation's extensive inland waterways were important historically in domestic trade. The Mekong and the Tonlé Sap Rivers, their numerous tributaries, and the Tonlé Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters and another 282 kilometers navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters. In some areas, especially west of the Mekong River and north of the Tonle Sap River, the villages were completely dependent on waterways for communications. Launches, junks, or barges transport passengers, rice, and other food in the absence of roads and railways.\nAccording to the Ministry of Communications, Transport, and Post, Cambodia's main ferry services crossing the Bassac River and the middle Mekong River were restored in 1985. The major Mekong River navigation routes also were cleared for traffic. Seaplane service to all waterways and islands in now offered by Aero Cambodia Airline.\n\n\nSeaports and harbors\n\nCambodia has two major ports, Phnom Penh Autonomous Port and Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, also known as Kampong Som, and five minor ports. Phnom Penh, at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap Rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season. In 2018 the port received 205,000 TEUs totalling 2.9 million tonnes. Its 2018 profits were US$7.35 million, up 36% from 2017.\nSihanoukville port reopened in late-1979. It had been built in 1960 with French assistance. In 1980 some 180 Soviet dockworkers, having brought with them forklifts and trucks, were reportedly working at Kampong Som as longshoremen or as instructors of unskilled Cambodian port workers. By 1984 approximately 1,500 Cambodian port workers were handling 2,500 tons of cargo per day. According to official statistics, Sihanoukville had handled only 769,500 tons in the four prior years (1979 to 1983), a level that contrasted sharply with the port's peacetime capacity of about one million tons of cargo per year.\n\n\nMerchant marine\nTotal: 626 ships (1,000 gross tonnage (GT) or over) totaling 953,105 GT/1,345,766 tonnes deadweight (DWT)\nShips by type: bulk carrier 41, cargo ship 533, chemical tanker 10, container ship 8, passenger ship/cargo 6, petroleum tanker 11, refrigerated cargo 15, roll-on/roll-off 1, vehicle carrier 1 (2008)\nNote: 467 foreign-owned: Canada 2, China 193, Cyprus 7, Egypt 13, Gabon 1, Greece 3, Hong Kong 8, Indonesia 22, Japan 1, South Korea 22, Latvia 1, Lebanon 8, Netherlands 1, Romania 1, Russia 83, Singapore 4, Syria 48, Taiwan 1, Turkey 26, Ukraine 34, UAE 34, United States 6 (2008)\n\n\nAirports\n\nThe country possesses twenty-six airfields, of which only thirteen were usable in the mid-1980s. Eight airfields had permanent-surface runways. Techo International Airport in Phnom Penh is the largest airport and replaced Phnom Penh International Airport; it also serves as the main base for the renascent Cambodian Air Force.\n\nCambodia's second largest airport is Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport in the tourist city of Siem Reap, replaced Siem Reap International Airport. In the past, tourist traffic into Siem Reap International Airport saw passenger numbers overtook those of Phnom Penh in 2006.\nCambodia also opened a new Soviet-built airfield at Ream, Sihanouk International Airport in late-1983, which never saw commercial air traffic until January 2007. There are additional airports in Battambang and Stung Treng.\nThe new national airline Cambodia Angkor Air was launched in 2009, with an investment from Vietnam Airlines, later in January 2025, it officially rebranched as Air Cambodia.

    "title": "Murder of Somwang Yapapha",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=76588730",
    "text": "On 16 February 1995, 35-year-old Thai worker Somwang Yapapha was battered to death by two of his compatriots during a drinking session at a Defu Lane flatted factory in Singapore. His murderers - Khampun Sriyotha and Samlee Prathumtree - were arrested soon after they killed Somwang, and they were charged with murder. Despite their differing accounts of the murder, Khampun and Samlee both put up a defence that there was a fight between them all while they were drinking, which caused the two defendants to bludgeon Somwang to death during the fight itself. However, the High Court rejected their defence, and the pair were hence found guilty of murdering Somwang and sentenced to death in November 1995. Both Samlee and Khampun lost their appeals, and they were jointly hanged on 4 July 1997.\n\n\nMurder and investigations\nOn 16 February 1995, the police received a report that a 35-year-old Thai construction worker died at a flatted factory in Defu Lane, Singapore.\nThe deceased Thai national, identified as 35-year-old Somwang Yapapha, was found with severe head injuries while he laid in a pool of blood, and his jaw was also smashed while his face and body were found with cuts caused by pieces of broken glass (some of which were embedded in the multiple open wounds). Shattered glass shards from a broken beer bottle were found scattered around the floor where Somwang's corpse was laid. On that same day, a 45-year-old Thai construction worker surrendered himself after he admitted to his employer that he was responsible for the murder, and the police report was thus made and the officers subsequently took him in for further probe and investigations. The police uncovered through first-stage investigations that the homicide likely happened between the suspect and the victim during a drunken argument while they were drinking heavily.\nA forensic pathologist later examined Somwang's body, and it was found that there were not less than 20 injuries all over his body, and most of these injuries were concentrated on the neck and head. Among these injuries were four skull fractures, and two of them were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The injuries, according to the pathologist, were caused by a heavy object and there were no defensive injuries found on the victim. It was confirmed through police investigations that a sledgehammer was used to kill Somwang.\nAltogether, after some investigations, the police arrested two Thai construction workers, including the 45-year-old man who surrendered, for the murder of Somwang. The two men, 45-year-old Samlee Prathumtree and 32-year-old Khampun Sriyotha, were charged in court with murder and subsequently remanded without bail while awaiting trial for murder.\n\n\nMurder trial and sentencing\nOn 17 August 1995, both Khampun Sriyotha and Samlee Prathumtree officially claimed trial for the murder of Somwang Yapapha. The trial, which took place at the High Court, was presided over by the late Justice T S Sinnathuray, a veteran Supreme Court judge who was notable for sentencing infamous child killer Adrian Lim to death for murdering two children in 1981, as well as British serial killer John Martin Scripps for killing and dismembering a South African tourist in 1995. Khampun was represented by James Bahadur Masih and Christopher Teh, while Samlee was represented by Low Tiang Hock and N K Rajarh, and the prosecution was led by Luke Tan Loke Yong and Wong Keen Onn.\nThe trial court was told that prior to the lethal sledgehammer attack, Samlee and Somwang did not have a good relationship with each other despite being neighbours back in Thailand. Samlee earlier told police that Somwang was previously incarcerated for a sexual crime, and he also engaged in petty offences like stealing cars. Somwang also proclaimed himself to be a hired professional killer who had killed many people for a living, and Somwang, who first came to Singapore in January 1995, about ten months later than Samlee (who first arrived in February 1994), often borrowed money from Samlee for gambling and alcohol. It was adduced from the men's statements that on 14 February 1995 (two days before the murder), Samlee had been threatened by a drunken Somwang with a hammer during a regular drinks session that he would be killed and have his body burnt, and although Somwang later apologized once he became sober, he continued to glare at him for the following day while at work. It was the prosecution's case that due to their interpersonal conflicts, Samlee intended to kill Somwang and Khampun, who was Samlee's close friend and employed at a neighbouring construction site, joined in the plot out of sympathy for Samlee and thus, it culminated into the murder of Somwang sometime between 9.30pm on 15 February and 1.30am on 16 February 1994.\nIn his defence, Samlee did not dispute the events that happened before the murder, but Samlee denied there was any intention or plan to kill Somwang. He said that on the same night when Somwang was killed, the two accused and the victim drank together, and in midst of their second session, an argument broke out between Khampun and Somwang, and it escalated into a fight between both Somwang and Khampun, who was hit with a beer bottle by Somwang. In retaliation, Khampun used a sledgehammer to batter Somwang, and Samlee thus escaped and went into hiding out of fear. Samlee, who pinpointed Khampun as the one who killed Somwang, admitted that after the end of the fight, he came out of his hiding place and saw Somwang lying face downwards on the floor motionless, and to confirm if Somwang had died, Samlee picked up the bloodstained sledgehammer and tapped once at the head of Somwang, in addition to a hard blow on the head as he recalled the death threat which Samlee spewed at him.\nAs for Khampun, his own version of events was that after they invited Somwang to have drinks, Somwang got aggressive with Samlee and argued with him, and Khampun also tried to restore peace between the two men, and yet the situation was aggravated further when Somwang hit him with a bottle, and Khampun thus used a clawhammer to bludgeon Somwang on the head, neck and jaw before he fled the scene, and the fight between Somwang and both the defendants ended with Somwang's death. Khampun also denied that he heard anything from Samlee about his interpersonal conflicts with Somwang. Despite the differing accounts from both men, the similarity in both version of events recounted by Samlee and Khampun was that the death of Somwang was unfortunately the result of a sudden but violent drunken brawl and there was no intent to commit murder in the first place, which formed the main crux of their defence in court.\nOn 28 November 1995, Justice T S Sinnathuray delivered his verdict. In his judgement, Justice Sinnathuray found that both Samlee and Khampun had the clear intention to cause the death of Somwang, especially Samlee who had the motive to commit the murder itself and thus roped his younger friend and confidant Khampun in the killing, and rejected the duo's defences in favour of the prosecution's submission. Justice Sinnathuray added that there was sufficient evidence to show that both Samlee and Khampun methodically lured Somwang to his death by inviting him for drinks, and attacked him after they started an argument on purpose, and thereafter used the sledgehammer to batter Somwang to death. The judge also noted that Samlee took steps to cover up the murder as one caused by a fight and he clearly did not tap but smashed the sledgehammer onto Somwang's head, and he also determined that both Khampun and Samlee had each took turns to hammer Somwang at least once, and the injuries which they intentionally inflicted on Somwang were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and these were also done in furtherance of their common intention to launch the concerted attack that ultimately took Somwang's life. On these grounds, Justice Sinnathuray concluded that the pair were ought to be convicted of the charges preferred against them for unlawfully causing Somwang's death.\nAs a result, both Samlee Prathumtree and Khampun Sriyotha, then aged 45 and 32 respectively, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Prior to 2013, all four degrees of murder carried the mandatory death penalty in accordance to Section 302 of the Penal Code upon the conviction of an offender for murder.\n\n\nAppeal process\nOn 21 August 1996, the Court of Appeal dismissed the two men's appeals and confirmed their death sentences. The three appellate judges - Justice M Karthigesu, Justice Thean Lip Ping (L P Thean) and Justice Goh Joon Seng - found that both Khampun and Samlee had shared the common intention to cause grievous hurt to Somwang, which in turn had resulted in the murder of Somwang, and the evidence proved that both men had the premeditation and planning to lure Somwang out with an excuse of inviting him for drinks and later killed him. Justice Karthigesu, who delivered the judgement, cited the forensic findings that the victim died from two fatal skull fractures (either one alone would have also caused death), which were caused by the ruthless and intentional assault caused by the two appellants, who both did so in furtherance of the common intention to cause harm and even the death of Somwang. In turn, Justice Karthigesu pronounced that the two appellants' respective defences should be rejected in view of the evidence that were enough to convict them of murder. Hence, the Court of Appeal affirmed the death penalty and murder conviction of both Samlee and Khampun, leading to the two men failing to escape the gallows.\n\n\nDouble execution\nOn the Friday morning of 4 July 1997, 34-year-old Khampun Sriyotha and 47-year-old Samlee Prathumtree were both hanged in Changi Prison for murdering Somwang Yapapha two years prior.\nDuring that same morning, three more drug traffickers were hanged in the same prison alongside both Samlee and Khampun. Two of them, Singaporeans Abdul Rahman Yusof and La Abuhari La Odd Hamid, were convicted and sent to death row for to the joint trafficking of more than 590g of marijuana in August 1995, while the third, Singaporean Low Theng Gee (also spelt Low Theng Ghee), was found guilty of smuggling more than 31g of diamorphine in January 1996; in an unrelated case, Low notoriously masterminded the kidnapping of two police officers during that same year. Low was not tried for this abduction case since he was already on death row for drug trafficking, but his accomplice and convicted robber Abdul Nasir Amer Hamsah was alone found guilty of the kidnapping and given both caning and a life sentence on top of the 18 years he got for the other crime of robbing a Japanese woman (who died during the robbery bid).\nKhampun and Samlee were one of the three Thais reported to be executed in Singapore during the year of 1997. Six months before their double executions, 30-year-old Thai citizen Pracha Thanomnin was hanged on 10 January 1997 for robbing and murdering a 47-year-old taxi driver Lee Kok Yin with three other Thais, two of whom remains at large till today and a third was convicted of attempted robbery and jailed for five years. Coupled with the executions of 11 drug traffickers and an infamous gunman Lim Chwee Soon, a total of 15 people were put to death in Singapore during the year of 1997.\n\n\nSee also\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\nReferences",

In the 2015 local election, she secured a slim majority (51.06%, 533,240 votes) in the six-candidate race with Ahmad Zamaksyari as running mate. She was officially sworn in by governor Ahmad Heryawan on 17 February 2016.\nAs regent, Nurrachadiana promoted vertical housing in the regency in order to reduce land use, with agricultural land already pressured by the expansion of industry. In 2018, she and her deputy entered a spat over the reassignment of hundreds of regency officials, with the latter declaring an intent to run against her in the 2021 local election.\nDuring a book launch in March 2016, Nurrachadiana gave a speech which resulted in the leader of the local branch of the Islamic Defenders Front threatening to kidnap her. The issue was later clarified and resolved as an error by a local media in quoting her.\nShe tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 during the 2020 pandemic, and was quarantined in a hospital.\nShe was reelected for a second term in 2020, with Aep Syaepuloh as her new vice regent. She resigned from her position, effective on 3 November 2023, in order to run as a candidate to the House of Representatives in the 2024 Indonesian legislative election. She was elected from West Java's 7th district (Karawang, Bekasi Regency and Purwakarta Regency) as a Demokrat member.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "A Distribution Transformer Monitor (DTM) is a specialized hardware device that collects and measures information relative to electricity passing into and through a distribution transformer.  The DTM is typically retrofitted onto pole top and pad mount transformers. A pole top (above ground) or pad mount (below ground) transformer commonly powers anywhere from 5-8 homes in the US and is the last voltage transition in stepping down voltage before it gets to the home or business. The conventional placement of Distributed Temperature Monitoring (DTM) devices is typically observed at the terminals of transformers. However, there are instances where these devices are directly affixed to the secondary power lines. \nDTM apparatus commonly comprises precision-centric sensors, either of the non-piercing or piercing variety, in addition to communication modules integrated on board for seamless data transmission. Adequate provisions for power supply are also incorporated within the DTM setup. The captured data from the DTM unit is relayed to a central data collection engine and/or the established Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) / Meter Data Management (MDM) system, where pertinent information pertaining to the transformer is stored and made accessible to users. Often, analytical platforms come into play to decipher the data gleaned and reported by the DTM, thereby enhancing the comprehension of the acquired information.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Distribution Transformer Monitoring (DTM) system, often referred to as an intra-grid sensor, occupies a distinctive position within the distribution grid. It is capable of providing both real-time and historical data about the transformers it monitors. Beyond individual transformer monitoring, DTMs constitute crucial information access points within the grid's architecture. When deployed in a network across the distribution grid, these devices offer multiple data points. For electric utility operators, these data points can range from basic bellwether measurements to comprehensive insights into intra-grid conditions and performance, depending on the deployment density.\nThe strategy for deploying DTM devices varies according to the specific needs and objectives of the utility in question. Deployments may be surgical, meaning strategically limited to key areas of the grid, or they can be comprehensive, covering larger grid sections such as line segments, specific circuit feeders, or entire substations. The decision on the placement and density of DTM deployments is influenced by the targeted data requirements and operational goals of the respective electric utility.\nRemote Over-The-Air (OTA) updates/upgrades are supported by certain DTM device offerings. This OTA capability, when supported, allows the operator to perform remote configuration and/or executable code (i.e., Firmware) updates of the DTM device(s) without the need for costly truck rolls or unit replacement. By supporting OTA Firmware updates/upgrades, providers can progressively broaden and deepen the suite of data points captured by the DTM device, making it reasonably future-proof, thus escalating value and relevance to the utility operator throughout the lifespan of the DTM device(s).\n\n\nApplications\nDTM sensors transmit timely, accurate intra-grid readings for Voltage, Energy, Current, and Temperature, thus empowering a long list of derived performance and power quality understandings for operations personnel. These fundamental data points provide direct relevance to electric utility operators.  Additionally, these data points can be extrapolated to reveal enhanced grid performance and asset health information.  Given the physical location of the DTM within the heart of the distribution grid, in addition to the DTM reporting frequency capability, the versatility of this intra-grid sensor is expansive.\nUtilities across the U.S. are beginning to turn to transformer technologies to improve distribution reliability and efficiency, as well as customer service and operating costs.\nExamples of applications derived from direct and/or indirect information presented by the DTM include:\n\nAsset management and Condition monitoring (AMCM)\nPreventive Grid Asset Maintenance recognition\nPower Theft identification\nDemand response assistance\nVoltage optimization\nOutage notification/Restoration enhancement\nDistributed Energy Resource (DER) Monitoring (i.e., bi-directional energy monitoring, voltage impacts, current impacts, etc.)\nTransformer under-sizing/over-loading recognition (e.g., electric vehicle charging station impacts, hydroponic marijuana grow houses, etc.)\nTransformer under-sizing (i.e., unnecessary added energy loss, accelerated premature failure, etc.)\nAbnormal transformer voltage characteristics\nTransformer-related temperature monitoring\nTransformer life expectancy estimation\nPhase Imbalance recognition\nPopulate Artificial Intelligence Platforms (foresee/forecast emerging intra-grid problems that human recognition cannot identify)\nFacilitate Strategic Battery Storage Location Efforts (i.e., leverage DER-induced Reverse Energy monitoring to locate present and future battery placements)\nIdentify Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping errors\n\n\nHealth Concerns\nGiven the physical deployment position of the DTM (i.e., on the distribution transformer), there are no known health concerns related to this family of intra-grid sensors.  DTM devices are created with user/installer safety in mind and otherwise bear no known measurable environmental impact.\n\n\nBusiness case justification\nUtility spending on asset management and grid monitoring technology is to hit almost $50 billion by 2023, according to a new study from Navigant Research. Given the pioneering stage of the DTM technology, significant business case information is limited in availability for public review.  Arguments against DTM deployment commonly assert that the secondary transformer value of $1000.00 to $2000.00 US (average) does not justify applying a retrofit DTM to monitor the transformer assets’ performance.   However, the DTM value is based upon a combination of features/benefits that include not only the transformer condition monitoring importance, but also a series of data visibility and reconciliation features from within the heart of the distribution grid that is otherwise unavailable to the electric operator (see Applications).  \nIn essence, while the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) or smart meter providers supply a series of data points to utilities, the DTM offers another dimension of real-time and historical data access for the grid operator and is capable of detecting information that AMI assets cannot capture and/or report with the necessary frequency to the operator. Each utility must evaluate, among other things, their unique grid management needs, their levels of unidentifiable losses that can be remediated/mitigated by DTM deployment, their Demand Response savings potential through Volt/VAR and conservation voltage reduction (CVR) related practices supported by DTM devices, and their need for real-time and/or historic data from within the heart of the distribution grid when formulating their business case justification. Investment decisions relating to DTM deployments involve a collection of monetary benefits that include savings for the utility through decreased operations costs, reduced power outages, lessened power outage durations, reduced peak demand costs, and recoverable power theft losses;  and indirect financial benefits associated with improved power delivery and quality to rate payers, reduced truck rolls which lessen service costs in addition to yielding decreased environmental impacts, improvement of the utility's Key Performance Indicators (e.g., SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI, etc.), and improved stakeholder/shareholder value through enhanced bottom line fiscal performance by the utility.\nRelevance to the smart grid: Distribution Transformer Monitor (DTM) devices provide a solution to the smart grid revolution. GTM Research (a division of Greentech Media) expects strong growth from the U.S. market for transformer monitoring hardware, increasing its current valuation of $112 million annually to $755 million by 2020. To date, smart grid providers have presented electric utility operators with significant management and control tools for substations, and have introduced Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI, or smart meters) to improve data access at the beginning and endpoints within the distribution grid. However, the expansive, and arguably most vulnerable segment of the grid remains the section between substations and endpoint meters—comprising over 6 million line miles (US grid), and 40+ million distribution transformers (US grid) -- which is now collectively coined the \"heart of the grid\".  \nPresently, the “heart of the grid” area is somewhat devoid of a sufficient density of versatile, cost-effective sensors, thereby leaving operators with limited visibility into this critical area.  To further evolve from a traditional reactionary management and problem resolution state within the “heart of the grid” space, to a more proactive posture that is congruent with the purpose and value of a ‘smart grid’, the emergence of the DTM is timely.  While efforts have been made to leverage substation and endpoint meter data, along with supporting algorithms to speculate and postulate occurrences and needs within the “heart of the grid”, it is evident that grid operators require precision-accurate, timely information from within this expansive segment of the grid in order to proactively and efficiently manage its performance.  The need to effectively combine all three critical points of measure (i.e., substations, endpoint meters, and DTM data from within the “heart of the grid”) may be collectively required to advance a comprehensive smart grid experience.\nWhy Distribution Transformer Monitors are fundamental for creating Grid Modernization—Achieving valuable results that Advanced Meter Infrastructure cannot reliably address:\n\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Automated Meter Reading (AMR), and/or Manual Meter reads accurately and reliably represent endpoint data only. If any power is tapped before the endpoint meter (i.e., pre-meter tapping), accurate detection of this power diversion is difficult or nearly impossible without the use of a reconciliation point upstream—preferably at the distribution transformer. By accurately capturing unique data at the distribution transformer, DTM devices provide necessary reconciliation points between the substation and endpoint meters, thus enabling utility operators to effectively detect power diversion occurring in front of the endpoint meter. Without a reliable reconciliation point at the distribution transformer, the utility operator's power theft detection system remains porous, inefficient, and unreliable.\nIf AMI alone was a complete solution for diversion detection/identification, then AMI-installed utilities would seldom experience more than 1-3% loss from otherwise unavoidable technical losses. According to the United States Energy Information Administration (US EIA) most power distribution utilities report annual energy losses of nearly 5% or more. DTM devices and associated Data Analytics have the functionality to allow the utility operators to quickly identify intra-grid anomalies.  AMI is a component in the diversion detection and solution process, but without a reliable reconciliation point at the distribution transformer, the detection system remains porous and inefficient. Many utilities, even those with AMI, actually suffer from the necessary availability of timely, granular, accurate intra-grid information that is necessary for improved energy loss detection, and enhanced Grid Modernization.\nEnergy measurements at the distribution transformer allow for ongoing validation of the AMI meters to ensure accurate meter performance, and to reveal improper metering issues within the distribution grid.\nIf customer meters yield \"reasonable consumption readings\" whether through AMI, AMR, or Manual meter reads, they will likely go without being investigated.  But, when a DTM is deployed upstream,  it records power consumption disparity for the entire downstream segment that is serviced by each respective transformer. This allows operators to locate less-obvious, but still costly power diversion instances.\nFor prosecution purposes, the evidence presented by a DTM in addition to AMI, AMR or Manual Reads is superior to having only meter reading data, whenever diversion is discovered, and remediation and/or prosecution is sought.\nThe DTM allows for enhanced desktop surveillance for power theft, thereby helping to keep utility personnel safe from the dangers of exploratory field efforts to locate potential power diversion occurrences. Using the DTM, operators can pinpoint losses from their desks, and dispatch the proper personnel (possibly even law enforcement) to address each particular situation.\nWith AMI or AMR deployed, utility meter-reader personnel are no longer visiting their customer's property; thus operators no longer have \"eyes in the field\" to spot nefarious behaviors.  The DTM provides a cost-effective, non-invasive, reliable source for much-needed visibility into the grid.\nDTM's offer valuable outage detection alerts via last-gasp reporting capability, thereby helping to pinpoint outage locations for utility operators, and accelerating power restoration for customers.\nTransformer loading/overloading information is superior when captured by the DTM (vs. the projected or algorithmic loading estimations produced via accumulated AMI or AMR statistics). In addition, the DTM accurately and reliably captures other metrics related to transformer health and intra-grid conditions; such as but not limited to temperature data, percentage of rated load, duration of actual load, voltage, and current information, etc....\nThe DTM allows for the detection, quantification, and location of additional costly intra-grid losses occurring between the transformer and the endpoint meters (e.g., certain technical losses, and non-technical losses), such as but not limited to the ability to identify poorly functioning and/or poorly calibrated endpoint meters.\nThe DTM enables operators to accurately quantify the amount of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) inspired Reverse Energy being passed into the grid at the distribution transformer level.  This is critical as Reverse Energy can adversely impact intra-grid voltages, and unplanned loading/overloading, which collectively or individually can result in grid safety and reliability risks.\nThe DTM uniquely enables the identification of unplanned grid-edge loading/overloading created by Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, Cryptocurrency mining, Legalized Hydroponic marijuana grow operations, ongoing power theft, etc.  The transformer-related loading/overloading impacts associated with such grid-edge activities (primarily occurring in the residential sectors) is commonly unknown by operators (i.e., operators typically do not know where, when, or how much-unplanned loading/overloading is created by most grid-edge activities).  This reality presents serious grid Reliability, Resilience, and Fire/Wildfire risks for all stakeholders.\nAlthough AMI deployment has been advancing in many markets, Power Theft is typically increasing in spite of this smart meter deployment effort.  Since AMI or AMR installations typically result in no utility personnel visiting customer locations following installation, power thieves know they can perform pre-meter taps, and likely steal power indefinitely without fear of utility detection.  Increasing power theft cost (while AMI deployment continues) is further validation of the importance of DTM technology being leveraged by operators as a critical intra-grid reconciliation point, thereby helping to identify costly power theft occurrences.\nOperators now have to contend with instances where endpoint meters are being stolen from locations or jurisdictions, and then are being installed at unauthorized locations by perpetrators. Endpoint meters may be swapped out in this manner on either a temporary basis or a permanent basis. This unauthorized practice results in inaccurate meter data being reported to the utility, which may result in added losses, and it results in inaccurate loading/overloading views regarding the upstream Distribution Transformer(s).\nCommonly, the Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping of utility assets is antiquated, due to perpetual changes occurring within the distribution grid.   Because of the antiquated GIS data, AMI, AMR, or Manual Read endpoint meter association to upstream transformers is likely to be inaccurate.  With just one endpoint meter being inaccurately assigned in the GIS mapping to the wrong upstream transformer, all endpoint meter information (AMI or otherwise) becomes unreliably accurate regarding the associated upstream transformer(s).  Thus, operators cannot reliably predict or know the actual loading/overloading, voltage, and/or current conditions regarding the upstream transformer.  This is another reason that accurate, reliable transformer information provided by the DTM is valuable to operators.\nDTM devices provide Automated Alert messages to operators.  This feature creates a \"Hands-Free\" Grid Watchdog environment where operators are not required to expend large amounts of money to consistently monitor intra-grid conditions.  Rather, the DTM can be programmed/re-programmed on the fly, each device individually re-programmable, thus allowing operators to focus on multiple points of interest throughout the lifespan of the DTM devices.   Automated Alerts are typically created when the DTM devices detect high/low readings that our occurring outside of the utility's pre-programmed tolerances, and/or rapid outage notifications, as cited above.  This feature automatically produces actionable information for operators, vs. trying to discern less reliable, less granular, less timely, and/or potentially antiquated endpoint meter data.   Only with DTM can comprehensive intra-grid conditions be reliably and consistently detected, revealed, and reported to operators in a timely manner.\nDTM device readings can “fill in the blanks” whenever an AMI meter in a group of meters on the same transformer fails to report properly for any reason.  Assuming there is no diversion, the DTM can provide the utility with the substantially accurate missing consumption information, helping to assure the customer can be billed more accurately vs. the typical estimation systems in use today.\nDTM-coupled with AMI can verify/measure problems between the DT and Meter, such as voltage drops that could leave the home running below-rated voltages.  An AMI meter will report the low voltage, but the DTM can verify whether the voltage supplied at the DT is operating nominally or not.\nThe DTM can be installed without a required power outage experienced by downstream customers.  When compared to the concept of replacing an aged/failing/overloaded transformer with a new, or 'smart' transformer, the reality of a forced downstream power outage is imperative.   But, by installing a DTM, operators can accurately understand the condition and the associated demand burdens being inflicted upon each DTM-monitored transformer.  This will enable operators to reduce the quantity of transformers that may otherwise need to be replaced or prematurely fail.  In essence, deploying DTM can create an \"instant smart transformer\" out of an existing standard transformer.  And, this \"instant smart transformer\" can then act to proactively apprise operators of intra-grid conditions for a lesser cost than a new smart transformer installation will require, in addition to the fact that a DTM deployment does not require an outage for installation, but a new smart transformer would require a multi-hour power outage requirement.\nDTM devices commonly have the ability to report key intra-grid information directly to the utility operator's existing SCADA, MDM, ADMS, ONS, etc. systems.   This seamless transfer of unique intra-grid data is achieved via DNP3, FTP, CSV, and/or web services.  Thus, the DTM can be seamlessly used to substantially improve the operator's intra-grid understandings, and the intra-grid data can be used to facilitate automated operations actions, based upon actual, reliable information that AMI (endpoint metering) cannot.\nUsing Over-The-Air (OTA) technology, DTM devices can be routinely upgraded as necessary, and/or as technology advancements unfold.  This ability creates an ongoing 'future-proof' benefit whereby DTM capability can be expanded; thus alleviating the concern of the DTM devices becoming antiquated prior to their anticipated lifespan (e.g., commonly 10–15 years)\nDTM devices typically have the flexibility to report intra-grid information via cellular or RF Mesh backhaul.  Most cellular networks offer a more robust backhaul capability whereby maximum intra-grid information payload can be passed onto the operator.  When using RF Mesh backhaul technology, less bandwidth is typically available than with cellular networks, thus reducing the data payload capability of the DTM devices.  There are various cost/benefit decisions that are applicable to proper backhaul selection for each operator.\nGiven the unique, timely, granular, and accurate intra-grid information that is presented by DTM, meaningful value is provided to the Planning, Operations, and Budgeting departments within most utility operators.  The result is a more reliable, more resilient, more cost-effective, and more energy-efficient grid operation being facilitated by DTM.\n\n\nSee also\nDistribution Transformer\nSmart Grid\nDemand Response\nDistributed Generation\nSCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition)\nMDM (Meter Data Management)\nSAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index)\nSAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index)\nCAIDI (Customer Average Interruption Duration Index)\nElectric Power Distribution\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "CityLights is a 2014 Indian drama film directed by Hansal Mehta, starring Rajkummar Rao and actress Patralekha in the lead roles. It is a remake of the BAFTA-nominated British film Metro Manila (2013). The film was presented by Fox Star Studios in association with Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt.\nThe story is about a poor farmer from Rajasthan coming to Mumbai in search of a livelihood. The film was released on 30 May 2014, and won rave reviews from most critics. In spite of releasing on just 350 screens, CityLights became a success due to its low cost of production and consistent collections at the box office.\n\n\nPlot\nDeepak Singh's (played by Rajkumar Rao) life as a former driver in the Indian Army in a village in Rajasthan who owns a garment store is tangled in the web of poverty, hope, and despair. Deepak's family consists of his ever-supporting wife, Rakhi (played by Patralekha), and their little daughter, Mahi. They tag along on his journey to Mumbai as he is unable to repay the money he owes for his store. With no contacts or addresses, except that of his friend Omkar, Deepak takes extreme measures to search for him when arriving in Mumbai.\nDeepak is tricked by two conmen who offer to sell him a flat for Rs 10,000 and decamp with the money. With no details on them, the Mumbai police refuse to file an FIR. His wife meets an escort working at a nightclub, who provides them with temporary accommodation in a building and convinces her to work as a bar dancer until Deepak finds a job.\nDeepak gets hired as a driver for a privately owned security bureau with a monthly pay of Rs 15,000. Deepak's senior colleague, Vishnu (played by Manav Kaul), realizes that he is gullible and does various favours for him to gain his trust. Vishnu later reveals a plan to loot a parcel being transported by the security agency. When Deepak vehemently opposes the idea of the theft, Vishnu blackmails him by revealing that he has hidden a box that he previously stole in Deepak's house. Feeling cornered, Deepak agrees to the risky plan of stealing the keys for this box. However, Vishnu is attacked and killed in the course of the robbery. Meanwhile, Rakhi loses her job. Deepak finds the box stolen by his senior in his house and comes up with a plan to ensure Rakhi and Mahi's safe return to their village.\nThe movie ends when his attempt to steal the keys from the agency cost him his life, but through a shrewd tactic, he is able to pass on Rakhi the imprint of the key for the stolen box. Rakhi and Mahi return to the village with Rakhi lost in memory of Deepak and their happy past.\n\n\nCast\nRajkummar Rao as Deepak Singh\nPatralekha as Rakhi Deepak Singh\nManav Kaul as Vishnu\nSadiya Siddiqui as Sudha\nPramod Pathak as Boss Mhatre\nKhushboo Upadhyay as Sonali\nResh Lamba as Waqar\nVaibhavi Upadhyay as Mahi Singh: Deepak and Rakhi's daughter\n\n\nProduction\nCityLights marked actress Anwita Paul's debut, known by her screen name Patralekha. As Paul was in a relationship with the lead actor Rao, the production house did not disclose her name until the trailer was released. When press kept questioning about the lead actress, the filmmakers dismissed the question.\nWhile the film was originally set to be directed by Ajay Bahl, due to creative differences he was replaced by Hansal Mehta. In December 2013, it was announced that shooting would begin in Rajasthan.\nThe film was first scheduled to release on 1 May 2014, which was subsequently shifted to 30 May. On 5 May 26 minutes of footage was previewed at a Mumbai event.\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe songs were composed by Jeet Gannguli with lyrics by Rashmi Singh. Rashmi Singh received Best Lyricist award at the 60th Filmfare Awards for her lyrics to the song \"Muskurane.\"\nThe film score was composed by Raju Singh.\n\n\nCritical reception\nSaurabh Dwivedi of India Today gave the film 5 out of 5 stars, and wrote, \"The film lays bare the darkness beneath shining lights of the metropolis, with its gut-wrenching screenplay. Rajkummar Rao proves it yet again why Mahesh Bhatt thinks he is the future of Bollywood.\" \nDirector Suparn Verma, writing for Rediff rated the film 4/5, and wrote, \"What makes City Lights memorable is how Hansal Mehta infuses his struggle into it. I have known Hansal for a better part of my life; we have seen both good days and bad. In this film, he gathers all his pain, pours it in a glass and makes Rajkummar drink it.\" Kusumita Das of Deccan Chronicle also gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Given its premise, some might say it’s old wine in a new bottle. But this bottle’s certainly a keeper.\nSweta Kaushal wrote in a Hindustan Times review that Hansal Mehta's direction makes Citylights \"intensely gripping and thought-provoking, the interplay of emotions and how the couple copes with city's hardships are the high points of the film.\" Renowned critic Anupama Chopra, also writing for the Hindustan Times, gave the film 3/5 stars, and wrote, \"The moving story about the horrors an immigrant family endures in the big city, translates perfectly to India and director Hansal Mehta stays faithful to the original\"\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 3/5 and wrote, \"Mehta does well with generating dread and creating a couple of surprising curves, which almost overcomes some of the plot’s uneven arcs\". India Today critic Rohit Khilnani also gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and wrote, \"Citylights is a very important film, it gives us a reality check. Mumbai is known to be the city of dreams but it does have a big share of shattered dreams too.\"\n\n\nBox office\nThe film collected ₹90 million (US$1.1 million) against a similar production budget.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCity Lights at IMDb \nCitylights at Bollywood Hungama",

    "text": "Nola aerugula, the scarce black arches, is a moth of the family Nolidae found in Asia and Europe. The species was first described by the German entomologist, Jacob Hübner in 1793.\n\n\nSubspecies\nNola aerugula aerugula\nNola aerugula holsatica Sauber, 1916 (Denmark, the Netherlands) – many authors consider holsatica to be a full species.\n\n\nDescription\nThe wingspan is 15–20 mm. These small drab moths show quite variable colors and patterns. The basic color may be gray, brownish or almost white, with brown transverse bands. There are also bright and dark specimens with high-contrast patterns. Forewings are almost triangular with a rounded basal area. The rear wings are gray or brownish. The body is cylindrical. The antennas are filamentous, about half as long as forewings.\n\n\nBiology\nAdults are on wing from June to August in one generation. Males begin to fly just before sunset, and can sometimes be seen in swarms in search of females. The larvae mainly feed on clover (Trifolium) and common bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), but also birch (Betula species), willow (Salix species) and poplar (Populus species). The larvae of ssp. holsatica feed on petty whin (Genista anglica) and hairy greenweed (Genista pilosa). Larvae overwinter, and can be found from August to June.\n\n\nHabitat\nThis species lives on sandy areas and peatlands.\n\n\nDistribution\nThis species can be found in most of Europe, east to eastern Asia and Japan. A former resident in Kent it is nowadays a rare migrant to Great Britain.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nIn 1793, Hübner placed the moth in the obsolete genus Phalaena, which was raised by Carl Linnaeus to house most of the moths. The English zoologist William Elford Leach Leach raised the genus Nola in 1815 and placed it in the Tortricidae family. The genus is possibly named after the town in Campania, Italy. This was one of the earliest examples of using a place for the name of a genus, although he did not give an explanation as to why he chose Nola. It was one of the earliest examples of using a place for the name of a genus. Hübner named the moth aerugula from aerugo – the rust of copper. There is no trace of green colouration and the intended meaning is probably 'coppery'  – referring to the pale brown colour on the forewing.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nLepiforum e.

    "title": "Geocentric creationism",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=79843375",
    "text": "Geocentric creationism is a religious belief held by a small subgroup of radical Young Earth Creationists who, in addition to asserting that the Earth was created between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago, also endorse the outdated geocentric model, which claims that Earth is stationary at the center of the universe. Advocates of Geocentric creationism believe that God placed the Earth at the center of the Universe to symbolize the uniqueness and centrality of humanity. This view is in direct contradiction to established scientific consensus on the movement of the Earth, biology and the age of the Earth and is thus classified as pseudoscientific. It is primarily followed by a small segments of Protestant and Catholic fundamentalists alongside a few Orthodox Jews, but is fringe within even the Creationist movement itself, who often try to distance themselves from geocentrism.\nGeocentrism differs from modern flat Earth beliefs as they nevertheless affirm the scientific fact of the Earth's spherical shape, however despite being largely insignificant, the view has had a somewhat greater influence within the anti-evolutionist movement than those who believe in a flat Earth. However, like flat Earthers, geocentrists also reject much of modern physics, astronomy, and biology.\nGeocentrism is rejected by the vast majority of Christians today, instead understanding the text of scripture to use phenomenological language that they believe was misunderstood to imply geocentrism in the medieval age.\n\n\nBackground and history\n\n\nHistorical background\nThe geocentric view of cosmology—especially the Ptolemaic model influenced by Greek thought—remained the dominant framework until the Copernican Revolution of the 16th century. During which multiple Christian theologians such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, Philip Melancthon and the Catholic Robert Bellarmine rejected the implications of heliocentrism due to their understanding of the Bible. \n\nSuch individuals like Luther often were strong in their critiques of the Heliocentric model, and Luther is famously recorded as saying that Copernicus was a \"fool who turned the whole science of astronomy upside down,\" reflecting his view that the new model contradicted Scripture and centuries of accepted truth.\n\nResistance to heliocentrism continued beyond theological objections. The Protestant Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, also rejected the Copernican system. However, Brahe attempted to find scientific explanations for Geocentrism. Aware of the observational advantages of Copernicus's model of the Universe, particularly in explaining planetary motion—Brahe developed a compromised system that attempted to preserve the Geocentric model while attempting to explain the observations of planetary movement. In his model, the Sun and Moon revolved around the Earth, which remained stationary at the center of the universe, while the other planets orbited the Sun. This system was also adopted by many Jesuit astronomers of the 16th and 17th centuries. However, Tycho's successor and a fellow Protestant Johannes Kepler (1571 – 1630) did not follow Tycho's compromised theory, but instead defended the heliocentric view that all the planets orbit the Sun. Nevertheless, according to the Reformed professor R. Scott Clark, some Reformed theologians such as Wilhelmius A Brakel resisted heliocentrism even until the 18th century.\n\n\nEastern Christianity\nThe \"Galileo affair\" happened in Western Christianity, for which Pope John Paul II later issued a verdict that admitted the condemnation of Galileo to have been an error. However, some Eastern Orthodox writers were also affected. Like in the West, many Eastern Christians had taught geocentrism, although they did not accept the Ptolemaic model of Geocentrism, but rather the system of Cosmas Indicopleustes. The first contacts with Russian Orthodoxy to Copernicus' heliocentrism came around the 17th century through a cosmological book which noted both models of Cosmology. For some time the hybrid model of Tycho Brahe was propagated as a better solution to the debates surrounding Geocentrism, although neither the Russian and Greek Orthodox ever condemned the Heliocentric, as they did not believe different cosmological theories to be dangerous.\n\n\nModern geocentric creationist movement\nModern Christians generally reject the geocentric model, and the strict understanding of the verses used to defend it in the medieval age. However, despite scientific advances, even today few still try to cling unto the Geocentric model of the past. This has been influenced by the Dutch-Canadian named Walter van der Kamp founded the Tychonic Society around the 1970s, which promoted the geocentric view that Copernicus was mistaken and that the Earth remains stationary at the center of the universe. One of the most prominent geocentric creationists of the 20th century is the Protestant Gerardus Bouw, director of the Association for Biblical Astronomy and author of several books defending geocentrism. And although unlike other Geocentrist advocates, Bouw had a PhD in astronomy, his views are not taken seriously by the scientific community.\nArticles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters associated with the Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible which they interpreted as indicating a stationary earth, and the view was also defended in 1991 by Marshall Hall, although his book was received extremely badly by Young Earth Creationist organizations. Such religious beliefs have also been held by the traditionalist Catholic Robert Sungenis, co-author of the self-published Galileo Was Wrong: The Church Was Right (2006). Robert Sungenis attributed his acceptance of the geocentric model to the influence of creationist Gerardus Bouw around 2002. His work is frequently marked by criticism of mainstream scientific theories. One of his most know projects was the 2014 film The Principle, in which he featured interviews with scientists such as Lawrence Krauss. However, these scientists later stated they were unaware that the film was intended to promote geocentrism and publicly disavowed its message. Another known traditionalist Catholic known to have taken Geocentrist stances includes Solange Hertz. Alongside small segments of Christian Fundamentalism, there has also been a movement towards Geocentrism within some anti-evolutionary Orthodox Jewish groups, which is often motivated by the statements of the influential Rabbi Maimonides (1138–1204), who argued that the Earth is stationary.\nThe two largest modern geocentric creationist organizations include The Biblical Astronomer and Catholic Apologetics International. And there have been some signs of growth for geocentrism within creationism.\n\n\nCreationist reaction\nBoth mainstream creationists and geocentrists agree that while the Bible is the only completely reliable source of information about knowledge on the natural world, they strongly differ on their understanding of scripture. Although some creationists such as Kent Hovind initially had a neutral opinion of geocentrism, the majority of the creationist movement have strongly rejected geocentrism, including the major organizations such as Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation Research and Creation Ministries International, these organizations avoid association with Geocentric movements, as they believe these movements to be harmful to Christianity. \n\n\nImpact\nAccording to a report released in 2014 by the National Science Foundation, 26% of Americans surveyed believe that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Morris Berman quotes a 2006 survey that show currently some 20% of the U.S. population believe that the Sun goes around the Earth (geocentricism) rather than the Earth goes around the Sun (heliocentricism), while a further 9% claimed not to know. According to 2011 VTSIOM poll, 32% of Russians believe that the Sun orbits the Earth. However, these numbers may be influenced by scientific ignorance.\n\n\nCharacteristics and beliefs\n\nThe Modern Geocentrist movement form a radical movement within Creationism, arguing that their perceived \"scientific assault\" on the religion did not begin with Evolution, but with Heliocentrism. This view was explicitly held by Gerardus Bouw, who argued that the Copernican Revolution set the stage for the development of Biblical Criticism, and attacked the doctrine of Biblical literalism. He argued that the anthropocentric view of creation logically leads to a geocentric view of the Cosmos. \nThese proponents advocate for adopting the Tychonic system, which gets its name from the 16th-century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, which places the Earth at the center of the universe while allowing the planets to orbit the Sun. This model serves as a deliberate compromise between the strict geocentrism of the Ptolemaic system and the heliocentrism of Copernicus. At the heart of the modern Geocentric view is that the Earth and his creatures are special to God, and the status of the Earth at the center of the universe symbolizes this belief. They also believe that passages such as Joshua 10:12-13 in which God stops the sun over the valley of Ajalon are evidences of the earth being at the center of the solar system. Geocentrism has relied upon multiple verses in the Bible which seem to talk about the Earth not being moved, such as Psalm 93:1. However, due the shift from the strict interpretation of such passages, even the majority of creationists reject the strict geocentric interpretations of such passages, and instead view them phenomelogically.\n\n\nTheological presuppositions\nGeocentric creationism is based on a rejection of the mainstream scientific method in favour of supernatural explanations of the Universe, arguing that God created everything that exists within 6 days around 6000 years ago and created the Universe with the Earth at its very center. People such as Gerardus Bouw have argued that observation must be interpreted in harmony with the text of scripture, which he believed to be teaching a Geocentric model and that it needs to be the starting point in scientific inquiry. However, contrary to the views of Kepler and Galileo who although being Christians, believed that the scripture never speak of the inner workings of the solar system. Bouw criticized modern Christians, including the majority of Christian fundamentalists who agree with the claim that Bible does not speak on cosmological models. Instead, he favoured supernatural explanations of the movement of the universe and the solar system that he believed to better reflect his geocentric understanding of scripture, including claims such as the existence of aether, which he identified as the \"firmanent\" of Genesis 1. Due to this, he ended up modifying the cosmology of Tycho Brahe's model further by adjusting the stars also to be centered on the Sun rather than the Earth to explain the aberration of starlight. This way, he believed that his modified geocentric model would be observationally equivalent to heliocentrism, concluding that one needed theological rather than purely scientific reasoning to establish the correct position.\n\n\nCriticism\n\n\nTheological criticism\nModern Young Earth creationists who reject Geocentrism have argued that the debate over Geocentrism and Heliocentrism in the 16th century arose not from a proper understanding of the Bible, but from the influence of Greek philosophy, critiquing the usage of verses from poetic books such as the Psalms to build a cosmological doctrine, rather arguing that such passages employ phenomenological language, not what happens literally in nature. Thus, they believe that while every claim of the Bible about the natural world is true, it should not be viewed as teaching geocentrism, as it only describes the rising of the Sun from our perspective as how it appears. Additionally, creationist critics have argued that the physical location of the Earth has no bearing on the theological idea that God's center of focus is the Earth.\nFrom a Roman Catholic perspective, more mainstream Catholics have criticized those more radical traditional Catholics such as Sungenis and Solange Hertz for assuming that the Church ever made definitive statements in defense of geocentrism, additionally arguing that the early Christian theologians who held to a Geocentric view of the universe did not teach it as doctrine or as a part of the faith but merely assumed it as a part of the science of their day, additionally criticizing modern geocentrists for using passages mainly from books like the Psalms, which are written in poetic style. \nOld Earth Creationists, including R. Scott Clark, contend that the Scriptures are written by God in a way that accommodates human understanding, meaning that Scripture should not be read like a scientific textbook. In this perspective, the Bible communicates to us in terms people of the time could understand, rather than providing a detailed scientific account of the Universe and the natural world.\n\n\nScientific criticms\nGeocentric creationism stands in contradiction to modern physics, particularly in its mechanics of motion: the model requires the entire universe, including distant stars and galaxies, to revolve around a stationary Earth—implying speeds far exceeding that of light. That the Earth orbits the Sun have long been established by scientific consensus, despite being rejected by geocentrists. This thus places Geocentrism into the category of pseudoscience.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "Geocentric creationism is a religious belief held by a small subgroup of radical Young Earth Creationists who, in addition to asserting that the Earth was created between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago, also endorse the outdated geocentric model, which claims that Earth is stationary at the center of the universe. Advocates of Geocentric creationism believe that God placed the Earth at the center of the Universe to symbolize the uniqueness and centrality of humanity. This view is in direct contradiction to established scientific consensus on the movement of the Earth, biology and the age of the Earth and is thus classified as pseudoscientific. It is primarily followed by a small segments of Protestant and Catholic fundamentalists alongside a few Orthodox Jews, but is fringe within even the Creationist movement itself, who often try to distance themselves from geocentrism.\nGeocentrism differs from modern flat Earth beliefs as they nevertheless affirm the scientific fact of the Earth's spherical shape, however despite being largely insignificant, the view has had a somewhat greater influence within the anti-evolutionist movement than those who believe in a flat Earth. However, like flat Earthers, geocentrists also reject much of modern physics, astronomy, and biology.\nGeocentrism is rejected by the vast majority of Christians today, instead understanding the text of scripture to use phenomenological language that they believe was misunderstood to imply geocentrism in the medieval age.",

In 1995, Otto left Switzerland to study animation at Gobelins Imagery School in Paris, France where he also received additional animation training through an internship with Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris.\nOtto's professional animation career started in 1997 when he was hired by DreamWorks Animation in Los Angeles, California to work as a traditional character animator on the studio's first traditional animated feature film The Prince of Egypt (1998). Otto then spent 21 years as part of the character animation team working on both 2D and CGI projects for the studio. He is particularly known for his work as the head of character animation for the How to Train Your Dragon movie trilogy and has been instrumental in developing the look of the characters and their personalities and the overall style of animation for the films.\nOtto was rewarded for his achievements with the VES Awards for a Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Feature in 2011 by the Visual Effect Society. Otto designed a number of characters in How to Train Your Dragon and did storyboarding work on the second film and the third film. He was a key contributor to the development of Premo, the animation software developed at DreamWorks Animation that won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement.\nInvolved as a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Otto participates in numerous of events, talks and interviews by highlighting the work of animation in the feature film industry. In 2016, Otto founded LuMAA (Lucerne Master Academy of Animation) with the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Lucerne, Switzerland where animation industry veterans teach a 6-week summer course for up and coming talents.\nIn 2019 after 21 years of working for DreamWorks Animation, Otto left the studio. He now works as an independent director on various film and television projects. Otto's first released television project after leaving DreamWorks Animation was the episode \"The Tall Grass\" that he directed for season 2 of the Netflix adult animated anthology television series Love, Death & Robots.\nOn 14 June 2021, it was announced that Otto would direct the 2024 Netflix and Locksmith Animation film That Christmas (in his feature film directorial debut) which is based on That Christmas and Other Stories, a trilogy of children's Christmas books written by Richard Curtis and illustrated by Rebecca Cobb.\n\n\nFilmography credits\n\n\nDirector\nDragons: Race to the Edge (2016) (TV series) (2 episodes from season 5)\nTrollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (2016) (TV series) (1 episode from season 1)\nLove, Death & Robots (2021) (TV series) (1 episode from season 2)\nA Tale Dark & Grimm (2021) (TV miniseries) (supervising director for ten episodes)\nThat Christmas (2024) (movie) (feature film directorial debut)\n\n\nActor\nThat Christmas (2024) (movie) (additional voices)\n\n\nProducer\nA Tale Dark & Grimm (2021) (TV miniseries) (executive producer for ten episodes)\n\n\nArt department\nShrek (2001) (movie) (storyboard artist)\nIce Age (2002) (movie) (storyboard artist)\nRobots (2005) (movie) (storyboard artist)\nHop (2011) (movie) (storyboard artist)\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) (movie) (story artist)\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019) (movie) (storyboard artist)\n\n\nAnimation department\nThe Prince of Egypt (1998) (movie) (animator for \"Moses\")\nThe Road to El Dorado (2000) (movie) (animator for \"Altivo\" and \"Cortes\")\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002) (movie) (animator for \"Spirit\" and supervising animator for \"Eagle\")\nSinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003) (movie) (animator for \"Jin and Li\" and supervising animator for \"Sinbad\" and \"Jin and Li\")\nSinbad and the Cyclops Island (2003) (short film) (supervising animator)\nShark Tale (2004) (movie) (animator)\nOver the Hedge (2006) (movie) (additional character designer)\nFlushed Away (2006) (movie) (supervising animator)\nEnchanted (2007) (movie) (additional animator)\nBee Movie (2007) (movie) (additional animator)\nKung Fu Panda (2008) (movie) (additional animator and traditional animator)\nHow to Train Your Dragon (2010) (movie) (head of character animation)\nLegend of the Boneknapper Dragon (2010) (short film) (supervising animator)\nDragons: Gift of the Night Fury (2011) (short film) (animation consultant and story artist)\nBook of Dragons (2011) (short film) (head of character animation)\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) (movie) (story artist and head of character animation)\nHome (2015) (movie) (additional supervising animator)\nBird Karma (2018) (short film) (animator)\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019) (movie) (story artist and head of character animation)\nThe Call of the Wild (2020) (movie) (animation consultant)\nRumble (2021) (movie) (animation consultant)\n\n\nThanks\nMax (2013) (short film) (special thanks)\nGoodbye Vesna (2016) (short film) (special thanks)\nThe Windshield Wiper (2021) (short film) (thanks to)\n\n\nSelf\nHBO First Look (2006–2010) (TV series) (2 episodes)\nKulturplatz (2014) (TV series) (1 episode)\nCreative Spark (2015) (TV series) (1 episode from season 1)\nAgora.Community (2021) (podcast series) (1 episode)\nLCJ Q&A Podcast (2021–2024) (podcast series) (2 episodes)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Web site\nSimon Otto at IMDb",

    "title": "Persistent fetal circulation",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=17802137",
    "text": "Persistent fetal circulation is a condition caused by a failure in the systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation to convert from the antenatal circulation pattern to the \"normal\" pattern. Infants experience a high mean arterial pulmonary artery pressure and a high afterload at the right ventricle. This means that the heart is working against higher pressures, which makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood.\nIn a fetus, there is high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and low pulmonary blood flow as the fetus does not use the lungs for oxygen transfer, but instead relies on the placenta for oxygen. When the baby is born, the lungs are needed for oxygen transfer and need high blood flow which is encouraged by low PVR. The failure of the circulatory system of the newborn to adapt to these changes by lowering PVR leads to persistent fetal circulation. The newborn is therefore born with elevated PVR, which leads to pulmonary hypertension. Because of this, the condition is also widely known as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). This condition can be either acute or chronic, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\nComplications\nPPHN can range from mild to severe disease. In the most severe form, infants experience severe hypoxemia resulting in cardiac and pulmonary complications. As a result of low oxygen levels, infants with PPHN are at an increased risk of developing complications, such as asphyxia, chronic lung disease, neurodevelopment issues, and death.\nNosocomial infections are another type of complication that may contribute to mortality in someone with PPHN. If the newborn acquires an infection while hospitalized, this could result in deterioration of the condition even after days of improvement.\n\n\nPathophysiology\nTypically, a fetus experiences pulmonary hypertension in utero since it is relying on the placenta for oxygen rather than its lungs. When the fetus is born, it is no longer attached to the placenta and must use the lungs to receive oxygen. To facilitate this change from fetus to newborn, the baby must change from a state of high PVR to low PVR, allowing for increased blood flow to circulate throughout the body. This inability of the newborn to adapt to these changes is caused by various processes, such as:\n\nNormal vascular anatomy with functional vasoconstriction: This has a good prognosis, as it is reversible.  Causes include hypoxia, meconium aspiration, and respiratory distress syndrome. Left untreated, this can lead to hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF).\nDecreased diameter of pulmonary vessels with hypertrophy of vessel walls: This has a poor prognosis, as it is a fixed abnormality. Causes include post-term pregnancy, placental insufficiency, and NSAID use by the mother.\nDecreased size of pulmonary vascular bed: This has a poor prognosis, as it is a fixed abnormality.  It is caused by space occupying lesions such as pleural effusions and diaphragmatic hernias.\nFunctional obstruction of pulmonary blood flow: This has a good prognosis if it is reversible. Causes include polycythemia and hyperfibrinogenemia.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nTo help with diagnosis, the clinician can watch out for predisposing factors, such as: birth asphyxia, meconium aspiration, use of NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)  by the mother, and early onset sepsis or pneumonia. To diagnose a fetus with pulmonary hypertension, PVR must be higher than systemic vascular resistance, resulting in high afterload and decreased systemic blood flow. This causes a significant decrease in oxygen concentration, which clinically manifests as insufficient blood flow to the lower body, while there is adequate circulation to the head and right side of the body. Other echocardiographic findings in PPHN include right ventricular hypertrophy, deviation of the ventricular septum, tricuspid regurgitation, and shunting at the patent foramen ovale.\nOther clinical signs that may signify PPHN are respiratory distress, partial pressure of oxygen greater than 100 mg and elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide. A gradient of 10% or more in oxygenation saturation between simultaneous preductal and postductal arterial blood gas values in absence of structural heart disease documents persistent fetal circulation. Since this may be a sign of other conditions, persistent fetal circulation must also be characterized by enlargement of right and left ventricles often confirmed through a definitive ECG.\nPersistent fetal circulation in neonates can be reversible or irreversible depending on the classified etiology listed above. If related to pulmonary disorders, the amount of lung damage dictates whether or not treatment is efficacious in reversing newborn lung insufficiency. Other causes for acute pulmonary hypertension include: infection, endocrine disorders, and drug injury.\nExamples of cases with newborns who with sustained fetal circulation are pulmonary hypoplasia and genetic abnormalities.\n\n\nTreatment\nTreatment aims to increase the amount of oxygen in the blood and reverse any causes of hypoxia as well as gain adequate perfusion.\nCommon treatments include:\n\nOxygen therapy\nMechanical ventilation\nPulmonary vasodilators\nNitrous Oxide Inhalation (iNO)\nSildenafil\nMilrinone\nGlucocorticoids\nThe therapies available to manage PPHN include high frequency ventilation, surfactant instillation, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\niNO is the preferred medication for PPHN due to its ability to more selectively cause pulmonary vasodilation in comparison to intravenous vasodilators. While this medication decreases the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or extracorporeal life support, it has not been shown to reduce mortality. Intravenous sildenafil has been shown to have similar efficacy and is becoming more commonly used as treatment for PPHN.\nAssessment of the efficacy of these treatments includes chest radiographs and arterial blood gases. Signs of inefficacious treatments include prolonged capillary filling time, low pulse volume, low blood pressure, and sustained metabolic acidosis.\nIn addition to treating the direct effects of this condition, other management strategies are implemented concurrently to stabilize the newborn.These include, but are not limited to nutritional support, reduction of stressful environment, gentle sedation, monitoring/treating acidosis and establishing normal systemic blood pressure.\nChallenges in developing countries:\nPPHN has been seen more frequently in developing countries or resource-poor areas, though it occurs across the globe. Treating this condition often involves large interdisciplinary teams, which is not always possible in developing countries. In low-resource environments, it is recommended to focus on five main bundles of management:\n\nIncreasing oxygen supply\nDecreasing oxygen demand\nFacilitating gas exchange\nInducing pulmonary vasodilation\nFixing metabolic disturbances\n\n\nEpidemiology\nIt occurs in 1–2 infants per 1000 live births. It is more common in males and in areas with higher altitudes. Additionally, two percent of infants with respiratory distress syndrome develop PPHN.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nDunn PM (March 1994). \"Professor Charles D Meigs (1792-1869) of Philadelphia and persistent fetal circulation\".

    "text": "Lee County is the southernmost county in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,555. The county seats are Fort Madison and Keokuk: it is the only county in Iowa with more than one county seat. Lee County is part of the Fort Madison–Keokuk, IA–IL–MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. It was established in 1836.\n\n\nHistory\nFort Madison dates to the War of 1812. Lee County was the location of the Half-Breed Tract, established by treaty in 1824. Allocations of land were made to American Indian descendants of European fathers and Indian mothers at this tract. Originally the land was to be held in common. Some who had an allocation lived in cities, where they hoped to make better livings. Lee County as a named entity was formed on December 7, 1836, under the jurisdiction of Wisconsin Territory. It would become a part of Iowa Territory when it was formed on July 4, 1838. Large-scale European-American settlement in the area began in 1839, after Congress allowed owners to sell land individually. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) under the direction of Brigham Young fled persecutions in Missouri to settle in Illinois and Iowa. Nauvoo, across the border in Hancock County, Illinois, became the main center of Latter-day Saints settlement, but there was also a Latter Day Saints stake organized in Lee County under the direction of John Smith, the uncle of Joseph Smith, land that was sold to them by Isaac Galland in 1839.\nLee has two county seats—Fort Madison and Keokuk. The latter was established in 1847 when disagreements led to a second court jurisdiction. Lee County's population grew to about 19,000 in 1850, the first US census, to 37,000 per the 3rd census in 1870, peaking at 44,000 people in 1960. It has continuously decreased since and as of 2020, 33,555 people lived there, comparable to the years between 1860 and 1870.\n\n\nName\nThere is no consensus about the derivation of the name \"Lee.\" It has been variously proposed that the county was named for Marsh, Delevan & Lee, of Albany, New York, and the 'New York Land Company', who owned extensive interests in the Half-Breed Tract in the 1830s; Robert E. Lee, who surveyed the Des Moines Rapids; or Albert Lea, who helped explore the interior of Iowa.\n\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 539 square miles (1,400 km2), of which 518 square miles (1,340 km2) is land and 21 square miles (54 km2) (4.0%) is water. The lowest point in the state of Iowa is located on the Mississippi River in Keokuk in Lee County, where it flows out of Iowa and into Missouri and Illinois.\n\n\nMajor highways\n U.S. Highway 61\n U.S. Highway 136\n U.S. Highway 218\n Iowa Highway 2\n Iowa Highway 16\n Iowa Highway 27\n\n\nTransit\nFort Madison station\n\n\nAdjacent counties\nHenry County (north)\nDes Moines County (northeast)\nHenderson County, Illinois (across the river east)\nHancock County, Illinois (southeast)\nClark County, Missouri (southwest)\nVan Buren County (west)\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\n2020 census\n\nThe 2020 census recorded a population of 33,555 in the county, with a population density of 62.0765/sq mi (23.9679/km2). 94.67% of the population reported being of one race.

The population density was 74 inhabitants per square mile (29/km2). There were 16,612 housing units at an average density of 32 per square mile (12/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 94.24% White, 2.80% Black or African American, 0.26% Native American, 0.39% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 1.03% from other races, and 1.21% from two or more races. 2.37% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 15,161 households, out of which 30.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.70% were married couples living together, 10.30% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.40% were non-families. 28.30% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.50% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.93.\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 24.40% under the age of 18, 7.80% from 18 to 24, 26.70% from 25 to 44, 24.60% from 45 to 64, and 16.50% who were 65 years of age or older.

    "text": "Uday Saddam Hussein (Arabic: عدي صدام حسين; 18 June 1964 – 22 July 2003) was an Iraqi politician and businessman. He was the eldest son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and his first wife Sajida Talfah, and was known for his extreme cruelty, erratic behavior, and human rights abuses, which included torture, rape, and murder. \nBorn in Baghdad, Uday was seen for several years as the likely successor to his father; however, he lost the place as heir apparent to his younger brother, Qusay, due to injuries in an assassination attempt. Owing to his family connections, Uday held various roles in the Iraqi political and military circles, as well as in business. He held positions as a sports chairman, heading the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Iraq Football Association, and the Fedayeen Saddam.\nUday held various positions in the Iraqi government and military, including chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, head of the Iraq Football Association, and commander of the paramilitary group Fedayeen Saddam. He was notorious for using his positions to inflict abuse. Athletes who lost matches were often imprisoned, beaten, and tortured in a private prison in the basement of the Olympic Committee building, sometimes in a sarcophagus with nails pointing inward or by being dropped into acid baths.\nUday was accused of serial rape and murder of young women, whom his guards would often snatch from the streets and force to come to his parties. In one infamous incident, he bludgeoned his father's favorite bodyguard to death at a party in 1988, an act for which he was briefly imprisoned by his father.\nDue to his violent and unstable nature, Saddam eventually favored his younger, more discreet son Qusay as his successor. In 1996, Uday was severely injured in an assassination attempt by gunmen, which left him partially paralyzed and able to walk only with great difficulty. Following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, he was killed alongside Qusay and his nephew Mustafa by an American task force after a prolonged gunfight in Mosul.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nUday Saddam Hussein Al-Nasiri Al Tikriti was born in Karkh, Baghdad, to Saddam Hussein and Sajida Talfah while his father was in prison. Multiple sources give different birth dates; although official sources give a birth date of 18 June 1964, The Independent gave a birth date of 9 March 1964, while others give a 1965 birth. One source gave it as early as 1963. He was rumored to have played with disarmed grenades as an infant. As a child, he and his younger brother Qusay would witness executions with their father.\nUday attended al-Mansour school in Baghdad in the 1970s. One of his teachers was Dinah Bentley, an English teacher from Yorkshire who married an Iraqi and briefly taught at the school. Uday was reportedly driven to school by a chauffeur in a Mercedes-Benz and surrounded by servants. He picked up his English teacher's Yorkshire accent and was described as a cheerful, bright child who was responsive to discipline, but an average student who struggled to concentrate.\nHe began studies at Baghdad Medical College, but only stayed for three days. Then he moved to the College of Engineering, and obtained a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Baghdad. He wrote his master's thesis on \"Iraqi military strategy during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war\". He obtained a doctorate in political science from the University of Baghdad in 1998 and the title of his dissertation was \"The world after the Cold War\", in which he predicted the United States would no longer be a world power in 2015. Some have argued that Uday did not have academic prowess and his theses were written by others in exchange for money and gifts, with no one able to give Uday a low score out of fear. \"He was really smart, probably smarter than his father—but he was crazy,\" said one of his classmates about Uday.\n\n\nTorture of Iraqi athletes\n\nIn 1984, after Uday graduated from university, Saddam appointed him chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee and the Iraq Football Association. In the former role, he tortured athletes who failed to win. According to Latif Yahia, Uday's alleged body double, \"The word that defines him is sadistic. I think Saddam Hussein was more human than Uday. The Olympic Committee was not a sports center, it was Uday's world\".\nRaed Ahmed, an Iraqi athlete who defected to the United States, said: \"During training, he would watch all the athletes closely, and put pressure on the coaches to push the athletes even more. If he was not happy with the results, he would have coaches and athletes put in his private prison in the Olympic Committee building. The punishment was Uday's private prison where they tortured people. Some athletes, including the best ones, started quitting the sport once Uday took over the Committee ... I always managed not to be punished. I made sure not to promise anything. There is a strong possibility of always being beaten. But when I won, Uday would be very happy.\" In 2005, a video of Uday questioning Raed's family was released. They were then reportedly transported by car to a prison, where they remained for 16 days in poor conditions.\nAmmo Baba, whose football teams won 18 tournaments and participated in three Olympics, said that Uday's punishment destroyed players' athletic abilities. Baba said that half of the Iraqi athletes had left the country, and many had feigned illness before playing against strong competitors; he reportedly told his friends that if he died suddenly, they would know the reason. Maad Ibrahim Hamid, assistant coach of the national football team, said that Uday rewarded players financially for winning and threatened them with imprisonment if they lost. According to Hamid, athletes were not tortured; they were arrested for immoral behaviour, (including adultery and addiction to alcohol) and for playing poorly. Ahmed Radhi said that after he was unwilling to join the new Al-Rasheed club, he was kidnapped at midnight by Uday's men, beaten and accused of harassment; he accepted Uday's offer when he was threatened with death. International footballer Saad Qais said that Uday was angry with him because he was sent off during a 1997 match against Turkmenistan. His \"discipline\" was administered by jailers (known as \"teachers\") in a closed section of a detention facility for athletes and journalists in Radwaniyah Palace. According to Qais, \"Uday established the Rashid team and forced the best Iraqi players to play in it, and forced me to leave my beloved team, and he honored us with gifts after every win, but he also punished us after every loss.\"\n\n\nMurder of Kamel Hana Gegeo\nAlthough his status as Saddam's elder son made him Saddam's prospective successor, Uday fell out of favour with his father due to his public erraticness. In October 1988, at a party in honour of Suzanne Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Uday murdered his father's personal valet and food taster, Kamel Hana Gegeo. Before an assemblage of horrified guests, an intoxicated Uday bludgeoned Gegeo who died of internal bleeding hours later. Gegeo had recently introduced Saddam to a younger woman, Samira Shahbandar, who had become Saddam's second wife in 1986. Uday considered his father's relationship with Shahbandar an insult to his mother. Shahbandar's oldest son fled to Jordan because of the harassment by Uday after the marriage. Uday also may have feared losing succession to Gegeo, whose loyalty to Saddam Hussein was unquestioned.\nAs punishment for the murder, Saddam briefly imprisoned Uday. Once released, Uday was sent to Switzerland to act as the assistant to the Iraqi ambassador there. He was expelled by the Swiss government in 1990, after he was repeatedly arrested for fighting. According to Jalopnik, Uday's vast car collection was burned by his father after the Gegeo incident.\nOthers describe the murder as follows: Next to the palace where Suzanne Mubarak and Uday's mother were staying, Gegeo was celebrating the wedding of a relative and firing in the air. Uday sent his men and asked them not to bother the two women. During the discussion, Uday hit Gegeo's head with his walking stick, causing Gegeo's death. Uday, afraid of his father's reaction, tried to commit suicide and was taken to the hospital. He escaped from the hospital, set up a barricade around his home, and fired at anyone trying to enter his home. He surrendered with the persuasion of his brother Qusay.\nAccording to the memory of Uday's half-uncle Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, after escaping from the hospital he went to his father's palace and told him to \"stay with your real wife.\" Saddam then said to Barzan, \"He was lucky because I had no weapon with me.\" However, Uday later came to the door of the palace again and told Barzan that he intended to shoot his father. He fired at Qusay and at step-uncles who were trying to prevent him from doing so. Later, under the guidance of Barzan, Uday apologized to his father. His father ordered him to surrender. When his brothers-in-law Hussein and Saddam Kamel learned that he was trying to escape to the United States, he was arrested on his father's orders, but released three weeks later. After the incident, Uday attacked two people whom he thought were informers. At the request of Saddam, Uday was sent out of Iraq under the control of Barzan to Switzerland in order to get rid of the disgrace caused by Uday.\n\nMuhammad Asim Shanshal, head of the private office of Uday, said:After a call from his mother, Sajida, told him that Kamel Hanna holds a joyful party for Saddam's second wife, Samira Shahbandar. There was shooting, rejoicing, and Uday shouting in the face of 'Kamel Hanna', denounced: \"What is the mess?!\" And he said: We celebrate on the occasion of lady and the President. Uday threatened him and warned him not to shoot bullets in the air, so it was 'Kamel Hanna' except that he raised his weapon in the air and fired bullets, so Uday's response was a fatal blow to his head with a heavy club that was with him, and he was killed. Saddam imprisoned all his guards and those who were with him, who were 15 individuals, and I was supposed to be with them had it not been for the delay that saved me from prison. They were sentenced to imprisonment, and Uday was exiled from Iraq to Switzerland for a period of six months.President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt called Uday a \"psychopath\".\n\n\nShooting of Watban Ibrahim\nIn 1995, during a fight between his maternal uncle Louay and paternal half uncle Watban Ibrahim, Uday shot Watban as well as the other guests at the party. The shooting left six bodyguards dead and Watban seriously injured. Uday then took Watban to the hospital and disappeared. Because his brothers-in-law, Hussein and Saddam Kamel, escaped to Jordan the next day, Uday's attack on his uncle remained in the background. Saddam ordered Uday to ask his uncle to shoot him in the same way as Uday had shot him, but Watban refused to do so. One of the injured at the party said that the reason for the attack was that Uday's half-uncle had mocked Uday's speech disorder, and his maternal uncle had told Uday about it. Since birth, Uday's upper jaw extended forward an abnormally large amount, making it difficult for him to speak clearly. At the ceremony, his uncle had imitated him mockingly. Shortly after the shooting incident, seeing his half-brother in the hospital having difficulty walking angered Saddam, who ordered the garage for Uday's luxury cars to be burned down. Saddam said at the time, \"While Iraqis are suffering from the embargo, this situation may send a false message.\"\nUday was angry with his brother Qusay for not preventing Saddam and had a nervous breakdown. Qusay said he prevented him from burning another garage. Uday set up a barricade in front of his luxury cars in another nearby garage, armed himself with weapons, and waited for his father or his men to come. According to his close friend Jaber, Uday would have killed him if his father had come to the second garage.\n\nAccording to Abbas Al Janabi:The reason why Uday shot Watban was a result of a business conflict between Lu'ayy Khayrallah Tulfa [Sajida's brother; Uday's maternal uncle and his childhood friend] and one of Saddam's other half-brothers, with Watban becoming the victim. Following Uday's shooting of [his uncle] Watban, Saddam tried to confiscate and blow up Uday's cars in one garage. But that garage contained only thirteen cars. Saddam did not know that Uday has several other garages; I know of at least six more.\n\n\nMurder of Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel\nIn 1996, Uday along with Qusay, were said to be involved in the killings of their brothers-in-law, Hussein Kamel al-Majid and Saddam Kamel, who themselves were powerful members of the elite regime. The two men, who had defected to Jordan along with their wives and children, were murdered after their return to Iraq.\nAccording to the book The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein by John Nixon, Uday provoked the escape of Hussein and Saddam Kamel in 1995. A drunk Uday went to Kamel's house where a party was being held, and punched Saddam Kamel. When he was defeated by Kamel, Uday took out his gun and fired, but accidentally wounded Watban, who got in the way. Shortly after the grooms escaped to Jordan, Saddam burned the garage for Uday's luxury cars, saying, \"While Iraqis are suffering from the embargo, this situation may send a false message.\" Uday took over Iraq's oil sales, previously largely pocketed by the entourage of Hussein Kamel when he oversaw the oil business along with his responsibilities in defense and industry, Uday also zeroed in on other areas that had been the province of Kamel, including army equipment supplies, reconstruction and food imports. An Iraqi official said, \"Kamel decided to defect because he became frightened that Uday was now getting strong enough to really take care of him.\"\n\nAbout the murder, Abbas Al Janabi, said:The decision to eliminate Husayn Kamil was not decided ahead of time but only after his return to Baghdad. On his return, Husayn Kamil was asked to go to the presidential palace. Saddam asked that both he and his brother divorce their wives (Saddam's daughters), but they both refused. In addition to Uday, Saddam had asked a prominent judge to attend the meeting with Husayn Kamil to prepare the divorce papers. I was at the palace at the time but I stayed outside the meeting room. I waited for 'Uday to leave the room, and he told me the details. After his refusal, Husayn Kamil went to his palace in the Ad-Dura area. The decision to eliminate them took place after their refusal to divorce. The decision to execute Husayn Kamil came from Saddam personally. Saddam had also decided that the execution should be carried out by Husayn Kamil's cousins in the al-Majid clan. It was the duty of Uday, Qusay, and Ali Hasan al-Majid to oversee the executions. Uday was not an initial proponent of his execution. However, after Husayn Kamil refused to divorce Uday's sister, Uday became a supporter of the decision to execute Husayn Kamil and his brother.\"On that day, Janabi said, \"With a loudspeaker, Uday said to him 'You and your brother have to divorce the girls, this is your last chance.' Instead of answering them, Kamel shoot them.\" The shoot-out lasted 13 hours. Then brothers and their father came out to surrender and they were dumped out. \"After they kill him, from a very near distance they shoot him, many bullets in his body. He was just swimming with a lake of blood.\"\n\n\nAssassination attempt\nUday sustained permanent injuries during an assassination attempt while in his Porsche on the evening of 12 December 1996. Struck by between 7 and 17 bullets while driving in al-Mansour, Baghdad, Uday was initially believed to be paralyzed. Evacuated to Ibn Sina Hospital, he eventually recovered but with a noticeable limp. Despite repeated operations, two bullets remained lodged in his spine and could not be removed due to their location. In the wake of Uday's subsequent disabilities, Saddam gave Qusay increasing responsibility and authority, designating him as his heir apparent in 2000. However, Abbas al-Janabi claimed that Uday's exclusion in the family ended after shooting his step-uncle Watban after this assassination. An American hypnotist from Chicago, Larry Garrett, travelled to Baghdad twice in April and September 2001, where he utilized hypnotism to treat Uday's inability to walk with his left leg and spent over 60 hours of personal time with Uday. Garrett said of Uday, \"He was an educated man, with a background in engineering. He was versed in the Koran. He had visited the U.S. with his cousin when he was 17. He expressed some political views, but he didn't involve me in them. I must say I was developing a fondness for him. He never spoke to me as a leader or the son of a leader. He never condescended. It was just two men sitting around at night.\" He published a book of his experiences with Uday in Iraq, initially titled Healing the enemy: Hypnotic Nights in Baghdad, but later changed to Hypnotizing the Devil: The True Story of a Hypnotist Who Treated the Psychotic Son of Saddam Hussein. He met with Uday on the day of the September 11 attacks, where Uday had great concern for Garrett's safety and told him Iraq would likely be blamed for the attack.\nThe Shia Shaaban movement assumed responsibility for the assassination attempt. Salman Sharif, one of the four would-be assassins who attacked Uday, learned that he regularly visited one of the luxurious streets of al-Mansour every Thursday at around 7 in the evening to pick up a girl. They watched the street for three months and made preparations. They realized that Uday was sometimes unprotected and tried to find out which shop owners and workers on the street were part of the secret police, and who were real shopkeepers. On the day of the assassination attempt, they saw a luxury car that could only belong to Uday without bodyguards. They shot at Uday exactly 50 times, with 17 hits. Some Shaaban members who knew about this assassination attempt were arrested for another incident in Jordan and handed over to the Iraqi police. In August 1998, Saddam's men arrested Abu Sajad and learned the details of other members of the team. Sharif's seven brothers and father were imprisoned, and his mother was then told to collect their bodies from the Baghdad morgue. The father and three brothers of would-be assassin Abu Sadeq were executed. Abu Sajad and his father shared the same fate. Security guards destroyed the homes of all families with bulldozers and confiscated all their property. Iraqi intelligence eventually traced Abu Sadeq to a location in Iran where he was assassinated on the elder Hussein's orders in December 2002.\nUday never fully recovered from the injuries he sustained during the attack; purportedly walking with a limp for the rest of his life and—according to popular belief—becoming impotent. Sharif interpreted this as \"divine justice\", referring to Uday's brutal reputation with women.\nAccording to Alaa Bashir, the surgeon who operated on Uday, \"He was not impotent because the injury was far from the reproductive system.\" He said that Uday saw the assassination attempt as God's revenge for having shot his uncle in the same leg. He said, \"Saddam entered the operating room. He looked at his son with calmness, and if any other person, whatever his strength, saw his son in such a scene, he would've lost his temper, but Saddam did not shook his time, but turned around his son and said to him despite his knowledge Uday was unconscious, 'My son, such things are possible and can be expected for men, but we are right and they are false.' Then he kissed him on his forehead and left. Then he met his son Qusay and said to him, 'My son. These things happen to the men, except for a bullet or a wound with a knife. These are normal matters, but you must prepare yourself for the worst day.' Then he went out.\" About Uday's personality, Alaa Bashir said, \"Uday was scary because he was unbalanced and did not care about anyone. He often attacked the leadership, and no one stood up to him, so I avoided him and did not come close to him. Uday used to hate me a lot and tried to offend me and caused me a lot of problems, but his father's interest in me was a deterrent in front of him.\"\nAbbas al-Janabi, who had worked with Uday as his secretary for 15 years, claimed that every Iraqi knew that Uday had come to that street on Thursdays and claimed that Uday had become much more brutal after the assassination attempt. He also claimed that Uday was outraged by the rumors that he was impotent after the assassination attempt and ordered the secret police to make up stories about his virility. Janabi said, \"Uday is a sadist, a monster. I saw how he laughed when someone was whipped.\" He also claimed that he witnessed dozens of rapes. He said that what makes Uday sexually excited was violence: \"This is his nature, rape is like a hobby for him, and believe me, I know what I am talking about and I am not exaggerating.\" Janabi said, \"I saw how he tortured people, how he laughed, how he enjoyed it, you can't control him, he is a kind of maniac, he is a psychologically imbalanced person.\" He said that Uday never kept friends around for long because he enjoyed scaring them. Uday didn't think that it was clean for his dogs to retrieve the birds he shot, so he would force his friends to act as retrievers when he went hunting. He said that Uday neutralized women who refused him with alcohol and drugs, raped them, recorded it, and if the victim's family was important, he terrorized the family by blackmail. He said that Uday even started to look at 12-year-old girls after he was 30 years old. Unlike their fathers, he said that Uday and Qusay are not the type of people to surrender.\nAlaa Bashir claimed that Uday had sustained brain damage due to low blood pressure after the assassination attempt, but doctors could not report this damage to Saddam. Again, according to Bashir, on the day of the incident, Ali Al Sahar, the brother of singer Kadim El Sahar, was with Uday, and the attempt was made on Uday's life when Ali got out of the car to give Uday's phone number to some girls that Uday liked. Ali immediately took Uday to the hospital. Qusay told his father that the incident happened when Uday went to buy food to break his fasting, but Saddam said to Ali, \"I know you were going to pick up girls there.\" Earlier it was claimed that Uday was jealous of singer Kadim Al Sahar because of his fame in Iraq and Kadim had to leave Iraq because of his threats. Abbas Al Janabi said: \"The interesting point here is that the person who saved Uday's life by driving him to the hospital, the singer Ali as-Sahir, received a death threat from Saddam personally in front of others. I was waiting outside the hospital with Qusay when Saddam arrived in a helicopter. He asked for Ali as-Sahir, who was brought to him. In front of us, Saddam told him: 'If anything happens to Uday, I will cut you in pieces.' Saddam thought that Sahir was behind the attempt.\"\nAfter the assassination attempt, Uday said to the press: \"I feel fine. I'm recovering. I feel like any leader of a team would feel if he had been betrayed. I feel that what has happened is not man's work (meaning this was a cowardly act). God bless the Iraqi people. God save Iraq. God save Saddam.\"\nLater, Uday told CNN his wounds are a source of pride and honor. He cited a family history of wounds acquired in battle, ending with his father, wounded in an operation \"for the party\" in 1959. \"And now this has happened to me,\" he said. \"The attack was nothing unusual. It could happen any time, because we are surrounded by countries, some of whom are hostile,\" none more so than Iran, he said. \"Time has proved that Iran is involved in such incidents. Incidents such as this have occurred throughout the region, not just in Iraq.\" He warned that Iran is growing in power, saying it is \"not in the interests of the United States to increase hostility and hatred in the region.\"\n\n\nPartying\nUday was known for forcing guests to drink large quantities of alcohol at his parties. According to a friend, whoever earned Uday's friendship had to drink a cocktail named the \"Uday Saddam Hussein\", a mixture of whiskey, brandy, vodka, cognac, and beer. The cocktail was served in a large \"cup of friendship\", and the new friend had to drink it all. Uday had employees whose job was to make people and especially singers drink cocktails containing 90% alcohol, sometimes including drugs. The guard would line up all the entertainment against the wall and give them 10 minutes to drink. Those who did not drink despite the threats were punished in three ways; having their hair and eyebrows shaven off, being beaten enough to stand up without touching their faces, and being subjected to a foot whipping before being forced to walk. Often, the tortures were done in front of Uday in person. If the bodyguards did not do this, or when asked to answer correctly who was drinking and who did not, they would receive the same punishment. The bodyguards alleged that they tortured people in this way twice a week and at least 100 people a year. \"When Uday wanted for a car, no one could stop him,\" one of his employees said. His employees claimed that they were also tortured by Uday or on Uday's orders. A source claimed that he killed his friend after forcing him to drink large quantities of alcohol, and this is not the first time that Uday has killed those close to him in this way.\nIsmail Hussain, who worked as a singer at Uday's parties in the early 1990s, said \"Uday did not need a reason to party. He would have food and drink tables while many people in Iraq were starving. He'd get drunk and dance—he was a good dancer too. Later, he'd bring out the machine guns and start shooting them off. He'd point the guns right over my head, and the bullets would spray all over the place. I would sing right through the flying bullets. I couldn't hear the music anymore. I'd just keep going, because I couldn't stop. It ended when Uday was ready for it to end. At the parties, there would be about five or six men and 40 or 50 women. He was moody. People were expendable.\" He said, \"I would be performing, and Uday would climb up on the stage with a machine gun and start shooting it at the ceiling. Uday would insist that everyone get drunk with him. He would interrupt my performance, get up on stage with a big glass of cognac for himself and one for me. He would insist that I drink all of it with him. When he gets really drunk, out come the guns. His friends are all terrified of him, because he can have them imprisoned or killed. I saw him once get angry with one of his friends. He kicked the man in the ass so hard that his boot flew off. The man ran over and retrieved the boot and then tried to put it back on Uday's foot, with Uday cursing him all the while.\"\nSinger Qasim Sultan was called to the Hunting Club in 1997 after singing at private parties in the United States and returning to Baghdad. Uday ordered him to sing until the sun rose. At 8:00 a.m., Uday began shouting at Sultan, scolded him for returning to Baghdad without telling him and told his guards to beat him. When Sultan went to another midnight concert by Uday, Uday's bodyguards beat him for not arriving earlier. Before Sultan came on the stage, he was called by Uday to drink his \"mysterious cocktail\", a mixture of beer, gin and other hard liquors. Sultan was hospitalized twice because of the amount of alcohol he was forced to drink at these parties. He also claimed that in 1997, after the assassination attempt, in the garden of Uday's palace, he was forced to sing among the lions. He described the parties as \"a place where armed cowboys can kill you at any time.\" After Al-Shabab was founded in 1993, Iraqi singers of the 70s and 80s, such as Fadel Awad, Saadoun Jaber and Riyadh Ahmed were banned by Uday, on the grounds that they were the singers of the previous generation. Uday said to them, \"You are forbidden from singing and I do not want to hear that any of you sings at a party.\" The ban was issued, their songs were not shown on TV, they did not perform any concert, and did not record a song for TV. However, Singer Ali Al-Issawi said, \"Uday was a fan of singing and a connoisseur and he listened to all the singers and enjoyed our songs. Uday did not punish anyone at that time, but he only held accountable the abusive artists. He used to meet with me two to three times during the same day and did not harm me or my group at all.\"\n\n\nOther ventures\nUday founded his own sports club called Al-Rasheed and signed all the best players from the country to play for the club. They went on to dominate Iraqi football until the team was dissolved in 1990. He also became the editor of the Babel newspaper, the general secretary of the Iraqi Union of Students and the head of the Fedayeen Saddam, as well as the head of the Iraq Journalists Union. His newspaper, Babel, was known for carrying Western reports on Iraq's conflict with the United States and was said to be the most influential newspaper in the country. Uday also had a television channel, Youth TV (Al-Shabab), which aired reports by other Arab channels not usually heard on Iraq's state-run media. Uday used his media empire to discredit people who got in his way. Iraq's most popular radio station was Voice of Youth, owned by Uday, the only radio station that played Western music. Uday seemed proud of his reputation and called himself Abu Sarhan, an Arabic term for \"wolf\".\nUday also ran a food processing business called Super Chicken, which reportedly earned him millions of dollars, and an ice cream company called the Wave.\nUday was responsible for nearly 20 American prisoners of war captured during the Gulf War, including ex-Navy Commander Jeff Zaun, forced to appear on Iraqi state television and forced to condemn their country after being tortured.\nSaad al-Bazzaz, who was the editor-in-chief of Uday's newspapers and state television, said, \"In an editorial meeting, Uday got angry at an article in my newspaper and took out his gun. You could imagine our reaction when he started playing with the gold-plated Kalashnikov while yelling at us. After that, any kind of dialogue with him was impossible. When Uday took over most of the media, the situation in Iraq got worse. This man had nothing to do with journalism, but he saw that media is a powerful way to try to control the minds of the Iraqi people. He knew very well that many journalists did not support his father. Many people worked against the regime at night. Some were beaten and executed. Others were killed or fled the country, leaving their families vulnerable to Uday's bloody revenge retaliation.\"\nDhafer Muhammad Jaber Siddiq, one of Uday's closest aides, said about Uday: \"He used to criticize his father's policies on many occasions, directly or indirectly, especially when discussing with Hussein Kamel... Uday was a young man like many young men trying to get close to beautiful women. He would send his phone number to every young woman he liked. There were a lot of women who were trying to get to know Uday, some of them changed their minds, and some of them strengthened their relationship with him...He was a person with many contradictions. For example, after the killing of his uncle, Minister of Defense Adnan Khairallah in 1989, he started to pray regularly and never cut it, and he fasted every Monday and Thursday, but he used to drink alcohol continuously. He was generous at times to the extreme, but at other times, he became unimaginably stingy. He had his independent empire. He used to say it himself, he used to say that he possessed the foundations of a state. He had press, television, sports, military and trade.\" Uday got a lawyer shot after he raised the case of a 17-year-old girl who was kidnapped and was rumored to be at Uday's Iraqi Olympic Committee compound. According to the lawyer's testimony, \"Uday was looking at the papers I carried for him and then said: I will break both of your legs so that you cannot come back again, but I see your left leg was injured during the war with Iran, so I will break your right leg.\" One of Uday's men then shot the right leg of the lawyer, and had him thrown off near a hospital. As for the girl, she was finally sent to her home after being raped repeatedly and asked her family not to travel. However, she managed to escape to Poland, where some of her relatives lived. But after a few years, some of the killers working for Uday were able to track down the girl and they killed her along with her father, the lawyer said. Some of the waiters working in high-end clubs said that they would shrink with terror whenever Uday arrived, drunk and armed, looking for women to kidnap. A lawyer said that Uday had ordered the head of a beautiful TV presenter to be shaved so that he could keep her long strands and then kept her naked in the Olympic Committee building for a month because she opposed his request.\nMuhammad Asim Shanshal, head of the private office of Uday, said, \"Uday by providing all the possibilities and needs for poors, as he allocated about 40% of the Olympic Committee's revenues as the head of the Olympic Committee, as he was coordinating with the rest of the ministries to allocate 20% of each ministry to poor families... They were spreading these rape rumours to discredit him, so it was not because Uday forced any girl to engage in obscenity, but we must note that any young man in any country has certain relationships and whims. He was a young man who had connections, and he was loved by everyone, and everyone wished to accompany him, but he was a smart person, as he knew very well and with an understanding of how to identify friends. Uday used to provide everything necessary for the players from homes, cars and all means of rest and decent living. But everything that happened if any player made a mistake was reprimanded by Uday, so if the player kept repeating mistakes, he had to be punished. The penalty was to stop him from playing and not participate in the team, until he regained consciousness, and apologized, and if the player insisted on the mistake, his punishment was severe, refer to legal matter. Uday was bloody fierce in the moment only, and after he laughed and loved fun.\"\nIn the last years of the regime, the Fedayeen Saddam troops led by Uday cut off the heads of 30 prostitutes and threw them in front of their homes. A member of a guerrilla group whose duties were mainly special operations of Saddam's Fedayeen said that they assassinated figures opposed to the regime, shattering the appearance of those who were accused of hiding the truth from the government. He said, \"If Uday said, cut his tongue, hands, fingers, or head, or anything, we do that. As for the penalties that do not amount to death, they were executed according to a specific system, those who steal cut their fingers and hands. Those who lie, throw heavy stones on their backs, while informants who transmit incorrect information, put hot irons in their mouths, and those who evade the army, cut their ears.\" When Uday wanted to kill someone, he sent a group equipped with ten photographs of the target. The process would be recorded with video or audio to demonstrate that it was carried out and Uday would maintain a set of these videotapes.\n\n\nFinancial and property interests\nIt has been claimed that Uday had taken advantage of the United Nations sanctions in Iraq and built an immense wealth and influence empire. He supplied oil, cigarettes and other prohibited materials through smuggling and sold them on the black market in Iraq. He also sold alcohol and racehorses to rich Gulf countries. He opened accounts with Yahoo! and MSN Messenger, which created controversy as this allegedly violated U.S. trade sanctions against Iraq. Uday also amassed a large video collection, found in his palace in 2003, much of which featured himself in both public and private situations. In Uday's palace, a zoo with wild animals, hundreds of luxury cars, guns made from many brands of gold, hundreds of luxury alcohol brands, and hundreds of cigars with the name on it were found. At the presidential palace, in Uday's dwellings, anti-depressants, an e-mail output that \"a virgin girl agrees to come to him,\" and another order asking for the girls to be examined for diseases were found. One of Uday's private prisons was later disclosed, and it was stated that there was everyone who bothered Uday inside, the insiders were businessmen clashing with Uday, athletes who could not win, drivers who did not yield him the right of way, and some were thrown into the same cell with German shepherd dogs and left to die. Erotic pictures of women downloaded from the internet and pictures of American president George W. Bush's twin daughters Jenna and Barbara were found on the walls of Uday's gym. In another house owned by Uday, \"pornographic pictures, heroin bags, expensive liqueurs, vintage cars and HIV testing\" was found. He was feeding lions and the other wild animals in his palace and often fed them with his own hands.\nAbbas Al Janabi said: \"He has a large number of cars. He stole around 160 cars from Kuwait. You may not believe it when I tell you that 'Uday has 1,300 luxury cars, such as Rolls Royces, Porsches, Ferraris, Range Rovers, Lincolns and others. Uday has prisons everywhere you go. He has two prisons in the presidential palace, a prison in the armory, a prison in the Olympic Committee, and a prison at his farm in the Radhwaniya compound.\" About his business, he said: \"He controls many facets of smuggling in Iraq—whisky, tobacco, fertilizers, petrol, and other goods. His business interests extend to Turkey, Iran, and Jordan. He has also gained control of all aid going to Iraq from the United Arab Emirates. He stores this aid in warehouses owned by the Olympic Committee and only distributes a small portion of it, always in front of the press. Uday then arranges for this aid to be sold in stores, and gets the proceeds. Uday is also one of the parties who controls the U.S. dollar/dinar exchange rate and the smuggling of dollars overseas. Because of the large number of U.S. dollars he has, he can affect the movement of the exchange rate at any given time to the benefit of his commercial operations.\"\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nPersonal accounts state Uday grew up idolizing his father, Saddam Hussein, although their relationship later became strained due to his father's many mistresses. Uday maintained a close cordial relationship with his mother, Sajida Talfah. The otherwise apathetic Uday, at his uncle Adnan Khairallah's funeral in 1989, showed a rare moment of tenderness.\nUday married 3 times. In 1983, his father arranged for him to marry Nada, the daughter of Ali Hassan al-Majid. They had 2 sons but later divorced. While banished in Geneva, he married Saha, the teenaged daughter of his father's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti in July 1993 in a union arranged by his father. The marriage was never consummated and she deserted him 3 months later after she accused him of beating her during their marriage. She wrote a letter to him in 1996 professing her love despite this. He later married Suja, the daughter of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who had a son with him, although she alleged that he treated her badly.\nAfter being handicapped by the assassination attempt on him in 1996, he maintained distance from Qusay who was rising in ranks and thought to be Saddam's next legitimate successor. Uday was 6 feet 6 inches tall and athletically built, though after the assassination attempt, he was partially paralyzed and would eventually use a wheelchair in private and a walking cane in public.\n\nHis longtime secretary Abbas al Janabi said: Uday is at times the primary cause of the internal squabbles and at others a catalyst for such squabbles within the family. The split in Saddam's family began in 1983 because of [Raghad], Saddam's oldest daughter. A nephew of Barzan was the first person to ask for her hand in marriage. Barzan was the one who went to Saddam to ask on his behalf. Saddam refused. Uday was strongly opposed to this marriage as he was influenced by his mother, Sajida, Saddam's wife and first cousin. Sajida was also the sister of Barzan's wife, but the two sisters did not get along. Barzan thought that Uday was behind Saddam's decision. When [Raghad] married the late Husayn Kamil, Barzan was enraged and the split widened. Sajida wanted Husayn Kamil, who at the time was a member of her security detail, to marry her daughter and preferred him to Barzan. Another source of the family split was Saddam's marriage to Samira Shahbandar [who became his second wife]. About the relationship with his brothers Janabi said in 1999: \"Saddam has one son, Ali, from Samira Shahbandar. He is thirteen years old. He is a member of the board of an athletic club. He is treated in a special manner by his father, with many servants and bodyguards. The press does not focus on Ali because Uday does not want him to have any public role. Even though he is a director of the largest athletic club in Baghdad, Uday refuses to have any publicity surrounding his role. Uday hates him. Uday cannot tolerate his [younger full] brother Qusay, let alone Ali.\" About his personality, he said: \"Uday was a complex personality. It has to do with his upbringing. Saddam personally took charge of bringing up his younger brother Qusay. Although Saddam also participated in bringing up Uday, he did not devote so much attention to him. It was Uday's mother and her father [Khayrallah Tulfa, Saddam's maternal uncle] who had the most influence on him. This is why we see Khayrallah Tulfa's known traits in Uday, such as the love of money, the love for taking over other people's property, violence and extremism. Uday obviously has some of his father's traits as well, but it is his maternal grandfather that seems to have influenced him as well.\"\nIn a sign of loyalty to Saddam, the vice-president of the Revolutionary Command Council Izzat al-Douri consented to marry his daughter Hawazin to Uday. However, al-Douri's influence with Saddam was so substantial that he was able to levy a condition: that the union would not be consummated. Because of Uday's violent and erratic behavior, al-Douri quickly petitioned that his daughter be permitted to divorce Uday. Uday reportedly had no children from his marriage. His third marriage was with Saja al-Tikriti, daughter of his step-uncle Barzan İbrahim al-Tikriti; that marriage soon ended as well, beginning with Saja's refusal to return to Iraq after going to Switzerland. Saja's brother said about the reason of divorce, \"Uday did not beat my sister black and blue but treated her like a princess. My sister was only 16, and had different ideas about marriage. That's why they separated soon after the wedding.\" Dr. Alaa Bashir said: \"Four days after the wedding, Uday was accompanied by a number of prostitutes in a suite at the Rasheed Hotel, which led to a new scandal in Baghdad. Saja went out to Sajida's house because her parents were in Geneva and tried unsuccessfully to persuade her uncle to agree to divorce her, but the president refused and asked her to talk to Uday about that. Uday refused to talk about the issue of divorce and told her: 'Our family does not know about divorce.'\" It was alleged that Uday's first marriage was to the daughter of Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid. A Turkish woman named Sevim Torun claimed that she was married to Uday and had a son named Mesut Uday and published her memoir Saddam's Bride.\nUday was reported to have converted to Shia Islam from Sunni Islam in 2001, but he denied these reports.\n\n\nAllegations of crimes\nIn November 1987, Uday's alleged body double Latif Yahia said, \"I saw many rapes. He raped and killed women, and then killed her parents if they complained. I witnessed many murders. Uday had raped one of the Baghdad Beauty Queens and her father complained to Saddam. He ordered me to kill him. I refused and instead cut my wrists.\"\nA report released on 20 March 2003, one day after the American led invasion of Iraq, by ABC News detailed several allegations against Uday:\n\nAs head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Uday oversaw the imprisonment and torture of Iraqi athletes who were deemed not to have performed to expectations. He would insult athletes who performed below his expectations by calling them dogs and monkeys to their faces. One defector reported that imprisoned football players were forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup finals. The Iraqi national football team were seen with their heads shaved after failing to achieve a good result in a tournament in the 1980s. Another defector claimed that athletes were dragged through a gravel pit and then immersed in a sewage tank to induce infection in their wounds. After Iraq lost 4–1 to Japan in the quarter-finals of the 2000 AFC Asian Cup in Lebanon, goalkeeper Hashim Khamis, defender Abdul-Jabar Hashim and forward Qahtan Chathir were labelled as guilty of loss and eventually flogged for three days by Uday's security.\nOther allegations include:\n\nUday was known to intrude on parties and otherwise \"discover\" women whom he would later rape. Time published an article in 2003 detailing his sexual brutality.\nUsage of an iron maiden on persons who fell foul of him.\nBeating an army officer unconscious when the man refused to allow Uday to dance with his wife; the man later died of his injuries. Uday also shot and killed an army officer who did not salute him.\nStealing approximately 1,200 luxury cars, including a Rolls-Royce Corniche valued at over $200,000.\nPlotting, in 2000, to assassinate Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress. This was done shortly after Saddam named his younger son, Qusay, heir-apparent to the presidency. Uday allegedly intended to curry favour with his father through the assassination.\n\n\nSexual assault allegations\nIn 1987, Uday allegedly raped the 15-year-old daughter of his father's mistress Shaqraa, a Greek-Lebanese former pageant holder who was the daughter of an oil businessman. When Saddam was informed of what happened, after several hours, Uday was put in prison but released after a short period. Because the girl had not kept silent about the rape, Uday's bodyguards tortured her with electric batons with Uday present.\nIn 1999, an anti-embargo group of French volunteers went to Iraq and a woman was forced to stay with Uday after the party, but they were able to leave the party when one of the women said \"we did not come here to be prostitutes\". Miss Germany, Alexandra Vodjanikova, met with Uday and said \"he was charming, downright warm, very friendly and always said to her 'you are beautiful, you are sexy'\".\nOne of his former classmates, Aziz Al-Taee, said:\n\n There was a lot of fear in the female students that the guy had a tradition of choosing the most beautiful woman and trying to force her to date him then the most cases he will exclude her or that's one of his bodyguards to kill her after he rape her. So there was a lot of fear when he was coming to College.\nZainab Salbi, daughter of Saddam Hussein's private pilot said, \"The days when Uday came to the university, the girls were hiding in the toilet in fear to escape from his hungry eyes, but it is a known fact that nobody can escape from the lust of Uday and Uday is known for his eerie quietness than for wild craziness.\" One of his long-time employees, Khaled Jassem, said:\n\nYou shouldn't compete with Uday on two subjects: business and girls. Often, he would make his decisions under the influence of the drink a cocktail based on whiskey, gin and champagne. I have never seen someone so cruel. My life was a nightmare. I was always afraid. I have suffered foot whipping as punishment four times. When he could not attend the caning, he sent his executioners to administer it. But not wanting to deprive himself of the pleasure of hearing the victim's pain, he listened the victim shouting over the telephone.\nAccording to a former employee, Uday would party five nights a week and fast for the remaining two days. The chief of the Baghdad Hunting Club claimed that after a wedding party in the late 1990s, the bride suddenly disappeared, Uday's bodyguards locked all the doors, and the groom committed suicide. Again, according to the allegations of Uday's servant, he witnessed forced custody of a crying bride at home in October 2002 and later said that the girl was killed, and her body was destroyed after she was raped. When the city was about to fall to US-led forces, it was alleged that Uday ordered Fedayeen Saddam to burn his cars instead of letting others take their cars. Former business manager Adib Shabaan said that Uday burned the hips of many women with whom he had sex with a horseshoe, creating a U-shaped scar. Alaa Bashir, the doctor of the Saddam family, claimed that he was treating women who were in the same condition and who had been burned with a lit cigarette by Uday.\nAdeeb al-Ani, who was Uday's secretary, said:\n\nUday wanted a different woman every night and had them kidnapped, usually very young girls, but also women from wealthy Baghdad families. They would all be paid as if they were prostitutes.\nUday's assistant, Adib Shabaan, said: \"In 1998, Uday saw an ex-governor's 14-year-old daughter at a party, had her kidnapped, sent her home after three days, and when the girl's father was informed about the rape and talked about what happened, Uday told the man, 'Your daughters will be my girlfriends, or I will erase you from the earth,' and ordered the man to bring his daughter and his other 12-year-old daughter to his next party.\" According to a former employee, \"Five nights a week, two dozen girls, all brought to him by his friends, were taken to the luxurious Baghdad Boat Club on the Tigris coast to meet Uday; those who were chosen after drinks, music, and dance would spend the night with Uday\". \"He never slept with a girl more than three times,\" said an ex-butler. If a friend used the same brand of clothes, perfumes, or shoes as Uday, Uday would threaten his friend not to use the same thing again. A family friend said that the day Uday discovered the Internet was \"a black day for the Iraqis\", and he had employees whose job was to investigate new methods of torture and new car models on the Internet. In the Boat Club's kitchen there was a monkey named Louisa, and if one of Uday's friends fell asleep at parties because of alcohol, he would put them in the same cage with the drunk monkey.\nAccording to one of Uday's close circle, \"If the girl he chose did not want Uday, if she found another boyfriend or was late or reluctant, she would have to dance after getting her feet whipped.\" Again, according to a friend's claim, Uday would make fun of the girls who lost their virginity because he knew that no one would touch them later and would say, \"She will have to be a prostitute from now on.\" Again, one of his employees said, \"He had a secretary hunting the girls – in universities, ministries. They even had a bedroom in the Olympic offices for women brought to him. They generally agreed to sleep with him. They had no other choice.\"\nHe had allegations against him as recently as early March 2003, shortly before the invasion, when a 13-year-old girl said she accompanied her older sister to Jadriea Equestrian Club, which he frequented. She alleged that she was taken by his bouncers to a back room and raped by him, in which she was given 250,000 Iraqi dinars (about $200).\n\n\nBody double allegations\nIn his memoir, I was Saddam's Son, Uday's alleged body double Latif Yahia said that he witnessed rapes, killings and torture by Uday Hussein. Yahia claimed that in 1987, he was forced to be Uday's body double, even going through plastic surgery to resemble him more. According to Yahia, Uday raped a little Palestinian girl who was selling flowers in the Al-Rashid Hotel, and later raped and murdered a little deaf girl in Nineveh. Uday also ordered the kidnapping of Ilham Ali al-Aazami, Miss Iraq, after she had rejected him. Uday and his bodyguards subsequently held her captive and raped her for weeks, and started the rumor that she was a prostitute, causing her to be killed by her father. When the father confronted Uday, the latter spoke disparagingly about the girl, causing the father to lose control to the point of first verbally accosting and ultimately physically assailing Uday. This prompted Uday to order Latif to shoot the father — rather than acquiesce, Latif instead refused and attempted to commit suicide. Ultimately the father was murdered by one of Uday's bodyguards. On another occasion, Uday attacked a newlywed couple and raped the bride in the al-Medina Hotel. She then committed suicide by throwing herself off the balcony. Her husband, a lieutenant, was later killed for \"insulting the president\".\nIrish Times journalist Eoin Butler and Sunday Times journalist Ed Caesar have questioned Yahia's various claims, including that he was Uday Hussein's body double, and pointed out that many of Yahia's activities since leaving Iraq in 1992, including his education, have not been verified. Individuals close to Yahia and Hussein denied that the former was the latter's body-double, or denied that Hussein had even had a body double. Yahia disputes these claims, stating that his very existence as a body double was a state secret.\n\n\nStatements before 2003\n\nIn July 2002, the Iraqi newspaper Babel, owned by Uday Hussein, published an article by \"Abu Hatim\" (an alias used by Uday) which claimed that the American administration was planning to strike Iraq and exert political control in the Middle East. It stated the plans \"will extend to include everything\", \"starting from making Jordan an alternative homeland for the Palestinians, \"dividing Saudi Arabia into at least three parts and obliterating Bahrain's identity by returning it as part of Persia.\nIn September 2002, Uday threatened that \"the heads of the Americans, the British and others will fly if they try to approach the borders of Iraq, with the aim of invading it.\" During his meeting with a number of delegations of Arab youth, Uday claimed the Americans who are now allied with them are \"Saddam Hussein and his family.\" He added, \"This is the pride of the family. Uday and Qusay said that it is God's will ... In any case, that is better than targeting the infrastructure and sabotaging the electricity, water, communications and other networks. Uday considered that the undeclared goal of the American war against Iraq is to control Iraq's oil and reserves, which he said is \"number one in the world, and they do not say it, they do not say that the war is for oil.\" He added that the last barrel of oil \"on the face of the Earth ... will be a barrel of Iraqi oil. They (the Americans) separated Northern Iraqi in this damned way, because the north has uranium, gold and other materials in it.\"\nUday responded to the accusations of British Prime Minister Tony Blair against Iraq, that the latter \"if his hands and feet were wrapped and put on a bear, he would have nodded evil with his head, and even if he put his head between the jaws of iron and wood pincers and squeezed the head between the jaws of the pincers, his eyes would still move and gesture to evil.\" Uday stressed the \"strength\" of the home front, and that \"the enemy will meet what it does, if he tries to harm Iraq.\"\n\n\nDeath\n\nDuring the Iraq War, Saddam Hussein's closest aide and personal secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud, had been captured, and told his interrogators that he and Saddam's two sons had sought refuge in Syria but were turned back.\nOn the night of 21 July 2003, Nawaf al-Zaidan, who had been sheltering Uday, Qusay, Mustafa and their bodyguard Abdul-Samad in his mansion in the Falah neighbourhood of northeastern Mosul, left the villa and went to a nearby 101st Airborne base to turn in the two sons due to the combined $30 million reward. \"He was nervous, I could tell, more nervous than anybody else I've seen dealing with it. Yet he had confidence in what he said. More than most of the other people,\" the 23-year-old American military intelligence sergeant who interviewed al-Zaidan told 60 Minutes II. \"He had exact locations. He also could tell very good descriptions on Qusay and Uday as well, their habits. He told me what exactly they looked like.\" Al-Zaidan then passed a lie detector test, which was interpreted as a definitive validation of his story.\nOn the morning of 22 July 2003, JSOC Task Force 20, aided by troops of the United States Army 101st Airborne Division, surrounded Uday, Qusay, and Qusay's 14-year-old son Mustafa during a raid on a home in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Acting on a tip from al-Zaidan, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division provided security while the Task Force 20 operators tried to capture the inhabitants of the house. As many as 200 American troops, later aided by OH-58 Kiowa helicopters, surrounded and fired upon the house, killing Uday, Qusay, and Qusay's son. After approximately five hours of battle, soldiers entered the house and found four bodies, including the Hussein brothers' bodyguard.\nSoldiers, who tried to enter the house three times, encountered resistance with AK-47 and grenades in the first two attempts. Uday, Qusay, and the guard took up positions in a bathroom at the front of the building, where they had a line of fire on the streets and on steps leading up to the first floor; Qusay's son took cover in the bedroom in the back and defended himself. The American forces then bombed the house many times and fired missiles. The three adults were thought to have died from a TOW missile fired into the front of the house. In the third attempt, the soldiers killed Mustafa after he fired. Mustafa had been the last one to die in the five-hour siege and kept shooting even after Qusay and Uday had been killed, US military officials said.\nBrigade commander Colonel Joe Anderson said an Arabic announcement was made at 10:00 a.m. on the day and called on people inside to come out peacefully. The answer he received was bullet bombardment. An experienced team of special forces tried to attack the building, but they had to retreat under fire. Four American soldiers were injured. Anderson then ordered his men to fire with 50-caliber heavy machine guns. Uday and Qusay refused to surrender even after a helicopter fired a rocket and the Strike Brigade fired 40 mm grenades at them. Anderson decided that more firepower was necessary to take down the brothers, leading to 12 TOW missiles being fired into the building.\nLater, the American command said that dental records had conclusively identified two of the dead men as Saddam Hussein's sons. They also announced that the informant would receive the combined $30 million reward previously offered for their apprehension.\n\nAccording to Saddam Hussein's memoirs, when he learned about the death of his sons and grandson, the first thing he asked was, \"Did they fight?\" When he got the answer \"Yes\", then he said, \"Good! Praise be to God, who honored me with their martyrdom and defense of their homeland.\"\n\nAfter his sons' deaths, Saddam Hussein recorded a tape and said: \"Beloved Iraqis, your brothers Uday and Qusay, and Mustafa, the son of Qusay, took a stand of faith, which pleases God, makes a friend happy, and makes an enemy angry. They stood in the arena of jihad in Mosul, after a valiant battle with the enemy that lasted six hours. The armies of aggression mobilised all types of weapons of the ground forces against them and succeeded to harm them only when they used planes against the house where they were. Thus, they adopted a stand with which God has honoured this Hussein family so that the present would be a continuation of the brilliant, genuine, faithful, and honourable past. We thank God for what he has ordained for us when he honoured us with their martyrdom for his sake. We ask Almighty God to satisfy them and all the righteous martyrs after they satisfied him with their faithful Jihadist stand. Had Saddam Hussein had 100 children, other than Uday and Qusay, Saddam Hussein would have sacrificed them on the same path God honoured us by their martyrdom. If you had killed Uday, Qusay, Mustafa, and another mujahideen man with them, all the youths of our nation and the youths of Iraq are Uday, Qusay, and Mustafa in the fields of jihad.\" During Saddam's interrogation, when George Piro started asking questions about Uday, Piro said, \"I was surprised. He didn't show any remorse (about his son's death). He told me that he was, of course, proud of his sons. They died believing, or fighting, for what they believed. I pressed him until Saddam didn't want to hear anymore (the rumors about Uday). He tells me to stop. Basically stop asking these questions. You don't get to pick your kids. You're kind of stuck with what you get.\" During a different interrogation, when CIA analyst John Nixon confronted Saddam with the rumor that he and Samira had a son named Ali, Saddam painfully said, \"If I told you yes, would you kill him like you killed Uday and Qusay?\" Saddam also told Nixon he had learned of his sons' deaths through BBC radio.\nNewsweek claimed that the contents of Uday Hussein's briefcase consisted of Viagra, numerous bottles of cologne, unopened packages of men's underwear, dress shirts, a silk tie and a single condom. The money found with the former Iraqi leader's sons was more than three times the $30 million bounty on their heads by the US Government. They had about $100 million in Iraqi dinars and US dollars. Some claimed Nawaf al-Zaidan, who owned the villa where the men were hiding, had tipped off the Americans to their presence after reportedly sheltering them for 23 days.\nThe others claimed that Uday and Qusay were tracked down after Uday made a telephone call to an associate that was tracked by the US Central Intelligence Agency. Then the brother of Nawaf, Salah al-Zaidan, was shot dead by gunmen while Nawaf was thought to have fled Iraq. According to a former bodyguard for Uday Hussein, after the fall of Baghdad, they planned a guerrilla resistance and Saddam and his sons lived separately in Baghdad after the American occupation, changing houses every two or three days. But Uday continued to drive through the city in nondescript vehicles, and always with a machine pistol, according to the bodyguard. He said Saddam and his sons had been moving freely around Baghdad, often with astonishingly little effort to hide themselves during the war.\nAt one stage, Uday had driven past a convoy of US soldiers, looking at their faces and quietly insulting the men who now controlled his country. During the war, Uday forsook the alcohol and womanising and concentrated his energies on directing the Fedayeen Saddam.\nThe U.S. Administration released graphic pictures of the Hussein brothers' bodies. Both brothers had grown long beards to avoid detection, with Uday shaving his head. Afterwards, their bodies were reconstructed by morticians to assure the public that they were deceased. For example, Uday's beard was trimmed, his nose was repaired, facial gashes from the battle were removed and an 8-inch metal bar in his leg from the 1996 assassination attempt was removed. When criticized, the U.S. military's response was to point out that these men were no ordinary combatants, and to express hope that confirmation of the deaths would bring closure to the Iraqi people. Uday is buried in a cemetery in his hometown of Al-Awja near Tikrit, alongside Qusay and Mustafa. In 2017, his son Massoud claimed that the Iranian government stole his body although this was unproven.\n\n\nIn film, television, and theatre\nPhilip Arditti portrayed Uday in the docudrama television miniseries House of Saddam. He and Latif were portrayed by Dominic Cooper in The Devil's Double, based on Latif's memoirs, I was Saddam's Son, but according to Latif had only been \"20% of the truth\". Hrach Titizian portrayed him in the play Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo. Sam Vincenti portrayed him in the Locked Up Abroad TV-series, in the 2013 episode \"Son of Saddam\".\nIn the 1999 movie Deterrence, Uday is depicted as Saddam's successor. A reference to Uday is made on the American The Office TV series, in the 2011 episode \"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\".\nUday is referenced in the 2003 season of Arrested Development, where a Saddam Hussein lookalike exclaims that \"I am behaving like an Uday lookalike.\"\nUday and Qusay are referenced during a sketch in The Eric Andre Show's 2020 episode, \"The 50th Episode!\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Uday Hussein at Wikimedia Commons",
    "summary": "Uday Saddam Hussein (Arabic: عدي صدام حسين; 18 June 1964 – 22 July 2003) was an Iraqi politician and businessman. He was the eldest son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and his first wife Sajida Talfah, and was known for his extreme cruelty, erratic behavior, and human rights abuses, which included torture, rape, and murder. \nBorn in Baghdad, Uday was seen for several years as the likely successor to his father; however, he lost the place as heir apparent to his younger brother, Qusay, due to injuries in an assassination attempt. Owing to his family connections, Uday held various roles in the Iraqi political and military circles, as well as in business. He held positions as a sports chairman, heading the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Iraq Football Association, and the Fedayeen Saddam.\nUday held various positions in the Iraqi government and military, including chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, head of the Iraq Football Association, and commander of the paramilitary group Fedayeen Saddam. He was notorious for using his positions to inflict abuse. Athletes who lost matches were often imprisoned, beaten, and tortured in a private prison in the basement of the Olympic Committee building, sometimes in a sarcophagus with nails pointing inward or by being dropped into acid baths.\nUday was accused of serial rape and murder of young women, whom his guards would often snatch from the streets and force to come to his parties. In one infamous incident, he bludgeoned his father's favorite bodyguard to death at a party in 1988, an act for which he was briefly imprisoned by his father.\nDue to his violent and unstable nature, Saddam eventually favored his younger, more discreet son Qusay as his successor. In 1996, Uday was severely injured in an assassination attempt by gunmen, which left him partially paralyzed and able to walk only with great difficulty. Following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, he was killed alongside Qusay and his nephew Mustafa by an American task force after a prolonged gunfight in Mosul.",

    "text": "St Peter's Church is in the village of Swettenham, Cheshire, England.  The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.  It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Congleton.  Its benefice is combined with that of Marton, Siddington, Eaton and Hulme Walfield.\n\n\nHistory\nIt is considered that a Norman church followed by a timber-framed church (of which some timbers remain in the sanctuary) was on the site of the present church.  The nave is thought to have been added in around 1500. The building was encased in brick in the early 1720s and most of the timber framework was lost partly at this time and partly during later restorations.  In 1846 a restoration was carried out by J. M. Derrick in Romanesque style and a Victorian restoration in 1865 was in Gothic Revival style.  Another restoration took place in 1926.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nExterior\nThe plan of the church consists of a west tower, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel and a north porch.  The tower is built in brick, as is the wall of the north aisle, while the wall of the south aisle is stone.  The roofs are of slate.  On the west face of the tower is a door above which is a window and above that a clock in a diamond-shaped wooden frame.  On the top of the tower is a brick parapet with a stone coping and vase finials on the corners, and a weather vane on a high-standing metal support.  Above the north porch is a sculpture of an ass's head upon the coronet of a marquess, which is the crest of the Mainwaring family.\n\n\nInterior\nThe pulpit is thought to date from the time of Queen Anne and was placed in the church around 1722. The altar rails are placed round three sides and in the church are three Jacobean chairs.  Two fonts are present, one dating from the 18th century and the other from the Romanesque restoration.  To the south of the altar is a stained glass window which contains some medieval glass.  In the south aisle walls are four Gothic monuments. On the north aisle wall are painted commandment boards.  A fragment of a Anglo-Saxon cross is set high in the wall between the nave and the south aisle.  In the vestry, above the Bryce family memorial, is mounted an old fiddle which was played in the church until about 1811.  The organ was built in 1964 by Noel Mander incorporating some of the pipework from the previous organ by Bryceson.  The astronomer Bernard Lovell was organist for 40 years. There is a ring of three bells, which are dated from around 1500, from 1627 and from 1689.  The parish registers begin in 1547 and the churchwardens' accounts in the 17th century.\n\n\nSee also\n\nGrade II* listed buildings in Cheshire East\nListed buildings in Swettenham\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nMedieval stained glass information from CVMA",

    "text": "Richard Arthur Teague (December 26, 1923 – May 5, 1991) was an American industrial designer in the North American automotive industry. He held automotive design positions at General Motors, Packard, and Chrysler before becoming Vice President of Design for American Motors Corporation (AMC). \nTeague designed several notable show cars and production vehicles, including the Packard Executive, many AMC models, such as the Pacer, Gremlin, and Hornet, as well as the Jeep Cherokee XJ. After Chrysler acquired American Motors in 1987, he also designed or assisted in styling later automobiles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ and the Neon.\n\n\nEarly life\nTeague's mother worked in the motion picture industry during the silent movie era. At five years of age, Teague appeared in five episodes of Our Gang, playing the role of Dixie Duval, a girl. When he was six, he was seriously injured in a car accident near Pasadena, California, which a drunk driver caused. He lost several teeth and suffered a broken jaw, as well as sight in his right eye (leaving him without depth perception or stereoscopic vision), while his mother was left an invalid. A year later, his father was killed in another automobile accident, also caused by a drunk driver.\nWhile attending grade school in Los Angeles during the 1930s, Teague built model airplanes before turning to hot rods, since his schoolmates included Ed Iskenderian, a hot-rodder and later automotive entrepreneur, and land speed racer Stuart Hilborn, as well as other car enthusiasts. He participated in time trials on a dry lake northeast of Los Angeles and was fond of saying that he \"had a little gasoline in his blood.\"\nTeague was exempt from service in the armed forces during World War II because of his visual impairment. After graduating from Susan Miller Dorsey High School in 1942, he worked as an aircraft technical illustrator for Northrop Corporation. His boss, Paul Browne, was a former designer at General Motors who suggested that Teague take night classes at the ArtCenter College of Design.\n\n\nEarly work\n\nAfter World War II, Teague proposed a pre-Henry J economy car design for Kaiser Motors.\nIn 1947, he joined the General Motors design studios headed by Edmund Anderson, starting as an apprentice stylist and eventually moving up to the Cadillac advanced design group. He also worked on the 1950 Oldsmobile Rocket. The 1950s \"saw some of the most beautiful and some of the most outlandish vehicles,\" and the head of the design department at General Motors liked chrome on cars. Teague described how GM stylists made two sets of overlay designs for Harley Earl to choose from. Both chrome trim sets had been put on one Oldsmobile prototype by mistake. Earl saw it and ordered it produced that way, although the stylists were horrified.\nTeague was dismissed from General Motors in 1952 and joined the Packard Motor Car Company as chief stylist, following John Reinhart's resignation. His first work there was a minor facelift on the Packard line for 1953. Packard management, under James J. Nance, decided to relaunch the Clipper brand as a standalone make, separate from Packard. It was Teague who achieved the visual distinction between the two models. He also designed several Packard show cars. These included the 1953 Balboa (whose canopied reverse-slant and lowering for ventilation rear window later appeared on the 1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, 1958–1960 Lincoln Continental, and several Mercury models), and the 1954 Packard Panther. Teague contributed with William Schmidt to the 1955 Request, whose principal designer was Dick Macadam.\nThe restyled Packard line for 1955 showcased Teague's keen eye for detail and ability to produce significant changes within limited budgets. However, the company was not doing well following the 1954 purchase of the struggling Studebaker Corporation. The last Teague design for Packard was the Executive, introduced in mid-1956 and derived from the Clipper Custom, which was launched just as sales of the luxury Packard line were collapsing. Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor, as well as a new Packard and Clipper lineup for 1957, which would have followed the general lines of the Predictor. The design was stillborn when, in mid-1956, the merged automaker shut down the Detroit Packard operations. Lacking funds for all-new models, Studebaker-Packard had to use existing and more economical Studebaker designs. Working with little time and money, the stopgap 1957 Studebaker-based Packard models became known as \"Packardbakers.\" The 1957 Packard Clipper, popularly derided as \"a Studebaker wearing Packard makeup\", was designed mainly by Teague, and was intended as a temporary stopgap to keep the brand going until the company's fortunes improved and a \"real\" Packard model could again be made.\nBy 1957, the entire Packard styling team had moved to Chrysler Corporation and Teague became chief stylist. However, there was an acrimonious battle between the director of design, William Schmidt, and vice-president Virgil Exner, that made working difficult for Teague. He would later reflect in a Road & Track magazine story: \"It was the worst 18 months of my life.\" Teague went to work for an independent design firm on non-automotive assignments.\n\n\nAmerican Motors\n\nTeague joined American Motors Corporation (AMC) as a member of Edmund E. Anderson's design team in September 1959. Teague's first assignment, according to designer James W. (Jim) Alexander, was to re-do the front sheet metal on the 1961 Ambassador. The first cars influenced by Teague's styling were the 1963 Rambler Classic and Ambassador, AMC's first all-new models since 1956. \nAfter Anderson left AMC in 1961, Teague was named the director of styling. This was when AMC was \"suffering from an image design problem\". With the ascendancy of Teague in the early 1960s, \"AMC Styling began to be written in a more positive manner\" within the industry and automotive press. His first significant project was the Rambler Tarpon, a compact fastback that could have \"conceivably matched Ford's forthcoming Mustang for pace and style\" if AMC's president Roy Abernethy had approved it. He was promoted to vice president of styling in 1964. He held this position at the automaker until he retired from AMC in 1983. At his retirement, he joked that the only Detroit auto company he had not worked for was Ford.\nAlthough he worked within tight budget restrictions at AMC, Teague sometimes referred to his time there as \"Camelot\". Designing several different cars from existing AMC stampings, he worked \"relative miracles\" compared to the spending norms in this industry. With little money to work with, he reconfigured the existing cars and parts in new ways. For example, he incorporated the doors from AMC's large-sized automobiles into his design for the new 1964 compact Rambler American.\nThe AMC Cavalier was one of the \"Project IV\" concept cars in the mid-1960s that demonstrated advanced techniques of interchangeable body panels and design symmetry. The right front and left rear fenders were identical, as well as the panels for doors, hood, and deck lid, all interchanged. The automobile platforms designed by Teague featured numerous interchangeable door skins, glass, and more. For example, the front and rear bumpers on the 1970 AMC Hornet were made from the same stamping. This design talent yielded significant cost savings for the company.\nTeague's work on the 1967 through 1969 AMC Ambassador proved that he \"could do more with less than most any other car designer around—usually because he had to.\" While the 1965 models were reskinned and rode on a longer wheelbase, Teague \"came through handsomely with crisp, angular lines\" that helped the Ambassador achieve record sales. The 1967 model year brought even more significant changes that were in line with Roy Abernethy's longtime aim of matching Big Three models on almost every front, including an all-new Ambassador that \"emerged as one of the decade's unsung good-lookers.\"\nAfter a management change at AMC, Teague worked under Roy D. Chapin Jr., who was also a sports car enthusiast. Teague developed production models that featured \"excitement,\" such as the Javelin. This design evolved from two AMX prototypes that were part of the \"Project IV\" concept cars during the 1966 automobile show circuit. Other top executives, such as Robert B. Evans, wanted Teague's two-seat AMX design to be brought to the market \"very quickly.\" Teague originated a non-running show car in late 1965, and since he was a \"two-seater kind of guy, the production American Motors AMX was his car.\" The new models' offerings reflected AMC's strategy to shed its \"economy car\" image and appeal to a more youthful, performance-oriented market.\nDuring the 1970s, \"only a handful of cars had real personalities, and many of those came from the smallest U.S. producer, American Motors\" under the direction of Teague. When the automobile market was changing to a greater focus on quality and fuel efficiency, Teague characterized the work by his design team at AMC as \"We still want to make cars with charisma; cars that stand out from the pack ... the future means the large look inside, away from the claustrophobic.\"\nIn 1971, Teague proposed an innovative economy car incorporating a lightweight materials with front-wheel drive utilizing a compact Wankel engine. However, the 1975 production version of the AMC Pacer turned out to be different due to numerous constraints. Focused on making the car large inside, it is considered to be the first car with a cab forward design. It was also the first 'wide-small' automobile that \"gave drivers the impression they were driving a conventional large American.\" Its \"styling was different and appealing in an offbeat sort of way\" featuring large amounts of glass. The Pacer's low beltline prevented the side door window from lowering entirely out of sight, so Teague designed the inner door panels with large bolsters.\" Anatole Lapine, the designer of the Porsche 928 body, was inspired by the Pacer.\nAmerican Motors was the smallest domestic automaker and had \"to innovate or die\" and this strategy was formalized by Chapin in the firm's \"Philosophy of Difference\" because it could not copy or compete with its rivals, but needed to go its own way by innovating market segments to survive. The company \"produced some wonderfully creative and original designs\". In the 1980, Teague unsuccessfully attempted to persuade AMC's board of directors with a minivan concept, a design formula adopted by Chrysler. Teague headed talented stylists that included Fred Hudson, Chuck Mashigan, Robert \"Bob\" Nixon, Vince Geraci, Norbert Ostrowski, and others.\n\n\nTeague designs\n\nBritish automotive writer Nick Georgano devotes a chapter to Teague in the book titled The Art of the American Automobile: the Greatest Stylists and Their Work, describing individuals whose creative talents made a difference in production and custom automobiles since the 1930s. According to the authors of the book, Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future, Teague was one of the people that \"helped to transport us into the future.\" While serving as the chief stylist, Teague was called by Popular Mechanics to predict the design trends for automobiles in the 1960s. Together with Brooks Stevens, Teague presented ideas about future cars and vehicle technologies at the 1963 SAE congress in Detroit. Teague, \"who is generally considered to have been a bit of a maverick\" predicted an evolutionary process for automobiles that turned out to be correct. Teague foretold improvements in conventional gasoline engines, while cars \"would have greater variety of style now that glass could be shaped, and better suspension systems\". In contrast to Stevens, Teague believed that the automobiles of 1970 would still be built to provide basic transportation, not \"a home on wheels\", and be powered by an advanced power plant \"the size of a breadbox.\"\nDuring the early 1960s, Teague's styling team began developing an entirely new concept for AMC—a sporty fastback design. Teague knew that the automaker was just not willing to spend the millions of dollars needed for all-new tooling; his design team made imaginative use of existing tooling and devised spin-offs from existing products. The results were proposals for which Teague selected the names for both: the Tarpon show car and the production Marlin. Although promoting the smaller version, Teague recalled that \"Abernethy had decided that instead of a 2+2 we would build a 3+3 sports-type car.\"\nTeague was responsible for designing several AMC and Jeep vehicles. He developed the Gremlin, Pacer, Matador coupe, Rambler American, AMC Javelin, and AMX and Hornet. Subsequently, he adapted AMC's compact platform for the Concord, Spirit, and Eagle models. Teague was also responsible for many concept cars and lobbied for the production of several, including the compact Tarpon, which ultimately led to the development of the large Marlin. He also lobbied company executives to continue the two-seat AMX models after the 1970 model year.\nThe 1968 AMX GT was one of the Teague-designed concept cars with some design elements incorporated into production models. For this short-wheelbase coupe, he styled a truncated kammback tail, which was then used on the 1970 Gremlin. Teague also designed the \"Concept 80\" series of show cars, built on variations of existing AMC platforms as ideas for possible future models.\nPerhaps Teague's most substantial effort ever was the \"handsome design\" of the 1970 AMX/3 that AMC developed with help on the chassis from Italian sports-car engineer Giotto Bizzarrini and road testing and development from BMW. Before he and his team of designers settled on the final design, a fiberglass push-mobile was made with the molds taken from the final clay mockup. The AMX/3 is one of the most unusual cars to come out of Detroit in the late 1960s featuring an internationally sourced components, a top speed of 160 mph (260 km/h), and potentially the Ford Pantera as its closest competitor. Teague was instrumental in moving the car to production at a reasonable cost, but upcoming U.S. bumper regulations and other issues would have inflated its price beyond volume viability.\nTeague was responsible for the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) that was launched in the United States in 1983. He described the practical and utilitarian appearance of the new SUV: \"We didn't want to lose the flavor of the older Jeeps ... We wanted it to look like something you'd want to take into the rough country.\" The design was unchanged and remained in production through 2001 and in China to 2005. The Cherokee XJ was described by one automotive magazine in 2009 as \"possibly the best SUV shape of all time\", and was the last Teague design to go into production. Automotive journalist Robert Cumberford, writing for Automobile, called the Jeep XJ one of the 20 greatest cars of all time—for its design, and \"possibly the best SUV shape of all time, it is the paradigmatic model to which other designers have since aspired.\"\nStarting in 1982, Teague worked on the first large cars sold by AMC since 1978, the front-drive sedan code-named X-58, for introduction in late 1986. and a companion code-named X-59, which was to debut for the 1988 model year. He achieved a roomy interior in an aerodynamic design. The two-door version was to have featured hidden headlamps, but the coupe was never produced. Giorgetto Giugiaro penned the sharper-edged exterior design for the four-door sedan that went into production as the Eagle Premier.\n\n\nHistorian and collector\n\nTeague was a noted automobile historian who collected classic and rare vehicles, as well as other automotive memorabilia. He restored old cars as a hobby, including a 1904 Packard, one of the first produced, and had already owned 285 vehicles by 1970. Teague was a four-wheel-drive enthusiast even before AMC bought Jeep. He owned several World War II models. At retirement, he mentioned that he had owned \"400 or 500\" cars. Teague's collection included a rare AMX/3.

In the award's 12-year history, this was the first time an automotive stylist was so honored.\nTeague was honored with the EyesOn Design 1999 \"Lifetime Design Achievement Award\" for his accomplishments as an automotive designer.\nTeague was inducted posthumously to the AMC Hall of Fame as the 2012 \"Person of American Motors\", an award established in 2002 on the \"AMC Forum\" recognizing an executive or employee of AMC or a subsidiary company that was instrumental to the company's success.\n\n\nFamily\nTeague married his wife Marian A. Rose (Johnson, 1927–) in 1950. He had three children: Richard B. (\"Rick\", 1953–2002), Jeff (1956–2016), and daughter Lisa (Scarpelli). Jeff Teague was also an industrial designer and established two automotive and product design services firms: \"Teague Design\" and \"JTDNA Design\". Jeff was quoted as saying that he did not \"long for the vehicles of his father's days\", but had sketched updated versions of his father's designs including the AMX/3.\n\n\nDeath\nTeague died on 5 May 1991 after suffering a long illness.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBibliography\nKimes, Beverly (2005).

    "text": "Charles Alan Fyffe (3 December 1845 – 19 February 1892) was an English historian, who was also well known as a journalist and a political candidate.\n\n\nLife\nHe was the son of Lawrence Hay Fyffe, M.D. of Blackheath, by Mary Prudence, daughter of John Ord, born at Lee Park, Blackheath, on 3 December 1845. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and obtained an open exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, 1864. He graduated B.A. in 1868 and M.A. in 1870.\nIn 1871, Fyffe was elected a fellow of University College, and for many years acted as the bursar. He acted as correspondent to the Daily News during the first part of the Franco-Prussian War, and was in Paris during the commune, where he was taken for a spy.\nFyffe entered Lincoln's Inn on 10 June 1873. He later transferred to the Inner Temple (26 May 1876), where he was called to the bar on 10 May 1877. He joined the south-west circuit, but never practiced.\n\n\nPolitics\nFyffe had strong Liberal views, and was president of the Oxford Union in 1867. In 1870, in Macmillan's Magazine, he wrote that \"Liberalism has become co-extensive with intelligence\". His activism was influenced by T. H. Green.\nFyffe held views as a land law reformer and was one of the founders of the free land league. His views on land reform were broadly supported by Sir Charles Dilke; they were more in line with the ideas of Henry George than those of Henry Hyndman, or the land nationalisation of Alfred Russel Wallace. His evidence for the Report on Small Holdings of 1888–90 was that demand for smallholdings could be very high. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the city of Oxford in the Radical interest at the general election of 1885.\n\n\nCourt case and death\n\nIn 1891, Fyffe was a prospective parliamentary candidate at Devizes. A charge was brought to court against him at Wiltshire Assizes. It was thrown out, but Fyffe attempted suicide. Early biographies were reticent about the details. Newspaper reports from overseas were that the charge was of improper assault; John Richard Robinson appeared as a witness for Fyffe. The charge was brought by a young fellow-passenger on the Brighton Railway.\nFyffe did not recover from his suicide attempt, and died on 19 February 1892 at Laughton Hall, Edinburgh. He was buried at Buncton in Sussex.\n\n\nWorks\nIn 1875, Fyffe published a small school history of Greece, which sold well. His History of Modern Europe was in three volumes (1880, 1886, 1890) and passed through subsequent editions.\n\n\nFamily\nFyffe married, on 7 June 1883, Henrietta Frances Arnaud, the only child of Waynflete Arnaud Blagden of Holmbush Ashington, Sussex, by whom he left three children.\nChildren of Charles Alan Fyffe & Henrietta Frances Arnaud Blagden\n\nAlan Herbert Fyffe  1884-1939  England Cricketer & J.P.\nMary Constance Fyffe  1885-1964  Married Lt.-Col Ivor Picton-Turbervill\nRonald Laurence Fyffe  1887-1901\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nRobin Darwall-Smith, Charles Alan Fyffe: A Victorian Tragedy, University College Record, XIII, No. 1, 2001, pp. 72–84.\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lee, Sidney, ed.

    "text": "Dicyclopentadiene, abbreviated DCPD, is a chemical compound with formula C10H12.  At room temperature, it is a white brittle wax, although lower purity samples can be straw coloured liquids. The pure material smells somewhat of soy wax or camphor, with less pure samples possessing a stronger acrid odor. Its energy density is 10,975 Wh/l.\nDicyclopentadiene is a co-produced in large quantities in the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oils to ethylene. The major use is in resins, particularly, unsaturated polyester resins.  It is also used in inks, adhesives, and paints.\nThe top seven suppliers worldwide together had an annual capacity in 2001 of 179 kilotonnes (395 million pounds).\nDCPD was discovered in 1885 as a C10H12 hydrocarbon among the products of pyrolysis of phenol by Henry Roscoe, who didn't identify the structure (that was made during the following decade) but accurately assumed that it was a dimer of some C5H6 hydrocarbon.\n\n\nHistory and structure\nFor many years the structure of dicyclopentadiene was thought to feature a cyclobutane ring as the fusion between the two subunits.  Through the efforts of Alder and coworker, the structure was deduced in 1931.\nThe spontaneous dimerization of neat cyclopentadiene at room temperature to form dicyclopentadiene proceeds to around 50% conversion over 24 hours and yields the endo isomer in better than 99:1 ratio as the kinetically favored product (about 150:1 endo:exo at 80 °C).  However, prolonged heating results in isomerization to the exo isomer.  The pure exo isomer was first prepared by base-mediated elimination of hydroiodo-exo-dicyclopentadiene.  Thermodynamically, the exo isomer is about 0.7 kcal/mol more stable than the endo isomer. The exo isomer also has a lower reported melting point of 19°C. Both isomers are chiral.\n\n\nReactions\nAbove 150 °C, dicyclopentadiene undergoes a retro-Diels–Alder reaction at an appreciable rate to yield cyclopentadiene. The reaction is reversible and at room temperature cyclopentadiene dimerizes over the course of hours to re-form dicyclopentadiene.   Cyclopentadiene is a useful diene in Diels–Alder reactions as well as a precursor to metallocenes in organometallic chemistry.  It is not available commercially as the monomer, due to the rapid formation of dicyclopentadiene; hence, it must be prepared by \"cracking\" the dicyclopentadiene (heating the dimer and isolating the monomer by distillation) shortly before it is needed.\nThe thermodynamic parameters of this process have been measured.  At temperatures above about 125 °C in the vapor phase, dissociation to cyclopentadiene monomer starts to become thermodynamically favored (the dissociation constant Kd = [cyclopentadiene]2 / [dicyclopentadiene] > 1).  For instance, the values of Kd at 149 °C and 195 °C were found to be 277 and 2200, respectively.  By extrapolation, Kd  is on the order of 10–4 at 25 °C, and dissociation is disfavored.  In accord with the negative values of ΔH° and ΔS° for the Diels–Alder reaction, dissociation of dicyclopentadiene is more thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures.  Equilibrium constant measurements imply that ΔH° = –18 kcal/mol and ΔS° = –40 eu for cyclopentadiene dimerization.  \nDicyclopentadiene polymerizes. Copolymers are formed with ethylene or styrene. The \"norbornene double bond\" participates.  Using ring-opening metathesis polymerization a homopolymer polydicyclopentadiene is formed.\nHydroformylation of DCP gives the dialdehyde called TCD dialdehyde (TCD = tricyclodecane).  This dialdehyde can be oxidized to the dicarboxylic acid and to a diol.  All of these derivatives have some use in polymer science.\nHydrogenation of dicyclopentadiene gives tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (C10H16), which is a component of jet fuel JP-10, and rearranges to adamantane with aluminium chloride or acid at elevated temperature.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMSDS for dicyclopentadiene\nInchem fact sheet for dicyclopentadiene\nCDC — NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards",

    "text": "The Harpers Ferry Armory, more formally known as the United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry, was the second federal armory created by the United States government; the first was the Springfield Armory. It was located in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, which since 1863 has been part of West Virginia. It was both an arsenal, manufacturing firearms, and an armory, a storehouse for firearms. Along with the Springfield Armory, it was instrumental in the development of machining techniques to make interchangeable parts of precisely the same dimensions.\nThe Armory was a long, narrow complex of buildings, located alongside the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line on a strip of land alongside the Potomac River. The entrance was close to the center of town, with its train station and hotels, and the bridge, the B & O Railroad Potomac River Crossing. At its peak, just before the Civil War, the Armory had 400 employees. As of that date, the Armory had manufactured some 600,000 firearms.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Armory was destroyed and its equipment removed; it was not rebuilt. The only surviving building is its former fire engine house, known today as John Brown's Fort. As of 2021, it is not in its original location.\n\n\nThe national armory\nIn 1794, the U.S. Congress passed a bill calling \"for the erecting and repairing of Arsenals and Magazines\". President George Washington, given wide latitude in carrying out this order, selected Harpers Ferry, then a part of Virginia, for the location of the Harpers Ferry National Armory. George Washington believed that an inland location would be more defensible against foreign military attack. However, his friends had an interest in the Potomac Company, which influenced his decision to locate the armory. In 1796, the United States government purchased a 125-acre (0.51 km2) parcel of land from the heirs of Robert Harper. Subsequently, in 1799, construction began on the national armory. Three years later, mass production of military arms commenced.\nThe national armory at Harpers Ferry was actually the second national armory. The first was the Springfield Armory, constructed in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1794 after Congress approved the bill to create the nation's first national armory.\nUpon its grand opening, the armory's size seemed inadequate for a work force. It consisted of only one room, and the workers numbered a mere twenty-five. Nevertheless, the armory produced many muskets, rifles, and later pistols for the United States.  Between 1821–1830 the armory produced 11,855 arms.  Each decade after that, production declined. The building relied on river power to drive the armory's machinery.\n\n\nExpansion and upgrades\n\nIn 1844, the deficient state of the armory was taken into account and demand for military equipment increased, and so the renovation and expansion of the armory was undertaken. The upgrades of the arsenal began in 1845–1854 with the construction of seven brand new workshops and the installation of 121 new machines. The new workshops had a brick superstructure with iron framing and slanted sheet metal roofing. These reconstructed arsenal buildings became collectively known as the \"U.S. Musket Factory\". The armory canal was enlarged so that more water could get to the armory, which meant it would receive more power. Along with the enlargement of the canal, seven new water turbines were installed.  The upgrades formed a well-integrated functional unit that improved the flow of work from one stage of production to the next. All the expansions of the armory were done on heavy stone foundations and included cast-iron framing in the general style of \"factory Gothics\" architecture.\nIn addition, more people were employed to work at the armory than before: the labor force increased from a minuscule twenty-five in 1802 to about four hundred workers in 1859. Furthermore, the working conditions improved, but only slightly.\n\n\nJohn Brown's raid\n\nIn 1859, the armory became the site of the famous seizure by abolitionist John Brown, which, while unsuccessful in inciting a slave revolt, helped precipitate the American Civil War and the eventual emancipation of slaves in the United States.\n\n\nDuring the Civil War\n\nWhile Virginia was still in the Union, the armory regularly shipped manufactured weapons and material throughout the United States. However, once the Civil War began, the national armory became a vital control point for both the Confederates and the Union.\nClose to the beginning of the war on April 18, 1861, just a day after Virginia's conventional ratification of secession, Union soldiers, outnumbered and deprived of reinforcements, set fire to their own armory in an attempt to thwart the usage of it by an advancing Virginian Confederate militia numbering 360 men in all. Harpers Ferry residents (many of whom made their living off the armory) were able to put out the fires swiftly enough to save most of the armory's weapon-making machinery. After rescuing the equipment from the fire, the Confederates stole the equipment and shipped it south by rail to Winchester, Virginia, and from there to Richmond, and use the machinery in the newly reopened, Confederate central government-run Richmond Armory. The South had virtually no small-arms production and an inadequate supply of raw materials.  The machinery taken from Harpers Ferry became the foundation of the Confederate arms manufacturing. Two weeks later, the Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry, while also confiscating what was left in the Armory and burning the rest of the remaining buildings. They also blew up the railroad bridge of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but returned in two weeks to destroy the Rifle Works and a bridge that crossed the Shenandoah river.\n\n\nThe armory's strategic location\nDuring the Civil War, the armory became a site of great strategic importance because it was located very close to the Mason-Dixon line, or the border between the free and the slave-holding states. Consequently, the Union used it as an effective means to supply troops with weapons quickly as they marched into battle. The downside to being on the border was that the armory could easily change hands and fall into Confederate control–the town of Harpers Ferry changed hands at least eleven times during the Civil War.\n\n\nAftermath of the Civil War\n\nDue to the degree of damage to the armory during the Civil War, the U.S. government decided not to re-establish the armory at Harpers Ferry, instead focusing the quickly developing areas west of the Mississippi River.\nToday the site is mostly covered by railroad track embankments.\n\n\nJohn Brown's Fort\n\nJohn Brown's Fort was the only building to survive the destruction wrought upon it by the Confederates and the Union forces. It was the armory's fire engine and guard house, which Brown and his raiders barricaded themselves in. It was given the name of John Brown's Fort after the war.\nThis building has been moved four times. The first time, freeing up the site for the railroad to use for an embankment, it was moved to Chicago, where it was displayed at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Abandoned after that, it was moved back to a farm near Harpers Ferry. From there, it was moved to the place it was the longest, and where it was most honored: Storer College, a school established for freedmen in Harpers Ferry, which also was given by Congress the Arsenal managers' housing, set back on Camp Hill.\nThe Fort remained at Storer until after the College closed in 1955, contributing greatly to Harpers Ferry's role as a destination for African-American tourists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was afterwards moved by the National Park Service to near its original location.\n\n\nSee also\nJohn Brown's Fort\nHarpers Ferry Model 1803 Rifle\nM1819 Hall rifle\nM1841 Mississippi rifle\nJohn H.

    "text": "Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising (abbreviated as G&H or GnH) was a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed by Heatwave Interactive and released in 2011 for Microsoft Windows. The game was set in ancient Rome, and combined historical elements and enemies (Etruscans, Faliscans, etc.) with mythological ones (Cyclopes, Gorgons, etc.). Players selected era-appropriate classes (Soldiers, Gladiators, Mystics, and Priests), each of which could be aligned with an Olympian god (such as Jupiter or Mars).\nOriginally developed by Perpetual Entertainment, the game was put on indefinite hold in October 2007. In February 2010, Heatwave Interactive announced it had acquired the rights to the game and planned to continue its development. The game was released in June 2011 with a retail purchase and subscription. In early 2012 the game switched to a free-to-play model with a $10 purchase of the game. The game and its forums entered maintenance in September 2012 and never fully returned, although some existing players were still able to log into game servers afterwards. Steam has since removed the game from its shop.\n\n\nGameplay\nIn previous development, minions were touted as one of the game's unique features. There were several different ways to collect the more than 130 minions available in the game. The player can hire the minions to join their camp for a fee, earn minions as quest rewards, get minion contracts as loot drops or earn their respect by beating them in combat situations.\nThese minions include warriors, ranged attackers, casters, and mythological creatures. These hirelings utilize an AI system enabling them to heal the player, attack, defend, form up in various formations and learn special moves. In addition, each god makes a different mythical minion available to their scions. In addition to the AI, players have the ability to control all aspects of their minions, such as telling a healer minion to heal a specific player, as well as customizable squad formations.\nAs a character's level progresses, they gain the ability to control more minions at once, until a character had a full squad with four minions. Each party member will be able to bring up to four minions with them in a party. There are challenges, quests, and some instances that would have limitations on the number of minions the player is able to bring along.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe game was originally announced on March 9, 2005, by Perpetual Entertainment, and was slated for release in the 4th quarter of 2005, and then pushed again for 2008, but due to the challenge to develop both Gods & Heroes as well as Star Trek Online, the company decided to hold the development indefinitely. The game had been in closed beta since October 2006, but was shut down the day of hold announcement.\nSony Online Entertainment was named as the publisher and distributor for the game in North America, but had no hand in the development of the game.\nThe game reached a state of closed beta test. Only a few people were granted beta keys at the time. Beta keys were given away in random intervals on the official homepage.  However, it was announced that the game's development would be put on indefinite hold, due to the developers shifting their focus to Star Trek Online, and the beta server was closed.  Perpetual Entertainment, now known as P2 Entertainment, has since announced its dissolution.\nOn February 22, 2010, it was announced that Heatwave Interactive had acquired the rights to the Gods & Heroes, previously developed by Perpetual Entertainment, and that development was back underway.  When asked at that time when the game would be released, Heatwave Interactive CEO Anthony Castoro estimated a \"window of about a year to 18 months.\"\nThe game was released in June 2011 with a retail purchase and subscription.\nIn early 2012 the game switched to free play with a $10 purchase of the game.

    "summary": "Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising (abbreviated as G&H or GnH) was a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed by Heatwave Interactive and released in 2011 for Microsoft Windows. The game was set in ancient Rome, and combined historical elements and enemies (Etruscans, Faliscans, etc.) with mythological ones (Cyclopes, Gorgons, etc.). Players selected era-appropriate classes (Soldiers, Gladiators, Mystics, and Priests), each of which could be aligned with an Olympian god (such as Jupiter or Mars).\nOriginally developed by Perpetual Entertainment, the game was put on indefinite hold in October 2007. In February 2010, Heatwave Interactive announced it had acquired the rights to the game and planned to continue its development. The game was released in June 2011 with a retail purchase and subscription. In early 2012 the game switched to a free-to-play model with a $10 purchase of the game. The game and its forums entered maintenance in September 2012 and never fully returned, although some existing players were still able to log into game servers afterwards.

    "text": "In graph theory, the Games graph is the largest known locally linear strongly regular graph. Its parameters as a strongly regular graph are (729,112,1,20). This means that it has 729 vertices, and 40824 edges (112 per vertex). Each edge is in a unique triangle (it is a locally linear graph) and each non-adjacent pair of vertices have exactly 20 shared neighbors. It is named after Richard A. Games, who suggested its construction in an unpublished communication and wrote about related constructions.\n\n\nConstruction\nThe construction of this graph involves the 56-point cap set in \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        G\n        (\n        5\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle PG(5,3)}\n  \n. This is a subset of points with no three in line in the five-dimensional projective geometry over a three-element field, and is unique up to symmetry.  The six-dimensional projective geometry, \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        G\n        (\n        6\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle PG(6,3)}\n  \n, can be partitioned into a six-dimensional affine space \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        G\n        (\n        6\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AG(6,3)}\n  \n and a copy of \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        G\n        (\n        5\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle PG(5,3)}\n  \n, which forms the set of points at infinity with respect to the affine space. The Games graph has as its vertices the 729 points of the affine space \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        G\n        (\n        6\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AG(6,3)}\n  \n. Each line in the affine space goes through three of these points, and through a fourth point at infinity. The graph contains a triangle for every line of three affine points that passes through a point of the cap set.\n\n\nProperties\nSeveral of the graph's properties follow immediately from this construction. It has \n  \n    \n      \n        729\n        =\n        \n          3\n          \n            6\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 729=3^{6}}\n  \n vertices, because the number of points in an affine space is the size of the base field to the power of the dimension. For each affine point, there are 56 lines through cap set points, 56 triangles containing the corresponding vertex, and \n  \n    \n      \n        112\n        =\n        56\n        ×\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 112=56\\times 2}\n  \n neighbors of the vertex. And there can be no triangles other than the ones coming from the construction, because any other triangle would have to come from three different lines meeting in a common plane of \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        G\n        (\n        6\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle PG(6,3)}\n  \n, and the three cap set points of the three lines would all lie on the intersection of this plane with \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        G\n        (\n        5\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle PG(5,3)}\n  \n, which is a line. But this would violate the defining property of a cap set that it has no three points on a line, so no such extra triangle can exist. The remaining property of strongly regular graphs, that all non-adjacent pairs of points have the same number of shared neighbors, depends on the specific properties of the 5-dimensional cap set.\n\n\nRelated graphs\nWith the \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        ×\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3}\n  \n Rook's graph and the Brouwer–Haemers graph, the Games graph is one of only three possible strongly regular graphs whose parameters have the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        3\n        n\n        −\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        n\n        +\n        3\n        )\n        ,\n        1\n        ,\n        n\n        (\n        n\n        +\n        1\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\bigl (}(n^{2}+3n-1)^{2},n^{2}(n+3),1,n(n+1){\\bigr )}}\n  \n.\nThe same properties that produce a strongly regular graph from a cap set can also be used with an 11-point cap set in \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        G\n        (\n        4\n        ,\n        3\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle PG(4,3)}\n  \n, producing a smaller strongly regular graph with parameters (243,22,1,2).\nThis graph is the Berlekamp–Van Lint–Seidel graph.\n\n\nReferences",

Outside of her writing, she is a screenwriter, producer and podcast host.\n\n\nCareer\nCollins' first novel, The Burial, was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin in 2012 and in the United States under the title The Untold by Putnam in 2014. The novel was inspired by the life of the female bushranger Jessie Hickman. It received positive reviews and was shortlisted for the Stella Prize, the Glenda Adams Award for New Writing, and the Dobbie Literary Award. In Australian Book Review, Gillian Dooley wrote that the novel was \"finely written, with a lovely ear for the cadences of language, but it also has an urgent narrative drive, along with a strong awareness of place, compelling characters, and a whiff of magic realism to enliven the mixture.\" In The Newtown Review of Books, Annette Hughes wrote that the book had a \"brilliant liberating conclusion\" and that its language and structure were polished and well-executed. A review in Kirkus Reviews wrote that Collins \"richly evokes a heartbreaking emotional terrain\", while a review in Publishers Weekly praised her \"poetic language and salty dialogue\". In The Sydney Morning Herald, Felicity Plunkett wrote that the book had an \"oddness and lyricism\" and that its unconventional narration gave it poignancy.\nCollins' second novel, Bird, was published by Hachette Australia in 2024. The novel follows two girls named Bird; one is sold into an arranged marriage in a Himalayan village, while the other, a reincarnation of the former, wakes up in a hospital in Darwin suffering from amnesia. In a review in The Saturday Paper, Maria Takolander praised the novel's \"propulsive but understated storytelling\" and Collins' strong characterisation. In Australian Book Review, Laura Elizabeth Woollett criticised Collins' unrealistic depictions of Himalayan culture, writing that the book gave the impression of \"Ancient Himalayan cosplay\". In The Age, Jessie Tu praised the novel's feminist message while writing that it was sometimes over-descriptive and suffered from inertia.\n\n\nNotable works\nThe Burial (Allen & Unwin, 2012) ISBN 978-1-74331-187-5\nBird (Hachette Australia, 2024), ISBN 978-0-7336-5241-7\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=79634653",
    "text": "George Town World Heritage Incorporated (abbrev. GTWHI) is a state-owned conservation organisation in the Malaysian state of Penang. Established in 2010, it serves as the conservation authority for George Town's World Heritage Site, gazetted by UNESCO since 2008. As a special-purpose vehicle of the Penang state government, GTWHI is chaired by the state's Chief Minister who serves as its chairman. \n\n\nBackground\nHeritage conservation within George Town was sparked by haphazard urban planning and a real estate boom in the 1980s, as developers rapidly redeveloped large swathes of the city to build high-rises. The drastic transformation of the cityscape posed a risk to the colonial-era buildings within the city centre. Concurrently, both the federal government and the Penang Island Municipal Council (now Penang Island City Council) demonstrated a lack of political will towards urban renewal and heritage conservation. From 1976 to 1986, a total of 67 monuments across Malaysia were protected under the Antiquities Act 1976, out of which only eight were located in Penang.\nIn 1991, the Penang state government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Koh Tsu Koon, invited French conservation expert Didier Repellin to assess the potential for Penang to be recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Renewed state interest in heritage conservation led to the formation of the Penang Heritage Centre in 1996 to train conservation architects and raise public awareness. The centre was staffed by representatives from local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and worked in collaboration with French experts specialising in reconstruction. Despite the preparation of the necessary documentation, efforts to designate George Town as a World Heritage Site were stymied by the federal government's lack of support for non-Malay cultural heritage.\nBy the late 1980s, the federal government had submitted nominations to designate Malacca as a World Heritage Site. The nominations were rejected by UNESCO due to the redevelopment of Malacca's original waterfront and the exclusion of the city's Chinese population from the proposed designation. However, the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted in 1972, encouraged sovereign countries to nominate sites that are \"trans-national, integrative and linear.\" This strengthened the case for a joint nomination of George Town and Malacca as a World Heritage Site, as the multicultural aspects of George Town were perceived as complementary to the predominantly Malay cityscape of Malacca.\nBetween 1998 and 2007, the Penang and Malacca state governments, along with the federal government and local NGOs, undertook efforts towards a joint nomination. In the nomination, the Penang state government mooted the establishment of a new administrative body to oversee the management of George Town's World Heritage Site. In 2008, George Town and Malacca were inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nThe inscription of George Town's World Heritage Site occurred months after the 2008 Penang election, which saw the incumbent Barisan Nasional coalition voted out of power. Pakatan Rakyat (predecessor to the present-day Pakatan Harapan coalition) wrested control of the state's legislature, while Lim Guan Eng succeeded Koh as Chief Minister. Following the inscription, the new state government formed an advisory committee, which included conservationists and developers, to enhance statutory enforcement of conservation plans within the city centre.\n\n\nHistory\nLim's administration soon saw the need to set up a special-purpose vehicle, rather than a regular government unit, to administer George Town's World Heritage Site. Local governments were deemed to be ineffective as a result of bureaucratic constraints and a lack of expertise, prompting the creation of this vehicle to circumvent the limitations.\nConsequently, the state-run Penang Heritage Centre was transformed into GTWHI in April 2010. GTWHI was established under the Companies Act 1965, with the Chief Minister serving as its chairman. Maimunah Mohd Sharif, who would later become the Mayor of Penang Island, was the organisation's first general manager. The board of directors includes members of the Penang State Executive Council, State Assemblymen of the constituencies within the gazetted zone and the mayor. It received an initial grant of RM1 million in 2010, and is continually funded by both federal and state governments.\nFounded without statutory authority, GTWHI retains the flexibility to execute roles beyond those typically associated with the Penang Island City Council. These include enforcing UNESCO conventions, research on heritage conservation, promoting heritage tourism and facilitating public participation in heritage conservation efforts. Between 2011 and 2016, GTWHI, as the de facto site manager, led the development of a Special Area Plan for the World Heritage Site. It additionally organises the annual George Town Festival in partnership with local NGOs, aimed at raising awareness of heritage conservation and advancing the city's arts industry.\n\n\nSee also\nInvestPenang\nPenang Development Corporation\nPenang Hill Corporation\nPenang Skills Development Centre\nPenang Water Supply Corporation\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "The Antiquarian's Family, or The Mother-in-law and the Daughter (La famiglia dell'antiquario, ossia La suocera e la nuora) is a comedy by Venetian author Carlo Goldoni, first published in 1749.\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn the introduction, Goldoni introduces the plot and characters : Count Anselmo from Palermo, an antiquarian who spends his money on low value items that are presented to him as ancient and precious; his wife, now elderly but who poses as a young woman, who fights with her daughter; and her son, Count Giacinto, who asks in vain for help to pacify the two.\n\n\nAct 1\nCount Anselmo is in his study admiring his precious \"Pescennius,\" an ancient coin \"so well survived that it seems to have been coined today\". His servant Brighella arrives to bother him with certain debts he needs to pay and reprove him for throwing away his small fortune for household junk. His master accuses him of ignorance, and tells him that with the dowry from his son's marriage, they will not lack for money. His wife, Isabella, then complains to him for having accepted a merchant's daughter as a daughter-in-law — though she won't say no to the money from the dowry,  which she used to redeem a precious ring that her husband had pawned for a loan. Anselmo reminds her that nobility is little use without money.\nDoralice, the daughter-in-law, laments that even with such a large dowry, she is not given the money to buy a bridal gown, but Anselmo continues to think about his coin and doesn't care. The son, Giacinto, speaks up, but his father does not listen. Doralice reproves Giacinto for not being able to make his father care, and complains about Isabella's mistreatment of her, threatening to return to her father's house if she is not treated a little better. Giacinto promises her a dress, and she sends for Colombina, the countess's faithful maid. Colombina, however, shows her no respect and does not wish to obey, because Doralice is not noble; thus, the latter slaps her, and the maid decides to take revenge.\nGiacinto asks his mother for money for the dress, but she gives him only six sequins, after having once again spoken badly of Doralice. After he has left, the doctor enters. He first defends the marriage of Isabella's son, but then begins to go along with the countess, as he always does. Colombina then enters, announcing the arrival of the Cavaliere del Bosco; Isabella sends away the doctor, and Colombina tells the countess that Doralice slapped her, exaggerating the facts. Isabella convinces the knight to try to speak reason to Doralice, but gets angry when he and Colombina make references to her age.\nBrighella, together with Arlecchino, who is dressed as an Armenian, plans to trick his own master, Anselmo, selling him fake ancient artifacts. The two pretend to speak Armenian and convince Anselmo to pay 14 sequins for an ordinary oil lamp. Then they leave, and Pantalone, Doralice's father, arrives, complaining of the treatment his daughter is receiving. He also proves to be preoccupied by the fact that the count spends all the family's money on knick-knacks, but Anselmo does not listen, and he leaves. Doralice then arrives, complaining to her father of the treatment she is receiving; Pantalone, like her husband, tells her to be patient, and rebukes her for the slap. He gives her 50 sequins for the dress, and a gold watch.\nThe knight presents himself to Doralice, and unsuccessfully requests that she ask pardon for the slap. He offers her his services, trying to be friends with both her and the countess. Isabella enters, and Doralice greets her as an old woman, which Isabella cannot stand.\n\n\nAct 2\nGiacinto again complains to Doralice, who does not listen and sends for Colombina, asking pardon for the slap and doubling Colombina's salary out of her own pocket. Colombina tells her everything that Isabella said about her, once again exaggerating things. Doralice has her repeat everything to the knight, trying to bring him to her side. The knight goes along with her, as the doctor had done with Isabella, saying that she is right about everything and confirming that she is more important than the countess. Then, however, the knight realizes that it is Colombina who has spread these ill rumors, and plans to set her up.\nBrighella again manages to fool Anselmo, who is intent on admiring an ancient Greek manuscript, by selling him fake antiques. Pantalone returns to Anselmo's house and tells him the manuscript is a fake, but Anselmo does not believe him. Pantalone also admonishes him to be careful with his money and to pay more attention to keeping his house in order; the count responds that it is better not to get involved in arguments, but agrees to a family meeting that Pantalone is organizing. Pantalone then encounters Arlecchino, still in disguise, who wants to sell more antiques to Anselmo, unmasks him and makes him confess the trick that he and Brighella played at the count's expense.\nIsabella complains of her daughter-in-law to the doctor, and has Colombina tell her what the knight and Doralice said. Colombina again exaggerates. Then the countess goes to the family meeting, accompanied by the doctor. The count, prompted by Pantalone, asks her with unusual firmness to behave better towards Doralice, and she agrees. Doralice enters the room, but Anselmo gets distracted by the cameo design on her watch, believing it an antique, and entrusts the role of judge to Pantalone. Pantalone, however, cannot make the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law be quiet. Anselmo leaves to go to Brighella's; Isabella and Doralice fight, assisted by their respective \"gentlemen,\" the doctor and the knight, and the meeting fails spectacularly.\n\n\nAct 3\nAnselmo has bought a bunch of knick-knacks from Brighella, but Pantalone brings in Pancrazio, the most famous antiquarian in Palermo, who tells him that all his antiques are junk. The count does not want to believe him, and claims that he is just envious. Pantalone, however, brings Arlecchino into the room, and the latter confesses everything. The count is convinced, and decides to try to settle the tempers in the household.\nThe knight and the doctor decide to try to make peace between Doralice and Isabella. They listen to both of them, and settle an agreement in money between the two. Then Anselmo and Pantalone also come in to speak with their wife and daughter respectively, while the knight and doctor discover that Colombina has exaggerated the reports of the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law in order to stir up the argument. The whole family finds out, Colombina runs away, and Doralice and Isabella agree to make peace. However, in spite of intense mediation on the part of the rest of the family, they cannot agree on who must visit whom to make peace, because neither wants to get up and leave the room. The count and Giacinto give up and leave, while Pantalone argues with the doctor and the knight.\nPantalone then goes to speak to Anselmo and Giacinto, lamenting that his daughter was once less impertinent. He accepts the task of administering the household finances, to the great relief of Giacinto, who has been worried about them. However, he wants the permission to be signed in the presence of witnesses. They return to the countess's room, where she is complaining to the doctor about her daughter-in-law. Doralice enters as well, and Pantalone begins to read the various points of the contract: he will administer the finances and see to peace in the family; the knight and the doctor must leave the house, because their support encourages Doralice and Isabella to argue. (The knight accepts graciously, and the doctor only after protesting — the countess's disagreeable personality is what eventually persuades him.) Then it is decided that the daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law will live in two separate apartments, and Colombina will be thrown out. At the end, however, the two do not want to kiss and make up. Pantalone concludes that there is nothing to be done, but thinks that once those who fomented disagreement are removed, and once Doralice and Isabella are kept apart for a time, he will have succeeded at making the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law live together in peace.",

    "title": "S-100 bus",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=152036",
    "text": "The S-100 bus or Altair bus, later standardized as IEEE 696-1983 (inactive-withdrawn), is an early computer bus designed in 1974 as a part of the Altair 8800. The S-100 bus was the first industry-standard expansion bus for the microcomputer industry. S-100 computers, consisting of processor and peripheral cards, were produced by a number of manufacturers.  The S-100 bus formed the basis for homebrew computers whose builders (e.g., the Homebrew Computer Club) implemented drivers for CP/M and MP/M.  These S-100 microcomputers ran the gamut from hobbyist toy to small business workstation and were common in early home computers until the advent of the IBM PC.\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe S-100 bus is a passive backplane of 100-pin printed circuit board edge connectors wired in parallel. Circuit cards measuring 5 in × 10 in (13 cm × 25 cm) serving the functions of CPU, memory, or I/O interface plugged into these connectors. The bus signal definitions closely follow those of an 8080 microprocessor system, since the Intel 8080 microprocessor was the first microprocessor hosted on the S-100 bus. The 100 lines of the S-100 bus can be grouped into four types: 1) Power, 2) Data, 3) Address, and 4) Clock and control.\nPower supplied on the bus is bulk unregulated +8 Volt DC and ±16 Volt DC, designed to be regulated on the cards to +5 V (used by TTL ICs), -5 V and +12 V for the Intel 8080 CPU IC, ±12 V  RS-232 line driver ICs, +12 V for disk drive motors. The onboard voltage regulation is typically performed by devices of the 78xx family (for example, a 7805 device to produce +5 volts). These are linear regulators which are commonly mounted on heat sinks.\nThe bi-directional 8-bit data bus of the Intel 8080 is split into two unidirectional 8-bit data buses. The processor could use only one of these at a time. The Sol-20 used a variation that had only a single 8-bit bus and used the now-unused pins as signal grounds to reduce electronic noise. The direction of the bus, in or out, was signaled using the otherwise unused DBIN pin. This became universal in the S-100 market as well, making the second bus superfluous. Later, these two 8-bit buses would be combined to support a 16-bit data width for more advanced processors, using the Sol's system to signal the direction.\nThe address bus is 16-bits wide in the initial implementation and later extended to 24-bits wide. A bus control signal can put these lines in a tri-state condition to allow direct memory access. The Cromemco Dazzler, for example, is an early S-100 card that retrieved digital images from memory using direct memory access.\nClock and control signals are used to manage the traffic on the bus. For example, the DO Disable line will tristate the address lines during direct memory access. Unassigned lines of the original bus specification were later assigned to support more advanced processors. For example, the Zilog Z-80 processor has a non-maskable interrupt line that the Intel 8080 processor does not. One unassigned line of the S-100 bus then was reassigned to support the non-maskable interrupt request.\n\n\nHistory\n During the design of the Altair, the hardware required to make a usable machine was not available in time for the January 1975 launch date. The designer, Ed Roberts, also had the problem of the backplane taking up too much room. Attempting to avoid these problems, he placed the existing components in a case with additional \"slots\", so that the missing components could be plugged in later when they became available. The backplane is split into four separate cards, with the CPU on a fifth. He then looked for an inexpensive source of connectors, and he came across a supply of military surplus 100-pin edge connectors. The 100-pin bus was created by an unknown draftsman at MITS, who selected the connector from a parts catalog and arbitrarily assigned signal names to groups of connector pins.\nA burgeoning industry of \"clone\" machines followed the introduction of the Altair in 1975. Most of these used the same bus layout as the Altair, creating a new industry standard. These companies were forced to refer to the system as the \"Altair bus\", and wanted another name in order to avoid referring to their competitor when describing their own system. The \"S-100\" name, short for \"Standard 100\", was coined by Harry Garland and Roger Melen, co-founders of Cromemco. While on a flight to attend the Atlantic City PC '76 microcomputer conference in August 1976, they shared the cabin with Bob Marsh and Lee Felsenstein of Processor Technology. Melen went over to them to convince them to adopt the same name. He had a beer in his hand and when the plane hit a bump, Melen spilt some of the beer on Marsh. Marsh agreed to use the name, which Melen ascribes to him wanting to get Melen to leave with his beer.\nThe term first appeared in print in a Cromemco advertisement in the November 1976 issue of Byte magazine. The first symposium on the S-100 bus, moderated by Jim Warren, was held November 20, 1976 at Diablo Valley College with a panel consisting of Harry Garland, George Morrow, and Lee Felsenstein. Just one year later, the S-100 Bus would be described as \"the most used busing standard ever developed in the computer industry.\"\nCromemco was the largest of the S-100 manufacturers, followed by Vector Graphic and North Star Computers. Other innovators were companies such as Alpha Microsystems, IMS Associates, Inc., Godbout Electronics (later CompuPro), and Ithaca InterSystems. In May 1984, Microsystems published a comprehensive S-100 product directory listing over 500 \"S-100/IEEE-696\" products from over 150 companies.\nThe S-100 bus signals were simple to create using an 8080 CPU, but increasingly less so when using other processors like the 68000. More board space was occupied by signal conversion logic. Nonetheless by 1984, eleven different processors were hosted on the S-100 bus, from the 8-bit Intel 8080 to the 16-bit Zilog Z-8000. In 1986, Cromemco introduced the XXU card, designed by Ed Lupin, utilizing a 32-bit Motorola 68020 processor.\n\n\nIEEE-696 Standard\nAs the S-100 bus gained momentum, there was a need to develop a formal specification of the bus to help assure compatibility of products produced by different manufacturers. There was also a need to extend the bus so that it could support processors more capable than the Intel 8080 used in the original Altair Computer. In May 1978, George Morrow and Howard Fullmer published a \"Proposed Standard for the S-100 Bus\" noting that 150 vendors were already supplying products for the S-100 Bus. This proposed standard documented the 8-bit data path and 16-bit address path of the bus and stated that consideration was being given to extending the data path to 16 bits and the address path to 24 bits.\nIn July 1979 Kells Elmquist, Howard Fullmer, David Gustavson, and George Morrow published a \"Standard Specification for S-100 Bus Interface Devices.\"\nIn this specification the data path was extended to 16 bits and the address path was extended to 24 bits. The IEEE 696 Working Group, chaired by Mark Garetz, continued to develop the specification which was proposed as an IEEE Standard and approved by the IEEE Computer Society on June 10, 1982.\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved the IEEE standard on September 8, 1983. The computer bus structure developed by Ed Roberts for the Altair 8800 computer had been extended, rigorously documented, and now designated as the American National Standard IEEE Std 696–1983.\n\n\nRetirement\n\nIBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 and followed it with increasingly capable models: the XT in 1983 and the AT in 1984. The success of these computers, which used IBM's own, incompatible bus architecture, cut deeply into the market for S-100 bus products. In May 1984, Sol Libes (who had been a member of the IEEE-696 Working Group) wrote in Microsystems: \"there is no doubt that the S-100 market can now be considered a mature industry with only moderate growth potential, compared to the IBM PC-compatible market\".\nAs the IBM PC products captured the low-end of the market, S-100 machines moved up-scale to more powerful OEM and multiuser systems. Banks of S-100 bus computers were used, for example, to process the trades at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; the United States Air Force deployed S-100 bus machines for their mission planning systems.  However throughout the 1980s the market for S-100 bus machines for the hobbyist, for personal use, and even for small business was on the decline.\nThe market for S-100 bus products continued to contract through the early 1990s, as IBM-compatible computers became more capable. In 1992, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, replaced their S-100 bus computers with the IBM model PS/2. By 1994, the S-100 bus industry had contracted sufficiently that the IEEE did not see a need to continue supporting the IEEE-696 standard. The IEEE-696 standard was retired on June 14, 1994.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"S100 Computers\", A website containing many photos of cards, documentation, and history\n\"\"Cromemco\" based, S-100 micro-computer\" Archived 2012-02-10 at the Wayback Machine, Robert Kuhmann's images of several S-100 cards\n\"Herb's S-100 Stuff\", Herbert Johnson's collection of S-100 history\n\"IEEE-696 / S-100 Bus Documentation and Manuals Archive\", Howard Harte's S-100 manuals collection",

    "text": "Flamiche (French: [fla.miʃ] ) is a French savoury pastry, originating in north-west France. It dates to medieval times and originally was a kind of galette, but in its modern version is a tart made with leeks and cream.\n\n\nEtymology\nTwo possible derivations have been advanced for the word flamiche: either that it comes from flamme, 'flame', as the dish was traditionally cooked in a wood-burning oven, or that it is a corruption of vlamiche – Flemish (the dish being native to north-west France, close to the border with Flanders).\n\n\nHistory\nThe term dates from medieval times. Jean Froissart's Chronicles, dating from the 14th century, mention people eating \"a little torte in the manner of a flamiche or beignet to comfort their stomachs\". In his Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues (1611), Randle Cotgrave applies the term to \"a cake made of butter, cheese, flower, and yolkes of egges\".\nThe 18th-century scholar Legrand d'Aussy described the flamiche as it was made in his time: \"It is a kind of galette made with baker's dough. It is rolled out with a rolling pin and put in the oven while the wood is burning. As soon as it has been thoroughly heated, it is taken out of the oven and spread with butter. It is eaten as soon as it comes out of the oven\". In his Encyclopédie méthodique (1782) Jacques Lacombe describes a flamiche as \"A kind of pastry made with salty fatty cheese, butter, eggs, flour & seasoning. The dough is cut into thick pieces of two fingers, and baked in the oven\".\n\n\nModern version\nAs late as the 1880s there is no mention of leeks in the definition in the Dictionnaire de la langue française: \"Name, in some provinces, of a pastry made of cheese, butter and eggs\", but in 1910 a French journal described a flamiche as \"a flour dough, buttered inside with leeks cut into small pieces\", originating in Péronne, Somme. In Larousse Gastronomique (1938), Prosper Montagné wrote, \"Nowadays the name flamiche is given to a kind of leek tart made in Burgundy and Picardy.\" In 1998, Simon Hopkinson wrote of \"La Flamiche aux Poireaux: a buttery leek pie – a famed speciality of Alsatian cookery\". Montagné does not specify the type of pastry to be used; Hopkinson uses puff; Elizabeth David suggests a crumbly shortcrust; Anne Willan uses a yeast dough similar to that used in pizzas. Clarissa Dickson Wright specifies a brioche dough, and although her recipe contains leeks, she comments that flamiche \"can be filled with whatever you like\".\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nCotgrave, Randle (1611).

He occupies his time by rebuilding a deserted house, and begins to recall his past, saying his main wish in life was to become a millionaire. Jan begins his career as a frankfurter vendor at a railroad station, and quickly learns the power of money and the influence it exerts on people.\nAt one point during his reminiscences, a young woman, Marcela, and her older traveling companion, a professor, settle in the area. Jan and Marcela develop a mutual attraction, though it remains unconsummated. The film continues to alternate between past and present, as the relationship between the older Jan and the new neighbors develops.\nIn the restaurant, the younger Jan has a number of affairs with various women, including an actress and a prostitute at a brothel. He also gets increasingly prestigious jobs, including a stint at a spa, the Hotel Tichota, where he has an affair with a maid. Eventually Jan finds employment in Prague at the Hotel Paříž, where he falls under the tutelage of the Maître d', Skřivánek, who claims that he once served the King of England. Eventually, Jan serves the Emperor of Ethiopia on one occasion. The Emperor tries to award Skřivánek a medal, but is too short to place the award around Skřivánek's neck. Jan is short enough for the Emperor to reach, and maneuvers to receive the medal in Skřivánek's place.\nWith the Third Reich's annexation of Czechoslovakia, Jan falls in love with Liza, a young Sudeten German woman who worships Adolf Hitler. She agrees to marry him only after he proves that he is of pure Aryan descent through medical examination. During the occupation, the other waiters and the hotel manager, Brandejs, express their contempt for the German occupiers by being as unhelpful as possible in their service to them. Jan is the only member of the waitstaff not to express such symbolic resistance. For this reason, Brandejs dismisses Jan, and says Jan will be blacklisted from employment in any Prague establishment. When Jan and Liza later appear as patrons, and Jan tells Skřivánek that serving the King of England has done him no good, Skřivánek pours food over Jan in protest. Soon, the occupying authorities take Skřivánek away and he is never seen again.\nDuring World War II, Jan works in an institute, formerly the Hotel Tichota, where German women reside to breed a new \"master race\" with selected soldiers. Because the owner, Mr Tichota, uses a wheelchair, he has been displaced as its owner and is never seen again. In the meantime, Liza serves as a nurse on the Russian front. She returns with valuable stamps taken from the homes of Polish-Jewish families. As the war progresses and the tide turns against Germany, the women are displaced from the facility, and wounded and amputee soldiers replace them. Near the war's end, the facility is attacked, and the soldiers and staff evacuated. Liza tries to retrieve the stamps from the burning building, but dies when its roof collapses on her. Jan finds her body holding the box of stamps and pries it from her hands. After the war, the stamps' value allows Jan to become a wealthy hotelier on the same premises.\nAfter the Communists take power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, Jan loses his property and wealth when he tells the Communist resistance that he himself is a millionaire. He is sentenced to prison for 15 years: one year for each of his millions. In prison, he sees that Brandejs and other formerly wealthy customers are prisoners. Jan tries to sit among them, but they exclude him from their circle.\nMarcela and the professor leave the area. Jan completes the restoration of his home and releases the stamps by letting the winds blow them into the valley.\n\n\nCast\nIvan Barnev as Jan Dítě, as a young man\nOldřich Kaiser as Jan Dítě, as an older man\nJulia Jentsch as Liza\nMartin Huba as Skřivánek\nMarián Labuda as Walden\nMilan Lasica as Professor\nZuzana Fialová as Marcela\nJosef Abrhám as Brandejs\nJaromír Dulava as Karel\nPavel Nový as General\nIstván Szabó as stock marketeer\nPetra Hřebíčková as Jaruška\n\n\nCritical reception\nI Served the King of England received generally positive reviews from critics. As of 19 June 2025, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of critics rated the film positively based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With charm and an eye for life's bittersweet moments, Czech New Wave master Jiri Menzel paints a picaresque story with whimsy and intellect.\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100 based on 26 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nThe film appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor named it the sixth-best film of 2008, and Dennis Harvey of Variety named it the eighth-best. It received the Gopo Award for Best European Film in 2009, meaning it was the European film that had the greatest box office success in Romania in 2008.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nI Served the King of England at IMDb\nI Served the King of England at Box Office Mojo\nI Served the King of England at Rotten Tomatoes\nI Served the King of England at Metacritic \nCFN Entry (in Czech)\nReview in The Prague Post",

She was diagnosed with hyperplasia as a child, resulting in one side of body growing faster than the other. She works as a Clerical Assistant at the Ministry of Health in Trinidad and Tobago married Codi Claxton in March 2018. She took up athletics, being trained by a Cuban national, later by Micky Ruben, earning the nickname \"HurriCain Nyo\".\nCain took part in the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Qatar, where she finished fifth in the women's 200 metres in the T44 class with a time of 28.24 seconds. In the T44 100 metres, she set a new personal best in the final of 13.31 seconds, winning the bronze medal.\nShe was selected for the Trinidad and Tobago team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for both the 100 and 200 metres. In her heat of the T44 200 metres, she finished in third place behind Germany's Irmgard Bensusan. This would have been sufficient to qualify her for the final, but Cain was disqualified for a lane infringement between the 100 and 150 metre markers. An appeal was lodged, but the referee's decision was upheld.\nTaking part in the women's 100 metres in the T44 class, she finished second in Heat Two with a time of 13.32 seconds behind Marlou van Rhijn of the Netherlands, which qualified her for the final. In the final later that day, she finished in third position to take the bronze medal with a time of 13.10 seconds behind van Rhijn who took the gold, and Bensusan with the silver. Cain had run with a hamstring injury, setting a new personal best in the final. This was one of the three medals won by Trinidad and Tobago, the other two taken by Akeem Stewart.\nAt the 2017 World Para Athletics Championships in London, England, Cain repeated her bronze medal from the 2016 Paralympics. She finished in a time of 13.25 seconds, behind the United Kingdom's Sophie Kamlish who set a new world record time of 12.92 seconds, and van Rhijn in second place.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Ward 4 Parkdale—High Park is a municipal electoral division in Toronto, Ontario, that has been represented in the Toronto City Council since the 2018 municipal election. It was last contested in 2022, with Gord Perks elected councillor for the 2022–2026 term.\n\n\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021. \nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model. \nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election. \nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018. \nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model. \nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency. \nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nThe current ward is an amalgamation of the old Ward 13 (western section), the old Ward 14 (eastern section).\n\n\n2018 municipal election\nWard 4 was first contested during the 2018 municipal election. Then–Ward 14 incumbent councillor Gord Perks, who had served since 2006, was elected with 44.55 per cent of the vote.\n\n\n2022 municipal election\nIncumbent Gord Perks secured re-election in a competitive race against fellow progressive Chemi Lhamo.\n\n\nGeography\nParkdale—High Park is part of the Toronto and East York community council.\nIt is bounded on the west by the Humber River, and on the east by rail lines used for Metrolinx operations, Dufferin Street and Lake Shore Boulevard. The ward's north boundary follows the Canadian Pacific Railway track just south of St. Clair Avenue, and the south boundary is Lake Ontario.\n\n\nCouncillors\n\n\nElection results\n\n\nSee also\nMunicipal elections in Canada\nMunicipal government of Toronto\nList of Toronto municipal elections\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCouncillor's webpage",

The actual design was conceived and executed by Raoul Pascual of WYNK Marketing. Michael Green of the Recording Academy stipulated that the logo should encompass all forms of musical genre and (whatever the design) the GRAMMY logo had to be prominently featured. Raoul's concept was to represent music with some of its major instruments:  the clarinet for woodwinds, the piano for percussion, the guitar for strings plus a microphone:\n\"I imagined all the instruments emanating from behind the logo. My problem was how to translate that into a visual. I designed black and white icons of the instruments using a vector program. I was working overtime and I was getting desperate. I was moving the different icons around the GRAMMY logo but none of the combinations seemed to work. As I picked up the guitar icon, I decided to pray and make a deal with God. I said 'if you bless me with a winning design, I will give you the glory every time I share how I designed the GRAMMY logo.' Suddenly, I inadvertently released my hold of the icon and it fell on top of the GRAMMY logo. I stared at the image on my screen and I saw my solution. I added the other icons and curved them to suggest movement from behind. Eureka! That was it!\"\nWith suggestions from the staff and the people at the Recording Academy in the course of several weeks, the design underwent an evolution from a 2 dimensional rendering into 3D.\n\n\nFashion\n\nIn January 2015, Google's president Eric Schmidt cited the massive attention to the dress Jennifer Lopez wore to the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards as the motivation for the creation of Google Images search. In 2000, Google Search results were limited to simple pages of text with links, but the developers worked on developing this further, realizing that an image search was required to answer \"the most popular search query\" they had seen to date: Jennifer Lopez's green dress.\nDesigned by Donatella Versace, the dress has been described as \"jungle green\", \"sea green\" or \"tropical\" green, a green dress with touches of blue to give an exotic appearance. It is a see-through silk chiffon dress with a tropical leaf and bamboo pattern, with a citrine-studded crotch. The dress \"had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below [the] navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,\" exposing Lopez’s midriff and then cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe. The dress then drooped behind her on the floor, open at the back.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Paul Ludwig von Krüdener (Russian: Pavel Alexeevich Kridener; 31 January 1784 – 29 January 1858) was a Russian diplomat of Baltic German extraction and the fourth Russian Ambassador to the United States.\n\n\nBiography\n\nKrüdener was born on 31 January 1784, in Saint Petersburg. He was the son of Barbara von Krüdener, a Baltic German writer and mystic affiliated with the Friends of God. His father was Baron Bourkhardt-Alexis-Constantine Krüdener, with whom Barbara did not have a good relationship. Pavel was baptized Paul in honor of Grand Duke (later Emperor) Paul I of Russia, his godfather.\nHis father was appointed by Catherine the Great as Ambassador to the Republic of Venice in 1785, and Pavel spent the first two years of his life there. He subsequently followed his father's assignments in Munich until 1787, Copenhagen until 1794 and finally Madrid until 1800. His father was then appointed by Paul I as Ambassador to Prussia, under Frederick William III of Prussia. Friedrich Ancillon, a prominent Prussian historian, became his tutor.\nPaul von Krüdener became chargé d'affaires and embassy secretary in 1804 to Paris. He was arrested in Strasbourg by Napoleon I in 1812, on suspicion of conspiracy. In 1817, he went to Bern, where he invited his mother.\nIt was in Bern that he married Margarethe König (1798–1859), the mother of his four children.\n\nKrüdener was appointed Ambassador to the United States in 1827, and served until 1837. He was then transferred to Switzerland where he represented Russia's interests until his death.\n\n\nFootnotes",

    "text": "The 1930–31 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Jack Roos in his 2nd season.\n\n\nSeason\nWith Clarkson having established itself as one of, if not the, best team in the country outside of the 'Big Four', Tech was able to schedule games against three of college hockey's elites this season. The only missing team from their slate was Harvard and despite rumors to the contrary, the two wouldn't until 1935. Clarkson didn't lose any players to graduation and were expected to be even better this season. Early on, however, injuries and departures left their offense struggling. While the first scheduled game of the season, a match against Loyola, was cancelled, the meeting with Victoria College was able to be played. Without Guest, Levia and Bob Houston, the team's offense looked strong but disjointed, failing to score on several early opportunities. The same could not be said for the defense, which was as stout as it had ever been. Wally Easton earned his first shutout of the season and Clarkson started off the year with a win.\nThe team then headed south for a swing through southern New England. The first match came against Princeton, who had already compiled a record of 9–1 and were in the running for the national championship. The game was filled with penalties but the defenses for both teams were all but impenetrable. Clarence 'Ike' Houston scored a shorthanded marker near the end of the first and Easton turned aside shot after shot for the remainder of the game. Despite a furious attack from the Tigers, Houston's goal stood as the game-winner and Easton earned a second shutout. Two nights later the team was in Williamstown and had another game slowed by infractions. Easton, however, was equal to the task once more and posted his third goose egg and set a program record for consecutive shutouts that still stands (as of 2021).\nFor the fourth game of the season, the Knights faces defending national champion Yale. With the way the early part of the season was shaping up, it could possibly decide the eastern intercollegiate championship. Unfortunately for Clarkson, they were completely outplayed by the Elis. The team appeared disorganized and allowed 4 goals to the Bulldogs while their offense was nonexistent. Even late in the game, with Yale down two players, Clarkson was unable to find the back of the net and were themselves shutout for the first time in over 5 years.\nThe loss seemed to awaken Clarkson's offense from its slumber. While swapping Moore and Guest in as the starting defenseman, the Knights scored 14 goals in two home games against Canadian teams and continued to score for the remainder of the season. 'Peck' Donald was particularly strong during this time, leading the attack from his center position. The match against Dartmouth was more lopsided than expected, not least of which because the Indians were weaker than anticipated this season. This time Ike Houston was the star, netting 4 goals in the game.\nBack home, the team found the weather to be freezing, which was good for their ice conditions, but bad for attendance. The sub-zero weather didn't harm the on-ice product, however, and Clarkson kept rolling with wins over St. Patrick's (of Ottawa) and the Ottawa Gee-Gees. The team ended its official season with a road match at Ithaca. On one of the rare occasions that Beebe Lake had good playing ice, Clarkson knocked off Cornell with Donald scoring a hat-trick. The following weekend, the team assembled for an exhibition match against an All-Star squad at the Syracuse Coliseum.\nThe loss to Yale may have prevented the team from earning its first national championship, however, Clarkson was in a dead heat with Harvard for the runner-up position.\nBernard LaRue served as team manager for the season with Donald Orton as his assistant.\n\n\nRoster\n\n\nStandings\n\n\nSchedule and results\n\nNote: Clarkson's records include a game against 'Prescott' on February 20. The match doesn't appear in either the student newspaper or yearbook.\n\n\nScoring Statistics\n\nNote: Assists were recorded, however, not all assists were reported. The actual assist total is likely much higher than what appears in the boxscores.\n\n\nGoaltending statistics\n\nNote: GAA is based upon 60 minutes per game.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Ironclads is a 2017 dystopian science fiction novella by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It is the first entry in his Terrible Worlds: Revolutions series.\n\n\nPlot\nIn a near-future world dominated by corporate interests, Scions are the heirs of wealthy and powerful families. Scions wear advanced armor that renders them nearly invulnerable on the battlefield. Jerome Speling, the Scion of a major American family, disappears during a military deployment in Sweden. A small squad of American soldiers is dispatched to locate him. The team is led by Theodore “Ted” Regan and includes his fellow soldiers Sturgeon and Franken. They are joined by Lawes, a British mercenary, and Cormoran, a corporate representative.\nThe squad crosses into occupied Sweden and investigates the site of Speling’s disappearance, where they discover evidence suggesting the involvement of Finnish special forces. Their movements attract the attention of Russian mercenaries and a mechanized unit known as a Ruud, forcing them into repeated engagements. The group later encounters Nordic resistance fighters, including a Finn named Viina, who offers to guide them to Speling.\nTheir search leads them to a castle controlled by the corporation LMK, where Speling was last seen. Regan, Sturgeon, and Lawes infiltrate the castle and discover Speling’s Scion suit, but not Speling himself. Lawes betrays the unit, and the soldiers are captured by LMK forces. Cormoran, Franken, and Viina mount a rescue; during the escape, Lawes is killed while both Franken and Viina are badly wounded. The Finnish fighters save Franken’s life, implanting him with experimental modifications in the process.\nRegan realizes that the squad has been set up to fail. With the aid of the Finns, the survivors track Speling to Stockholm, where LMK has transferred him. Upon arrival, they are taken into custody by corporate security forces rather than national authorities. They meet Speling, whoreveals that he never went missing. Instead, he traveled to Stockholm voluntarily to negotiate a corporate settlement to the war. The mission to retrieve him was a cover story, intended to eliminate Regan’s unit and lend credibility to Speling’s supposed disappearance.\nThe enhancements implanted in Franken allow him to access and disrupt Speling’s systems. He uncovers LMK’s plan to overthrow the Swedish government and replace it with a corporate-controlled puppet regime. In the ensuing confrontation, Franken sacrifices himself to assassinate Speling. Regan, Cormoran, and Sturgeon are rescued in the aftermath.\nFollowing the mission, the squad members go their separate ways. Sturgeon chooses asylum in Sweden, Cormoran enters Russian service, and Regan returns to the United States.\n\n\nMajor themes\nPatrick Mahon called the novel \"a pretty brutal satire on the military-industrial complex...\" In the novel, poor Americans are disenfranchised because the children of poor families are more likely to die in the war. This means that large military losses will not affect American military strategy. Mahon compares this to wars of the Middle Ages, in which \"wars were started and continued by monarchs and the aristocracy, none of whom went to battle unless they had superior weapons and heavy protective armour, while most of the actual fighting was done by poorly-armed, poorly-armoured and poorly-trained serfs.\"\n\n\nStyle\nThe novella is written in first person and narrated by Sergeant Ted Regan. Patrick Mahon described the tone as \"informal\" and \"conversational ... spiced up by the frequent f-bombs that are an inevitable consequence of trying to reflect the language of soldiers under fire.\"\n\n\nPublication history\nIronclads was published by Solaris Books on 7 Nov 2017 as a limited-edition hardback. The ebook was released on 31 Dec 2017. An omnibus edition of Terrible Worlds: Revolutions was published 23 May 2025.\n\n\nReception and awards\nTadiana Jones of fantasyliterature.com gave the novella four out of five stars, calling it an \"imaginative, fast-paced military science fiction ... with a large side of social commentary.\" Jones wrote that the narrator was a \"fairly standard military sort of character\" but that the side characters such as Comoran were interesting. The review praised the novel as both a \"straight-up military SF adventure\" as well as its deeper thematic content.\nLiz Bourke of Locus praised Tchaikovsky's worldbuilding, calling it \"frighteningly plausible in some respects.\" Of the Scions, Bourke commented that they are \"an extension of the ways in which the upper classes have always been shielded from the kind of consequences that predominantly afflict ordinary people.\" Bourke concluded that the book is \"short, sharp, and not as depressing as its premise might suggest. It’s a solid piece of near-future military science fiction.\"\nPatrick Mahon of SF Crow's Nest called the book \"an exciting military SF novella which dramatises current conflicts between rich and poor, right and left, public and private in a brutally satirical fashion.\" Ed Fortune of Starburst called the book \"a rapid and addictive read, very much the page-turner.\"\nKirkus Reviews listed Ironclads as one of its best science fiction and fantasy reads of November 2017.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Colby Joseph Armstrong (born November 23, 1982) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger and current hockey broadcaster. He was selected in the first round, 21st overall, by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2001 NHL entry draft. Armstrong also previously played for the Atlanta Thrashers, Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens. He currently serves as an analyst for NHL on Sportsnet along with being an analyst for the Pittsburgh Penguins on SportsNet Pittsburgh.\n\n\nEarly life\nArmstrong was born in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, but grew up in Saskatoon. His father worked for the City of Saskatoon and his mother operates a skating school in Saskatoon. He has an older sister, Tiffany, and a younger brother, Riley. He attended St. Joseph High School in Saskatoon.\n\n\nHockey career\n\n\nJunior hockey\nArmstrong played his minor hockey with the Saskatoon Redwings and Saskatoon Blazers. He later played major junior hockey with the Red Deer Rebels of the Western Hockey League (WHL) beginning in 1999. In his second year with the Rebels, the team won the 2000–01 WHL championship. This allowed the Rebels to play for the Memorial Cup as the best junior hockey team in Canada. The tournament was held in Regina, Saskatchewan. The Rebels won the cup in overtime in the final with Armstrong as their captain. He played one more year with Rebels and finished his major junior career with 185 points in 205 games.\n\n\nProfessional hockey\nArmstrong was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the 2001 NHL entry draft as the 21st pick overall. He was assigned to the Penguins' American Hockey League affiliate, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins beginning in the 2002–03 season. In the 2005–06 season, Armstrong made his NHL debut, and had a superb rookie season, in which he played 47 games and tallied 40 points (16 goals and 24 assists). Armstrong had three overtime goals for the Penguins in the 2006–07 season in which he accumulated 12 goals and 34 points. The Penguins and Armstrong avoided an arbitration hearing in the 2006–07 off-season by re-signing him to two-year, $2.2 million contract. Armstrong became very close friends with teammate Sidney Crosby while playing for the Penguins. On January 1, 2008, Armstrong scored the first ever outdoor Winter Classic goal in the inaugural event.\nPittsburgh traded Armstrong on February 26, 2008, to the Atlanta Thrashers, alongside Angelo Esposito, Erik Christensen and a first-round draft pick in the 2008 NHL entry draft, in exchange for Marián Hossa and Pascal Dupuis. He then scored 11 points in 18 games to finish out the 2007–08 season with Atlanta. In the 2008–09 season, Armstrong played in all 82 games, matching his career high of 40 points. On July 16, 2009, Armstrong re-signed with the Thrashers to a one-year, $2.4 million contract. He served as one of the team's alternate captains during the 2009–10 season. He was also suspended for two games in April for an illegal hit on Mathieu Perreault of the Washington Capitals. He finished the season with 15 goals and 29 points in 79 games.\nOn July 1, 2010, Armstrong signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs on a three-year, $9 million contract. With his first two seasons largely affected by injury and inconsistent play, on June 30, 2012, he was bought-out by the Maple Leafs from his final season of his contract. He played in 79 games over the two years, registering 9 goals and 26 points. He was named an alternate captain by the Maple Leafs during his time with them.\nWith the opening of free agency the next day, July 1, 2012, Armstrong signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens.  During the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 season, he signed to play with the Utah Grizzlies, where his brother Riley was playing at the time. After the season resumed, Armstrong suffered another major injury in an April game versus the Carolina Hurricanes. He finished the season contributing only 5 points in 37 games.\nOn July 27, 2013, Armstrong left the NHL as a free agent and signed his only European contract with the Växjö Lakers of the Swedish Hockey League, playing one season.\n\n\nInternational play\n\nArmstrong was a member of Canada's 2007 IIHF World Championship-winning team. His only goal of the tournament was the game-winning goal in the gold medal game against Finland in Moscow, which Canada won 4–2. He also played in the 2009 IIHF World Championship for Team Canada where they won the silver medal after losing to Russia 2–1 in the final.\n\n\nBroadcasting career\nRogers Media hired Armstrong as an analyst for Sportsnet's national coverage of the NHL starting in the 2014–15 season.  Since 2016, he has also been an analyst of Pittsburgh Penguins games for the SportsNet Pittsburgh studio and game broadcast crew and games on TNT since 2022.\nIn 2019, Armstrong was in training to appear on the CBC reality TV show Battle of the Blades. However, he was injured during training and instead appeared on the show as one of the judges.\nHe currently appears on the Spittin' Chiclets spinoff podcast, Game Notes, on the Barstool Sports network, with former teammate Matt Murley. \n\n\nPersonal life\nArmstrong's younger brother Riley briefly played in the NHL with the San Jose Sharks.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database\nColby Armstrong on Twitter",

According to the story, described in other sources as a \"strong folk belief\" or \"local legend\", a woman, who ran a shebeen at nearby Glengarriff, conspired with five local men to kill a priest and split the £45 bounty. After capturing the priest during Mass, beheading him inside a house at Killowen near Kenmare, and bringing his severed head to Cork city, the six conspirators learned that Catholic Emancipation had just been signed into law and that no reward would be given. In the folktale, the six priest hunters reputedly threw the severed head into the River Lee in frustration.\nThe nearby parish church at Sheana-Shéipéil, described as having \"tottering walls\" and a \"confined unsafe cabin\" in 1839, was replaced with a new structure at Milleens in the mid-19th century. The present church, dedicated to Saint Fiachna, was built on the same site in 1892.\n\n\nAmenities\n\nTourist sites in the area include Bonane Heritage Park, a chocolate factory and traditional farm and visitors centre.\nSt. Fiachna's Church (built 1892) is in the centre of the village, while Bonane's national (primary) school is located at Tulloha.\n\n\nTransport\nBonane lies on the N71 national route between Glengarriff and Kenmare.\nWhile Bus Éireann route 270 (from Killarney to Skibbereen) passes through the village, there is no official bus stop.

    "text": "Ninja Blade is a 2009 action game developed by FromSoftware and published by Microsoft Game Studios for Xbox 360 and Windows.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThe player plays as a modern-day ninja, using a katana, twin swords and broad sword as the main weapon to the hostile creatures. The combat system is similar to Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry. A chi bar is used up when \"ninja vision\" or ninjutsu is used. The gameplay is highly cinematic, relying on quick time events to finish missions; after attacking a boss until the health bar is empty, the player must perform a finishing move called the \"todome\".\n\n\nPlot\nIn 2011, the inhabitants of a small Northern African village are infected by an unknown hookworm parasite, classified as \"Alpha-worm\" after the village was attacked by a group of Alpha-worm infected oversized rats, which alters its hosts' bodies and minds while increasing their strength and resilience. To prevent an outbreak, the military raid the quarantine zone and exterminate the infected with MOBA bomb, while the incident is covered up by the government. Military intelligence forms a containment task force called GUIDE (Global United Infestation Detection and Elimination), recruiting operatives from around the world.\nFour years later, a GUIDE ninja team, including the young Ken Ogawa and led by his father Kanbe, is dispatched to Tokyo to contain a massive Alpha-worm outbreak after the JSDF failed to contain the outbreak. Following Kanbe's trail, Ken chases and defeats an Arachne creature, however Kanbe and fellow team member Kuroh, having been infected by King Worms, slaughter the entire unit. Kanbe runs Ken through with the clan's 'Ninja Blade', narrowly missing his heart — something a master swordsman could only do on purpose. After a quick recovery, Ken is dispatched solo back to the city.\nAs Ken eliminates other major Alpha-worm Carriers, he is informed that the military are considering a mass sterilization of Tokyo via orbital laser cannon, which will sacrifice its entire population. He then pursues two more King Worm hosts, a father-daughter pair of Yakuza bosses oyabun Kurokawa and Ryoko. After defeating both, Ken witnesses Ryoko momentarily regain her sanity and beg for a mercy killing, which re-ignites hope in Ken that he may still save his father.\nAfter thwarting an attempt to spread the infection overseas through a plane carrying evacuees, Ken learns that Kuroh has attacked the local shopping mall and rigged the Tokyo underground with explosive Carriers called Blast Mites. Ken disposes of the Mites, catapulting the last one into the air out of harm's way. The bombing, however, was meant as a distraction to allow Kuroh to lead a strike team of Carrier military operatives into the GUIDE headquarters. All GUIDE personnel, including director Michael Wilson, are taken hostage. With the help of Wilson himself, Ken manages to rescue the hostages, after having to kill his former teammates turned Carriers. In a final confrontation with Ken, Kuroh reveals that Ken was not born but made in a military lab with the goal of wiping out the Alpha-worms, hence his immunity to the parasite. Kuroh also reveals that both he and Kanbe infected themselves with King Worms intentionally, Kuroh having done so out of craving for the power bestowed by the parasite.\nKanbe rescues Ken from a suicide attack by Kuroh, whereupon he confirms he volunteered to be infected, but only so that he could infiltrate and locate the Alpha-worm hive, which was buried underground to escape sterilization. Ken goes underground and eventually finds the hive, however he is unable to use the Ninja Blade to destroy it. A now controlled Kanbe challenges Ken on top of the Tokyo Tower. Before Ken can finish him, the hive absorbs Kanbe, thus transforming into a colossal version of him which begins laying waste to the city. Ken chases down and attacks the mutant Kanbe, weakening him enough for Ken to enter the hive and attack its core, which manifests itself in Kanbe's shape again. Ken defeats the core using the Ninja Blade and finally brings peace to his father, then the hive crumbles along with every trace of the infection.\nMonths later, Tokyo is being rebuilt after the whole incident is again covered up by the government and media. Wilson reforms GUIDE and appoints Ken to train and lead the new recruits in the event of a new outbreak.\n\n\nDevelopment and release\nThe concept for Ninja Blade initially came when FromSoftware tried to create a game that conveyed the same intense sequences as those of Hollywood action films. FromSoftware worked with Microsoft in creating the game's protagonist, Ken Ogawa. Producer Masanori Takeuchi said: \"We worked closely with Microsoft in creating Ken. They provided us with lots of useful feedback and insightful consumer research of worldwide gamers. By cooperating and working together, Ken has become more appealing to a wider audience.\" The character was designed by Capcom 2nd Character Development Studio designer Keiji Nakaoka.\nThe game has been categorized as a \"cinematic action game,\" combining a mixture of hack and slash elements with context-sensitive commands. Ninja Blade was commonly referred to as Otogi 3 by various sources before its official announcement. Lead planner Kazuhiro Hamatani noted that while not a direct sequel or spiritual successor to Otogi, the game would contain action-adventure elements of which fans of the Otogi series would like. The soundtrack was composed by Norihiko Hibino's GEM Impact studio. The animation was produced by Production I.G.\nA demo was released in Japan on December 29, 2008. The demo was released in North America on March 10, 2009. The full game was released for Xbox 360 in 2009 in Japan on January 29, Europe on April 3, North America on April 7, and Australia on August 6. A port for Windows was released by Russian publisher ND Games both physically and on their digital storefront in Russia on November 5, 2009. It was made available worldwide via Steam two weeks later on November 19, 2009. Having signed a mutual publishing agreement with Noviy Disk, Iceberg Interactive released a retail version of the game in select regions in Europe on February 19, 2010. The game was also made available through cloud service OnLive in North America as part of a bundle on February 1, 2011, and in the United Kingdom alongside the regional launch of the service on September 22, 2011.\n\n\nReception\n\nOverall, the game has received mixed to positive reviews. Ninja Blade was named Game of the Month in the June 2009 issue of GamePro, with a rating of 5/5 stars. In GameSpot's The Best of 2009 awards, it was one of the five titles nominated for Best Game No One Played.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Minsmere is a place in the English county of Suffolk. It is located on the North Sea coast around 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north of Leiston and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south-east of Westleton within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB. It is the site of the Minsmere RSPB reserve and the original site of Leiston Abbey.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAt the Domesday Book survey in 1086 Minsmere was known as Menesmara or Milsemere. It is recorded as having six households headed by freemen with one plough team. The manor, which was in the Hundred of Blythling, was held by Roger Bigot.\nRanulf de Glanvill, King Henry II's Lord Chief Justice, founded an abbey on the marshes at Minsmere in 1182, but, probably due to an increased risk of flooding, this was abandoned in favour of Leiston Abbey in 1363.\nPeat cutting took place at Minsmere from at least the 12th century and a 1237 description of the coastline describes Minsmere as a port. Minsmere is recorded in the 14th century as being a small village with around 10 homesteads, but these had all been lost to the sea by the 16th century. A survey of 1587 records that the early Tudor period 'entrenchments' at Minsmere were in ruins and recommended that they be rebuilt. During the 18th century Minsmere, Eastbridge and the Sizewell gap were renowned as a hotbed for smugglers. A coastguard station operated at Minsmere in the 1840s in an attempt to control smuggling along this stretch of the coast.\nThe marshes along the Minsmere River were drained for agricultural use in the 1840s but reflooded during the Second World War to defend against invasion along the East Anglian coast. A number of military defences were built in the area, including pill boxes, anti-tank blocks and barbed wire defence lines. Cottages and a beach cafe on the coast at Minsmere sluice were evacuated, used as target practice and later demolished. The Minsmere RSPB reserve was established in 1947, making use of the wetland habitats reintroduced by wartime flooding.\n\n\nGeography\nMinsmere is in a low-lying area of the Suffolk coast approximately 24 miles (39 km) north-east of Ipswich. It is in the civil parishes of Westleton and Leiston with the parish border running along the Minsmere Old River. It borders the parish of Theberton at Eastbridge to the south-west and the parish of Dunwich to the north along the coast.\nThe landscape is largely flat along the line of the river. This is known as the Minsmere Level, an area of drained and re-flooded marshland with underlying alluvial geology. The area to the south of the Minsmere New Cut drainage ditch, built in 1812, is used as grazing marsh. To the north the wetland areas are flooded and managed as part of the RSPB's habitat management strategy for its Minsmere reserve. This area includes drier areas of sandlings, including areas of mixed woodland rising up to 20 metres above sea level on sandy ridges.\nThe area provides a number of important habitats, including for species such as bitterns, marsh harriers, hen harriers, avocets and Dartford warblers. The wetland areas include flooded lagoons and much of the area is designated as a Ramsar site. The grazing marshes to the south of the Minsmere Levels provide over-wintering grounds for a variety of different waterfowl species.\nThe coastline at Minsmere consists of a narrow shingle beach and some areas of sand dune with a shingle bank protecting the low-lying coastal areas. This area is at risk of flooding from coastal surges although, unlike areas to the north and south, it does not suffer significantly from coastal erosion. To the north Minsmere Cliffs are found within Dunwich Heath, a National Trust property. The cliffs consist of loose, unconsolidated sand and shingle glacial deposits and suffer from coastal erosion.\n\n\nMinsmere Sluice Chapel\n\nThe remains of a chapel built on the original site of Leiston Abbey are located on the Minsmere Level to the south of the Minsmere New Cut. These are the only visible remains at the site of the original Premonstratensian Abbey. The chapel was probably built when the abbey was relocated and stands on the site of the original monastic church, the stone from which was probably used to build the new abbey at Leiston. It is thought to have been used as a chapel dedicated to St Mary until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537. The abbey was originally built on an island in the marshland but is believed to have suffered from frequent coastal flooding which led to its relocation to Leiston in 1363. Geophysical surveys have shown that a number of archaeological features lie buried in the immediate area, including remains of the abbey church, cloisters and fish ponds.\nThe chapel remains include a pillbox built in the early stages of the Second World War. The site and its surrounding area is a scheduled ancient monument. The chapel remains were restored in 2011 to preserve them and to allow some public access.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Minsmere at Wikimedia Commons\n\n3D model of the chapel on Sketchfab",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=48842",
    "text": "The smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Centrarchiformes. It is the type species of its genus Micropterus (black basses), and is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America, and has been spread by stocking —as well as illegal introductions—to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and more so introduced in the United States. The maximum recorded size is approximately 27 inches (69 cm) and 12 pounds (5.4 kg). \nThe smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, the Champlain Valley, and the Hudson Bay basin. Its common names include smallmouth, bronzeback, brown bass, brownie, smallie, bronze bass, and bareback bass.\n\n\nDescription\n\nSmallmouth have a slender but muscular fusiform body shape making them powerful swimmers. The coloration of the smallmouth bass' ctenoid scales range from golden-olive to dark brown dorsally which fades to a yellowish white ventrally with dark brown vertical bars or blotches along the body and dark brown horizontal bars on the head. The combination of the muscular fusiform body shape and camouflage like coloring make these fish highly effective ambush predators. The coloration can vary greatly depending on the fishes age, habitat, water quality, diet, and the spawning cycle.\nGenerally, the protruding jaw of the smallmouth does not extend back beyond the eyes which are red or brown. They have two dorsal fins which are separated by a shallow interdorsal notch. The front dorsal has 9–11 spiney rays and the back dorsal has 13–15 soft rays.\nMales are generally smaller than females. The males tend to range around two pounds, while females can range from three to six pounds. Their average sizes and coloration can differ, depending on if they are found in lacustrine or riverine habitats. Smallmouth found in riverine habitats are generally long and slender which allows greater agility in moving water, while those found in lacustrine habitats and shorter and deeper bodied.\nRiverine smallmouth that live in dark water tend to be rather torpedo-shaped and very dark brown to be more efficient for feeding. Lacustrine smallmouth bass, however, that live in sandy areas, tend to be a light yellow-brown and are more oval-shaped.\nThere are two recognized subspecies, the Northern smallmouth bass (M. dolomieui dolomieui) and the Neosho smallmouth bass (M. dolomieui velox). The Northern smallmouth bass is much more widespread than the much smaller subgroup called the Neosho smallmouth bass. The Neosho are native to an ecologically isolated region of the lower Midwest known as the Central Interior Highlands, which weave through southwestern Missouri, northern Arkansas and northeastern Oklahoma.\nThey eat tadpoles, fish, aquatic insects, and crayfish.\nThe world record size is 11 pounds 15 ounces (5.41 kg) caught in the Dale Hollow reservoir, on the Kentucky—Tennessee border.\n\n\nHabitat\n\nThe smallmouth bass is found in clearer water than the largemouth, especially streams, rivers, and the rocky areas and stumps and also sandy bottoms of lakes and reservoirs. It can also survive in a stronger current than other black bass. The smallmouth prefers cooler water temperatures than its cousin the largemouth bass, and as a result will often seek out deeper, faster moving water during the hot summer months. Because it is intolerant of pollution, the smallmouth bass is a good natural indicator of a healthy environment, though they are still much more resilient than most trout species. Carnivorous, its diet comprises crayfish, amphibians, insects, and smaller fish, while the larvae feed on various zooplankton and insect larvae. Adults also cannibalize young of other parents.\nThe female can lay up to 21,100 eggs, which are guarded by the male in his nest.\n\n\nMigration\nWhen the weather gets colder, and the water temperature drops below 16 °C (60 °F), smallmouth will often migrate in search of deeper pools in which they enter a semi-hibernation state, moving sluggishly and feeding very little until the warm season returns. The migration patterns of smallmouth have been tracked and it is not unusual for a smallmouth to travel 12 miles in a single day in a stream, creek or river. The overall migration can exceed 60 miles.\nSmallmouth generally begin spawning patterns in spring or early summer when water temperatures are between 15–18 °C (59.0–64.4 °F), which is heavily dependent on latitudinal location. Smallmouth require clean stone, rock, or gravel substrate for a successful spawn.\n\n\nAngling\n\nIn the United States, smallmouth bass were first introduced outside of their native range with the construction of the Erie Canal in 1825, extending the fish's range into central New York state. During the mid-to-late 19th century, smallmouth were transplanted via the nation's rail system to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far as California. Shippers found that smallmouth bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels by rail, sometimes using the spigots from the railroad water tanks to aerate the fingerlings. They were introduced east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards transplanted to the states of New England.\nWith increased industrialization and land use changes, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were polluted or experienced elevated water temperatures, reducing the range of native brook trout. Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers with increased water temperatures and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers. Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range. Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by overdevelopment and pollution, as well as a loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers to form lakes or reservoirs. In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.\nToday, smallmouth bass are very popular game fish, frequently sought by anglers using conventional spinning and bait casting gear, as well as fly fishing tackle. The smallmouth bass is potentially the toughest fighting freshwater fish in North America, and is commonly the targeted species in many fresh water fishing tournaments. In addition to wild populations, the smallmouth bass is stocked in cool rivers and lakes throughout Canada and the United States. In shallow streams, it is a wary fish, though usually not to the extent of most trout. The smallmouth is highly regarded for its topwater fighting ability when hooked – old fishing journals referred to the smallmouth bass as \"ounce for ounce and pound for pound the gamest fish that swims\". Smallmouth bass are not usually taken for the table, but rather are caught and released by most anglers. However, smaller specimens in cooler water often have higher quality filets of white, firm flesh when cooked.\nThe current all-tackle world record for a smallmouth bass is 11 lb 15 oz, caught by David Hayes in the Dale Hollow Reservoir, on the Kentucky/Tennessee border, in 1955.\n\n\nTackle\nIn conventional fishing, smallmouth may be successfully caught on a wide range of natural and artificial baits or lures, including crankbaits, hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits, artificial worms, spinnerbaits, and all types of soft plastic lures, including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs. Spinning reels or baitcasting reels may be used, with line strengths of 6 to 15 pounds typically utilized. According to many, smallmouth typically put up a better, more exciting fight than any other black bass. Rods are usually of ultralight to medium-heavy action. They may also be caught with a fly rod using a dry or wet artificial fly, nymphs, streamers, or imitations of larger aquatic creatures, such as hellgrammites, crawfish, or leeches. Floating topwater popper fly patterns and buzz baits are also popular for smallmouth fishing.\nFor river fishing, spinning tackle or fly tackle has been the most popular angling tools for smallmouth in North America for many years. When fishing in colder water, it is believed to be more effective to fish with smaller lures like hair jigs or small spinners. During the rest of the year, smallmouth are usually taken using soft plastic tubes or spinnerbaits. The best spots in rivers to fish for smallmouth are behind rocks or in eddies, where water swirls around. Smallmouth can also be taken in cool lakes like Lake Erie or any of the northern lakes.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\nITIS: Micropterus dolomieu\nRohde, F. C., et al.

    "title": "Writing across the curriculum",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=21138276",
    "text": "Writing across the curriculum (WAC) is a movement within contemporary composition studies that concerns itself with writing in classes beyond composition, literature, and other English courses. According to a comprehensive survey performed in 2006–2007, approximately half of American institutes of higher learning have something that can be identified as a WAC program. In 2010, Thaiss and Porter defined WAC as \"a program or initiative used to 'assist teachers across disciplines in using student writing as an instructional tool in their teaching'\". WAC, then, is a programmatic effort to introduce multiple instructional uses of writing beyond assessment. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement (student-centered learning) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom. This page principally concerns itself with WAC in American colleges and universities. WAC has also been important in Britain, but primarily at the K–12 level.\n\n\nHistory of WAC\nDavid Russell traces the history of WAC in the United States to the 1870s, the emergence of professional disciplines, and the new need for college-level instruction in writing. Prior to this era, college students were exclusively (for all practical considerations) affluent white men whose natural discourse was identical to the approved discourse of the academy; therefore, their way of speaking and writing was already considered appropriate by and for the academy and composition didn't need to be taught at the college level. Two changes happened to motivate the need for college writing instruction. Firstly, as disciplines (as divisions within academic studies) and contemporary professions specialized, they developed their own specialized discourses. Because these discourses were not merely the same as the everyday discourse of the upper classes, they had to be taught. Secondly, as college students became more diverse – first in terms of social background and, later, in terms of gender, race, and age – not all college students grew up speaking the accepted language of the academy.\nFirst-year composition courses couldn't be about the content of the writing, because content was what the other disciplines taught. Composition, therefore, had to be about the form the writing took and so \"writing\" was reduced to mechanics and style. Because of this reduced focus and because writing was addressed by composition, other disciplines assumed no responsibility for writing instruction; most students, then, were not taught to write in the context of their specialties. As American education became increasingly skills-oriented following World War II – in part a reaction to the suffusion of universities with war veterans in need of job training, in part a result of modeling education after the efficiency of Fordian factory production – writing instruction was further reduced to a set of skills to be mastered. Once correct (that is, standard academic) grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style were mastered – preferably before reaching the post-secondary level – there was no need for additional writing instruction save as remedial education.\nThis product-oriented, skills-focused paradigm of writing pedagogy began to change in the 1970s with the popularization of James Britton and colleagues' expressivist school of composition, which said that students benefited from writing as a tool for self-expression and that focusing on technical correctness was damaging. Janet Emig's 1977 article \"Writing as a Mode of Learning,\" grounded in constructivist theories of education, suggested that writing functioned as a unique and invaluable way for students to understand and integrate information. Simultaneously, widespread media attention around college students' apparently decreasing writing proficiency (more a product of the changing demographics of college students than an overt shift in teaching) provoked institutions of higher learning to reevaluate and increase the amount of writing required of students. Carleton College and Beaver College began what were probably the first contemporary WAC programs in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with faculty workshops and writing requirements shared across disciplines.\n\n\nMajor Theories\nWAC efforts are usually driven principally by one of two theories: writing to learn or on learning to write in disciplinary discourses, sometimes also called writing in the disciplines. Though both may be used together, one of the two theories generally guides any given writing assignment and, often, any given WAC course.\n\n\nWriting to Learn\nWriting to learn is also occasionally referred to as the expressionist or cognitive mode of WAC. Writing to learn supports the use of mostly informal, often ungraded writing exercises to help students understand course content in non-English disciplines. Writing to learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of writing to learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common writing to learn exercises include reading responses, journals, free writing, and multiple forms of collaborative writing.\n\n\nWriting to Engage\nWriting to engage stands between the two most common approaches to writing across the curriculum: writing to learn and writing in the disciplines. Writing to engage involves the use of writing activities and assignments to engage students in the processes and approaches typical of a discipline and, in particular, to employ critical thinking skills typically used in that discipline. The critical thinking skills typically referred to in work on writing to engage draw on the taxonomy of educational objectives in the cognitive domain developed by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues in the 1950s and later modified by Loren W. Anderson and David R. Krathwohl in the 1990s. Within writing studies, writing has long been viewed as a useful means of demonstrating critical thinking and, through the work of scholars such as Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter (1987), even as a means of transforming knowledge. Writing to engage takes this view of writing and applies it to WAC.\nThis category of WAC activities and assignments allows instructors to distinguish between writing-to-learn activities that focus largely on remembering, understanding, and reflecting and writing-to-engage activities that involve applying, analyzing, and evaluating. This focus on critical thinking supports alignment between the curricular goals of a course and instructor expectations about the kinds of work they assign. It also calls instructor attention to the development of the general and disciplinary critical thinking skills students encounter as they progress from lower-division to upper-division courses. Distinguishing between writing to learn and writing to engage can contribute in useful ways to student learning and to preparation for further work in their disciplines.\n\n\nWriting in the Disciplines\nWriting in the disciplines is also occasionally referred to as the transactional or rhetorical mode of WAC. Writing in the Disciplines (WID) teaches students how to write acceptably in their respective disciplines. Writing in the Disciplines classes teach students to learn to write texts that they will apply in their scholarly and professional lives. Although WID and WAC are correlated, WID emphasizes disciplinary orientation. The students' participation in their majors enlists the students in discourse communities, which are social groups that communicate, at least in part, via written texts and share common goals, values, and writing standards. These writing standards include but are not limited to specialized vocabularies and particular genres.> The goal of WID is to allow students to demonstrate writing skills within the genres expected in academic and professional discourse communities.\nReflection is considered an essential component of critical learning and problem solving, and as such, is indispensable for Writing in the Disciplines. Reflection tasks stimulate students to look back on completed tasks such as writings done in their respective disciplines with the aim to understand their accomplishments and steer future actions. Students are commonly asked to work out these reflections in a writing task. The act of writing itself promotes learning in a particular discipline. They also find writing within a discipline leads students to deploy different productive approaches to learning that they might not have otherwise applied.\nWriting in the discipline courses are commonly referred to as Writing Intensive courses (WI). Writing Intensive courses were developed for two reasons: 1) Students' writing skills would decrease if not consistently reinforced. 2) Students' writing improves significantly when they write involving their major. The controversy surrounding WID is who holds responsibility for teaching WID courses. The different models for teaching WID classes are the following: 1) The English (or Writing) department faculty teaches writing courses focused on individual disciplines. 2) English (or Writing) departments and other discipline departments collaborate on instructing writing courses for particular majors. Peterson talks about how English assignments done in the freshman year will carry on and relate to the writing assignments during the rest of ones college career. What is learned in one course can carry on to other courses. This knowledge can be spread by working with colleagues in the same and other departments on assignments and class discussions. By doing this, departments can learn about the similarities and differences they have between them. 3) Individual faculty of respective disciplines teach writing for their respective disciplines. Each university decides which model works best for their institution. For example, The University of San Francisco has implemented model one to teach their Writing in Psychology course(RHET 203). Cornell University has used model two to teach their Technical Writing course(WRIT 7100). The University of Missouri employs the third model to teach their Process Synthesis and Design course - Writing Intensive(CH_ENG 4980W).\n\n\nWID across the Globe\nThe University School of Business Administration (EAN) of Bogotá, Colombia, conducted a study where students took courses for writing in the disciplines. The study showed that writing in the disciplines had positive outcomes on students' performance. Students were split into writing courses based on their majors that would ultimately help them with discipline-specific writing. Courses offered for writing in the discipline included: Introduction to Administration, Principles and Theories of International Business, Economic Thought, Models of Organizational Communication and Foundation in Engineering. Not every major is the same, and there were some differences, the courses offered individual \"work guides\" for students so that they could focus more in-depth on writing in the discipline. The goal of this study was to help students read and write more critically and analytically.\n\n\nWID in the US\nThe George Washington University located in Washington D.C. has successfully implemented a WID program in their undergraduate education. During students first year, freshman take First Year Writing which teaches students college level research and writing, rhetoric, and more. As students go on, they take two WID courses in different semesters at their time at the university. These courses show their students how to write in their respective disciplines and how to communicate in those disciplines as well. The WID program at this university is implemented at all departments and schools unlike the WID program at The University School of Business Administration (EAN) of Bogotá, Colombia. The University of George Washington had WID in the Arts and Sciences, International Affairs, Public Health, and Engineering and Business schools. The university also has a writing center to further improve their students writing skills. The George Washington University has been in the U.S. News & World Report list for the success they have in their writing program.\nScholars agree that writing enhances learning within a discipline by encouraging students to adopt diverse cognitive approaches. Writing allows students to engage more deeply with their field, refer back to their own work for reinforcement, and develop a stronger mastery of their discipline when introduced early. Studies suggest that meaningful interactions with experts and exposure to discipline-specific reading further improve students' understanding of academic discourse.\nUniversities have begun initiating academic discourse partnerships between WID programs and writing centers with a focus on inclusivity for diverse student bodies. The goal of this inclusive-based approach to a writing center is for the tutor to guide the students to apply the characteristics of their background to learning and contributing to new discourse communities. Moreover, the inclusive tutoring style acts as an outlet for the student to reconsider their struggles as a normal part of the writing process.\nWID in the Workforce\nWriting in the disciplines is a valuable skill applicable across various professional fields, including medicine, business, nursing, and accounting. It enables students to establish real-world connections with their chosen field, fostering a deeper understanding of their area of study. Many professionals utilize this skill daily to communicate effectively within their disciplines.\n\n\nPossible Drawbacks of WID\nOne of the possible problems of applying the curriculum may be how different schools define their English/ writing departments. Departments that narrowly focus on only \"literary\" reading and writing may have some difficulty adapting to a curriculum that contains non-literary subjects (such as organic chemistry). The teachers may lack confidence in their ability to teach such subjects, as they were not the focus within their personal educational career.\nAnother issue that may arise is the lack of an all-encompassing education within the English department staff. Most literature professionals specialize only in English or literature, but the writing in the disciplines course demands that the teachers must have a very broad field of experience and choosing said curriculum might prove to be difficult. What constitutes a good organic chemistry report may be completely opposite of what a well written literary article constitutes and if a professor chooses a source that is not an accurate representation of the subject, then that particular segment of the course will be moot.\nA problem that may affect the students is the case of information overload. Heavy information load can confuse the individual, affect his or her ability to set priorities and make prior information harder to recall. Within a very short amount a time, students are expected to learn how to proficiently write for disciplines all across the board. Because of the very nature of the class, students may find the subject overbearing and difficult to navigate.\nStudents' writing ability may not actually increase as they progress through upper-division writing classes. Instead, they may simply change their writing style to better fit the criteria of the reader/ teacher. Because of this, students can completely miss the point of WID classes and not learn the nuances between each discipline.\n\n\nWAC Structure and Implementation\nWAC may exist as a formal program housed in or attached to an English department or independent writing program, a formal program as a free-standing unit reporting directly to a dean or vice president, a program attached to an all-campus writing center, or an informal initiative in which faculty voluntarily participate. The WAC director, at most universities, is a tenure-track professor. WAC programs are often administered by a WAC director, frequently with the aid of a WAC faculty committee, and are sometimes staffed by undergraduate or graduate student assistants (also referred to as tutors, consultants, or fellows.)\n\n\nWAC Workshops\nWorkshops at which faculty from many disciplines meet to share ideas about and strategies around writing are a primary way in which WAC is enacted.\nWorkshops serve multiple functions including:\n\nEncouraging community amongst faculty interested in WAC\nAllowing WAC faculty (often, but not always from English or composition studies) to share knowledge about writing to learn, writing process, providing student feedback, and other composition scholarship\nProviding a forum for open discussion about writing and teaching\nGiving faculty themselves an opportunity to experiment with different writing strategies including collaborative writing and peer-review and to experience something of how these strategies may feel for their students\nA major complaint against the workshop model of WAC is that it can encourage the mindset that writing pedagogy is relatively simple and can be mastered in a few days, whereas using writing effectively (in English or non-English classes) is widely recognized as taking years of practice.\n\n\nWAC in Upper-division Courses\nOn a programmatic level, WAC most often manifests as some kind of writing-intensive (also called writing-enriched or writing-in-the-major) courses. Courses carrying this designation typically meet university-wide criteria including a minimum number of pages or words students write over the semester (or some other measure of writing frequency), opportunity for revision, and deriving a significant portion of the final grade from writing. Writing-intensive courses also often have relatively small enrollment limits (15–35 students depending on institution) and may require faculty to participate in WAC-related professional development activities.\nThe rationale for writing-intensive coursework includes:\n\nWriting practice – as with any other skill, students' writing abilities will atrophy if they are left unpracticed; writing-intensive courses ensure that students continue to write after leaving first-year composition\nWriting to learn – contemporary composition theory holds that incorporating active writing promotes student engagement and, therefore, learning\nProfessionalization – writing-intensive courses directed at upper-division major students provide an opportunity for students to learn the communication skills expected of professionals in their anticipated fields\n\n\nWAC in First-year Composition\n\nWhile WAC is usually understood as distributing writing across the curriculum in courses outside of English departments, a WAC philosophy can also influence the structure of first-year composition courses. Because first-year composition is often the only writing course students take, the composition of the class can shape students' understanding of what writing is. Incorporating writing from diverse academic genres can therefore expand students' expectations about what constitutes \"writing.\" WAC in first-year composition owes much to genre theory (genre studies) which asks students to think about the classification and rhetorical implications of writing within socially constructed genres.\n\n\nWriting-Enriched Curriculum\nWriting-Enriched Curriculum (or WEC) is a movement that scholars have recently started to implement in university programs across the U.S. With its basic premise reflecting WAC's integration of relevant writing throughout all student's courses, WEC aims to focus on faculty involvement and intense reflection upon devising a writing program that is effective and relevant for students in their various fields of study.\n\n\nPrecursors of WEC\nIn the late 1990s, North Carolina State University developed an approach to writing across the curriculum that involved extensive consultation by writing experts with individual departments. These consultations began with a focus on the qualities and characteristics faculty felt that student majors would exhibit if they were strong communicators. Those discussions led to the articulation of learning outcomes for both writing and oral communication. The departments then developed implementation plans that could help them reach the outcomes, followed or preceded by plans for assessing student abilities in order to further refine or project plans for implementation. The Campus Writing and Speaking Program, directed since 1999 by Distinguished Professor Chris Anson (www.ansonica.net), provided much of the support for this campus-wide approach. A few years into the program's existence, Anson and colleague Michael Carter (who is often credited with originating the departmentally-focused conversations on which WEC is founded) consulted with Pamela Flash at the University of Minnesota (where Anson had been a professor for 15 years) to help them spearhead a similar effort. Minnesota evolved the approach into a portable model, shifting from a focus on outcomes-oriented assessment to a faculty-driven, long-term process of sustainable curricular transformation). They branded their model, which is being implemented and adapted by an increasing number of institutions, \"WEC.\"\nWEC is both a specific model and a developing concept relating to WAC; the acronym was created by Pamela Flash and her colleagues at The University of Minnesota. Flash is the university's director of Writing Across the Curriculum, founding director of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum and co-director of the writing center. As a pioneer of the WEC writing instruction model, the University of Minnesota has had its faculty enroll up to 5 units of WEC plans per year into the undergraduate curriculum for up to 10 years.\n\n\nThe WEC Model\nAccording to the WEC website at the University of Minnesota, WEC is a faculty-driven method to ensuring the effective, intentional integration of relevant writing and writing instruction into disciplinary curricula. The WEC model created by Writing Across the Curriculum director Pamela Flash and colleagues and initially implemented by the University of Minnesota involves departmental faculty in developing a locally relevant Writing Plan. The outlining of plans is attempted through collaborative discussions between numerous departmental faculty and specialists in both writing and assessment and the consideration of previous attempts at effective writing instruction. Some of the content under consideration include writing assessments, locally collected data, stakeholder surveys and writing expectations from instructors. The outcome of this meetings is pronounced expectations and plans for relevant instructions to be implemented in the curricula. The next step is the application of the plan into the undergraduate curriculum and assessing Undergraduate Writing Plans. Integrating the WEC model is anticipated to show improvements in writing instruction at a rate that would meet faculty expectations. Each of three writing plans is tested for 1-3 academic years through multiple outlets; internal curricular study and structural changes, material development, writing workshops, seminars, and panels, and additional research. The feasibility of each edition of these writing plans is assessed by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate; the Campus Writing Board. Contributions to writing plan assessment include triennial panel ratings of student writing against faculty expectations and criteria. The results are then used to guide future writing plans.\nPamela Flash, a key figure in developing the WEC program, stresses the necessity of having the willingness to reflect on the current curriculum and the importance of diverting resistance between faculty members being integral to the Writing-Enriched Curriculum (WEC). This means that WEC essentially challenges the normal standards of writing and the way it is frequently taught. Flash argues that professors need to understand the principles of writing and writing education and to help them understand that undergraduate students and graduate students are not trained in the same writing strategies. When the professor possesses a knowledge of these conceptions the student is more likely to latch onto writing for their respective field of study. For the program itself there are undergraduate writing plans that are designed to graduate and equip students with a writing enriched degree. These plans are formulated by faculty meetings, statistics, curricular maps, and sample writings. The WEC model is based upon reflection and critically analyzing what would enrich the student's writing curricula.\n\n\nThe Principles of WAC and the WEC Model\nBecause WEC closely reflects WAC, the principles that Barbara Walvoord gives to devise a WAC program are similar to Anson's Campus Writing and Speaking Program at NC State and Pamela Flash's WEC model at the University of Minnesota. James K. Elmborg's work on information literacy and WAC summarizes Walvoord's characteristics of creating a WAC program as:\n\nIncluding colleagues from various disciplines, including teaching assistants and students, as they will all be affected by the WAC program the most.\nDiscussing what needs and concerns need to be met with a WAC program and who will be willing to dedicate time to implementing the curriculum.\nWhat changes will be made to address this—whether it be in school-wide assessments, writing centers or classroom methods\nSchool administrators will then oversee and facilitate WAC but should not be seen as dictators.\nSimilarly, both Anson's approach at NC State and Pamela Flash's model at the University of Minnesota reflect the same idea of coming together with faculty members from various fields throughout the curriculum and implementing these changes cohesively. The main point of difference between WAC and WEC, however, is that WEC requires faculty to maintain intentional support activity and assessment of how the program is affecting their students and to make changes, if necessary. Like WAC, Flash's WEC model also requires ongoing implementation and incremental direct and indirect assessment, which allows the faculty-implemented plans to sustain. Anson's program at NC State revisits departments to conduct \"profiles\" of their efforts, resulting in a formative report for the department's use According to Flash, WEC differs from most WAC programming in its departmental locus and its direct focus on the ways that faculty members in diverse disciplines conceptualize writing and writing instruction.\n\n\nEvolution of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum\nThe process in the development of the Writing-Enriched Curriculum provides a space for equal dialogue between all faculty in all disciplines. WEC is no longer solely dedicated to composition studies and other writing courses, but has expanded toward the Performing Arts curriculum achieving interdepartmental dialogue between all faculty. In turn, WEC now focuses on creating, discovering, and using a language that can be translated into practical, academic, creative and professional fields.\n\n\nCriticisms\nP.A. Ramsay, in his paper Writing across the curriculum: Integrating discourse communities in the academy, found that students that participate in WAC programs become better communicators in their chosen discipline and demonstrated improved critical/analytical thinking.\nDisadvantages of WAC include fears that the teaching style will reduce the available time to teach content material, difficulties getting teachers \"on board\" with the style, as well as fears that the teacher is ill-equipped to teach writing. Ramsay also found while working in Jamaica, that students who were unable to compose in their first language (either because of academic deficiencies or because the language did not have a written language) had difficulties composing in their second language using WAC practices. This was a sentiment echoed by Alexander Friedlander, who in his research found that students unable to write in their first language will have great difficulty writing in their second language regardless of whether their instruction has used WAC strategies.\n\n\nSee also\nThe WAC Clearinghouse\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nSyracuse University, Antiracist WAC Toolkit.\nPeterson, Linda. \"Writing Across the Curriculum and/in the Freshman English Program\" (PDF).

    "summary": "Writing across the curriculum (WAC) is a movement within contemporary composition studies that concerns itself with writing in classes beyond composition, literature, and other English courses. According to a comprehensive survey performed in 2006–2007, approximately half of American institutes of higher learning have something that can be identified as a WAC program. In 2010, Thaiss and Porter defined WAC as \"a program or initiative used to 'assist teachers across disciplines in using student writing as an instructional tool in their teaching'\". WAC, then, is a programmatic effort to introduce multiple instructional uses of writing beyond assessment. WAC has also been part of the student-centered pedagogies movement (student-centered learning) seeking to replace teaching via one-way transmission of knowledge from teacher to student with more interactive strategies that enable students to interact with and participate in creating knowledge in the classroom. This page principally concerns itself with WAC in American colleges and universities. WAC has also been important in Britain, but primarily at the K–12 level.",

    "text": "The New England Anti-Slavery Society (1831–1837) was formed by William Lloyd Garrison, editor of The Liberator, in 1831. The Liberator was its official publication.\nBased in Boston, Massachusetts, members of the New England Anti-slavery Society supported immediate abolition and viewed slavery as immoral and non-Christian (sinful). It was particularly opposed to the American Colonization Society, which proposed sending African Americans to Africa.\nThe founding meeting took place on January 1, 1831, in the vestry of the Belknap Street Church. (Some sources list the date as January 1, 1832.) Garrison was the principal founder. The other founding members were: Benjamin Bierly of Amesbury, Massachusetts, Reverend Elijah Blanchard, Dr. Gamaliel Bradford, Elizabeth B. Chase, Joshua Easton, also a member of the Massachusetts General Colored Association, Charles Theodore Follen, Reverend Henry Grew, Reverend Cyrus Pitt Grosvenor, Ellis Gray Loring, Captain Jonas Parker of Reading, Massachusetts, Reverend Perry of Mendon, Massachusetts, Reverend Amos August Phelps, Reverend Aaron Pickett of Reading, Massachusetts, Samuel Edmund Sewall, Horace Wakefield, Amasa Walker, and a Reverend Yates.\nThe society sponsored lecturers or \"agents\" who traveled throughout the New England area, speaking in local churches or halls, and also selling abolitionist tracts or The Liberator. Whenever possible, the Society's agents would also encourage the formation of local anti-slavery societies. By 1833 there were 47 local societies in ten northern states, 33 of them in New England. The society also sponsored mass mobilizations such as yearly anti-slavery conventions and celebrations of July 4 or — preferred by those who believed celebrating July 4 was unacceptable since the U.S. Constitution accepted slavery — the Anniversary of the Abolition of Slavery in the West Indies, August 1.\nJohn Levy, \"a colored gentleman\" from Lowell, decries insufficient involvement of free Negroes in the struggle. Garrison, Birney, Burleigh, Henry Stanton, and other stalwarts speak at length.\n\n\nMassachusetts General Colored Association\nIn January 1833, Thomas Dalton, president of the Massachusetts General Colored Association, led a successful petition to merge with the New England Anti-Slavery Society. Separate black anti-slavery societies had already existed in Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Connecticut, and New Jersey, however, a strong feeling against the organization of separate anti-slavery societies had been emerging.\nTogether they organized anti-slavery conventions and speaking programs throughout New England.\nSometime after Joshua Easton was sent as a delegate to the New England society in 1833, African Americans were granted full membership in the organization.\n\n\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society\nIn 1833, Garrison and Arthur Tappan expanded this society and formed the American Anti-Slavery Society. The American Anti-Slavery Society, however, attempted to create state-based organizations under the umbrella of its executive committee. At first the New England Anti-Slavery Society and the American Society worked together, with the New England Society becoming an auxiliary in 1834.\n\n\nMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society\nIn 1838, however, the New England Society gave up its regional jurisdiction and reorganized into the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. The society took a proactive role in advocating for legislation against new slave codes and laws, particularly within Massachusetts, including publishing treatises related to proposals to outlaw or penalize those participating in the activities and formation of societies relating to abolition and anti-slavery activities.\nAnnual meetings were held in Boston at Julien Hall, Melodeon, and Tremont Temple. Officers included James N. Buffum, Francis Jackson, Wendell Phillips, Parker Pillsbury, and Edmund Quincy. Lecturers affiliated with the society included   William Wells Brown, Frederick Douglass, Samuel Joseph May, and Charles Lenox Remond. Joel W.

    "text": "The Oerlikon GDF or Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon is a towed anti-aircraft gun made by Oerlikon Contraves (renamed as Rheinmetall Air Defence AG following the merger with Rheinmetall in 2009). The system was originally designated 2 ZLA/353 ML but this was later changed to GDF-001. It was developed in the late 1950s and is used by around 30 countries.\n\n\nDesign and development\nThe system uses twin autocannons, firing 35×228mm NATO-standard ammunition. It was originally designated 353 MK and is now designated as the KD series. The same KD series 35mm cannons are used in the Leopard 1 based Gepard and Type 74 tank based Type 87 SPAAG and Marksman self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAG). The system could be paired with the off-gun (remote) Super Fledermaus fire control radar, which in the late 1970s was upgraded to the Skyguard system. The weapons were aimed either directly, by way of an advanced sighting system, or automatically, by locking onto the target with radar. Early models carried 112 rounds ready to fire, and an additional 126 stored on the chassis as reloads. Later versions with automated reloading carry 280 rounds total. A typical engagement burst is 28 rounds.\nIn 1980 an upgraded model, the GDF-002 was produced, which featured an improved sight, and the ability to be directed by an off-gun digital control system. A few years later a third version of the system was being produced, the GDF-003, which was broadly similar to the GDF-002, but included some enhancements like self-lubricating weapons and integrated protective covers.\nA self-propelled concept, the GDF-001 Escorter 35 existed.\nIn 1985 a further upgraded model was produced, the GDF-005, which was introduced, featuring the Gunking 3D computer-controlled sight with an integrated laser range-finder and digital control system. The GDF-005 also introduced an automated ammunition-handling system, which eliminated the need for the two reloaders, reducing the crew from 3 to 1.\nThe guns are usually transported by a 5-tonne 6×6 truck.\n\n\nKD series cannons\n\nDevelopment of the KD series cannon began around 1952 soon after Oerlikon calculated that 35 mm was the optimum calibre for an anti-aircraft gun. The KD series cannons were a design adapted from the post-war 20 mm KAA 204 Gk cannon. Several designs were developed, including a water-cooled design, designated Mk 352, which was tested by the U.S. Navy.\nThe final design was the Mk 323, which was developed in two variants, a belt-fed version the KDA, and a linkless version the KDC, fed by seven-round clips. Both designs are gas-operated, with a propped-lock locking system.\n\n\nSuper Fledermaus\n\nThe Super Fledermaus fire control system was designed and built by the then separate Contraves company. It consists of a four-wheeled towed trailer with an E/F band pulse doppler search radar with a range of around 15 km and a pulse doppler tracking radar operating in the J band, also with a range of 15 km. It was also used as the fire control system on the Gepard SPAAG.\n\n\nSkyguard\n\nThe Skyguard is a fire control system developed by Contraves and introduced in the 1977 to replace the Contraves Super Fledermaus system in the Swiss Air Force. It is produced by Oerlikon-Buehrle (now Rheinmetall Air Defence). Updated versions were fielded in 1975, 1995 and 2010. It's an all weather low to medium altitude (up to 3,000 m) air defence system with the maximum effective distance of 4,000 m.\nThe Skyguard fire control system performs air surveillance, target acquisition, calculation of the derivative-action values and control of the twin 35 mm guns or missiles. Pulse doppler search radar, pulse doppler tracking radar and co-axial television camera are mounted on the roof of the towed trailer. Skyguard is operated by four people. The radar is deployed quickly through the use of hydraulic systems for antenna erection. The trailer houses the crew of two and a small power generator.\nA typical fire unit consists of two twin 35 mm gun platforms with a single Skyguard fire control radar. Skyguard systems can also incorporate an optional SAM module based on the GDF's mount and radar system but with the guns replaced by four missile canisters. It can be armed with either AIM-7 Sparrow, RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or Aspide missiles.\nThe Skyguard radar system was used in the German Air Force for surveillance of low-altitude flight zones. In Taiwanese service, the system includes the Sky Sentinel radar, two 35 mm Oerlikon twin gun and an AIM-7 Sparrow Missile Launcher. Greek service the Skyguard system with RIM-7M is known as the VELOS. In Spanish service, Toledo is a Skyguard system with Aspide launchers where the fire control unit has been replaced with Skydor from Navantia.\nA total of 468 systems were built through 1994 and major users were Italy (84 systems), Spain (64 systems) and Pakistan (32 systems).\n\n\nAmmunition\n\nDesignation:\nHEI: High Explosive Incendiary (-T—Tracer)\nSAPHEI: Semi-Armour Piercing High Explosive Incendiary\nFAPDS: Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot\nTP: Target Practice (-T—Tracer)\nAHEAD: Anti-missile rounds, that fire \"152 heavy tungsten metal sub-projectiles\".\nATOM 35mm: Aselsan ATOM 35mm is a airburst round, that fire tungsten metal pellets as sub-projectiles.

To date, its exterior significantly changed, although the installation has retained the design of the original serial versions of the systems. Unlike other variants, this one relies on an internal power source. The GDF-009 model is based on a four-wheeled carriage, and is raised off the ground by three stabilisers when deployed in the firing position. It also features an automatic levelling system that can compensate for a maximum tilt angle of up to 7°. Mounted on the forward part of the carriage is the integrated battery, which functions as the gun's power supply unit and can be recharged from an external source if required.\nAHEAD: An upgrade for the GDF series guns built around a special projectile which explodes at a pre-calculated point in front of the target, sending a cone of 152 tungsten sub-projectiles at the target. Used by Canada, Pakistan, Greece, Oman, Spain, Taiwan, and Chile (unconfirmed).\nMKE GDF-003B: Turkish version of 35 mm GDF series. The gun of the system manufactured under licence by Turkish company Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation.\nMKE/Aselsan GDF-003B Modernized: MKE GDF-003B system modernized by another Turkish company Aselsan.  MKE made 35mm guns linked with an Aselsan made Fire and Command Control System. The system has similarities with Skyguard system. The Fire and Command Control System consists of Aselsan made 3D search radar, fire control radar, electro-optical (E/O) sensors and other electronics. Each weapons system can fire up to 1100 rpm (2 x 550rpm) to an effective range of 4 km. The upgradation enables the system to fire Aselsan ATOM 35mm airburst round which explodes at a pre-calculated point in front of the target, sending a cone of tungsten pellets at the target. The gun can also fire HEI and TP-T ammunitions. The concept of ATOM 35mm air burst ammunition came up in order to increase the efficiency of the gun systems against modern targets including fixed/rotary wing aircraft, cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles and other precision guided weapons. Aselsan Fire and Command Control system can also incorporate a low altitude air defense SAM along with 35 mm gun platform. Like the GDF-009 each gun platform equipped with the integrated battery, which functions as the gun's power supply unit and can be recharged from an external source if required.\nKORKUT: Turkish Self-propelled (SPAAG) variant designed by Aselsan. The system developed from modernized GDF-003B and based around the amphibious capable FNSS ACV-30. KDC-02 cannon of the system manufactured under licence by MKE.

GDF-002 guns now in storage and in a few military museums in the UK.\n\n\nCombat History\n\n1982: The system was widely used by the Armed Forces of Argentina during the Falklands War. The Skyguard radar system was employed by the 601 Antiaircraft Artillery Group and the Super Fledermaus by the 1st Group of the Argentine Air Force. This force shot down a Sea Harrier (XZ450) on 4 May 1982 at Goose Green, prompting British aircraft to operate beyond its range. An RAF Harrier (XZ988) was also shot down on 27 May and another,  (XW919) was damaged by 35 mm splinters over Sapper Hill on 12 June. \nThe system was used in a direct fire role during the Battle of Goose Green, killing two, wounding 11. and at Wireless Ridge shortly before the Argentine surrender.\nThe weapons were involved in two friendly fire incidents. On 1 May 1982, a GADA 601 battery shot down a combat-damaged Argentine Mirage III (I-019) near Stanley Airfield, killing its pilot, Captain Gustavo Cuerva.  The second occurred on 24 May 1982, when a Douglas A-4 Skyhawk (C-244) entered a restricted zone over Goose Green and was shot down, killing the pilot, Lieutenant Gavazzi.\nSkyguard radars were targeted by the RAF during Operation Black Buck on 31 May and 3 June. One radar was destroyed by Shrike missile shrapnel, killing four operators.\nBritish forces captured 15 guns and six Skyguard units, later refurbished in \"Operation Skyguard\". BMARC restored the GDF-002 AA guns at Faldingworth, while Rheinmetall/Oerlikon refurbished four radars in Germany. Twelve guns and four radars entered RAF service with 1339 Wing Royal Auxiliary Air Force, operated by 2729 and 2890 Squadrons at RAF Waddington. Two more Skyguard units were procured. Budget cuts and maintenance costs eventually forced their retirement.  One gun is on display at the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre, RAF Honington. The Skyguard system is still used by the RAF to monitor low-level flights.\n12 October 2007: A malfunctioning GDF-005 killed nine and injured 14 SANDF soldiers during an exercise at Lohatla, Northern Cape. The gun jammed, then entered automatic mode and fired a burst while traversing uncontrollably. A 2008 SANDF report blamed a sheared spring pin, while others cited poor training.\nMay 2025: The Pakistan Army Air Defence Corps deployed their Oerlikon GDF-002s during the 2025 India–Pakistan conflict. India launched numerous IAI Harop drones, with Pakistani defences reportedly downing 77.\n\n\nSee also\nList of artillery\nList of anti-aircraft artillery\nList of artillery of Germany\nList of artillery of Switzerland\nRelated development\nOerlikon Millennium 35 mm Naval Revolver Gun System\nType 09 SPAAA\n\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Oerlikon 35mm at Wikimedia Commons\nRheinmetall page on 35 mm ammo\nOfficial website\nOerlikon Skyguard III Air Defense System on armyrecognition.com",

    "title": "Uesugi clan",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2296843",
    "text": "The Uesugi clan (上杉氏, Uesugi-shi, historically also Uyesugi) is a Japanese samurai clan which was at its peak one of the most powerful during the Muromachi and Sengoku periods (14th to 17th centuries). At its height, the clan had three main branches: the Ōgigayatsu, Inukake, and Yamanouchi. Its most well-known member is the warlord Uesugi Kenshin (1530–1578).\nDuring the Edo period, the Uesugi were a tozama or outsider clan, in contrast with the fudai or insider daimyō clans which had been hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan.\n\n\nHistory\nThe clan claims descent from the Fujiwara clan, specifically Fujiwara no Yoshikado, who was a daijō-daijin during the 9th century.\nKanjūji Shigefusa was a 13th generation descendant of the clan's great progenitor and the originator of the clan's name. Near the end of the 13th century, he received the Uesugi domain in Tango Province and adopted the name \"Uesugi\" after arriving and establishing himself there.\n\n\nMuromachi period\nThroughout the Muromachi period, members of the clan were appointed as shugo (provincial governors) and would also regularly hold sway over the post Kantō Kanrei (shogun's deputy in Kantō).\nThrough their dominance of this position, the clan gained a large amount of power in the Kantō region. In 1449, Kantō Kanrei Ashikaga Shigeuji killed his Uesugi deputy in order to check the family's power. However, Uesugi forces rose up throughout the region and drove out Shigeuji. After ousting the Kanrei, they asked the shogunate in Kyoto for a different deputy to be placed in power.\nThe Uesugi's deposition of Shigeuji left them as the predominant power in the Kantō region, and the clan was able to grow rapidly. They eventually split into their three main branches, which were named after their traditional homelands. The Ōgigayatsu controlled Kawagoe Castle, the Yamanouchi were centered in Hirai, and the Inukake held a castle in the region as well. Each of these branch families can trace their lineage to Uesugi Kiyoko, mother of Ashikaga Takauji, the founder of the Ashikaga shogunate.\nThese three branches would commence infighting for dominance within the clan and the Kantō region almost as soon as the split occurred. This conflict would continue for roughly twenty-five years until around the end of the Ōnin War in 1477, which brought the end of the Ashikaga shogunate. Though the Ōgigayatsu and Yamanouchi branches both survived this conflict, the Inukake did not.\n\n\nSengoku period\nTraditionally, the Ōgigayatsu branch allied themselves with the Ōta clan, while the Yamanouchi were aligned with the Nagao clan. While the Ōgigayatsu were less numerous than the Yamanouchi, they held on to power due to Ōta Dōkan's construction of the Edo Castle in the 1450s. At the same time as the Uesugi branches continued to compete for power with themselves, the Hōjō clan began to gain power in the lower area of the Kantō region. The first head of this rising clan, Hōjō Sōun, allied himself with Nagao Tamekage, Deputy Constable of Kamakura, and would go on to become one of their strongest rivals.\nThis rapid expansion of a rival clan forced the two rival branches of the Uesugi to become allies. In 1537, the city of Kawagoe fell to the Hōjō clan. By 1545, the united Uesugi launched a campaign to regain their power in the region and retake lost possessions. However, the Ōgigayatsu branch would ultimately come to an end with the death of Uesugi Tomosada during a failed siege of Kawagoe castle later that year.\n\nNear the end of the Sengoku period, the Uesugi would undergo major changes in their leadership. Uesugi Norimasa, holder of a castle which had fallen in 1551 to the Hōjō, took up arms with his retainer Nagao Kagetora. Kagetora would go on to change his name to Uesugi Kenshin after campaigning against the Hōjō in Sagami Province. Kenshin would later become one of Sengoku's most prominent generals, continuing to wage war against the Hōjō for control of the Kantō region. Kenshin's adopted son Uesugi Kagekatsu eventually became head of the Uesugi clan. However, his support of Ishida Mitsunari during the battle of Sekigahara would result in a devastating blow to the power of the Uesugi, as Mitsunari's forces were crushed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his supporters.\n\n\nEdo period\nDuring the Edo period, the Uesugi were given the domain of Yonezawa, a Tozama daimyō worth 300,000 koku. The domain, located far from the capital in the Tōhoku region, was considered fairly representative of what might be given to daimyō considered \"outsiders\" by the shogunate. Yonezawa had minimal direct control from the shogunate, but was not urbanized and was largely an agricultural domain.\nDespite agricultural advances and generally high growth in the 17th century, Yonezawa, like most parts of the country, experienced a considerable drop in growth after 1700. The official koku revenue of the Uesugi daimyō was cut in half in 1664, but the family maintained its same expensive lifestyle as before. After Yonezawa entered debt and experienced famine in the 1750s, the current daimyō Uesugi Shigesada considered giving the territory back to the shogunate. Instead, he allowed his adopted son Uesugi Harunori to take over as daimyō. Through agricultural and moral reforms, as well as other strict policies, Harunori was able to restore a measure of prosperity to the domain. After his death, the shogunate officially praised Yonezawa as an example of good governance.\n\n\nBakumatsu\nWhen the Uesugi clan faced the threat of abolition due to the sudden death of Tsunakatsu (1639–64), they were saved by Hoshina Masayuki. In the Boshin War (1868–69), to repay this favor, the Yonezawa Domain rose to assist the Aizu Domain in its time of crisis. Alongside the Sendai Domain (Date clan), they led the Northern Alliance (Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei) and fought against the new government forces, but after repeated defeats, they eventually surrendered.\n\n\nMeiji period and modern era\n\nThe Meiji Restoration in 1868 brought the abolition of the han system, that is, the end of the domains, the feudal lords, and the samurai class. During this period, the head of the clan was Uesugi Mochinori. While the han system ended, the Uesugi clan survives to this day. Its present head, Uesugi Kuninori (born 1942), is a professor at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Ministry of Education.\n\n\nCrests and banners\nThe clan crest of the Uesugi was two flying sparrows in bamboo.\nUesugi Kenshin had several personal standards: the first character in Bishamonten (毘, bi), a flag of divine appointment, an open fan horse insignia, and the suspended and chaotically written dragon character (龍).\n\n\nNotable members and retainers\n\n\nMembers\n\n\nRetainers\n\n\nCastles\n\nKasugayama Castle\nTochio Castle: Honjō Saneyori\nSakado Castle: Nagao Masakage\nKitajō Castle: Kitajō Takahiro\nYoita Castle: Naoe Kanetsugu\nMoto-Yoita Castle: Naoe Kanetsugu\nNechi Castle: Murakami Yoshikiyo\nAkada castle: Saito Tomonobu\nMasagata Castle: Amakasu Kagemochi\nJōjō Castle: Jōjō Masashige\nKakizaki Castle: Kakizaki Kageie\nYasuda Castle: Yasuda Nagahide\n\n\nSee also\nJapanese cryptology from the 1500s to Meiji\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nAppert, Georges and H.

If passed, it would have amended the Nebraska Constitution to establish a right to abortion until fetal viability. It and Initiative 434 were mutually exclusive; the one with more votes in favor would become law in the event both amendments passed.\nInitiative 439 failed after 51% of Nebraskan voters voted against it, with only 49% voting in favor. On the contrary, Initiative 434, an amendment that restricts abortion after the first trimester, passed with just under 55% voting in favor.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nLegislative history\nIn April 2023, LB626, the Nebraska Heartbeat Act, failed 32–15, falling one vote short of the 33 votes needed to end a filibuster. If enacted, the bill would have outlawed abortion at six weeks with exceptions for rape, incest, and medical emergency.\nThen, after LB626 failed in April, after Ben Hansen voted against LB626, he amended LB574 to add abortion. In May 2023, LB574, the Adopt the Let Them Grow Act, approved 33–15, was one vote above of the 33 votes needed to end a filibuster. Nebraska enacted a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the pregnant person. This law replaced the previous 20-week abortion ban.\n\n\nNebraska Heartbeat Act vote\nThe bill was failed by the Senate on April 27 by a 32–15–2 vote.\nSenators Justin Wayne and Ben Hansen did not vote. Later, Ben Hansen modified his vote to yea.\n\n\nAdopt the Let Them Grow Act vote\nThe bill was approved by the Senate on May 19 by a 33–15–1 vote.\nSenator Justin Wayne did not vote.\n\n\nAftermath\nA November 2022 Hart Research poll found that 59% of Nebraskans opposed further abortion restrictions, with 48% strongly opposed, while only 36% supported additional bans, revealing increased support for abortion rights across both rural and urban areas and all congressional districts compared to earlier polling.\nIn response to this new restriction, citizens began a petition to place a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot that would protect abortion rights in Nebraska.\n\n\nBallot measure\nThe proposed amendment would add the following text to Article I of the Nebraska Constitution:\n\nAll persons shall have a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions. Fetal viability means the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient's treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus' sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.\n\n\nPolling\n\n\nResults\n\n\nBy congressional district\nDespite losing the state, \"Yes\" won two of three congressional districts, which both elected Republicans.\n\n\nSee also\n2024 United States ballot measures\nAbortion in Nebraska\nInitiatives and referendums in the United States\n\n\nOther abortion referendums\n2024 Nebraska Initiative 434\n2022 Kansas abortion referendum\n2022 California Proposition 1\n2022 Michigan Proposal 3\n2022 Vermont Proposal 5\n2024 Arizona Proposition 139\n2024 Colorado Amendment 79\n2024 Florida Amendment 4\n2024 Maryland Question 1\n2024 Missouri Amendment 3\n2024 Montana Initiative 128\n2024 Nevada Question 6\n2024 New York Proposal 1\n2024 South Dakota Amendment G\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n2024 Nebraska Initiative 439 at Ballotpedia",

    "text": "Metskhal (Ingush: Мецхал, romanized: Metskhal) is an abandoned aul in the Dzheyrakhsky District of Ingushetia. It is part of the rural settlement of Lyazhgi (administrative center rural settlement).\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name was most likely based on the Ingush word \"metskhalg\", meaning \"swift\", which was revered by the Ingush. Metskhal may also have a connection to the name of the ancient Georgian capital, Mtskheta.\n\n\nGeography\nMetskhal is located northeast of the village of Falkhan, on the spur of Mount Myat-Loam.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOn January 8, 1811, the foremen of 13 (Fyappin) villages, including Metskhal, signed an act of oath to the Empire Russian Empire. However, it is worth noting that even after these oaths by individual Ingush societies or clans, the nature of Russian–Ingush relations remained largely unchanged. In fact, both sides regarded these oaths as the conclusion of union treaties.\nAccording to the List of Populated Areas of the Military-Ossetian Okrug from 1859, Metskhal had 13 households and was part of the Military-Ossetian Okrug within the Kistin society.\nIn Metskhal there were once separate but closely interconnected tower castle complexes belonging to the Tochievs, Kotievs, Dzhabagievs, and Kusievs. Some scholars argue that this tower complex functioned as the administrative, cultural, and economic centre of the late medieval Fyappin/Metskhalin society (in the 19th century).\nMetalworking was highly developed among the Ingush from ancient times. Local artisans skilfully combined various metalworking techniques, including graining, blackening, gilding, and inlay with multicoloured inserts. The most renowned jewellery-making centres among the Ingush included Metskhal and others.\nChristianity occupied a significant place in the religious history of the region. It first reached the Ingush from Georgia (beginning from the 12th–13th centuries and again in the 17th century), and later from Russia (18th–19th centuries). Early Christian stone-box burials from this period were found near Metskhal and other villages.\nThe Metskhal tower complex was a large settlement consisting of two fortified castle complexes, including two battle towers. One of the battle towers had a flat roof and was clearly visible. Defensive walls and residential towers remained intact until 1944, when, following the deportation of Chechens and Ingush, the entire complex was mined and destroyed.\n\nAccording to the stories passed down by the abreks (outlaws):The Metskhal Tower was one of the largest. All attempts to destroy it ended in failure, and then the Soviet troops decided to fill the entire first floor with explosives. When the explosion was heard, nothing happened to it for several seconds, but a strong crack was heard. The tower was so strong that even with such a filling it was not torn to pieces, but it took off into the sky like a rocket, flew several meters high while being intact and fell on the ground and crashed!\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nМальсагов, З.

The third was a motor ship that was built in 1950 and scrapped in 1971.\n\n\nBuilding\nIn 1879 William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton built for BI Sirdhana and Scindia, a pair of sister ships. In 1883 A. & J. Inglis of Glasgow built a second pair of ships for BI, Secundra and Sirsa, to the same design.\nSirsa was the last of the four to be built. Inglis built her at Pointhouse as yard number 177. She was launched on 19 October 1883 and completed that December. Her registered length was 310.0 ft (94.5 m), her beam was 39.2 ft (11.9 m) and her depth was 25.0 ft (7.6 m). Her tonnages were 2,351 GRT and 1,691 NRT. She had berths for 48 passengers.\nSirsa had a single screw, driven by a two-cylinder compound engine. It was rated at 180 NHP, and gave her a speed of 10 knots (19 km/h). She also had three masts for sailing, and was rigged as a barquentine.\nBI registered the ship in Glasgow. Her UK official number 87726 was and her code letters were JCGS.\n\n\nCareer\nSirsa's maiden voyage was to Brisbane, leaving Britain on 31 December 1883. Thereafter she worked coastal routes around India.\nAll BI ships were designed to be converted into troop ships, by putting troop accommodation in the holds. In the Second Boer War the UK Government chartered at least 37 BI ships for war service. On 20 September 1899 in Bombay she embarked part of the Second Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders. She reached Durban on 9 October. She also made a trooping voyage in 1900.\nSirsa was laid up in 1906.

It was released through AWGE and Interscope Records as the fifteenth track from Carti's third studio album, Music, on March 14, 2025. The song was written by Playboi Carti and Kendrick Lamar, alongside producer Cardo.\n\n\nComposition\n\nThe song features a verse from Lamar who name-drops Slovenian basketball player Luka Dončić and makes pointed remarks toward rapper ASAP Relli regarding his recent assault case involving ASAP Rocky. Lamar additionally refers to both Playboi Carti and Cardo, the producer of the song, as his \"evil twin\", to each one of them respectively. Some, such as DJ Akademiks, have suggested that Lamar's lyrics on \"Good Credit\", and his other two features, \"Mojo Jojo\" and \"Backd00r\", make subtle jabs at Canadian rapper Drake after their feud last year, he also claimed Lamar's involvement in the album's creative direction as he claims the rapper started to work together with Playboi Carti since October–November of 2024.\nWith streaming platforms lacking production credits for many songs on Music, some have speculated that Kanye West participated in the production of \"Good Credit\" due to its specific sample usage. However, such rumors have been dispelled. After the release of Music, West tweeted his disapproval over Lamar's inclusion on the album, like on songs like \"Backd00r\".\n\n\nCritical reception\nBillboard ranked the song at first place in a list of the best guest features on Playboi Carti's Music, lauding Lamar's \"razor-sharp wit and precision, as he taunts A$AP Relli and possibly rapper Drake while dissecting fame, wealth and power. He switches flows effortlessly, all while Carti’s high-energy charisma makes the Compton rapper’s controlled delivery pack that much more of a punch.\" Billboard also called it the fourth best song in Music, lauding the strength of the collaboration between Playboi Carti and Lamar.\n\n\nLive performances\nLamar included the song for his set list during his concerts of the co-headlining Grand National Tour (2025) with SZA, he brought out Playboi Carti to perform \"Good Credit\" together during the concert at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on 29 April 2025.\nOn October 14 2025, Carti and Lamar performed the song during the Los Angeles, California concert at the Crypto.com Arena of Carti's Antagonist Tour (2025), as well as bringing out ASAP Rocky and Fakemink.\n\n\nPersonnel\nCredits and personnel adapted from Tidal.\nMusicians\n\nJordan Carter – vocals\nKendrick Lamar – vocals\nRonald LaTour, Jr. – production\nTechnical\n\nGlenn Schick  – mastering\nJonathan Turner – mixing\nMarcus Fritz – mixing, recording\nRay Charles Brown Jr. – recording\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "All American Racers is an American-licensed auto racing team and constructor based in Santa Ana, California. Founded by Dan Gurney and Carroll Shelby in 1964, All American Racers initially participated in American sports car and Champ Car races as well as international Formula One events with cars named Eagle.  The Formula One team, based in the United Kingdom and using British-built Weslake engines was named Anglo American Racers.  Under team manager Bill Dunne they set up shop in Rye, East Sussex. The team were adjacent to Harry Weslake's engine development plant and half a mile from Elva cars. They participated in 25 Grands Prix, entering a total of 34 cars.\nThe first Eagles were created after AAR entered a Goodyear-backed Lotus 38 in the 1965 Indianapolis 500 and Gurney hired former Lotus designer Len Terry to develop their own car for 1966.  The resulting Ford-powered Eagle T2G was codeveloped with the Eagle T1G for Formula 1.  After exiting Formula One in 1968 and concentrating on Champ Car, Eagle turned to sports car racing in the 1980s, partnering with Toyota to develop the Celica and later sports prototypes for the IMSA GT Championship.\nThe company built the Ben Bowlby-designed DeltaWing that was run by Highcroft Racing at the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\n\nFormula 1\n\nIn order to run the Formula 1 operations, Gurney established the Anglo American Racers team, based in Rye, East Sussex, UK, though the cars were built in Santa Ana, California, USA by the All American Racers team. The Eagle T1G car, powered by an obsolete Coventry Climax engine, debuted at the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix and scored its first points with a fifth place three weeks later at the French Grand Prix. For the 1967 season Richie Ginther was signed as a second driver. The Climax engine was replaced by a new 3-liter Weslake V12 engine designed by Aubrey Woods and built in Great Britain by Weslake.\nAt the 1967 Belgian Grand Prix Gurney achieved the first \"all-American\" victory in a Grand Prix since Jimmy Murphy´s triumph with Duesenberg at the 1921 French Grand Prix. Excluding the Indianapolis 500, this is the only win for a USA-built car as well as one of only two wins of an American-licensed constructor in Formula One.\nThe Eagle-Weslake was a beautiful and efficient car, one example of which was constructed in titanium and exotic alloys. More than this, the Eagle was designed to make the tall Gurney fit comfortably at the wheel. Their efforts produced a V12 that was smooth and powerful. At Monza, an insight into the future of engine design was seen for the first time. The engine had four valves per cylinder at a narrow included angle (thirty degrees) that allowed a single cover to enclose both the close-spaced camshafts on each bank. The sixty-degree-vee layout had a larger bore than stroke (72.8 X 60mm).  Gurney's program ran out of money in 1968 and by the end of the year he returned to the United States to concentrate his efforts on the more successful Indycar program, in which Bobby Unser had won the Indianapolis 500 and the 1968 Indycar Championship. A non-works version briefly appeared with privateer Al Pease in the 1969 Canadian Grand Prix, but Pease became noticed for all the wrong reasons and made history as the only F1 driver ever disqualified for being too slow.\n\n\nUSAC & CART Champ Car\nDuring the USAC years, the Eagle chassis was very successful in the late 1960s and 1970s. Eagles won 51 Champ Car races, including the 1968 and 1975 Indy 500's won by Bobby Unser and the 1973 race won by Gordon Johncock. During this two-decade period, Bobby Unser, who drove Eagle cars for most of his teams, joined AAR as the sole driver, winning the 1975 Indianapolis 500. Unser also claimed 22 wins and 52 podiums with Eagle cars. After Unser's departure from the team for Team Penske, All American Racers started to lose their edge in IndyCar competition. Mike Mosley won a few races for the team before being dismissed at the end of 1982. By 1984, AAR merged with Mike Curb's team to form Curb-All American Racers. After a two-year partnership with Curb, Gurney and Curb parted ways, and this marked the beginning of the end of AAR's time in IndyCar.\nThe All American Racers team was inactive in single-seaters from 1987 to 1995 and returned in 1996 again building their own chassis and using new Toyota engines. However, this new effort, a combination of new and untested equipment, did not prove to be successful, never winning a race and collecting only occasional top-tens. The team ceased active racing after the 1999 CART season.\n\n\nCART/USAC drivers\nAlex Barron (1998–1999)\nRaul Boesel (1999)\nGeoff Brabham (1981)\nMike Chandler (1982, 1984)\nKevin Cogan (1984–1985)\nJuan Manuel Fangio II (1996–1997)\nPete Halsmer (1984)\nP.

It was entered exclusively by Eagle and only for the 1996 season, because it was unsuccessful, even though it had 2 races in which it scored points, and a further 2 other races where it finished 1 place down from points. The drivers were Juan Manuel Fangio II and P. J. Jones. The Mk-V would be the first CART chassis developed by Eagle after being inactive after the 1986 CART Series. This new car, called the Mk-V would be a unique chassis, but would be structurally similar to the Reynard 94I. The CART would be almost completely untested before the season, and during the season would prove to be extremely bad in the corners.\n\n\nEagle 987\nThe Eagle 987 was the second to last chassis built by All American Racers. The car was raced only by Eagle, and was driven by Vincenzo Sospiri and Alex Barron. The car was entirely unsuccessful, and would be replaced by the Eagle 997 for the 1999 CART Championship.\n\n\nIMSA GT\nGurney's team was contracted by Toyota in 1983 to enter the IMSA GT Championship with specially-modified Toyota Celicas.\nIn 1988, the team moved up to the GTP category with two chassis – a modified Toyota 88C Group C car and a team-designed Eagle HF89 purpose-built for IMSA competition.\nAAR experienced its greatest success in GTP competition with the Eagle MkIII, introduced in 1991. Powered by a turbocharged 2.1-liter Toyota inline-4 developing up to 800 horsepower and generating 10,000 pounds of downforce at 200 mph, the MkIII won 21 of the 27 races in which it was entered – a record so dominant that it has been blamed for the collapse of the GTP series.\n\n\nTrans-Am\n\nAAR created a special Trans-Am Series version of the Plymouth Barracuda, running in the 1970 season with drivers Dan Gurney and Swede Savage.

She works on acute leukemia and used cytogenetics to optimise treatment protocols.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHarrison attended an all girls school, where she was encouraged to become a nurse or a teacher. Harrison went to work at GlaxoSmithKline, before returning to education and securing her A-Levels. She was appointed as a research technician at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research. She was encouraged to attend university, and studied zoology at the University of Manchester. She remained there for her postgraduate studies, and earned a PhD in cell biology in 1978. During her postgraduate degree Harrison became interested in cytogenetics. \n\n\nResearch and career\nIn the 1980s Harrison established the Oncology Cytogenetics Service at the Christie Hospital in Manchester. She subsequently held posts at the Royal Free Hospital and University of Southampton. In 2001 Harrison was awarded a £1.7 million grant to investigate the genetic causes of childhood leukaemia. She identified that possession of the Philadelphia chromosome can make it more likely that children will be diagnosed with leukaemia. She has continued to search for new measures of prognosis, and found that the level of minimal residual disease can be a reliable predictor of outcome. Her research has contributed to the increased survival rate (up to 90 %) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nHarrison works with scientists around the world to identify the genetic causes of leukaemia and treatment resistance. She has gone beyond whole genome sequencing to study the 5 – 10 % of the genome which is uncharted. Harrison has made several discoveries of abnormal genes, that can help in diagnosis and help doctors personalise healthcare. She collects data from acute leukaemia clinical trials, studying . She identified that a chromosome abnormality known as rob(15;21)c increases people's likelihood to develop leukaemia. For patients with this Robertsonian translocation, leukaemia is initiated by chromothripsis; an event which breaks two chromosomes and reconfigures them in a flawed manner. Harrison is investigating new treatments to target leukemia cells.\nSince 2008 Harrison has served as a Professor of Cytogenetics at Newcastle University.

    "text": "Dudleya albiflora, known by the common name white-flower liveforever, is a species of succulent perennial plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to the Baja California Peninsula. This species represents numerous populations with varying chromosome numbers scattered around the peninsula, but all share broad, common morphological traits such as white flowers and narrow leaves.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nMorphology\n\nThis species has many varying forms based on location. The first description, by Joseph Nelson Rose, refers to the type specimen of Dudleya albiflora collected at Magdalena Bay, in Baja California Sur. This plant is a rosette-forming perennial succulent, with plants clumping to form up to 25 or more rosettes. The leaves are narrow, strap-shaped to lanceolate, 1 to 1.5 cm broad, and 4 to 5 cm long, with a distinctive flattened but thick and fleshy shape. The leaves are not glaucous and become purplish in color towards the tips. The corolla is white. Chromosome number is 85 for the Magdalena Bay plants. Plants on Isla Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida east of La Paz have a chromosome number of 34 and narrower, white leaves.\n\nThe second description is based on Dudleya moranii, known commonly as the Moran dudleya, a species described in Miller's Landing, Baja California. This species was moved into a synonym for D. albiflora, but it has varying chromosome counts compared to the plants in the D. albiflora type locality. This plant is solitary when young, but eventually divides by twos into up to 8 rosettes, and has a caudex 2 in (5.1 cm) to 5 in (13 cm) long. The basal leaves spread evenly, with the lower ones decurrent. The leaves are linear-attenuate, and their tips are abruptly short-acuminate or cuspidate, with the leaves 8 to 10 cm long and 1.5 to 2 cm wide at the base. They are colored a light greenish-yellow, and have a light red coloration at the tips of the bases. The leaves are stiff, solid and brittle. Flowering stems emerge from the axils of maturing leaves. The sepals are glossy green and tipped with red. The corolla is a pure, opaque white, with the tips slightly spreading. Chromosome number is 51 for most mainland and Cedros Island plants, 68 for Isla Natividad and Punta San Pablo plants.\n\n\nTaxonomy\n\n\nTaxonomic history\nThe type specimen was collected by T.S. Brandegee in Magdalena Bay, and he brought it to the New York Botanical Garden, where it flowered in 1903. That same year, Joseph Nelson Rose described the species Dudleya albiflora during his work on North American Crassulaceae with Nathaniel Lord Britton. In 1911, Rose returned to collect the plant again at the type locality. In 1921, Ivan M. Johnston collected the plant while working with a scientific expedition sent by the California Academy of Sciences with the intent to explore the islands in the Gulf of California. Living specimens from that expedition first went to Washington, and from there, plants were sent to the New York Botanical Garden, where illustrations were made of plants in flower in 1923. \nThe type specimen of Dudleya moranii, which is representative of the more northerly plants, was collected by Mr. Howard H. Gates, who is also the namesake of Dudleya gatesii. The species Dudleya moranii was described by Donald A. Johansen, who named the plant after the then 16-year old Reid V. Moran, who he noted as a \"discriminating young collector... who has forwarded to the writer innumerable specimen plants of many species of Dudleya and related genera...\" D. moranii was synonymized into D. albiflora, but some writers, such as Paul Thomson, have argued that they deserve to remain separate.\nA population of plants with an affinity to D. albiflora exists on the western slopes of the Sierra de San Francisco.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nDudleya albiflora occurs from the desolate southern Baja California coast south to the islands of Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida off of La Paz. It occurs in a variety of widely separated coastal locations and some inland locations. It is present on Cedros Island and Isla Natividad in the Pacific. Plants with an affinity to this species are found far inland in the Sierra de San Francisco.\n\n\nReferences",

When launched, the engine produced 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp). Renault later introduced a higher-powered twin-turbocharged variant producing 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp).\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nR9M 130\nR9M 130PS was introduced in 2011.\nDeveloped within the framework of the Alliance, the newcomer's performance credentials were made similar to those of its predecessor, the 1.9 dCi 130 engine. This 1.6-litre power plant delivered peak power of 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) and torque of 320 N⋅m (236 lb⋅ft) available across a broad rev-band.\nThis new block came with a change in Renault's engine downsizing policy. More downsizing was to be obtained, thanks to the shortening of the stroke of the pistons and a redesign of the reciprocating parts. The cylinder's swept volume was reduced and thereby diminished the amount of fuel being burned during each cycle. Performance levels were maintained, however, by improving turbocharging efficiency.\nApplications:\n\n2011 - Renault Scénic\n2011 - Nissan Qashqai\n2012 - Renault Mégane\n2013 - Renault Fluence\n2014 - Mercedes Vito\n2014 - Mercedes C Class\n2015 - Renault Kadjar\n2016 - Renault Talisman\n\n\nR9M 160\nR9M 160 was launched in February 2011.

    "text": "Hillarys Boat Harbour is a marina and tourist precinct located in Hillarys, north of Perth, Western Australia, and on the Indian Ocean. The marina also contains two retail precincts, Sorrento Quay and Hillarys Boardwalk.\n\n\nHistory\nHillarys Boat Harbour was the first such major marina in the north metropolitan region of Perth. Construction of the new marina commenced in September 1985; protestors laid down in front of bulldozers in an attempt to halt early site works. Boat launching facilities were completed in October 1986 and boats started moving into pen moorings two months later, just before the start of the 1987 America's Cup Challenge Series. Developed by the Lombardo Group, Sorrento Quay commenced trading in December 1987, and the marina was officially opened in January 1988.\nIn 1989 receivers were appointed to sell the assets of the Lombardo Group, and Sorrento Quay was sold to the Japanese group Victoria Co. In 1995, an amusement park named The Great Escape opened on the eastern side of the harbour, adjacent to the beach. The complex included three water slides, trampolines, dry attractions and a mini-golf course called \"Wacky Putt\". In 1999, the Wyllie Group bought Sorrento Quay for $16 million from Victoria Co.\nIn late 2004, the Wyllie Group announced a $9 million plan, designed by Cox, Howlett and Bailey Woodland Architects, to expand the boat harbour's Sorrento Quay shopping precinct by expanding the northern side of the facility with 800 square metres (8,600 sq ft) of retail and dining space and a two-storey tavern of 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft). A 175-metre (574 ft) footbridge with a drawbridge, would cross the harbour from the new area to the northern parking area. The WA Planning Commission approved the now $12 million project in 2005 and the Wyllie Group lodged an application for a building licence in November of the same year.\nIn May 2006, the WA Department of Planning and Infrastructure committed $5 million to expand the area they managed at the boat harbour with boardwalks, upgrades to picnic areas, new barbecue facilities, toilets, improved lightning, trees, grass and shade structures with work to begin in August of that year. The new development cost $30 million when it was opened by MLA Rob Johnson on 13 December 2008. The new Breakwater Tavern had been fitted out at $7 million by the Reid family. A further 19 marine pens had been constructed along with a new Rottnest Island ferry terminal. Another stage was planned with the redevelopment of the old tavern and the adding of more shops and food and beverage facilities.\nIn June 2016, The Great Escape closed after its tenancy lease wasn't renewed, but briefly reopened with the dry attractions, trampolines and Wacky Putt operating in Summer 2016. The park was eventually demolished in November 2017 after standing idle for nine months. On 12 September 2018, after leaseholder Wyllie Group struck a deal with local family company, Pirate's Cove Adventure Golf, plans emerged of a complex in the former Great Escape site that would include two themed 18-hole golf courses, a double flowrider, a cafe, a small bar and a beach kiosk, with completion scheduled in March 2019. However the next month, the project was suddenly cancelled following negative publicity surrounding a shareholder of Pirate's Cove Adventure Golf and his previous business relationship with notorious child rapist William Goad.\n\n\nAttractions\nHillarys is also home to Aquarium of Western Australia (AQWA) which showcases the marine life and unique regions of Western Australia's 12,000-kilometre (7,500 mi) coastline. AQWA is open daily from 9 am to 4 pm. \nOther attractions in and around the harbour include helicopter flights, fishing charters and cruises. A ferry also departs from here to Rottnest Island daily.\n\n\nSee also\nLittle Island\n\n\nReferences",

She is co-inventor of the first artificial intervertebral disc, and from 1990 to 2012, she was chief physician of clinics in Berlin, Germany. She has a foundation named Spinefoundation.\n\n\nGymnastics career\nBüttner-Janz began training in gymnastics when she was five. Her first coach was her father, Guido Janz. Büttner-Janz moved to a sports school in Forst when she was 10, where she boarded during the week and visited her parents on weekends; she later said \"that was not good at this age\". She moved to a training center in Berlin in 1966. She trained under Klaus Helbeck, and her final coach was Jürgen Heritz.\nAt 14, she became the East German champion.\nIn 1967, at the age of 15, Büttner-Janz was nominated as East German Athlete of the Year after a silver medal on the uneven bars and a bronze medal on the vault at the European championship in Amsterdam. She went on to win the silver medal on the uneven bars and a bronze medal as part of the country's gymnastics team at the 1968 Summer Olympics.\nAt the 1970 world championships, she overcame Ludmilla Tourischeva on the uneven bars to win the gold medal. In a controversial finish, she delivered another gold medal-winning performance on the uneven bars, her best apparatus, at the 1972 Munich Olympics, defeating Olga Korbut; the audience protested her score for ten minutes. She also won the gold medal on the vault, a silver medal as part of the East German women's gymnastics team, another silver medal in the all-around competition behind Ludmilla Tourischeva and ahead of Tamara Lazakovich, and bronze on the balance beam.  \nShe was the most successful German athlete at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich and was afterwards recognized as GDR (German Democratic Republic) Sportswoman of the Year in 1972. After these successes, she announced her intention of ending her competitive career to turn to the study of medicine to become a physician.\nBüttner-Janz has an uneven bars element named after her, the Janz Salto, which she first performed in competition at the SV Dynamo Spartakiade in East Berlin, 1971.\n\n\nAcademic physician\n\nBüttner-Janz studied at the Humboldt University in East Berlin beginning in 1971, when she was still competing, and earned her degree in human medicine, with her thesis examining emergency medicine. Later, she conducted her clinical semester at the orthopedic hospital of the Charité and went on to specialize in orthopaedics. She obtained her postdoctoral lecture qualification (habilitation treatise) through her work on the development of the first artificial spinal disc, known as the Charité Disc. She developed the device together with her colleague Kurt Schellnack.\nIn 1990, Büttner-Janz moved from the Charité Berlin to the orthopedic clinic of Berlin-Hellersdorf, then in 2001 to the Vivantes clinic of Berlin-Friedrichshain. From 2008 to 2012, she was Chief Physician of trauma surgery and orthopaedics at the Vivantes clinic in Berlin-Kreuzberg.\nBüttner-Janz was often in conflict with other employees at the clinic, who felt she was authoritarian and disliked demands she made, such as not allowing patients from other departments to be moved through the orthopaedics ward, which she said was against regulations and unhygienic for her patients. In 2011, she entered a relationship with Dorothea Dreizehnter, a managing director at the clinic. Other chief physicians at the clinic accused her of using the relationship for unfair treatment, although no evidence for this was ever presented.\nIn March 2012, she was told that she was being put on leave of absence. When she contacted the supervisory board of the company, saying that she was dismissed from her position as Chief Physician due to her relationship with Dreizehnter, her superior banned her from the hospital and dismissed her immediately. Büttner-Janz filed a lawsuit over her dismissal and alleged discrimination due to her same-sex relationship; both sides agreed to a settlement, from which she received the amount of her annual salary and an unusually large settlement of €590,000, which her lawyer suggested was due to the groundless nature of her dismissal. Several of her colleagues resigned from the hospital as well.\nIn 2012, she began a foundation named Spinefoundation, which is focused on scientific research and public awareness of spinal issues.\nIn 2005, she became a professor of orthopaedics at the Charité-Unviversitätsmedizin Berlin. From 2008 to 2009 she was president of the Spine Arthroplasty Society (later renamed to International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery).\nFrom 2014 to 2016, she studied at the Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin and became Master of Business Administration (MBA) in general management.\n\n\nHonours\n\n1972 – awarded the title of Merited Master of Sport of the USSR.\n2003 – inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.\n\n\nCompetition History\n\n\nSee also\nList of top Olympic gymnastics medalists\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nKarin Janz at the International Gymnastics Federation\nKarin Janz at the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame \nKarin Janz at Olympics.com \nKarin Janz at Olympedia \nKarin Büttner-Janz (sportsfrauen.de) at archive.today (archived 21 March 2012) (in German)\nDrastic cuts to funding of Berlin Gymnastics Festival (gymmedia.com) at the Wayback Machine (archived 8 January 2012) (in German)",

    "text": "John A. Russo (born February 6, 1959) is a former American politician, city attorney, and city manager with municipal management experience in four cities in the state of California.\nRusso was a member of the Oakland City Council from 1994–2000, where he served as finance committee chair and became a leading advocate for fiscal accountability and government reform. In September 2000, he became the first elected city attorney of Oakland, California after a little-debated aspect of Jerry Brown's strong-mayor initiative, Measure X, changed the city attorney post from an appointed to an elected one.\nRusso served as the president of the League of California Cities from 2002–03, serving a total of nine years on the board.\nIn 2007, during his second term as city attorney, Russo ran unsuccessfully for the California Assembly 16th District seat in 2006. In June 2008, Russo was re-elected to a third term as city attorney, running unopposed.\nIn 2011 Russo was named the city manager for neighboring Alameda, California.\nIn 2015, Russo was named the city manager of Riverside, California. He served in that position for nearly three years, establishing practices of reform and accountability and increasing projects in arts and culture, including initiating the deal to bring the Cheech Marin Center for Art, Culture, and Industry to Riverside. According to the Press Enterprise, \"Russo, who has served as City Manager since 2015, has been behind initiatives like the Sunshine Ordinance to improve transparency in city government, a more robust budget process and a rotating system of audits of all city departments.\"\nIn 2018, the Irvine City Council voted unanimously to name Russo as the city manager for Irvine, California. In 2019, Russo was included on the Orange County Register list of 100 Top Influencers. Russo resigned in 2020 to devote more time to family.\n\n\nBackground\nJohn Russo was born and raised in the Italian immigrant Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, New York. His father, a construction worker and union vice president, and his mother, a dressmaker, moved to the United States from London in 1958 five months before he was born. Russo attended Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY. He graduated with honors in economics and political science from Yale University and earned his J.D. degree from New York University School of Law.\nAfter a two-year stint as a Legal Aid attorney in St. Louis, Missouri, Russo moved to Oakland in 1987. He served as president of Friends of Oakland Parks and Recreation, treasurer of the East Bay League of Conservation Voters, and pro bono attorney to several neighborhood associations and non-profits.\nIn June 1994, John was elected to the Oakland City Council, where he became the council's leading advocate for fiscal accountability and government reform. In his six years on the council, John implemented community policing, developed the first balanced budget in a generation, and working closely with the League of Woman Voters, authored Oakland's open government law called the \"sunshine\" ordinance.\nIn 2002, John served as president of the League of California Cities spearheading initiatives to protect local tax revenues from state fiscal mismanagement and amend California's Constitution to ensure public access to government records and decision-making. His ability to work 'across the aisle' earned him a seat on the Board of the National League of Cities, an organization which represents more than 18,000 towns and cities, in December 2003.\n\n\nNeighborhood Law Corps\nIn 2001, Russo founded the Neighborhood Law Corps, an organization to help address chronic urban problems. Law Corps attorneys, generally new law school graduates, focus on quality-of-life issues and tackle cases involving drug dealing and building-code violations. The Law Corps also led Oakland's crackdown on liquor stores considered a blight on the community because they were providing a haven for drug dealing and other nuisances. In 2006, the National League of Cities named Oakland as one of nine winners of its 2006 award for municipal excellence, and one of three Gold award winners honoring the work of the Neighborhood Law Corps.\n\n\nOpen Government Program\nAs city attorney, Russo created the Open Government Program. The program ensured that citizens of Oakland have full access to information about their city and that the business of city government would be conducted in the light of day. Three pieces of legislation were cited to support the intent of the Open Government Program:  The Ralph M. Brown Act (California Law, Government Code, Sections 54950 – 54962): The California Public Records Act (California Law, Government Code, Sections 6250 – 6277); the Oakland Sunshine Ordinance (Title 2, Chapter 2.20).\n\n\nRiders' settlement\nIn 2003, Russo's office negotiated the largest legal settlement in Oakland municipal history. Plaintiffs who claimed they were victimized by a group of rogue cops known as \"the Riders\" shared $10.5 million in damages. The settlement brought major changes to police department operations and dealings with the public. The case riveted the city as it was the largest case of police misconduct in Oakland in decades. Despite the settlement's hefty price tag, Russo said the cases could have cost the city tens of millions of dollars more had they gone to trial, pointing out that the victims had spent more than 25 years, combined, imprisoned on false charges. By comparison, Los Angeles spent $40 million to settle litigation stemming from the Rampart corruption scandal.\nThe payout went to 119 plaintiffs who filed federal civil rights lawsuits claiming four police officers kidnapped, beat and planted drugs on them during the summer of 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the Oakland Police Department either encouraged or turned a blind eye to the abuse. U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson approved the settlement in the civil cases after 18 months of negotiations.\n\nWe did not bury our heads in the sand. We acknowledged freely our faults, and we've worked arm in arm toward fixing the problem rather than hiding from or denying the problem,\" said City Attorney John Russo. \"A lot of the plaintiffs are people who have bad histories with the law,\" Russo said. But \"there are some people who did not have trouble with the law who got caught up in this kind of overzealous behavior. And even people who are career criminals are entitled to their constitutional rights.\"\nIn addition, he said, the settlement prevented the U.S. Justice Department from imposing changes on the police department through consent decree, as it has done in other cities facing police misconduct scandals such as Los Angeles. Russo said the changes will make it easier for police brass to identify problem officers and deal with them.\n\nAt the high point of their careers, the so-called \"Riders\" were considered the best and the brightest, veterans whom rookie police officers tried to emulate. Their specialty: bringing in reputed drug dealers in record numbers from the crime-plagued streets of West Oakland.\nThe alleged abuses came to light after a rookie officer, just 10 days on the job and fresh out of the police academy, resigned and reported his former co-workers' activities to the police department's internal affairs division.\n\n\nAnti-bias policy\nIn 2002, two city of Oakland employees had posted fliers in the workplace advertising the \"Good News Employee Association\", a group created to promote \"natural family, marriage, and family values.\" The flier also said, \"We believe the natural family is defined as a man and a woman, their children by birth or adoption, or the surviving remnant thereof.\"\nThe fliers were posted in response to a celebratory message sent from openly gay former City Council member Danny Wan to city staff on National Coming Out Day in 2002.\nOne flier was posted just outside the cubicle of a lesbian colleague. When she complained about the homophobic fliers, the city attorney's office conducted an investigation and concluded \"the fliers were causing a workplace disruption and were in violation of the city's anti-discrimination policy,\" according to Angela Padilla, one of the lawyers representing the city in the initial court case.\nThe plaintiffs stated in their deposition that gay and lesbian employees were like \"weeds\" in the workplace, and that their intention was \"to keep [the workplace] from spoiling, to keep it from rotting, to keep it from deteriorating.\"\nThe plaintiffs were invited to post different fliers without discriminatory language, but instead they elected to sue the city over violation of their free speech rights. The case went to court, and the bulk of the case was dismissed in March 2004, while the free speech issues were dismissed in July 2005.\nAccording to 9th Circuit Court Judge Richard Clifton, the flier presented homosexuality as something that hurt the \"integrity\" of the workplace, violating the city of Oakland's policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court, but the court declined to hear the appeal.\nThe case received national attention when Washington Post columnist George Will denounced the city of Oakland for infringing on the plaintiffs' free speech rights.\nIn his response to Will, printed in the San Francisco Chronicle, Russo reminded readers that the plaintiffs were deliberately attempting to exclude their LGBT co-workers. Russo pointed out that rather than being only a liberal issue, it was a conservative judge, a Bush appointee, who said, \"It's hard to avoid the inference, 'We lack ethics, we lack integrity because these people are here.'\"\n\n\nSeat belt sting\nIn 2007, Russo was caught in a law enforcement campaign to catch seat belt scofflaws. Russo was ticketed and the incident ended up in the local media.\nIn a San Francisco Chronicle interview, Russo acknowledged that he wasn't wearing his seat belt when he was pulled over by officers at about 5:30 p.m. on Piedmont Avenue in Oakland. He said he had been distracted as he left the popular Fentons Creamery with his twin 8-year-old sons in the back seat of his 2004 Honda Civic hybrid.\nIn response to the ticket, a tongue-in-cheek Public Service Announcement was produced with Russo, his twin sons, and a friend, to contribute to the national law enforcement PR campaign, \"Click it or Ticket\" which included a video posted to YouTube and an ad that appeared among other locations, the Oakland BART station.\n\n\nAwards\nIn 2006, the National League of Cities named Oakland as one of nine winners of its 2006 Award for Municipal Excellence, and one of three Gold award winners honoring the work of the Neighborhood Law Corps. In 2005 the program won the Grand Prize, Helen Putnam Award for Excellence from the National League of Cities.\nIn August 2005, John Russo was voted a Northern California Super Lawyer by his peers and the independent research of the Law & Politics Magazine.\nIn 2004, the League of California Cities gave John Russo the Champion of Local Democracy Award for his work to strengthen democracy at the local level. In addition, the California Minority Counsel Program (CMCP) awarded the Office of the City Attorney the John Essex and Guy Rounsaville In-House Diversity Counsel Award for demonstrating superior commitment to diversity; it was the first time a public agency had received the honor in the thirteen-year history of the program.\nIn 2003, California Lawyer Magazine named John Russo as Attorney of the Year for Government/Public Policy. The eighth annual CLAY (California Lawyer Attorneys of the Year) Awards for 2003 recognized City Attorney Russo for his advocacy and innovation in public law while saving taxpayer money.\n\nAs lead defense counsel for the city of Oakland, Russo settled a civil suit alleging widespread police misconduct for $10.8 million, only $2.2 million of which came from taxpayers, with the rest paid by excess insurers. Despite this payout, he managed to reduce city spending on lawyers and lawsuits by $3.5 million compared with the previous fiscal year. On the local level, Russo's innovative, privately funded Neighborhood Law Corps helped overcome blight by, among other things, entering an agreement with Union Pacific Railroad to clean up illegally dumped trash along railroad tracks, which will save the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in cleanup costs over the ten-year period of the agreement.\nThe award also recognized Russo for winning an appellate ruling upholding the city's anti-predatory lending ordinance and successfully petitioning California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi to investigate ZIP Code discrimination in auto insurance.\n\nThere are some achievements made by California lawyers that have such far-reaching impact that they cannot go unrecognized,\" said the magazine's editors. \"The lawyers selected as Attorneys of the Year for 2003 substantially influenced public policy or a particular industry, brought about a significant development in their field of practice or in law-firm management, or achieved a notable victory for a client or for the public in a difficult, high-stakes matter.\"\nIn the fall of 2003, John Russo received the California First Amendment Coalition's Beacon Award for leadership in promoting public access to government and going \"beyond the norm to assure government transparency.\"\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Testing of Luther Albright is the debut novel by MacKenzie Bezos (who in 2019 changed her name to MacKenzie Scott), published in 2005 by Fourth Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins.\n\n\nPlot\nLuther Albright is a civil engineer who designs dams in Sacramento, California. He lives with his wife, Liz, and teenage son, Elliott, in a house that he built. Luther is emotionally reserved with no friends, and the novel traces how this alienates him from his wife and child over the course of Elliott's coming of age.\nAt the beginning of the novel, an earthquake hits Sacramento while Luther and Elliott spend the summer remodelling the attic. Elliott is entering adolescence, and this project marks a symbolic shift in their relationship. Luther notices that he has started to grow facial hair, and gives Elliott the reins to build and install the plumbing for a new bathroom independently. Elliott starts to test Luther's emotional boundaries, beginning with haphazardly operating power tools.\nElliott chooses Luther's father as his subject for a biography he has to write at school. Throughout their projects, Elliott questions Luther about what his own father was like, and Luther routinely evades these questions. Luther interprets this as Elliott challenging him, and the questions continue throughout the novel.\nLuther leaves a shaving set by the sink for Elliott, and the next morning, Elliott comes downstairs completely bald. This shocks Luther and Liz, but they don't react. Around this time, Liz expresses that she worries what she and Luther will talk about once Elliott moves out, and that one day she might realize that she \"doesn't know that she doesn't know [Luther]\". At work, Luther is given a prestigious corner office, with rumors of a promotion. This frustrates Luther's workplace rival, Belsky.\nLuther and Liz are woken one night to the sound of a girl from Elliott's high school calling to him from their yard, and Elliott telling her to leave. Liz invites the girl in, and Luther convinces Elliott to come downstairs to talk to her. Luther and Elliott walk in to see the girl giving Liz a bolder, shorter haircut, and the parents leave the teenagers to talk. The girl eventually becomes Elliott's first girlfriend.\nAt Elliott's request, Luther brings him to work and introduces him to his colleagues. Luther watches as Elliott jokes around with Belsky about his bald head, and Belsky makes a dig about one of Luther's dams getting a routine inspection following the earthquake. Luther and Elliott go for a drink, and Elliott questions Luther about why he doesn't defend himself against Belsky's criticisms. Elliott then spends more and more time at Belsky's house after befriending his children. This bothers Luther, but he doesn’t interfere with it.\nThere is a sewage gas leak in the house, and Luther suspects the cause may be from the renovations Elliott did by himself that summer. He doesn't tell Elliott this at risk of offending him. Around this time, Luther wakes Liz up one night to suggest she enroll in training to become a counselor once Elliott moves out, something she has always wanted to do. Liz is insulted, and clarifies she was worried about them as a couple once Elliott leaves, not herself. She does, however, start volunteering at a crisis center, which results in her spending less and less time at home.\nMeanwhile, the media begin to cover Luther's dam's routine inspections. Luther receives a phone call from a journalist, whom he evades. Elliott continues to ask Luther questions about his father, specifically asking if there was ever a time his father scared him. Luther continues to avoid the question, but reflects on a time his father came home with a gun, and his estrangement from his father. Luther’s flashbacks interspersed throughout the novel reveal that over time his father’s behaviour became shiftier and that he tried to taunt Luther’s mother, not only by bringing home a gun but also by pretending he was having an affair.\nElliott visits Luther at work and asks him why he hasn't responded to the increasing media criticism about the dam. When Elliott leaves, the journalist calls again, and Luther impulsively tells the journalist that the department is only doing the inspection in order to get funding because there is little other work to do. The next day, Luther's boss threatens to relocate him to Fresno as punishment, but Luther resigns instead.\nLuther notices one day when the Belskys pick Elliott up that they have been teaching him how to drive. He surprises Elliott by buying him his first car. Luther continues to receive promising job offers, and turns all of them down, including one from a former colleague, Nathan, whose firm's projects often require overseas travel. Elliott tells Luther that he knows that Belsky got Luther the job offer with Nathan.\nWhen taking out the trash one night, Luther notices the classifieds section from a newspaper with several part-time jobs circled. When he eventually confronts Liz about it, she admits that she only interviewed with jobs just to see if she still qualified as being useful. Eventually, Luther returns to Nathan to ask if the job is still available. Luther mentions Belsky, but Nathan does not remember who Belsky is, revealing that Elliott had lied about Belsky getting him the job in order to provoke Luther.\nThe narrative, told from Luther's perspective decades later, reveals that Liz eventually dies of cancer. A couple of nights before her death, Luther tells her she is the most important person he knows.\nThen, back in the story's narrative time, Elliott reveals that he found Luther's father's gun, which Luther had been keeping in the house the entire time, but Luther doesn't elaborate. Later that day, Luther discovers that Elliott had been tampering with the pipes to cause the sewage gas leak all along. He confronts Elliott, the angriest he's ever been, and then returns downstairs to fix it. As they grow older, Elliott and his family visit Luther, now a widower, less and less, until they only see him once a year at Thanksgiving.\n\n\nReception\nThe book received a generally positive reception, although reviews also criticized the confusing and uncompelling narrator. The book was widely reviewed, garnering reviews from The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, New Orleans Review, The A.V. Club, Kirkus Reviews, The Independent, and The Seattle Times, among others. The book won a 2006 American Book Award.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBezos discusses her debut novel, Seattle Post-Intelligencer\nThe Testing of Luther Albright at Goodreads",

Much of his childhood is not known but at the age of eighteen, Artaldus entered the court of Duke Amadeus III, but after a year or so he left to become a priest.\n\n\nEarly religious life\nArtaldus entered the Carthusian house of Portes Charterhouse in modern-day Bénonces. There he was ordained a priest. He spent many years serving as a priest before being sent by the prior of the Grande Chartreuse to found a charterhouse near a valley in the Valromey, a place that was known as \"the cemetery\". Artaldus decided to take with him six fellow priests from the Portes Charterhouse to establish this new community. The community had to move when the newly built charterhouse buildings were ravaged by fire. Artaldus chose a fresh site on the Arvières River, and the Arvières Charterhouse was founded and dedicated to Our Lady, in 1132.\n\n\nAppointment as Bishop of Belley\n\nIn the years spent at Arvière, Artaldus gained considerable fame and a great reputation, like that of St. Bruno, his master. Similar to St. Bruno, Artaldus was called from his monastery, to accept the role of serving as a bishop. This was at the See of Belley. Artaldus, who was over eighty when called to the post, less than two years later he resigned and returned to Arvières.\n\n\nLater life and death\nIn his later years Artaldus was visited by Hugh of Lincoln, who had convinced King Henry II of England to become a benefactor of the charterhouse at Arvières. Artaldus who live the remainder of his days at Arvières, living until the age of 105, he died in 1206. His cultus was confirmed in 1834, by Pope Gregory XVI.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal) is a successor to the Erie Canal and other canals within New York. The 525-mile (845 km) system is composed of the Erie Canal, the Oswego Canal, the Cayuga–Seneca Canal, and the Champlain Canal. In 2014 the entire system was listed as a national historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2016 it was designated a National Historic Landmark.\nThe Erie Canal connects the Hudson River to Lake Erie; the Cayuga–Seneca Canal connects Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake to the Erie Canal; the Oswego Canal connects the Erie Canal to Lake Ontario; and the Champlain Canal connects the Hudson River to Lake Champlain.\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1903 New York State legislature authorized construction of the \"New York State Barge Canal\" as the \"improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\".\nIn 1905, construction of the Barge Canal began; it was completed in 1918, at a cost of $96.7 million. It opened to through traffic May 15, 1918.\nThe Barge Canal's new route took advantage of rivers (such as the Mohawk River, Oswego River, Seneca River, Genesee River and Clyde River) that the original Erie Canal builders had avoided, thus bypassing some major cities formerly on the route, such as Syracuse and Rochester.  However, particularly in western New York State, the canal system uses the same (enlarged) channel as the original Erie Canal. In 1924 the Barge Canal built the Gowanus Bay Terminal in Brooklyn to handle canal cargo.\n\nSince the 1970s, the state has ceased modernizing the system due to the shift to truck transport. The canal is preserved primarily for historical and recreational purposes. Today, very few commercial vessels use the canal; it is mainly used by private pleasure boats, although it also serves as a method of controlling floods. The last regularly scheduled commercial ship operating on the canal was the Day Peckinpaugh, which ceased operation in 1994.\nSince 1992, the Barge Canal is no longer known by that name. Individual canals in the New York State Canal System, formerly collectively known as \"the Barge Canal,\" are now referred to by their original names (Erie Canal, Oswego Canal, Cayuga–Seneca Canal, and Champlain Canal). Today, the system's canals are 12 feet (3.7 m) deep and 120 feet (37 m) wide, with 57 electrically operated locks, and can accommodate vessels up to 2,000 tons (1,800 metric tons).  The canal system is open for navigation generally from May 1 through November 15. Payment of a fee for a permit is required to traverse the locks and lift bridges with motorized craft.\nIn 2004, the New York State Canal Corporation reported a total of 122,034 recreational lockings on the canal, along with 8,514 tour boat lockings and 7,369 hire boat lockings, and a total of 12,182 tons of cargo valued at approximately $102 million was shipped on the canal system.\nIn 2012, the system's annual cargo volume reached 42,000 tons.\nTravel on the Canal's middle section (particularly in the Mohawk River valley) was severely hampered during destructive flooding in Upstate New York in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal system and its facilities was estimated to be at least $15 million.\nIn 2011, newly elected Governor Andrew Cuomo appointed Schenectady Mayor Brian Stratton as director of the Canal Corporation, which runs the Canal System.\nAt the end of August 2011 Tropical Storm Irene caused closure of almost the entire canal due to flooding.  At the beginning of September 2011, Tropical Storm Lee added more flooding to the system.  Damage to several locks was severe enough to close the canal from Lock 8 (Scotia) through Lock 17 (Little Falls) from late August. The canal was fully open for the start of the 2012 navigation season.\nOver 200,000 tons of cargo was expected for 2017, the largest shipping volume since 1993.\n\n\nFunding and maintenance\n\nThe New York State Canal Corporation is responsible for the oversight, administration and maintenance of the New York State Canal System. In 2012, the Canal Corp., then a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority, employed 529 people, consisting of 458 full-time employees and 78 seasonal workers. Its spending accounted for about 10 percent of the Thruway Authority's total $1.1 billion in annual spending.  In 2012, the Canal Corp.'s operating budget was $55.7 million and its capital budget was $51.4 million.\nAn August 2012 report by state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said the canal system \"contributed to the deterioration of the Authority's financial condition over the past decade\", with canal traffic dropping nearly one-third since the period immediately before the Thruway Authority assumed control.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the New York State Canal Corporation became a subsidiary of the New York Power Authority. The move was authorized in April 2016 through the state budget process. Its headquarters then moved from the Thruway Authority's offices to 30 S. Pearl Street, Albany, the New York Power Authority's regional offices.\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of canals in New York\nList of National Historic Landmarks in New York\nList of navigation authorities in the United States\nNational Register of Historic Places in New York\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nInformational and Boater's Guide to the New York State Canals\nNew York State Canal System\n10/3/1908;Construction of the New York State Barge canal\nHistoric American Engineering Record (HAER) No. NY-154, \"New York Barge Canal, Gowanus Bay Terminal Pier, East of bulkhead supporting Columbia Street, Brooklyn, Kings County, NY\", 29 photos, 39 data pages, 3 photo caption pages\nHAER No. NY-371, \"New York State Barge Canal, Lock E2, South of the intersection of Broad and Fifth streets, Waterford, Saratoga County, NY\", 1 photo, 1 photo caption page",

    "text": "The 2006 German Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 2006) was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 30 July 2006.\nThe 67-lap race was the twelfth round of the 2006 Formula One season.\nKimi Räikkönen took pole position, but it proved artificial, as McLaren had inadvertently not put enough fuel as intended in his car before qualifying. In the race, his early pitstop left him unable to challenge for the win. Michael Schumacher scored his 89th career win ahead of teammate Felipe Massa.\nThe race also saw the last appearance by 1997 champion Jacques Villeneuve, who blamed the split on the \"lack of assurances about his short-term future with BMW Sauber\". Robert Kubica was promoted to drive in all the remaining Grands Prix.\n\n\nBackground\nThe Grand Prix weekend got off to a controversial start when the mass damper system fitted by Renault was deemed legal by the FIA appointed stewards, despite the FIA banning the use of these devices. The FIA appealed against their own steward's decision and Renault withdrew the system after Friday practice to avoid further sanctions.\n\n\nDriver changes\nSuper Aguri's third driver Sakon Yamamoto replaced Franck Montagny to make his Formula One debut. Montagny took over the role of third driver from the Turkish Grand Prix on.\n\n\nPractice\nThree practice sessions were held before the Sunday race: two on Friday, both lasting 90 minutes, and one on Saturday for 60 minutes. The first session was led by Williams's Alexander Wurz, the second by BMW Sauber's third driver Robert Kubica and the third by Christian Klien at Red Bull Racing.\n\n\nFriday drivers\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2005 Constructors' Championship and Super Aguri were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\n\n\nQualifying\n\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 15 minutes, and cars that finished the session 17th position or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The second part of the qualifying session lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 16. The final part of the qualifying session ran for 20 minutes which determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which failed to make the final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions.\nKimi Räikkönen scored his eighth career pole position ahead of the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Felipe Massa.\n\nNotes\n^1  – Jarno Trulli qualified 13th but dropped ten places on the starting grid due to an engine change to his Toyota.\n^2  – Christijan Albers qualified 18th but dropped ten places on the starting grid due to an engine change to his MF1.\n^3  – Sakon Yamamoto started the race from the pit lane after changing the chassis of his Super Aguri after qualifying.\n\n\nRace\n\n\nRace report\n\nMany questioned the sudden pace of Kimi Räikkönen and the sudden lack of it at the Renault team. Soon after the start of the race, the first question was answered: McLaren had put a minimum amount of fuel in Räikkönen's car, forcing him to make a pit stop after just ten laps. And it became a long stop when his crew had problems changing the right rear tyre. All this meant that the Ferrari duo of Michael Schumacher and Felipe Massa sailed off into the distance, with Jenson Button in the Honda and the Renaults of Giancarlo Fisichella and Fernando Alonso chasing behind.\nSchumacher made his first stop without losing the lead. Meanwhile, Alonso was down in sixth behind Mark Webber. The Australian had started down in eleventh but later even passed Fisichella for fourth. During the second round of pit stops, Fisichella went off track and was passed by his teammate.\nSchumacher and Massa scored a comfortable 1-2. It was the German's 89th career win. Räikkönen used the unplanned third-stop strategy to its best to fight off Webber and overtake Button to take the third step on the podium. In the final stages, Webber's car developed an engine problem and he retired on lap 59.\nJacques Villeneuve had crashed his BMW on lap 30. It would turn out to be the last race of his career.\nMidland drivers Christijan Albers and Tiago Monteiro were disqualified after the race for having illegally flexing rear wings. \n\n\nRace classification\n\nNotes\n^1  – Christijan Albers and Tiago Monteiro were disqualified for having illegally flexing rear wings.\n\n\nChampionship standings after the race\n\nNote: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\nBold text and an asterisk indicates competitors who still had a theoretical chance of becoming World Champion.\n\n\nSee also\n2006 Hockenheimring GP2 Series round\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nDetailed German Grand Prix results (archived)",

    "text": "Andrew Christian LaRoche (born September 13, 1983) is an American former professional baseball third baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Oakland Athletics, and Toronto Blue Jays.\nLaRoche is the son of Dave LaRoche, a former Major League Baseball pitcher for the California Angels, and brother of former first baseman and designated hitter Adam LaRoche. Andy and Adam played together on the Pirates in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\nCollege and draft\nLaRoche played shortstop for Grayson County College. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. In 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. He had been originally a catcher but switched positions due to an injury. He was originally drafted in the 21st round by the San Diego Padres in 2002, but he turned down an offer estimated at $200,000 and remained in school for another year. He re-entered the draft the following year, and, despite having broken a bone in his left leg in a collision at first base, his stock soared and scouts projected him as a first rounder. However, teams were concerned about their ability to sign him, as he had turned down the Padres' offer and was planning on transferring to Rice University.\nNevertheless, he was drafted in the 39th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, but still got supplemental money when the Dodgers signed him in August 2003. At the time, his bonus was the highest for a \"non draft and follow\" outside the first three rounds.\n\n\nPlaying career\n\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nConcern about his range caused the Dodgers to move him from shortstop to third base prior to sending him to their rookie league team, the Ogden Raptors, for the last few games of the 2003 season.\nHe started the 2004 season with the Dodgers Single-A team in Columbus, hitting .283 with 13 home runs and 42 RBI before being promoted to the higher Single-A team in Vero Beach where he struggled a bit, hitting only .237 with 10 HRs and 34 RBI.\nIn 2005, at Vero Beach, he hit .333 with 21 HRs and 51 RBI and received a call-up to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. At Jacksonville, he hit .273 with 9 HRs and 43 RBI. He was voted the Dodgers Minor League Player of the Year.\nFor the 2006 minor league season, he started at Jacksonville and hit .309 with 9 HRs and 46 RBI. He would be called up to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, where he hit .322 with 10 HRs and 35 RBI.\n\nDuring LaRoche's second big league spring training in 2007, he noted that his last name should be spelled \"La Roche\" with a defined space. However, as reported by Steve Henson of the Los Angeles Times, he decided to revert to the previous spelling by the end of camp.\nLaRoche made his major league debut on May 6, 2007, against the Atlanta Braves. He recorded his first major league hit, a ground rule double, against Kyle Davies. The following day, May 7, LaRoche recorded his first two RBI against the Florida Marlins. After being demoted to Triple-A Las Vegas, LaRoche was recalled on September 1. LaRoche received more playing time in September due to Nomar Garciaparra's injury problems. On September 20, LaRoche hit his first major league home run off Colorado Rockies pitcher Matt Herges.\nLaRoche played for Team USA in the 2007 Baseball World Cup during the MLB off-season.\nOn March 7, 2008, while playing a spring training game against the St. Louis Cardinals, LaRoche tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the base of his right thumb. In a freak accident, LaRoche was attempting to catch a pickoff throw from catcher Danny Ardoin. The throw deflected off Cardinals base runner D'Angelo Jiménez and struck LaRoche on his throwing hand. LaRoche was injured in the fifth inning, having taken over third base duties for Nomar Garciaparra, who was injured an inning earlier when he was struck on the wrist with a pitch. At the time, LaRoche and Garciaparra were in competition for the starting third base job. Neither player could begin the season, and minor league rookie Blake DeWitt assumed third base duties on opening day.\nOn May 3, after completing a ten-game rehab assignment with the Double-A Jacksonville Suns and the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, LaRoche was reinstated from the disabled list and optioned to the 51s. This move was seen as Dodgers management endorsing Blake DeWitt, who had played well enough to keep his starting role while LaRoche was on the disabled list.\nLaRoche was recalled from Las Vegas on June 10 and made his 2008 debut the next day at first base. He hit a home run against Padres starter Randy Wolf in the fourth inning.\n\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\nOn July 31, 2008, LaRoche, along with pitcher Bryan Morris, was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in part of a three-team deal that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jason Bay to the Boston Red Sox. LaRoche joined his brother Adam in Pittsburgh. After hitting .144 while with the Pirates in 2008, LaRoche was given an \"intensive offseason workout regimen\" throughout the offseason.\nHis reunion with brother Adam ended on July 22, 2009, when the Pirates traded Adam to the Boston Red Sox for minor-league pitcher Hunter Strickland and shortstop Argenis Díaz.

    "text": "Conway-Johnson family (also called “The Family” or “The Dynasty”) was a prominent American political family from Arkansas of British origin. It was founded by Henry Wharton Conway of Greene County, Tennessee, who had come to the state of Arkansas in 1820 with his younger brother James and his cousins Elias and Wharton Rector, all of whom were deputy-surveyors under the patronage of their uncle, William Rector, Surveyor General of Missouri, Illinois, and Arkansas.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Conway-Johnson family developed following a fatal duel between former friends Robert Crittenden and Henry Wharton Conway on October 27, 1827, near Napoleon, Arkansas. Conway had served as territorial delegate for Arkansas, with Crittenden acting behind the scenes on his behalf. After the resignation of Territorial Governor Miller in 1824, Conway nominated Crittenden to fill the position. President James Monroe appointed George Izard instead. \nCrittenden continued as secretary of state. He and Conway disagreed over the latter's decision not to seek re-election in 1825.\nConway defeated Robert Oden, who was backed by Crittenden. After a period of public conflict through the newspapers, Crittenden challenged Conway to a duel. Conway fired first and hit a button on Crittenden's coat; Crittenden shot and hit Conway, who died of his wounds weeks later. By firing at Conway after having been hit, Crittenden broke the dueling etiquette. His political career suffered. Conway's brother James formed a political alliance with Ambrose H. Sevier and supported his appointment to fill the deceased Conway's territorial seat. The duel caused realignments and a split in Arkansas politics. Crittenden supporters later became the Whig Party. The Conways and Seviers led the Democrats in opposition to Crittenden.\n\n\nMember families\nThe alliance between the immediate Conway and Sevier families later broadened to include Conway's cousins Elias and Wharton Rector. Additional political families were linked by marriage. Henry Conway had married the daughter of Benjamin Johnson, a superior court judge in Arkansas Territory. Sevier had married a sister of Robert Ward Johnson, a member of a powerful Kentucky political family. Johnson served as a Congressman and US Senator from Arkansas in the antebellum years and was part of The Family.

    "text": "Howard Henry Erskine-Hill,  (19 June 1936 – 26 February 2014) was an English literary scholar most notable for his work on the eighteenth century poet Alexander Pope.\n\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Wakefield and studied at a Methodist boarding school in Harrogate, Ashville College. He was exempt from National Service due to his asthma and he studied English with philosophy at the University of Nottingham. He graduated with a BA in 1957 and then embarked on his PhD thesis (also at Nottingham), titled \"Tradition and Affinity in the Poetry of Pope\".\n\n\nAcademic career\nFrom 1960 to 1965 Erskine-Hill taught English at the University of Wales, Swansea, ending his time there as senior lecturer. From 1965 to 1984 he was a lecturer in English at Cambridge University, then reader (1984–94) and professor of literary history (1994–2003). From 1969 until 1980 he was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge and in 1985 was elected Fellow of the British Academy, where he served on the publications committee (1987–94).\nIn 1964 Oxford University Press published Erskine-Hill's edition of Horace's Satires and Epistles. His Social Milieu of Alexander Pope was published by Yale University Press in 1975 and sought to place Pope's work in its historical context by analysing six figures who featured prominently in Pope's life and poetry. In his review, Donald Davie said the book was \"one of those very rare books which truly deserve the description: humane scholarship. It is very learned indeed. ... [H]is book is a great achievement, and also a great pleasure. ... I do not know when literary scholarship in England came up with anything so deeply satisfying\".\nHis next book, The Augustan Idea in English Literature, was published in 1983 and explored how writers from the time of Shakespeare to Pope used the Roman Emperor Augustus and his associated poets Virgil and Horace as a model to praise or criticise politics. Erskine-Hill explained in the preface:\n\nThe word ‘Idea’ in my title is not intended to suggest that the English reception of Rome's Augustan Age involved one idea alone, as it might be for example, of peaceful empire, or of enlightened patronage of poets. ‘Idea’ must perforce stand for a shifting pattern of ideas, some diametrically opposed, if pressed to their extreme forms. The grateful view of Virgil and Horace; the penetrating and hostile view of Tacitus; and the Christian providential view of Eusebius, each quite different from the others, are the major components of what may for the sake of brevity be termed the Augustan Idea. Separated out, they formed the arguments in a debate about the nature of Augustan Rome. Drawn together they composed a compound image in which compatibility was more evident than contradiction.\nIn the book's introduction he explained: \"Evidence has been presented and conclusions based on that evidence. I acknowledge the principle of truth as the end of scholarship, and have no interest in the production of subjective myth in the guise of criticism, or in the mere multiplication of readings none of which has any greater probability than the rest\". In his review, Frank Kermode complained of the \"vanity\" of Erskine-Hill's \"mock-modest tone\" in the introduction and said it was \"quite deplorable\" from \"so pedestrian an author to put on such airs\". Emrys Jones called it \"an ambitious and impressive work\" which was not only \"exceptional in the scope and quality of its reading but deeply considered in what it has to say\".\nIn 1992 Erskine-Hill unsuccessfully opposed Cambridge University's bestowal of an honorary degree on Jacques Derrida because he had derided the value of truth and that such academic recognition of Derrida would undermine educational standards. The pamphlet he wrote with Hugh Mellor exclaimed that \"the major preoccupation and effect of [Derrida's] voluminous work has been to deny and to dissolve those standards of evidence and argument on which all academic disciples are based\".\nIn order to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Pope's death, Erskine-Hill set up a symposium in May 1994. This led to him being appointed to give the Warton Lecture on \"Pope and Slavery\". This and other papers from the symposium were published in the Proceedings of the British Academy in 1998.\nIn 1996 Oxford University's Clarendon Press published his two companion volumes on the relationship between politics and literature from William Shakespeare to William Wordsworth, Poetry and the Realm of Politics and Poetry of Opposition and Revolution. He explained in the introduction to the first volume:\n\nThe chief contention of this book is that there is a political comment, often involving contemporary political ideas and historical circumstance, in some of the most powerful poetic works of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature, works which have in the past been usually read for their aesthetic achievement and generalized wisdom. I argue that this political component is an eventual part of their aesthetic life, and that that, in its turn, is part of that wider historical culture which it is the vocation of scholarship to explore with as much imagination and disinterestedness as it can.\nIn 2008 Erskine-Hill's festschrift was published, edited by David Womersley and Richard McCabe. They said in the preface that Erskine-Hill's works \"range from the most magisterial of research monographs to the most accessible of student introductions. ... In Howard the teacher and the scholar are one\".\n\n\nPersonal life\nErskine-Hill's political views were originally left-wing; he was a Labour voter and a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament but he moved to the right whilst at Cambridge. Although he voted for James Callaghan's Labour Party in 1979, he admired Margaret Thatcher's leadership during the Falklands War, during the 1983 general election he complained: \"If you believe in democratic procedure and in defence, you cannot vote Labour this time. If you believe in government support for the economy and unemployment, you cannot vote Tory\".\nLater on he embraced Euroscepticism; in 1991 he wrote to Thatcher to try and dissuade her from retiring from the House of Commons so that she could lead the campaign against a federal Europe. He also supported her idea of a referendum on the subject. He later supported the UK Independence Party.\nThroughout his life he was a supporter of Amnesty International.\nAbandoning the atheism of his student days, he joined the Church of England. In 1994, after the Church of England decided to ordain women, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\nWorks\n(editor), Pope: Horatian Satires and Epistles (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964).\nThe Social Milieu of Alexander Pope: Lives, Example, and the Poetic Response (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975).

    "text": "A Mooney viscometer or rotating disk viscometer is an instrument used for measuring the Mooney viscosity of rubbers.  Invented in the 1930s by Melvin Mooney, it contains a rotating spindle and heated dies, the substance encloses and overflows the spindle and the mooney viscosity is calculated from the torque on the spindle.\n\n\nInstrument description\nThe working principle of the Mooney viscometer consists in the measurement of the torque necessary to rotate a disc in a cylindrical chamber filled with the rubber compound to be vulcanized. A number proportional with the value of this torque is taken as viscosity index (Mooney viscosity) and is reported in arbitrary Mooney units. \nThe rubber compound is introduced under pressure into the test chamber, made up of two halves. Inside the test chamber a disc is rotated by means of a motor. To avoid rubber slippage during the determination, both the chamber walls and the rotor surface are striated. \nThe conversion of the torque into viscosity units is made by means of a calibrated flat spring anchored to the rotating disc shaft. The deformations of the shaft are transmitted to the indicating scale. The elasticity of the spring is chosen so that to a torque of 84 daN.cm correspond 100 viscosity units. The chamber is electrically heated and the temperature is kept constant within 0.5 degree C.\n\n\nTest procedure\n\nThe rubber compound, including the vulcanizing system, is shaped on the mill as 6–8 mm thick sheets. Round-shaped samples with 45 mm diameter are cut from the sheets. The samples are pierced in the middle in order to allow the rotor shaft to pass. Before the beginning of the measurement, the instrument is heated up to 118 degree C. After the sample is introduced, it takes a minute for the sample to reach the thermal equilibrium, and then the rotor is started.\nThe value of Mooney viscosity decreases at the beginning, due to the decrease of the compound viscosity as temperature rises.  After about 4 min, a minimum value is reached, which stays constant for a while. This value is indicated as MV. After a certain period of time, vulcanization starts and the Mooney viscosity increases.\nThe following values are indicated on the obtained curve:\n\nminimum viscosity MV;\nscorch time (t5) - the time interval (measured from rotor start) corresponding to a viscosity increase of 5 Mooney units over MV, measured at rotor start. The t5 value indicates the prevulcanization tendency of the compound. The larger t5 is, the lower the prevulcanization tendency, and, therefore, the rubber compound can be more reliably processed on mill, calender or extruder.\nVulcanization time (t35) - the time interval (measured from rotor start) corresponding to a viscosity increase of 35 units over the MV value.\nVulcanization index - Dt30 = t35 − t5; provides indications about the vulcanizing ability of a rubber compound. A compound with a low vulcanization index, cures more rapidly than a compound with a higher vulcanization index.\nOptimum vulcanization time at the experimental temperature employed (top), which can be calculated with the relationship:\n\ntop = (t5 − tMV) + 10.Delta 30\nwhere tMV is the time interval, measured from rotor start until Mooney viscosity reaches the MV value.\nBy using the slope of the curve, the vulcanization rate can be determined.\nIf vulcanization goes on, Mooney viscosity becomes in many cases practically constant in time.  Going beyond the plateau time leads to either reversion in natural rubber, or overcure in synthetic elastomers.\n\n\nReferences",

The Swedish participating broadcaster, Sveriges Television (SVT), organised Melodifestivalen 2020 in order to select its entry for the contest. However, the contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to the 2020 contest, Sveriges Radio (SR) until 1979, and Sveriges Television (SVT) since 1980, had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Sweden fifty-nine times since SR's first entry in 1958. Sweden had won the contest on six occasions: in 1974 with the song \"Waterloo\" performed by ABBA, in 1984 with the song \"Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley\" performed by Herreys, in 1991 with the song \"Fångad av en stormvind\" performed by Carola, in 1999 with the song \"Take Me to Your Heaven\" performed by Charlotte Nilsson, in 2012 with the song \"Euphoria\" performed by Loreen, and in 2015 with the song \"Heroes\" performed by Måns Zelmerlöw. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the 2004, Sweden's entries, to this point, have featured in every final except for 2010 when the nation failed to qualify.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, SVT organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. Since 1959, SR first and SVT later have organised the annual competition Melodifestivalen in order to select their entries for the contest.\n\n\nBefore Eurovision\n\n\nMelodifestivalen 2020\n\nFour heats, a Second Chance round and a final were held.

From 1921, he lived in exile in France.\n\n\nEarly life\nMustafa Shokay was born into a Muslim Kazakh family of aristocrats in the Kazakh town of Ak-Meshit (modern Kyzylorda, Kazakhstan). During this period the status of family was evaluated by the number of cattle they possessed, meaning that Mustafa's family was wealthy  in their village due to the high number of cattle in their possession. Mustafa's paternal grandfather was the Datkha, which in Persian means – \"a wish, request, Justice\".  The Datkha was equal to a Sultan and was higher in title than the Bey. Mustafa's grandfather was electing Prime Minister – Datkha of Khiva's khan. The Datkha was subordinate only to the Khan and was often tasked with helping him manage the Khanate. The mother of Mustafa was Bakty, an intellectual in her own right and a descendant of the famous Batu Khan. Bakty was well-educated, in Kazakh, Arabic, and Persian. Mustafa and his family were from the Middle Juz (horde) of the Kypchak’s tribe, Torgai clan, Shashty popliteal, Boshay knee, Janay popliteal. \nBefore the October Revolution in 1917 Shokay's Family and about 30 of his relatives lived in one village, which was located in 5 kilometers from the station of Sulu-Tube. They lived in nice yurts, (nomad's houses). Mustafa's father had 2 wives, with Bakty being his second one. Bakty gave birth two 2 sisters and 3 brothers in addition to him. Most of the other children in the Shokay family are undocumented, but sources do mention that Mustafa had an older brother named Nurtaza.  Mustafa was the youngest child in their family and was 15 years younger than his Sadyk brothers. \nMustafa's mother taught her children to read and write in childhood, helping them learn Kazakh, Arabic, and Persian just as she did. When he was 5 years old, Mustafa learned to play on the dombra. From childhood he was musically gifted, and had a great ear and for music. In their village was a local mullah, who was taught to read the Quran and assisted Mustafa in understanding the Islamic Holy Book. Mustafa set himself apart from other students by perfectly memorizing all of the sura from the Quran by heart. \nAt the age of 7, Mustafa's father took him to the urbanized part of Ak-Meshit, where he would study in a Russian school and slowly assimilate into Russian society.  While his father was in favor of him receiving a higher education and at least partially assimilating, Mustafa's mother feared that he would forget his Muslim Kazakh roots and forever be Russianized. Moreover, the mullah of Ak-Meshit added to all of this by claiming that the Russians will put him on the cross should Mustafa refuse to give up Islam. Mustafa was initially hesitant to go to the Russian school, but his father was able to effectively persuade him into furthering his education there.\nMustafa started his education in the Russian school, but he became very sick and soon left his studies. In 1902 he was admitted to a Tashkent gymnasium and in 1910 he graduated with the school's gold medal. General Samsonov (Alexander Samsonov (1859–1914), a Russian military commander during World War I) was against Mustafa receiving the gold medal and insisted that an ethnic Russian student should win. The gold was then handed to Zeprometov, a Russian student in the program. However, the director of the Tashkent gymnasium disagreed and even Zeprometov himself said that Shokay should get the gold medal.  After a brief conflict, the medal was given back to Mustafa. \nThe intentions of Samsonov caused outrage not only within the ranks of the local youth, but also from the Russians. All of the professors and Russian intellectuals were ready to strike. That strike was provoked by the administration, showing the unfair treatment to the student in favor of the officials.\nTrying to smooth over the scandal, Samsonov approached Mustafa with a proposal to be an interpreter in his administration, but he refused Samsonov's request and went to St. Petersburg to enter the university's law faculty (1910–1917). \nIn 1912 Mustafa's father died and the local villagers asked him to return home at the request of family to replace the post of his father – a judge.  This event caused Mustafa to once again put a hold on his education. He returned to complete the final stage of his education one year later in St. Petersburg.  Towards the end of his education, the Stolypin agrarian reform in Kazakhstan occurred, and many Kazakhs became resettled peasants by the Russian imperial administration. Mustafa moved back to Ak-Meshit, where his family remained as one of the few who did not suffer any dramatic effects of the Stolypin agrarian reform.\n\n\nActivities in St. Petersburg\n\nDuring study in St. Petersburg, Mustafa was trying to protect not only the interest of his countryman, but the whole Kazakh nation. However, on 3 July 1907, Tsar Nikolai II issued a decree depriving the electoral rights of the indigenous peoples of Siberia and Central Asia. They lost their way with little representation in the State Duma of Russia. But the Kazakh politicians and intellectuals continued to fight for the interests of the people. Working in the Duma, Shokai met with prominent Muslim political leaders of Russia and became friends with Ahmad Zeki Velidi, the future chairman of the Bashkir autonomy.\nIn the midst of heavy fighting during the First World War, on 25 June 1916, Tsar Nicholas II issued a decree \"On the requisition of foreigners\", attracting the indigenous population of Turkestan and the steppe region in age from 19 to 43 years to rear work – digging trenches, despite the fact that the Muslims were exempted from military service due to the deprivation of electoral rights. The decree came in the days of Ramadan and the height of the agricultural work, and caused widespread outrage among Kazakhs. A powerful uprising, led by Amankeldı İmanov, began in Turgay Oblast and soon spread throughout Kazakhstan.\nThere were protests against the decree in the State Duma. Shokay entered his commission as a secretary and translator of the Muslim faction. Subsequent performances of Kerensky in the Duma with the analysis of the Turkestan uprising against the imperial government policies brought him huge popularity throughout Russia. When he returned to Petrograd, Shokay prepared materials for their performances in the State Duma of their faction. However the State Duma was dissolved by Tsar Nicholas II, and then he himself abdicated.\n\n\nCharacter of Mustafa Shokay\nLike other ethnic Kazakhs, Mustafa Shokay remained a devout Muslim all throughout his life.  During his student life, in fact during his all life, Mustafa was not involved in any political party. He was a democrat, without the slightest hint of socialism, who loved his homeland and his nation. Mustafa never spared himself in the name of the future of his people. There were politicians for peace or for the war and Mustafa belonged to the politicians for peace. Mustafa's character was soft and easily vulnerable. He knew that to work in the State Duma he had to be a strong person.\nShokay admired and highly valued Mustafa Kemal, a Turkish nationalist who used his stances to found the modern-day Republic of Turkey. Shokay considered that Turkestan needed a political reformer like himself. Mustafa Shokay did not have any hostile emotions toward bigots or to representatives of other nations. He loved to make discussions or argue with people who possessed different political opinions than him. In arguments he was calm and ever respected his opponent's standpoint. He always took any inhumane acts to his heart. He was able to find the way to heart of people throughout honesty and the ability to empathize with others. Sometimes he stood really heatedly, defending his position, but in all cases did not hurt the feeling of his opponent. Mustafa was the enemy of narrow-minded nationalism. He defended his interest for position of Turkestan's people union. However, the Russian nationalist recognized Mustafa's position, but they did not want to regard with interest of Turkestan's nation, also with non-Russian nations. These principles of Russian democracy really hurt the feeling of Mustafa Shokay and for this reason he severed good relations with the Russian periodical press in 1923 (mass-media).\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1914 World War I began and Mustafa as a student, became a member of State Duma as a secretary. Mustafa was introduced to the Muslim fraction on the recommendation of Alikhan Bukeikhanov. Until 1917, before the October revolution Mustafa was a member of State Duma where he represented the Turko-Tatar peoples. His formal political activities began in 1917 when Mustafa Shokay was delegated to the congress of Muslims in Moscow. This big congress on Turkestan was held by his initiative. Mustafa was a member of Turkestan committee of Interim Government and later he was elected as a chairman of Turkestan's national committee.On 10 December 1917 the project of creating autonomy was submitted. On the 4th Congress in Turkestan, Turkestan autonomy, known as the Kokand Autonomy. After overthrowing the Russian Provisional Government was declared in Petrograd during the armed uprising on 25 October, the Bolsheviks carried out popular measures for the people in the election-Russian Constituent Assembly of Russia. But in election 12 November 1917 the Bolsheviks received only 23.9% of the vote against 40.4% for the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. \nIn such circumstances, the Kokand government announced its intention to create on 20 March 1918, its parliament by universal direct, equal and secret ballot. Two thirds of the seats in parliament were for Muslim MPs and one third – representatives of non-Muslims. The existence of such a parliament was to be the first step towards the democratization of Turkestan. But Chairman of People's Commissars of the Turkestan Republic Fedor Kolesov, said: \n\n\"We can not allow Muslims to the supreme authorities, since the position of the local population against us is not defined and, in addition, they have no proletarian organization\"\n\nSo on 11 February 1918 the Bolsheviks sent troops to Kokand. Kokand was completely destroyed, as the Bolshevik troops were armed with machine guns and cannons, which were not available in Kokand, Turkestan. Shokay fled through Fergana to Tashkent. On his head a bounty of 1000 rubbles was placed. At that time Mustafa Shokay was the youngest politician, who advocated for Turkestan Autonomy, but he was against separatism. When he was in hiding, Mustafa met his old friend Maria Gorina, whom he married in April 1918, After this event Shokay said:” We called the soviet power then established in Tashkent the «enemy of our people». I have not changed my view on the matter in the last ten years.”  \nDuring the following years Shokay wrote and published a book:” Turkestan under the Soviet Union (On the characteristics of the dictatorship of the proletariat)”.\n\n\nEmigration\nTraveling through the Kazakh steppe and the Caspian Sea, Mustafa Shokay manage to safely arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan, then Tbilisi, Georgia where he lived with his wife of two years, from spring 1919 till February 1921. Shokay moved to Turkey, because The Red Army led by Ordzhonikidze, defeated the Volunteer Army of General Denikin, captured the North Caucasus, then Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 16 February 1921 came to Tiflis. The democratic Republic of Transcaucasia was overthrown by the Soviet Union. After the events in Transcaucasia Mustafa Shokay and his wife Maria Shokay emigrated to Istanbul, Turkey. Shokay in Istanbul wrote articles in English for “The Times” and for publications like “Şafak”, also for “Yeni Dünya”- “New World”. Then he found that Alexander Kerensky, who also emigrated to Paris from Russia. Kerensky helped Shokay to get a French visa and in the summer of 1921 Mustafa with Maria moved to Paris. He was writing articles for the newspaper of Kerensky “Days” and Milyukova's “Last News”. In 1923 Mustafa and Maria Shokay moved to Nozhan-Sur-Marn, spoke for the European public with the speech \"The policy of Russia and Turkestan National Movement\". The time during the exile it was the most darkness period for both of Mr. and Mss. Shokay. Mustafa Shokay was trying to write books, newspapers, magazines; held meeting with his speech for whole world to submit and to hear about the problems in Turkestan and Central Asia. These editions was published in Istanbul, Paris, Berlin, London, Warsaw, he published articles about Central Asia, theoretical studies, historical and political review. Mustafa Shokay created newspaper in Istanbul: Yash Turkistan in 1927 and it was existed till 1931. In 1929 he settled in Berlin edition of the magazine \"Yash (Young) Turkestan\" and became its editor in chief. The magazine last until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, was released 117 editions. Mustafa Shokay spoke foreign languages such as English, French, Russian, German, Turkish, and Arabic.\n\n\nUnsuccessful collaboration with the Nazi Germany\nOn the day of Operation Barbarossa, the attack of the Axis powers on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the German occupations troops in Paris arrested all the well-known emigrants from the territories of the Soviet Union and imprisoned them in the castle of Compiègne (Château de Compiègne). Those imprisoned included Shokay.\nAfter three weeks, Shokay was taken to Berlin and after two weeks offered to lead the Turkestan Legion. This unit was meant to include Soviet military prisoners of Turkic descent held in German prisoner of war camps. The Nazis hoped for Mustafa Shokay's authority. But the Legion had been partially replenished by elite German troops which had combat experience against Soviet troops on the Eastern Front, while Shokay was required to familiarize Turkic prisoners with circumstances of their fellow countrymen in the camps. He was shocked by the inhuman conditions of Asians kept behind barbed wire.\nDetailing the journey of Mustafa's life, he entertained the possibility of creating a union of Muslim states with the help of Germany. To achieve this goal, it would be necessary to organize Muslim-Soviet prisoners of war – particularly from the army. And acquired goals should be overthrowing Soviet governments in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Mustafa Shokai said that he was ready to consent to be the head of this noble movement. The collaboration made known to the ideological leader of the National Socialist party on matters of ideology and foreign policy, the Minister for the \"Eastern Territories\" General SS Alfred Rosenberg.\nMustafa Shokay wanted to give some relief and grasped the chance to save prisoners' lives, he compromised with the German authorities. He set his conditions:\n\nCreate staff for the future of Turkestan state schools in Germany;\nCreate military forces from follow prisoners, which will be used only when approaching the borders of Turkestan.\n\nMustafa Shokay wanted to receive some benefit from the collaboration with Nazis. Unfortunately Adolf Hitler declined in all queries, because Hitler considered the Turkestan Legion as “cannon fodder”. Later Shokay wrote a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gruppenführer Joachim von Ribbentrop: “Seeing how representatives of the nation, who raised such geniuses as Goethe, Feuerbach, Bach, Beethoven, Schopenhauer, treat prisoners of war ... I can not accept the offer to lead the ... Turkestan Legion and refuse further cooperation. All the consequences of my decision, I realize.” \nAdolf Hitler realized his attempted manipulation of Mustafa Shokay was going to fail; the German leadership decided to remove him. On 22 December 1941, Hitler signed a decree for the establishment of the Turkestan and other national legions. At that time Mustafa was in hospital in Berlin \"Victoria\". On 27 December 1941, he died. The official report stated that he \"died of blood poisoning on the background of an emerging epidemic of typhus,\" he was infected when visiting concentration camps. But the same symptoms could be poisoning. Moreover, in the memoirs of his wife Maria Gorina-Shokay, she wrote that Mustafa had been ill with typhus in Turkestan and he was supposed to be immune. Mustafa Shokai was buried in the Turkish Muslim cemetery (Osmanidov) in Berlin. On the tombstone just below the date at the behest of his wife M. Shokay, Maria Jakovlevna, there are three letters in Latin and four numbers: JOH.15.13. They point to the thirteenth verse of the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel of John: \"There is no greater love than this; that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\nThe Turkestan Legion army was later granted to Nazi-loyalist Vali Qayyum, a long standing cooperative of the anti-Soviet movement Prometheism. He was honorifically titled Khan after he had no problem embracing Nazi vision to build Turkic-Muslim army which would fight Soviets.\n\n\nSelected works\nMustafa Shokay. «Chez les Soviets en Asie Centrale», Paris, 1928.\nMustafa Shokay. «The Basmati Movement in Turkestan», «The Asiatic Review», vol.

According to a local legend, a farmer discovered Prettau's copper deposits by chance while trying to tame a bull. The bull's horns struck the ground and brought out golden sand. Locals initially mistook it for gold before realising it was copper. The old copper mine has since been converted into a local history museum.\nPrettau's economy is now served primarily by tourism.

    "title": "NBR D class 0-6-0",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=49893383",
    "text": "The NBR Class D (later LNER Class J34) was a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive of the North British Railway, often known as the Wee Drummonds. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond (Locomotive Superintendent). A total of 101 were built from 1883 to 1887.\nThe NBR Class D (later LNER Class J33) was an almost identical type of 0-6-0 locomotive. The design remained that of Dugald Drummond, but was slightly adapted by his successor Matthew Holmes. The changes were largely technical, whilst both classes of locomotive were virtually identical in outward appearance. A total of 36 were produced.\nThe class D engines (of both the Drummond and Holmes types) were highly successful with long service lives.\n\n\nBuild dates\nThe initial D class (later J34) was built in batches; the first batch by Dübs and Company of Glasgow, and the subsequent batches by the North British Railway at their Cowlairs railway works. The engines were built between 1879 and 1883. All the engines were rebuilt during the years 1892 to 1908. It has been suggested that Drummond's design for these, and other 0-6-0 engines, was influenced by his admiration for locomotive designer William Stroudley.\nThe later class D locomotives (subsequently J33) were built in five batches between 1883 and 1887. Thus the North British Railway operated a total of 137 class D locomotives, 101 of the J34 type, and 36 of the J33 type.\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough both types were classified as D when the NBR adopted formal class designations in 1913, in 1923 (on grouping) the LNER considered the locomotives to be sufficiently different mechanically to warrant different class designations. Thus the original Drummond D class became LNER class J34, whilst the modified Holmes D class became LNER class J33. There are documented examples of even the NBR's own locomotive workshops failing to correctly distinguish between the J33 and J34 types of D class engine, owing to their near-identical appearance.\n\n\nClass D (J34)\nThe Class D (J34) engines were designed to meet a perceived need for a smaller version of the already highly successful Drummond class C (later J32) 0-6-0 freight engines. The problem with the class C engines was their size and weight, which made them unsuitable for certain routes. Drummond produced the class D on similar principles, but with a significant reduction in overall length and weight of the engine, thus permitting far wider route access for freight train operation. This led to the popular nickname \"Wee Drummonds\" for members of the class.\nThe engines performed well, and although designed for light freight were regularly employed on mainline passenger services or wherever required on the network. They were versatile and flexible, owing to their size and weight. This ease of use led to almost all the engines surviving into LNER ownership. However, the LNER began withdrawing the class almost immediately, and the last two were scrapped in January 1928.\n\n\nClass D (J33)\nThe Holmes class D (J33) were simply a continuation of the earlier Drummond type, in which the toolbox from the rear of the tender was removed and were given a different, non-sloping fire grate. The Drummond D class engines were modified as such when they were rebuilt.\nOwing to the close similarity, they were often identified colloquially as \"Wee Drummonds\", although the nickname properly belongs only to the J34 type. At a late stage in construction Holmes designed a new cab for the D class engines, although the bulk of the modified class D machines (J33) had already been built with Drummond cabs, just like the original class D engines (J34). Thus the machines with the Holmes style cabs simply became another variation within the class. It was suggested (for example, by NBR historian John Thomas) that the drivers found the Holmes cabs more pleasant to work in, and less draughty.\nLike the original D class engines, the modified D class saw widespread service not only on their intended work (light freight), but also on suburban passenger services, and sometimes even long-distance coal trains. The later members of the class were actually fitted with the Westinghouse brake apparatus from new, an indication of the intention to employ them on passenger services. Under the LNER they were gradually relegated to secondary roles such as station pilot or shunter. They were withdrawn between 1924 and 1932 with the exception of two engines (9159 and 9249) which survived considerably longer, both being scrapped in 1938.\n\n\nAccidents\nOn 28 November 1890, two class D locomotives were involved in a serious head-on collision on Todd's Mill Viaduct. The engines involved were numbers 501 and 524, the latter actually crashing off the viaduct, resulting in a fall of around 60 feet (18 m).\n\n\nPreservation\nThe last J34 was scrapped in 1928, and the last J33 was scrapped in 1938.\n\n\nSources\nIan Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives, 1948 edition, part 4.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Jacques Philip Malan (24 October 1917 - 20 June 2012) was a South African musicologist who held several prominent positions in South African music throughout his career. He was also the editor of the South African Music Encyclopedia, published in four volumes by Oxford University Press between 1979 and 1986.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJacques Philip Malan was born on 24 October 1917 in Bloemfontein. He undertook his early musical training at the Free State Music School. In 1940, he received his teaching and performer's licentiates from the University of South Africa, and in 1943 a BA degree from Grey University College (later the University of the Orange Free State, and now the University of the Free State). Malan was the first South African to undertake musicological studies overseas, completing his doctoral studies at the University of Vienna with a thesis on the content and form of the motifs in Handel's oratorios under the supervision of Erich Schenk in 1954.\n\n\nCareer and contributions\nMalan was responsible for the establishment of a music department at Potchefstroom University College for Christian Higher Education (which became the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (PU for CHE) in 1951 and is now known as the North-West University) in the 1940s. In 1960, he was appointed as the head of the music department at the University of Pretoria. Under his guidance, the department's research had a strong focus on South African and particularly Afrikaans topics. During his time at the University of Pretoria, he also compiled and edited the South African Music Encyclopedia, a process which lasted from 1960 to 1986. In 1978, Malan left the University of Pretoria to join the Human Sciences Research Council as the head of its Research Centre for South African Music.\n\n\nResearch and publications\nIn the early stages of his career, Malan concentrated on Afrikaner church music, as evidenced by his publications from 1961 to 1964. Over time, his focus shifted towards the organization and reform of South African music education and research, reflecting a growing emphasis on the intellectual life of universities. This shift is evident in his inaugural professorial address, where Malan described the university as a crucial element in shaping and reflecting the consciousness of the \"volk\". He argued that a civilized society depends on the university's role as a research center, training hub, and cultural focal point, contributing to a vibrant intellectual life.\n\n\nCriticism and legacy\nIn her master's thesis, Carina Venter identifies Malan as a scholar whose discourse is marked by nationalism and Christianism. She argues that Malan's critique of Afrikaans church music echoes the racially charged ideologies of Apartheid, particularly through themes of Afrikaner unity and segregation. Venter also identifies themes of national goals, integration, order, and racial segregation in Malan's other work, noting that his stance on ethnomusicology was aligned with apartheid's ideals of separate development.\nMalan has been critiqued by scholars such as Christine Lucia, who describes him as a \"political activist waiting to exploit 'the possibilities of a new kind of (white) critical inscription'\", placing his scholarship within the \"discursive realm of political activism\".\nHowever, in her PhD dissertation, Mieke Struwig argues for a more nuanced perspective of Malan. Struwig argues that Malan recognized the importance of indigenous music for developing an authentic South African compositional style and was aware that white appropriation of Black music would be problematic. She also highlights that Malan opposed the politicization of music studies, though this stance itself could be seen as political. While Struwig acknowledges that Malan was not \"an apartheid ideologue\", she points out that his scholarly activities were complicit in the intellectual project of apartheid.\n\n\nPublications\nMalan, J.P.

    "text": "Racing Mount Pleasant is the self-titled second album by the American indie band Racing Mount Pleasant. Following on from their 2022 album Grip Your Fist, I'm Heaven Bound, it was released on August 15, 2025 on the record label R&R, and was preceded by three singles. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who frequently compared it to the work of Black Country, New Road, Arcade Fire, and Bon Iver.\n\n\nBackground and release\n\nRacing Mount Pleasant formed under the name Kingfisher in 2019 at the University of Michigan; in November 2022, they released their debut album Grip Your Fist, I'm Heaven Bound. On April 9, 2025, they changed their name to Racing Mount Pleasant, coinciding with the release of the single \"Call It Easy\". On May 9, they released a second single, the self-titled \"Racing Mount Pleasant\"; it was written before the band's name change. They also announced that they would be releasing an album on the record label R&R. The single \"Your New Place\" was released on July 11, accompanied by the announcement that Racing Mount Pleasant would be released on August 15.\n\n\nStyle and composition\nCritics disagree on the genre of Racing Mount Pleasant. It has been described as big band, folk rock, indie rock, baroque pop, and a mix of post-rock and Midwest emo. It has frequently been compared to Black Country, New Road and Arcade Fire, as well as Explosions in the Sky and Bon Iver. The album's tracks were written over the course of the band's entire existence; some were omitted from Grip Your Fist because they were yet to be recorded. Songs were composed by repeating sections many times until a natural transition to another section manifested.\nRacing Mount Pleasant were inspired by memories and looking back on the band's history while composing Racing Mount Pleasant, creating what Stereogum describes as a \"miniverse\". There are references to other songs throughout the lyrics, instrumentals, and song titles; for example, the melody of \"Your New Place\" is repeated on the closing track, \"Your Old Place\". The album was recorded in at least six different spaces, including a bandmember's attic and a church.\n\n\nReception\nRacing Mount Pleasant received generally positive reviews from critics. In a review for The New Yorker, Hanif Abdurraqib drew comparisons between the album and the poem \"Katy\" by Frank O'Hara, stating that the band had become \"quieter and also less silent\" since their debut (a reference to the fifth line of \"Katy\"). Abdurraqib did not feel like he had learnt anything by listening to the album, as many of the themes were \"unspectacular\", but felt \"delighted by the experience nonetheless\". David Renshaw of The Fader praised the album's \"grand crescendos fit for cavernous arenas\", describing \"Your New Place\" as \"like a garage rock band swapping the dive bar for an orchestra pit\". In her interview article of the band for Stereogum, Margaret Farrell applauded the album's ability to evoke memories of the past, stating that \"these songs move like memory: animated, all-encompassing, unpredictable\". Ian Cohen's review for Pitchfork was much more mixed; he praised the \"panoramic sweep of post-rock\" on \"Your New Place\", but disliked that the album was too similar to bands such as Arcade Fire, Bon Iver, and Black Country, New Road, stating \"it sounds like a group working hard to make a cathartic, cleansing instant classic of [an album], but one drawn from memory\". Cohen also believed that songs such as \"You\" and \"Call It Easy\" didn't have a compelling narrator, describing them as \"glacial\". However, he concluded that \"bands and albums of this nature don't come around all that often\".\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nPersonnel\nAdapted from Bandcamp.\n\n\nRacing Mount Pleasant\nCasey Cheatham – drums, background vocals\nKaysen Chown – strings, harmonium, synth guitar, background vocals\nSam DuBose – guitar, piano, vocals\nConnor Hoyt – alto saxophone, flute, background vocals\nCallum Roberts – trumpet, guitar, background vocals\nTyler Thenstedt – bass, slide guitar, background vocals\nSamuel Uribe Botero – tenor saxophone, piano, synth, background vocals, engineering\n\n\nAdditional musicians\nBen Lafo – trombone (on \"Seminary\")\nIan Eylanbekov – electric guitar (on \"Outlast\")\n\n\nTechnical personnel\nEmelia Piane – additional engineering\nWes Millhouse – additional engineering\nGavin Ryan – additional engineering\nCollin Dupuis – mixing\nFelix Davis – mastering\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Heraklion, Herakleion ( hih-RAK-lee-ən; Greek: Ηράκλειο, Iráklio, pronounced [iˈrakli.o], not to be mistaken with Heracleion, Egypt) or Iraklion, is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece, and the largest city in the Greek islands, with a municipal population of 179,302 (2021) and 211,370 in its wider metropolitan area, according to the 2011 census.\nThe greater area of Heraklion has been continuously inhabited since at least 7000 BCE, making it one of the oldest inhabited regions in Europe. It is also home to the ancient Knossos Palace, a major center of the Minoan civilization dating back to approximately 2000-1350 BCE, often considered Europe's oldest city. The palace is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Greece, second only to the Parthenon in terms of visitor numbers.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Herakleion (Ηράκλειον) is derived from an ancient port of Heracleium that served as the harbour for Knossos. The port, bearing the same name, was named in honour of the hero Heracles (Hercules). In antiquity, it was located about 20 stadia (approximately 3.7 kilometers) from Knossos. Strabo also confirms the connection between the two.\nThe site of the ancient port falls within the boundaries of the modern city, near today’s port area. Although ecclesiastical records do not list it as a bishopric, a bishop named Theodoros of Heracleopolis is mentioned at the Second Council of Nicaea.\nThe name was revived in the 19th century and was in use by locals as early as 1867.\n\n\nOther names\n1. In antiquity: The area that would later become the city of Heraklion served as the port for the ancient city of Knossos, one of the centers of the Minoan civilization. This strategic location facilitated trade and communication across the Mediterranean. Over time, as Knossos declined, the port area grew in significance, eventually becoming a prominent urban center.\n2. Rabḍ al-ḫandaq (ربض الخندق): In 824 CE, Arab exiles from al-Andalus (Iberia) who conquered Crete and founded the Emirate of Crete moved the island's capital from Gortyna to a new castle they called rabḍ al-ḫandaq (\"Castle of the Moat\").\n3. Chándax (Χάνδαξ) / Chándakas (Χάνδακας): The Arabic name rabḍ al-ḫandaq was Hellenized to Χάνδαξ (Chándax) or Χάνδακας (Chándakas).\n4. Candia: This name, derived from Chándax, was Latinized as Candia and adopted into other European languages: in Italian and Latin as Candia, in Spanish as Candía, in French as Candie, and in English as Candy. These names could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the Ottoman name for the city was Kandiye.\n5. Megalo Kastro (Μεγάλο Κάστρο): After the Byzantine reconquest of Crete, the city was locally known as Megalo Kastro (Μεγάλο Κάστρο, 'Big Castle' in Greek) and its inhabitants were called Kastrinoi (Καστρινοί, \"castle-dwellers\").\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nMinoan era\nHeraklion is home to the ruins of the palace of Knossos, located in the southern periphery of the city and part of the Heraklion municipality. In Minoan times, Knossos was the largest centre of population on Crete and is considered by many to be the oldest city in Europe.\nKnossos itself had a port at the site of Heraklion (in the modern area of Poros-Katsambas neighborhood) from the beginning of the Early Minoan period (3500 to 2100 BC).\n\n\nAntiquity\n\nAfter the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into Byzantine times the area abounded with pirates and bandits.\n\n\nEmirate of Crete\nHeraklion was chosen as capital in 824, with fortifications starting being built the following year, by the Moors under Abu Hafs Umar who had been expelled from Al-Andalus by Emir Al-Hakam I and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. They built a moat around the city for protection, and named the city rabḍ al-ḫandaq (ربض الخندق, \"Castle of the Moat\", hellenized as Χάνδαξ, Chandax). It became the capital of the Emirate of Crete (c. 827–961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.\n\n\nByzantine era\n\nIn 960, Byzantine forces under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a prolonged siege, the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground. Soon rebuilt, the town remained under Byzantine control for the next 243 years.\n\n\nVenetian era\n\n \nIn 1204, the city was bought by the Republic of Venice as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor Isaac II Angelus to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to 40 metres (130 ft) thick, with seven bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed Candia and became the seat of the Duke of Candia, and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as \"Regno di Candia\" (Kingdom of Candia). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole island of Crete as well. To secure their rule, the Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from Venice on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of the Italian Renaissance led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the Cretan Renaissance.\n\n\nOttoman era\n\nDuring the Cretan War (1645–1669), the Ottomans besieged the city for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, the longest siege in history up until that time. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished. The Ottoman army under an Albanian grand vizier, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha conquered the city in 1669.\n\nUnder the Ottomans, Kandiye (Ottoman Turkish قنديه) was the capital of Crete (Girit Eyâleti) until 1849, when Chania (Hanya) became the capital, and Kandiye became a sancak. In Greek, it was commonly called Megalo Castro (Μεγάλο Κάστρο 'Big Castle').\nDuring the Ottoman period, the harbour silted up, so most shipping shifted to Chania in the west of the island.\n\n\nModern era\n\nAn earthquake located off the northern coast of Crete on October 12, 1856, destroyed most of the over 3,600 homes in the city. Only 18 homes were left intact. The disaster claimed 538 victims in Heraklion.\nIn 1898, the autonomous Cretan State was created, under Ottoman suzerainty, with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898–1908), Candia was part of the British zone. At this time the ancient name of \"Heraklion\" was revived.\nIn 1913, with the rest of Crete, Heraklion was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece. Heraklion was severely damaged in the bombing campaign in May 1941 during the German invasion in the Battle of Crete. The city remained under German rule until 1945. Heraklion again became capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania. The city, and Crete generally, became a major tourist destination from the 1980s onwards.\n\n\nArchitecture, urban sculpture and fortifications\n\nThe oldest monument of architecture is the palace in Knossos on the outskirts of the city.\nTwo largest medieval churches in the city were the Dominican church of St. Peter (built between 1248 and 1253) and the San Salvatore, belonging to the Augustinian Friars. The latter one stood in Kornaros Square, but was demolished in 1970.\nOther monuments of architecture from Venetian times include the Saint Mark's Basilica and the Renaissance loggia next to Lions Square (1626–28).\nAround the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the Republic of Venice. The fortifications managed to withstand the longest siege in history for 21 years, before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1669. The Koules Fortress (Castello a Mare), the ramparts and the arsenal dominate the port area.\nMany fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the Bembo fountain, the Priuli fountain, Palmeti fountain, Sagredo fountain and Morosini fountain in Lions Square (1628).\nArchitecture from the 19th century is represented by the St Titus Cathedral, built in 1869 as the Yeni Cami (\"New Mosque\"), and the Agios Minas Cathedral (1862–95).\nAn example of modern architecture in Heraklion is the Heraklion Archaeological Museum built between 1937 and 1940 by architect Patroklos Karantinos.\nSeveral sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like El Greco, Vitsentzos Kornaros, Nikos Kazantzakis and Eleftherios Venizelos can be found around the city.\n\n\nMunicipality\n\nThe municipality Heraklion was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\n\nGorgolainis\nHeraklion\nNea Alikarnassos\nPaliani\nTemenos\nThe municipality has an area of 244.613 km2, the municipal unit 109.026 km2.\n\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n\nSuburbs\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\nPort\nHeraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including Santorini, Ios Island, Paros, Mykonos, and Rhodes. There are direct ferries to Naxos, Karpathos, Kasos, Sitia, Anafi, Chalki and Diafani. There are also several daily ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by Sir Robert McAlpine and completed in 1928.\n\n\nAirport\n\nHeraklion International Airport, or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native Nikos Kazantzakis, a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after Athens International Airport, first in charter flights and the 59th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 8,066,000 passengers in 2022 (List of the busiest airports in Europe).\nThe airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the Hellenic Air Force.\n\n\nHighway network\nEuropean route E75 runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: Agios Nikolaos, Chania, and Rethymno.\n\n\nPublic transit\n\nUrban buses serve the city, with 39 different routes. Intercity buses connect Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.\n\n\nRailway\nFrom 1922 to 1937, a working industrial railway connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.\nIn the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants held in Heraklion, two engineers, George Nathenas and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno, and Heraklion. No official plans exist for implementing this idea.\n\n\nClimate\nHeraklion has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa in the Köppen climate classification). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than Athens, it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the Aegean Sea. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30 °C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 5 °C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.8 °C in the airport while in the port it has never dropped below 0 °C. Snowfalls are rare with the last significant snowfall with a measurable amount on the ground occurring in February 2004. Heraklion falls in 11a hardiness zone.\n\n\nEducational and Research Institutions\nUniversity of Crete\nHellenic Mediterranean University\nMBS College\nFoundation for Research & Technology - Hellas\nNicolas Kitsikis Library\nVikelaia Library\n3rd High School of Heraklion\n5th High School of Heraklion\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nMuseums\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\nCretaquarium\nHistorical Museum of Crete\nNatural History Museum\nThe Battle of Crete and National Resistance Museum\nNikos Kazantzakis Museum\nCollection of Agia Aikaterini of Sinai\nMuseum of Visual Arts\n\n\nArts\nThe Cultural and Conference Center of Heraklion is a centre for the performing arts.\n\n\nSports\nThe city is home to several sports clubs. Most notably, Heraklion hosts OFI and Ergotelis, two football clubs with earlier presence in the Greek Superleague, the top tier of the Greek football league system. Furthermore, the city is the headquarters of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association, which administers football in the entire region. Other notable sport clubs include Iraklio B.C. (basketball), Atsalenios (football) and Irodotos (football) in the suburbs of Atsalenio and Nea Alikarnassos respectively.\n\n\nLocal TV stations\nChannel 4\nCreta Channel\nKriti TV\nMyTV\n\n\nNotable people\n\nHeraklion has been the home town of some of Greece's most significant people, including the novelist Nikos Kazantzakis (best known for Zorba the Greek), the poet and Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis and the world-famous painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco).\n\n\nLiterature\nElli Alexiou (1894–1988) author\nMinás Dimákis (1913–1980) poet\nOdysseas Elytis (1911–1996) Nobel awarded poet\nTess Fragoulis, Greek-Canadian author\nRea Galanaki (born 1947) author\nGiritli Ali Aziz Efendi (1749–1798), author and diplomat\nNikos Kazantzakis (1883–1957) author\nMenelaos Parlamas (1911–1997) author and scholar\nPedro de Candia, (1485–1542) author and travel writer, recorded the Spanish Conquest of the Americas\nStephanos Sahlikis (1330 – after 1391) poet\nLili Zografou (1922–1998) author\n\n\nScientists and academia\nNicholas Kalliakis (1645–1707) Greek Cretan scholar and philosopher\nNiccolò Comneno Papadopoli (1655–1740) lawyer, historian and librarian\nAndreas Musalus (c. 1665 – c. 1721) Greek Cretan professor of mathematics, philosopher and architectural theorist\nFrancesco Barozzi (1537–1604) mathematician and astronomer\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591–1655) rabbi, author, physician, mathematician and musical theorist\nFotis Kafatos biologist, President of the European Research Council\nSpyros Kokotos (1933–present) architect\nMarcus Musurus (Markos Mousouros) (1470–1517) scholar and philosopher\nPeter of Candia also known as Antipope Alexander V: philosopher and scholar\nJoseph Sifakis (1946–present) computer scientist, co-recipient of the 2007 Turing Award\nMichael N.

    "summary": "Heraklion, Herakleion ( hih-RAK-lee-ən; Greek: Ηράκλειο, Iráklio, pronounced [iˈrakli.o], not to be mistaken with Heracleion, Egypt) or Iraklion, is the largest city and the administrative capital of the island of Crete and capital of Heraklion regional unit. It is the fourth largest city in Greece, and the largest city in the Greek islands, with a municipal population of 179,302 (2021) and 211,370 in its wider metropolitan area, according to the 2011 census.\nThe greater area of Heraklion has been continuously inhabited since at least 7000 BCE, making it one of the oldest inhabited regions in Europe. It is also home to the ancient Knossos Palace, a major center of the Minoan civilization dating back to approximately 2000-1350 BCE, often considered Europe's oldest city. The palace is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Greece, second only to the Parthenon in terms of visitor numbers.\nHeraklion was Europe's fastest growing tourism destination for 2017, according to Euromonitor, with an 11.2% growth in international arrivals. According to the ranking, Heraklion was ranked as the 20th most visited region in Europe, as the 66th area on the planet and as the 2nd in Greece for the year 2017, with 3.2 million visitors and the 19th in Europe for 2018, with 3.4 million visitors.",

Henzi later represented her nation Switzerland, as a 38-year-old senior, at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and also rode professionally for more than five seasons on Fischer-BMC Team, before retiring from the sport in early 2010.\n\n\nRacing career\nAs a full-time member of Fischer-BMC team since her professional cycling debut in 2002, Henzi sought sporting headlines on the international scene at the 2005 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in Livigno, Italy, where she claimed the bronze medal in the women's marathon race, adding the Swiss national championship title to her career resume in that same year.\nA year later, Henzi continued to flourish her ample success in mountain biking, as she collected a Swiss national championship title in women's cyclo-cross, and a prestigious silver medal in the marathon race at the 2006 UCI World Championships in Oisans, France. With the sudden absence of three-time world and defending Olympic champion Gunn-Rita Dahle Flesjå of Norway due to a sustained stomach virus, Henzi managed to hold off a sprint cross-country race against Germany's Sabine Spitz for an elusive gold medal in the same distance at the 2007 UCI World Championships in Verviers, Belgium. Henzi's striking effort on her gold-medal success strongly guaranteed an automatic spot for her team at the Olympics.\nHenzi qualified for the Swiss squad, along with her teammate and European junior champion Nathalie Schneitter, in the women's cross-country race at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by receiving one of the nation's two available berths for her team from the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), based on her best performance at the World Cup series and Mountain Biking World Rankings. She successfully completed a 4.8-km sturdy, treacherous cross-country course with a career-high, sixth-place effort in 1:48:41, narrowly missing out the Olympic podium by more than two seconds.\nShortly after the Olympics, Henzi established herself again as the top female cyclist by surpassing her teammate Esther Süss for another gold medal at the second and final stage of the Nissan UCI MTB World Cup in Ornans, France. Because of her continuous triumphs and a more profound dedication to the sport, Henzi was officially nominated to be the Swiss Sportswoman of the Year, but did not reach the final shortlist.\nAt the 2009 UCI World Championships in Graz, Austria, Henzi could not match a sterling ride with a bronze-medal effort in the women's cross-country race, trailing behind her rivals Spitz and Süss by almost three minutes.\n\n\nCareer achievements\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nNBC 2008 Olympics profile\nPetra Henzi at Cycling Archives (archive)",

The difficulty of the slate was reflected in their record, as they came away from their eight non-conference games with only one win. Their ACC season did not start much better, as their lost their first game before tying the next two. This was followed by two losses. Their fortunes turned around as they won two of their next three before losing their final two games. They finished 3–9–6 overall and 2–5–3 in ACC play to finish in a tie for tenth place place.  They did not qualify for the ACC Tournament and were not invited to the NCAA Tournament.\nThe Wolfpack's three wins were the second lowest in program history, with only 2014 having fewer wins. 2023 was the second straight year where the Wolfpack only finished with two conference wins. This season broke a streak of two straight NCAA tournament invites.",

    "text": "Elizabeth Hamilton (1756 or 1758 – 23 July 1816) was a Scottish essayist, poet, satirist and novelist, who in both her prose and fiction entered into the French-revolutionary era controversy in Britain over the education and rights of women.\n\n\nEarly life\nHamilton was most likely born on 25 July 1756, though the date is often given as 1758. She was born in Belfast, the third and youngest child of Charles Hamilton (d.1759), a Scottish merchant, and his wife Katherine Mackay (d.1767).\nIn Belfast, Hamilton's parents were on familiar terms with the town's prominent \"New Light\" Presbyterian families and with their Scottish Enlightenment social and political ideas. Her later thoughts on child education were greatly influenced by David Manson's co-educational English Grammar School, which her older sister Katherine attended with other children from this progressive milieu. Manson advertised the school's capacity to teach children to read and understand the English language \"without the discipline of the rod by intermingling pleasurable and healthful exercise with their instruction\".\nIn 1762, after the death of her father, her mother sent Hamilton to live with her paternal aunt, Mrs Marshall who lived near Stirling. In 1772, she lived at Ingram's Crook near Bannockburn.\n\n\nCareer\nHamilton's first literary efforts were directed in supporting her brother Charles in his orientalist and linguistic studies. After his death in 1792 she continued to publish orientalist scholarship, as well as historical, educationalist and theoretical works.\nHamilton maintained Belfast connections. She established a particularly close friendship with Martha McTier (sister of William Drennan, the founder of the United Irishmen), who pioneered schooling for poor girls. In 1793 she visited McTier in Belfast approving of her pedagogic efforts. \"My little girls\", boasted McTier, \"do not gabble over the testament only, nor read with that difficulty which prevents pleasure in it... I keep up my number and four of them can read Fox and Pitt\".\nIn 1796 she published Translation of the Letters of the Hindoo Rajah. The two volume work in the tradition of Montesquieu and Goldsmith, follows the adventures in England of an Indian prince. His encounters with slave owners, capricious aristocrats, sceptical philosophers and belligerent women leads to his progressive disillusionment with English culture.\nIn 1800 Hamilton produced Memoirs of Modern Philosophers.  The novel was a response to the Revolution Controversy of the 1790s, a discussion of “revolutionary ideas about a broader franchise, primogeniture, meritocracy, marriage and divorce”. Conservative feminists such as Hannah More argued that “there is a different bent of understanding in the sexes” while those their detractors denounced as \"Jacobins\",  such as Mary Wollstonecraft, insisted that “there is no sex in the soul or mind” and that women were limited only by their inadequate education. In Memoirs, Hamilton occupies a middle ground, urging greater educational opportunity for women but within the bounds of a consciously Christian, middle-class morality that emphasises women's responsibility for the domestic sphere.\nHamilton's most important pedagogical works followed: Letters on Education (1801), Letters on the Elementary Principles of Education (1801), Letters addressed to the Daughter of a Nobleman, on the Formation of Religious and Moral Principle (1806), and Hints addressed to the Patrons and Directors of Schools (1815).\nIn 1808, Hamilton wrote The Cottagers of Glenburnie (1808), a celebrated tale of Scottish manners and mores which cast a critical eye on hardships and inequities endured by women in domestic life. It also occasioned a lengthy discourse on child education. The fictional Mr Gourley and Mrs Mason direct the teacher William Morrison's efforts to reorganise his school on a spare-the-rod monitorial system emphasising accountability and self-government. Mrs Gourley cites David Manson's account of \"what he calls his play school\", and in a footnote Hamilton further acknowledges Manson. His \"extraordinary talents\", she suggests, were exercised in Belfast \"in too limited a sphere\" to attract the attention they deserved.\nHamilton spent much of her later life in Edinburgh. She died in Harrogate, England after a short illness.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cousin, John William (1910).

    "text": "The Turtles were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The band achieved several Top 40 hits throughout the latter half of the 1960s, including \"It Ain't Me Babe\" (1965), \"You Baby\" (1966), \"Happy Together\" (1967), \"She'd Rather Be with Me\" (1967), \"Elenore\" (1968), and \"You Showed Me\" (1969), with \"Happy Together\" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe group originally consisted of lead vocalist Howard Kaylan, backing vocalist Mark Volman, lead guitarist Al Nichol, rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker, bassist Chuck Portz, and drummer Don Murray, with subsequent members being bassists Chip Douglas and Jim Pons, and drummers Joel Larson, Johnny Barbata, and John Seiter.\nAs the Turtles' commercial success waned by the end of the 1960s, they became plagued with management problems, lawsuits and conflicts with their label, White Whale Records, leading the group to break up in 1970. Kaylan and Volman (alongside Pons) then joined Frank Zappa's band, the Mothers of Invention, where, for contractual reasons, they performed under the name Flo & Eddie (Volman as \"Flo\", Kaylan as \"Eddie\"). After leaving Zappa at the end of 1971, Kaylan and Volman continued to perform under the Flo & Eddie name, becoming popular as a comedy rock act, and also went on to long-lasting success as session musicians for artists including John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, and Alice Cooper. In 1983, Kaylan and Volman began touring as The Turtles featuring Flo & Eddie. Kaylan ceased touring in 2018, while Volman continued to tour with the Turtles until his death in September 2025, with Ron Dante (previously of The Archies) replacing Kaylan.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n1963–1966: Formation, initial success and first personnel changes\n\n\nThe Nightriders, the Crossfires and the Tyrtles\nIn early 1963, New Yorker Howard Kaylan and Californian Mark Volman attended the same school, Westchester High in Los Angeles (Kaylan had moved from New York City as a child). The two sang in the school's a cappella choir, where Volman soon heard about Kaylan's instrumental surf music band, the Nightriders, which included Kaylan on saxophone and choir members Al Nichol on lead guitar, Don Murray on drums and Chuck Portz on bass. Volman joined the group as a saxophonist, just before the group changed its name to the Crossfires in the same year. After high school graduation, the band continued on while its members attended area colleges, picking up rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker as a sixth member along the way.\nThey released a single, \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\" b/w \"Fiberglass Jungle\", on the local \"Capco Records\" label, eventually signing with newly formed White Whale Records. Adhering to the prevailing musical trend, the group rebranded itself in 1963: with the help of KRLA and KFWB DJ and club owner Reb Foster, the Crossfires signed as a folk rock band under the name The Tyrtles, an intentionally stylized misspelling inspired by the Byrds and the Beatles. However, the trendy spelling did not survive long, and they had to name themselves The Turtles.\n\nBecause of the stylistic change from \"Surf music\" to \"Folk rock\", Kaylan and Volman dropped the saxophones to become the band's vocalists. Kaylan became the group's lead singer and keyboardist (although he would give up most of the keyboard parts to Nichol in their hits). Volman began to harmonize with Kaylan's lead singing, becoming a third guitarist as well as a percussionist for the band.\n\n\n\"It Ain't Me Babe\" and \"You Baby\"\nAs with the Byrds, the Turtles achieved breakthrough success with a cover of a Bob Dylan song. \"It Ain't Me Babe\" reached the Billboard Top 10 in the late summer of 1965, and was the title track of the band's first album. \"Let Me Be\", their second single, reached the Top 30, and \"You Baby\" charted in the Top 20 in early 1966. \"You Baby\", with its intricate vocal harmonies and upbeat tempo, was influential in the band's sound as it departed from the political, Byrds-type folk rock; the band's new sound ranged from chamber pop to straightforward pop music.\nYou Baby, the band's second album, failed to reach Billboard's Top LPs chart, and of several singles released in 1966, \"Grim Reaper of Love\" and \"Can I Get to Know You Better\" barely entered the Billboard Hot 100. One single, the tough \"Outside Chance\", written by Warren Zevon, did not chart. In 1966, the Turtles made an appearance in Universal's film Out of Sight, singing \"She'll Come Back\" on screen.\n\nIn early 1966, drummer Don Murray and bassist Chuck Portz quit the group. Murray was replaced by Joel Larson for a few months, before John Barbata became the band's new drummer in late 1966. Portz was replaced by Chip Douglas on bass.\n\n\n1966–1968: Peak years\n\n\n\"Happy Together\"\n\"Happy Together\", the first of several key Turtles singles co-written by Garry Bonner and Alan Gordon, had been rejected by countless performers. \"Happy Together\", both their biggest hit and their signature song, signaled a turning point for both the Turtles and for Chip Douglas, who provided the arrangement. The single replaced the Beatles' \"Penny Lane\" at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1967. The Turtles' only No. 1 remained there for three weeks. An album of the same name followed and peaked at No. 25. \"Happy Together\" reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. This same year saw the Turtles performing the title song (composed by John Williams with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse) for the Twentieth Century-Fox bedroom farce A Guide for the Married Man.\nImpressed by Chip Douglas's studio arrangements, Michael Nesmith approached him after a Turtles show at the Whisky a Go Go and invited him to become the Monkees' producer as that band wanted to break out of their \"manufactured\" studio mold. Douglas accepted and left the Turtles, producing the Monkees' next three albums: Headquarters; Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. (both 1967); and The Birds, the Bees & the Monkees (1968), the last of which he co-produced with the band. Meanwhile, the Turtles continued with new bassist Jim Pons replacing Douglas.\n\n\n\"She'd Rather Be with Me\", \"You Know What I Mean\" and \"She's My Girl\"\nOther hits, all written by Gordon/Bonner, followed \"Happy Together\", making 1967 a lucrative year for the Turtles. A follow-up, the brassy \"She'd Rather Be with Me\", reached No. 3 on the US charts in late spring and actually out-charted \"Happy Together\" overseas, reaching No. 4 in the UK. Two successive Top 15 songs followed: \"You Know What I Mean\" and \"She's My Girl\". Both 45s showed a psychedelic side in the band's style. During that year, the band released two albums, Happy Together and Golden Hits, the former reaching the Top 30 and the latter reaching  the Top 10. The similar album covers for Golden Hits and its 1970 companion More Golden Hits were designed by Dean Torrence of Jan & Dean.\nBy the end of 1967 the band were reduced to a five-piece, when rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker departed, citing the pressure of touring and recording new material. He moved to Grass Valley, California where he became an electrical contractor. He has denied that he left the band because John Lennon was rude to him, as Kaylan later suggested in his 2003 film My Dinner with Jimi.\n\n\nThe Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands\n\n\"Sound Asleep\" and \"The Story of Rock and Roll\", the first two singles in 1968, stalled somewhere in the middle of the Top 100. The band's fortunes changed when former member Chip Douglas returned to work with them as a producer. Late in 1968 the band released a concept album called The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands, in which the group pretended to be 11 different bands (with fanciful names including the Bigg Brothers, Nature's Children, the US Teens featuring Raoul, and the Fabulous Dawgs), each with a song in a different genre. The album yielded two singles: \"Elenore\" and \"You Showed Me\", both peaking at No. 6. \"Elenore\" also reached No. 7 in the UK chart. Although both singles were successful, they did not help to boost the album's sales, which peaked at No. 128 on the Billboard Pop Albums. The 1969 hit \"You Showed Me\" had been written by the Byrds' Gene Clark and Roger (then Jim) McGuinn in 1964. It was their last Top 10 single. Television appearances included a February 1968 spot on The Mike Douglas Show, to which they returned in April 1969. 1969 saw the band undergo another personnel change, with drummer John Barbata being replaced by John Seiter.\n\n\n1969–1970: Commercial waning and break-up\n\n\nTurtle Soup\nTowards the end of 1969, the group released its next album, Turtle Soup, a critically well-received LP produced by Ray Davies of the Kinks. Inspired by the 1968 concept album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, this was Davies's only released production work for another band (but Davies had previously produced demo recordings for the Iveys). Notable tracks include \"Somewhere Friday Nite\" and \"Love in the City\". In spite of Turtle Soup's positive reception from the music press, its commercial success was marginal, and the band began to disintegrate.\n\n\nConflicts with White Whale and disintegration\n\nLong disillusioned with their record label and its growing financial problems by this time, Kaylan and Volman resisted White Whale's efforts to turn the Turtles into something approaching an assembly-line pop act, like the early Monkees. The label apparently encouraged Kaylan and Volman to fire the rest of the band, tour with hired musicians and make records by adding their vocals to backing tracks recorded by Memphis session players. Such pressure convinced the band to record a single called \"Who Would Ever Think That I Would Marry Margaret?\", which they disowned after its release.\nThe Turtles wound down their career in 1970 with More Golden Hits, a second compilation album, and Wooden Head, a B-sides and rarities album. With the demise of the Turtles, White Whale Records lost its biggest moneymaker, had few commercially viable bands, and soon ceased operations.\n\n\nPost-Turtles\n\n\n1970s\nIn mid-1970, Kaylan and Volman joined Frank Zappa's band the Mothers of Invention, with Pons also joining in early 1971. As well as the Turtles' name, Kaylan and Volman were unable to use their real names in billings due to them being prohibited by their contract with their label White Whale Records. Because of this, Volman and Kaylan began performing under the nicknames the Phlorescent Leech & Eddie or Flo & Eddie for short. Kaylan, Volman, and Pons worked with Zappa until December 1971, when the infamous attack on Zappa at the Rainbow Theatre in London left him no choice but to cease touring for a while. During their time together the former Turtles appeared on several Zappa albums, as well as starring in his 1971 film 200 Motels. Volman and Kaylan then went on to make several duo albums, still using the Flo & Eddie name.\nVolman and Kaylan sang backing vocals on several recordings by the band T. Rex, including their worldwide 1971 hit \"Get It On (Bang a Gong)\" and the albums Electric Warrior and The Slider. When White Whale's master recordings were sold at auction in 1974, the duo won the Turtles' masters, making them the owners of their own recorded work. They promptly licensed the tracks to Sire Records, which issued them as a compilation album titled Happy Together Again. In the mid-1970s, Volman and Kaylan started their syndicated radio show titled Flo & Eddie by the Fireside, which originated from KMET in Los Angeles.\n\n\n1980s\nIn the 1980s, the duo began hosting their radio show on KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WXRK in New York City and recorded soundtrack music for children's shows like the Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake. In 1980, Flo and Eddie performed backing vocals on Alice Cooper's Flush the Fashion and sang backup on Bruce Springsteen's \"Hungry Heart\" from his album The River. 1982 saw the re-release of the Turtles' original albums through Rhino Records.\nIn 1983, they also contributed backing vocals to the self-titled debut album of British New wave band Espionage, produced by Roy Thomas Baker and released by A&M Records. Also in 1983, Howard Kaylan appeared in the comedy film Get Crazy, starring Malcolm McDowell and Daniel Stern: Kaylan played the part of Captain Cloud, a spiritual guru, leader of a caravan of time-lost hippies. In the same year, Kaylan and Volman legally regained the use of \"the Turtles\" name and began touring as the Turtles Featuring Flo and Eddie; instead of trying to reunite with their earlier bandmates, they began featuring sidemen who had played with different groups. In 1984, the Turtles embarked on a U.S. Happy Together tour with Gary Puckett & the Union Gap, Spanky & Our Gang and the Association.\nIn 1987, Kaylan and Volman appeared in a music video of their 1967 song \"Happy Together\" to promote the romantic comedy Making Mr. Right. That year also saw the debut of the previously unreleased Shell Shock album, as well as a new retrospective CD 20 Greatest Hits, both released by Rhino. The latter compilation was followed in 1988 with Turtle Wax: The Best of the Turtles, Vol. 2, which featured the best of their \"album tracks\" and previously neglected single B-sides.\nThe 1989 debut album by hip-hop combo De La Soul, 3 Feet High and Rising, featured a tape loop repeating the first 11–12 seconds of the Turtles song \"You Showed Me\" in the short album-filler skit \"Transmitting Live from Mars\", with some percussion and a sampled French language lesson added by De La Soul's producer Prince Paul. Kaylan and Volman sued for copyright damages in 1989, demanding $2.5 million but settling out of court in 1991 for $1.7 million. This established a legal precedent, causing the music industry to begin carefully crediting (and paying royalties for) sampled works on future rap music and other recordings in general.\n\n\n1990s\nIn 1991 Music Club Records released a Turtles' anthology in the United Kingdom: Happy Together: The Best of the Turtles. In 1993, Rhino Records presented Captured Live, a live album of their 1992 tour. In 1994 Sundazed Music re-released all of the Turtles' original albums, and in 1999 Varèse Sarabande released Happy Together: The Best of White Whale Records, which included many of the Turtles' singles.\nOriginal drummer Don Murray died on March 22, 1996, at the age of 50.\n\n\n2000s\nIn 2002, the film Adaptation used their song \"Happy Together\" extensively as a device to portray the closeness of the two brothers Kaufman, both played by Nicolas Cage; this film closes with the Turtles' version over the final credit scroll and time lapse photography.\nAlso the 2005 film Imagine Me & You, the title of which was taken from the first line of the song \"Happy Together\", used this song in its end credits. In 2009, a Turtles compilation CD titled Save the Turtles: The Turtles Greatest Hits was issued on their FloEdCo Record label and distributed by Manifesto Records.\n\n\n2010s\nStarting in the summer of 2010, the Turtles Featuring Flo & Eddie toured throughout the United States as part of the Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour, an oldies concert series that retained the \"Happy Together\" moniker in subsequent years. They performed alongside other 1960s and 1970s pop stars, including Gary Puckett, Mitch Ryder, Mark Lindsay, Mark Farner, Gary Lewis, and Micky Dolenz. The 2015 tour featured the Buckinghams, the Cowsills, the Grass Roots, and the Association. In 2016, the complete output of the Turtles was reissued as two box sets, titled The Complete Original Album Collection and All the Singles. The expanded editions of the six albums contained in the former were issued separately in 2017.\nIn 2018, since Kaylan required heart and back surgery, he was told by his doctors to cease touring, so Ron Dante (a prolific session musician of the Archies, the Cuff Links and the Detergents fame) replaced him.\n\n\n2020s\nOriginal rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker died on November 12, 2020, at the age of 74.\nDrummer John Barbata died on May 8, 2024, at the age of 79.\nVolman died after a short illness on September 5, 2025, at the age of 78.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nFormer members\nHoward Kaylan – lead vocals, keyboards (1965–1970, 1983–2018)\nMark Volman – harmony and backing vocals, guitar, percussion (1965–1970, 1983–2025; his death)\nAl Nichol – lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1965–1970)\nJim Tucker – acoustic and electric rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1965–1967; died 2020)\nChuck Portz – bass guitar (1965–1966)\nDon Murray – drums (1965–1966; died 1996)\nChip Douglas – bass guitar, backing vocals (1966–1967)\nJoel Larson – drums (1966)\nJohn Barbata – drums, percussion (1966–1969; died 2024)\nJim Pons – bass guitar, backing vocals (1967–1970)\nJohn Seiter – drums (1969–1970)\nRon Dante – lead vocals, guitar (2018–2025)\n\n\nTimeline (Original incarnation of the band, 1965–1970)\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nSee also\n 1960s portal\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nThe Turtles discography at Discogs\nThe Turtles at IMDb",
    "summary": "The Turtles were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The band achieved several Top 40 hits throughout the latter half of the 1960s, including \"It Ain't Me Babe\" (1965), \"You Baby\" (1966), \"Happy Together\" (1967), \"She'd Rather Be with Me\" (1967), \"Elenore\" (1968), and \"You Showed Me\" (1969), with \"Happy Together\" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe group originally consisted of lead vocalist Howard Kaylan, backing vocalist Mark Volman, lead guitarist Al Nichol, rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker, bassist Chuck Portz, and drummer Don Murray, with subsequent members being bassists Chip Douglas and Jim Pons, and drummers Joel Larson, Johnny Barbata, and John Seiter.\nAs the Turtles' commercial success waned by the end of the 1960s, they became plagued with management problems, lawsuits and conflicts with their label, White Whale Records, leading the group to break up in 1970. Kaylan and Volman (alongside Pons) then joined Frank Zappa's band, the Mothers of Invention, where, for contractual reasons, they performed under the name Flo & Eddie (Volman as \"Flo\", Kaylan as \"Eddie\"). After leaving Zappa at the end of 1971, Kaylan and Volman continued to perform under the Flo & Eddie name, becoming popular as a comedy rock act, and also went on to long-lasting success as session musicians for artists including John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, and Alice Cooper. In 1983, Kaylan and Volman began touring as The Turtles featuring Flo & Eddie. Kaylan ceased touring in 2018, while Volman continued to tour with the Turtles until his death in September 2025, with Ron Dante (previously of The Archies) replacing Kaylan.",

A critic from TimesNow gave the film the same rating and wrote that \"there was real potential and promise in Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout to build something interesting. But the red herrings grow tiresome and the final reveal, in which the antagonist basically reveal all their intentions, drags the story and the film by a good 20 minutes or so\".\nA critic from Pinkvilla rated the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Silence 2 is a long and tiring watch that simply fails to connect. The performances also fail to match the level of a no-nonsense investigative-thriller\". A critic from Outlook rated the film one-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that \"The only good part about Silence 2: The Night Owl Bar Shootout is the camera work. The camera work is smooth, and it keeps your attention in this poorly written whodunit\".\nIn a review for India Today, Zinia Bandyopadhyay wrote that, in particular because of its dialogues, the film \"fails to impress as a crime thriller despite its potential\".

    "text": "X1 (EKS-wun; Korean: 엑스원, romanized: ekseuwon) was a South Korean boy group formed by CJ ENM through the Mnet reality competition show Produce X 101. The group was composed of eleven members: Kim Yo-han, Kim Woo-seok, Han Seung-woo, Song Hyeong-jun, Cho Seung-youn, Son Dong-pyo, Lee Han-gyul, Nam Do-hyon, Cha Jun-ho, Kang Min-hee, and Lee Eun-sang. The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with the single \"Flash\" under Swing Entertainment and was co-managed by Stone Music Entertainment.\nInitially contracted for five years, the Mnet vote manipulation investigation led to a halt in their activities, and after an unsuccessful negotiation about the group's future between the members' individual agencies, they disbanded on January 6, 2020.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nPre-debut: Produce X 101\nX1 was formed through the survival competition series Produce X 101, which aired on Mnet from May 3, 2019, until July 19, 2019. Out of an initial 101 trainees participating, the final 10 were chosen out of the remaining 20 trainees in the final week of the show. The final member, known as the rank X member, was selected from the remaining trainees based on the highest number of cumulative votes. All members were announced via the final episode, which was broadcast live on July 19, 2019.\nPrior to the program, several members had already been active in the music industry. Cho Seung-youn debuted as a member of the group Uniq in 2014. In 2016, following his participation on  Show Me the Money 5, he debuted as a solo artist under the stage name Luizy in 2016, before adopting the stage name WOODZ in 2018. He was also active as a music producer for various artists. Kim Woo-seok debuted in the group Up10tion under the name Wooshin in September 2015, and was also the host of SBS MTV's The Show alongside Produce 101 season 1 contestant and former I.O.I member Jeon So-mi in 2016. Han Seung-woo debuted as a member of the group Victon in 2016. Lee Han-gyul previously debuted as a member of Yama and Hotchicks Entertainment's ballad group IM and also competed alongside other members of IM in KBS2's The Unit, where he placed 13th overall. Nam Do-hyon was a contestant in MBC's Under Nineteen as a member of the Rap Team. Kang Min-hee was featured in the music video for Mad Clown and Ailee's song \"Thirst\" in 2018. Son Dong-pyo was active as a member of the dance group Artbeat in 2018.\nThe group's contract was initially intended to be for five years following their debut, with the first 2.5 years of the contract being an exclusive contract, followed by the second 2.5 years being a non-exclusive contract, meaning that the individual members can return to co-promote with their original agencies after the first half of their contract was over.\n\n\n2019: Debut and vote manipulation investigation\n\nIn the final episode of Produce X 101, the final eleven contestants were announced as members of X1, and were set to debut under Stone Music's Swing Entertainment, the label which housed the Produce 101 's Wanna One. However, following a civil lawsuit filed against Mnet due to Produce X 101's vote manipulation allegations, several brands cancelled their endorsement deals with X1 or put them on hold. Some of the agencies representing the contestants refused to sign the group's contract until the allegations cleared up. In spite of this, X1's debut proceeded as planned.\nAhead of their official debut, the group's reality show X1 Flash premiered on August 22, 2019 through Mnet. The reality show followed the members as they prepared for their upcoming debut, as well as a glimpse into their daily lives. On August 1, it was announced that their debut album would be titled Emergency: Quantum Leap with the title track \"Flash\", composed by Score, Megatone and Onestar. The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with a debut showcase at Gocheok Sky Dome. On September 3, X1 won their first-ever music show win through SBS MTV's The Show one week after debut. They received 11 wins in total for their debut song, \"Flash\" with their 11th win being on M Countdown on September 19.\nOn November 5, 2019, Ahn Joon-young, the producer of Produce X 101, was arrested, and he later admitted to manipulating the vote rankings. Subsequently, X1 had several public appearances cancelled and Mnet announced that plans for the group's promotion were on hold. On December 30, 2019, CJ ENM announced that members and their agencies were in discussions on the group's future.\n\n\n2020: Disbandment\nOn January 6, 2020, CJ ENM, Swing Entertainment, and the members' individual agencies held a meeting to determine the future of the group. After deliberating for an hour about whether the group should continue to promote or disband, a secret ballot was held between the members' agencies. Prior to voting, the agencies had agreed that the group could only continue if there was unanimous agreement to do so, or the group would disband. Four agencies voted in favor of the continuation of X1's activities, and four agencies voted against the continuation of X1's activities, and one agency whose vote was unclear was ultimately discarded.\nDuring the meeting, a representative of CJ ENM relayed X1's members' request to attend the meeting in order to express to the representatives their wishes to continue promotions as a group. However, this request was turned down by another agency. Although X1 members were ultimately not invited to the meeting, Swing CEO Cho Yoo-myung later also expressed their collective desire to have attended. Thus, despite the absence of X1's members in the meeting, it was determined within 2 hours of the start of the meeting that the group would disband. The group's disbandment was officially announced to the public on the same day.\nFollowing the decision of X1's disbandment, CJ ENM suggested that a previously recorded winter track be released as a goodbye song, but the idea was rejected by two or three of the members' agencies. Similarly, a suggestion from a member's agency to record a final video was rejected by another agency.\n\n\nFormer members\nKim Yo-han (김요한)\nKim Woo-seok (김우석)\nHan Seung-woo (한승우) – leader\nSong Hyeong-jun (송형준)\nCho Seung-youn (조승연)\nSon Dong-pyo (손동표)\nLee Han-gyul (이한결)\nNam Do-hyon (남도현)\nCha Jun-ho (차준호)\nKang Min-hee (강민희)\nLee Eun-sang (이은상)\n\n\nAchievements\nPrior to debut, X1 made their Billboard chart debut on the charts Social 50 and Emerging Artists at number six and number eleven respectively.\nEmergency: Quantum Leap sold over 500,000 physical copies in the first week of sales, breaking the record of the highest first week sales for a debut album in South Korea; the record was previously set by solo artist, Kang Daniel with his debut album, Color on Me.\nOn July 26, 2020, the group's debut and only music video \"Flash\" reached over 100 million views on Youtube.

    "text": "Yukio Kasahara (笠原 幸雄, Kasahara Yukio; 6 November 1889 – 2 January 1988) was a leading general in the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\n\nBiography\nKasahara was born into a military family in Sendai, but attended the First Tokyo Middle School as a youth. He graduated from the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1913, and from the 22nd class of the Army Staff College in November 1918.\nKasahara was sent as a military attaché to Moscow, Russia from 1929 to 1932, and became fluent in the Russian language. On March 4, 1931, a telegram sent by Kasahara to the general staff in Tokyo was intercepted and decoded by Soviet  military intelligence and forwarded to Stalin. In that, Yukio belittled Red Army's capabilities and urged \"a speedy war\" before the good timing passes. On December, 13, 1931, the OGPU decoded and forwarded to Stalin a conversation between Kasahara and his superior visiting Moscow, which advocating for war before the USSR became too strong and underscoring that “the countries on the Soviet western border (i.e., at a minimum Poland and Romania) are in a position to act with us. The thinking of Japanese ambassador to USSR, Hirota Koki, “the cardinal objective of this war must lay not so much in protecting Japan from Communism as in seizing the Soviet Far East and Eastern Siberia”, was also mentioned.\nOn his return to Japan, he was assigned to the Soviet Branch of the 4th Section (European & American Military Intelligence), 2nd Bureau, of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff.\nFrom 1933 to 1934, he became an instructor at the Cavalry School, and was subsequently appointed commander of the Imperial Guards Cavalry Regiment from 1934 to 1936.  Kasahara returned to the 2nd Bureau of the General Staff in 1936 as Chief of the 4th Section, 5th Section and 6th Section, covering all of the European, American and Russian Intelligence. He was a major proponent of the Strike North Group (hokushin-ron) philosophy, feeling strongly that the Soviet Union posed a major threat and a major opportunity for Japan.\nFrom 1937 to 1938, Kasahara was sent to Manchukuo as Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He visited Germany as part of a military mission in 1938 after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, and returned to the General Staff on his return to Japan.  However, Kasahara was soon dispatched back to China. From 1939 to 1941, he served as Chief of Staff of the Northern China Area Army. He was then promoted to commander in chief of the IJA 12th Division from 1941 to 1942.  For most of the remainder of the war (1942–1945), Kasahara served as Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. However, in April 1945, he was appointed to replace General Yoshio Kozuki as commander of the IJA 11th Army, and thus participated in the Operation Ichi-Go offensive, notably at the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBooks\nFuller, Richard (1992).

    "title": "Electricity sector in the Dominican Republic",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=14606341",
    "text": "The power sector in the Dominican Republic has traditionally been, and still is, a bottleneck to the country's economic growth. A prolonged electricity crisis and ineffective remedial measures have led to a vicious cycle of regular blackouts, high operating costs of the distribution companies, large losses including electricity theft through illegal connections, high retail tariffs to cover these inefficiencies, low bill collection rates, a significant fiscal burden for the government through direct and indirect subsidies, and very high costs for consumers as many of them have to rely on expensive alternative self-generated electricity. According to the World Bank, the revitalization of the Dominican economy depends greatly on a sound reform of the sector.\n\n\nElectricity supply and demand\n\n\nInstalled capacity\nElectricity generation in the Dominican Republic is dominated by thermal units fired mostly by imported oil or gas (or liquefied natural gas). At the end of 2006, total installed capacity of public utilities was 3,394 MW, of which 86% was fossil fuels and 14% was hydroelectric. The detailed share for the different sources is as follows: \nThe large coal-fired Punta Catalina power plant has been accused of causing considerable soil, water and pollution, reportedly affecting the health and livelihoods of local residents.\n\nSource: Electricity Superintendence Statistics, 2006\nTotal electricity generated in 2006 was 10.7 TWh. Generation experienced a 7.7% annual increase between 1996 and 2005. However, between 2004 and 2006, there has been an average annual decrease of about 10% in total electricity generated.,\n\n\nPlanned expansion\nCurrently, there are plans for the construction of two 600MW coal-fired plants, Montecristi and Azúa, by the private sector. It is also expected that, by 2012, an additional 762MW of hydroelectric capacity will have been added to the generation system. The first three hydropower plants with a combined capacity of 240MW are:\n\nPinalito with 50 MW on the Rio Tireo and the Rio Blanco,\nPalomino with 99 MW at the confluence of the rivers Yaque Del Sur and Blanco, and\nLas Placetas with 87 MW, involving an inter-basin transfer from the Rio Bao to the Rio Jaguá\nThe two first plants are already under construction.\n\n\nAlternative sources for self-generation\nAs a response to the electricity supply crisis (see crisis section below)., many consumers turned to alternative self-generation units such as small diesel generators, inverters, kerosene lamps or large power generators (for large industrial consumers). It is estimated that total installed capacity in 2006 was 5,518MW, which means that self-generation accounted for about 2,214MW, equivalent to 63% of the 3,394MW total capacity of public utilities and 38% of total installed capacity. The costs associated with this self-generation capacity are very high as they include equipment purchase, maintenance and fuel supply. This affects the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. For the latter, about 60% of its electricity consumption is self-generated.\n\n\nDemand\nElectricity demand in the Dominican Republic has grown considerably since the early 1990s, at a yearly average of 10% between 1992 and 2003. Consumption is very close to the regional average, with annual per capita consumption of 1,349 kWh in 2003. Total electricity sold in 2005 was 3.72 TWh. Demand has constrained supply (see crisis section below), which in turn is limited by subsidies (see subsidies below)\nIn 2001, the share of each sector in the electricity sold by the three distribution companies (EdeNorte, EdeSur and EdeEste) was as follows:\n\nResidential: 44%\nCommercial: 10%\nIndustrial: 30%\nPublic: 16%\n\n\nDemand projections\nAnnual demand increase has been estimated at about 6% for the upcoming years.\n\n\nAccess to electricity\n\nDistribution networks cover 88% of the population, with about 8% of the connections thought to be illegal. Government plans aim to reach 95% total coverage by 2015.\n\n\nService quality\nService quality in the Dominican Republic has suffered a steady deterioration since the 1980s. Frequent and prolonged blackouts result mainly from financial causes (i.e. high system losses and low bill collection) that are further aggravated by technical factors (i.e. unadequate investments in transmission and distribution). Poor service quality is also characterized by large voltage and frequency fluctuations.\n\n\nInterruption frequency and duration\nThe transmission system in the Dominican Republic is weak and overloaded, failing to provide reliable power and causing system-wide blackouts. East-west and north-south transmission lines need to be reinforced in order to deliver electricity to the capital and northern regions and to transmit power from the new power plants in the eastern region.\n\n\nDistribution losses\nDistribution is the most dysfunctional element of the country's power system. Distribution losses in the Dominican Republic have historically been high and have increased even further in recent years. In 2005, the percentage of losses was 42.5%, up from 28.5% in 2002. This is far above the 13.5% average for LAC. Sustained poor service quality and relatively high prices have induced theft through illegal connections and non-payment of electricity bills. Recent data for 2007 show that only about 59% of power purchased by the distribution companies is eventually paid for by consumers  (88% would be the target percentage for a well-managed distribution company ). Although still very low, this percentage has shown an improvement up from about 52% in 2005.\n\n\nResponsibilities in the electricity sector\n\n\nPolicy and regulation\nThe National Energy Commission (Comisión Nacional de la Energía, CNE) is the policy agency, one of its main responsibilities being the elaboration of the National Energy Plan. The CNE presented in 2004 the National Energy Plan for the period 2004-2015 as well as the Indicative Plan of Electricity Generation (PIEGE) for the period 2006-2020. \nThe Electricity Superintendence (Superintendencia de Electricidad, SIE) is the regulatory agency, while the Coordination Agency (Organismo Coordinador, OC) was created to coordinate dispatch of electricity. \nThe Dominican Corporation of State Electricity Companies (Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales - CDEEE) is a holding company that brings together all government-owned generation, transmission and distribution companies and associated government programs in the country. It consists of:\n\nHydroelectricity Generation Company\nElectricity Transmission Company, ETED\nRural and Suburban Electrification Unit, UERS\nBlackout Reduction Program, PRA\n50% of the North Distribution Company, EdeNorte\n50% of the South Distribution Company, EdeSur\nthe 50% government holding of the East Distribution Company, EdeEste\nEdeNorte and EdeSur are entirely government-owned, the remaining 50% shares being held by the government's Enterprise Trust Fund, Fondo Patrimonial de las Empresas (FONPER). EdeEste is a mixed private-public company.\n\n\nGeneration\n\n86% of generation capacity is privately owned (excluding self-generation), and 14% is publicly owned. Generation capacity is shared among the different companies as follows:\n\nSource: Electricity Superintendence Statistics\n\n\nTransmission\nThe transmission system, which is under the full responsibility of the state-owned company ETED (Electricity Transmission Company), consists of 940 km of 138kV single-line circuit lines that radiate from Santo Domingo to the north, east, and west.\n\n\nDistribution\nIn the Dominican Republic, there are three distribution companies. The government owns two of them, EdeNorte and EdeSur, through the CDEEE (50%) and the Fondo Patrimonial de las Empresas (FONPER). It also maintains a 50% ownership of the third one, EdeEste, (the additional 50% is owned by the Trust Company of the West (TCW) which is operated by AES Corporation, its original buyer. The three companies serve a similar share of the market.\n\n\nRenewable energy resources\nAs it has been described, most electricity generation in the Dominican Republic comes from thermal sources. Only 14% of the installed capacity is hydroelectric, with this percentage falling to below 9% when all the thermal self-generation is accounted for. The exploitation of other renewable resources (i.e. solar, wind) is very limited. However, this situation is expected to change following the enactment of in May 2007 of the Law of Incentives to Renewable Energy and Special Regimes (Law No. 57-07). Among other incentives, this law establishes financing at favorable interest rates for 75% of the cost\nof equipment for households that install renewable technologies for self-generation and for communities that develop small-scale projects (below 500 kW).\n\n\nHydroelectricity\nAs it has been mentioned, Egehid's expansion plan contemplates the addition of 762MW of hydroelectricity capacity in the period 2006-2012. According to CDEEE, the first of the new series of dams and hydropower plants - Pinalito - is a \"model of environmental management\", with only 12 families resettled and extensive reforestation.\n\n\nWind\nA 2001 study estimated that the Dominican Republic had a wind generation potential of 68,300GWh per year, equivalent to more than six times its current power production.\n\n\nSolar\nIn March 2016, the 33.4 MW Monte Plata solar plant came online. The farm consists of 132,000 photovoltaic panels. It was built by Soventix Caribbean (www.soventix.energy), and there will be a proposed second phase consisting of 270,000 photovoltaic panels that would double the size of the plant to 69 MW.\nIn August 2018, the 57.98 MW solar park Montecristi Solar started its energy injection to the grid, and became the largest solar farm in the Caribbean with 214,000 photovoltaic panels. A second phase is planned to double the capacity to 116 MW.\nIn 2021, Girasol Solar Park was inaugurated and its currently the largest photovoltaic plant in the country and the Caribbean. It has a total installed capacity of 120 megawatts, which is estimated to produce 240,000 MWh per year.\nBuilt on an area of 220 hectares, composed of 268,200 panels with solar position followers or “trackers” that rotate 104 degrees for twelve hours a day depending on the solar movement to guarantee greater use of irradiation, which translates into an increase in the effective capacity of the project. With an investment of approximately US$100 million, the park, located in the Yaguate municipality, San Cristóbal province, increased the national photovoltaic capacity by 50%.\nIn addition, the Girasol Solar Park will annually avoid the emission into the atmosphere of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) and the import of 400,000 barrels of oil, contributing to mitigating the effects of climate change and representing savings in foreign currency, respectively. \n\n\nHistory of the electricity sector\n\n\nThe situation prior to the reforms\nPrior to the 1990s reform, the Dominican power sector was in the hands of the state-owned, vertically-integrated Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE). The operation of the company was characterized by large energy losses, poor bill collection and deficient operation and maintenance. During the 1990s, the rapid growth in the power sector mirrored the high economic growth experienced by the country. Total electricity demand increased at an annual rate of 7.5% in the years 1992-2001, while annual GDP growth was 5.9%. Generation capacity was not enough to meet peak demand, which translated into continuous supply constrains and widespread blackouts lasting up to 20 hours. In the mid-1990s, in order to address generation capacity shortages, several Independent Power Producers (IPPs) where encouraged by the government to sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the CDE. The result of these deals, often nontransparent and negotiated, was high electricity prices.\n\n\nSector reforms: 1997-2002\n\n\nSector unbundling and privatization\nThe government, aiming to solve the enduring problems of the lack of available installed capacity and constant blackouts, enacted the Public Sector Enterprises Reform Law, which provided the framework for the privatization and restructuring of the power sector. In 1998-1999, under the first government of Leonel Fernández, the sector was unbundled and the vertically state-owned monopoly, Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE), was broken into a number of generation companies. EGE (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad) Haina and EGE Itabo, which ran the thermal plants, were privatized, and three distribution companies - EdeNorte (Empresa Distribudora de Electricidad), EdeSur and EdeEste - were created and also privatized.\nAn attempt had been made in 1997 to improve the functioning of the sector by strengthening sector regulation with the appointment of a new regulator, which was part of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and thus had only limited autonomy.\n\n\nElectricity Law of 2001\nA comprehensive regulatory framework was not enacted until July 2001, with the Electricity Law (Law 125-01)passed under the government of Hipólito Mejía. Under this law, the government's operational presence in the sector was to be through three entities: \n\nthe formerly integrated utility CDE, which kept the contracts with the Independent Power Producers (IPPs);\na transmission company, Empresa de Transmisión Eléctrica Dominicana (ETED); and\na hydropower production company, Empresa de Generación Hidroeléctrica Dominicana (EGEHID).\nA new holding company, Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas (CDEE) was established to own ETED and EGEHID and to eventually substitute the CDE. Initially the government had intended to transfer its assets to manage the companies as an investment under a Trust Fund separate from the entities governing the sector, rather than using its ownership as a potential instrument for sector policy. However, this change was not implemented. \nThe 2001 Law and its supporting regulations from 2002 included the creation of an autonomous regulatory agency, the Electricity Superintendence (SIE). It also created the National Energy Commission (CNE) and a wholesale market under responsibility of a Coordinating Agency.\n\n\n2000s developments\n\n\nThe crisis and renationalization of distribution companies\nThe reform resulted in new generation facilities, which were built and financed by the private sector, and investment in distribution by the privatized companies. Thanks to the new investments, between the end of 2000 and mid-2003, effective capacity experienced a 43% increase, with the distribution network also showing improvement. This led to temporary reduction in blackouts and distribution losses and increasing operating efficiency, the combination of which translated in improvements in the quality of service. Unserved energy decreased to 11% of the potential demand in 2002, down from 40% in 1991. In the same period, capacity deficits to meet unsuppressed demand were estimated to have fallen from 30% to 16%. However, rising oil prices, the introduction of generalized subsidies and political interference negatively affected the sector's financial health. In 2003, these unfavorable conditions and strong political pressure led the government to repurchase Union Fenosa's shares in the privatized distribution companies EdeNorte and EdeSur. These companies have experienced a deteriorating operating efficiency since their renationalization.,\nThe electricity sector has been in a sustained crisis since 2002, characterized by very high losses (both technical and commercial) and frequent blackouts of long duration. This situation has led to very high economic and social costs: high fiscal costs to the government; high production costs and uncertainty to industrial consumers as a result of service interruptions; high costs to industrial and residential consumers for public and private power generation, and increased social instability, including rising crime rates, caused by frequent blackouts and disruption in basic public services (e.g. hospitals, clinics and schools). In addition, domestic and international investment has been deterred, especially in sectors that depend on a reliable power supply for their activities, although many facilities (such as tourist resorts) have their own sources of power supply.\n\n\nBlackout Reduction Program\nThe Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was established by the government in 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended in the absence of an alternative way to deal with the issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the perverse incentives built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted subsidy scheme have jeopardized the medium-term sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is part of a more comprehensive approach to solve the problems of the power sector.\nThe program was closed in 2010.\n\n\nMeasures against fraud: modification of the Electricity Law\nIn 2002, the government created the National Program to Support the Eradication of Electricity Fraud (PAEF) (Decree No. 748-02), whose main objective is to support the distribution companies in their efforts to eliminate fraud. However, results of the PAEF to date have been modest. The most serious step to combat fraud was taken in 2007 with the modification of the Electricity Law. Law 186-07, which modifies Law 125-01, criminalizes electricity fraud (e.g.illegal connections, non-payment, etc.), prescribing fines and/or jail sentences to those who breach its mandate.\n\n\nComprehensive Plan for the Electricity Sector\nIn 2006, by request of President Leonel Fernández, the CDEEE, the CNE and the SIE designed a Comprehensive Plan for the Electricity Sector for the period 2006-2012. This Plan aims at achieving self-sustainability of the Electricity Sector in the Dominican Republic. The main objectives of the plan are: achieve financial sustainability of the sector, reduce electricity prices for final consumers and promote an efficient use of energy. For the medium term, it recommends the renegotiation of contracts with generators, the construction of coal plants, the development of transmission plans, the addition of new hydroelectric capacity, the promotion of renewable energy sources, a review of cross-subsidies and the strengthening of the Electricity Superintendence (SIE).\n\n\nTariffs and subsidies\n\n\nTariffs\nElectricity tariffs in the Dominican Republic are among the highest in the Latin American and Caribbean region. This is due to several factors: reliance on imported oil, weak institutional environment, difficulties to pursue large non-payers, high prices originally negotiated in power purchase agreements with the generators, high commercial risks faced by generators such as non-payment or delayed payment by the distribution companies and/or the government, low cash recovery index (CRI), and high operating costs in the distribution companies.\nThe country's policy of cross-subsidizing residential tariffs by disproportionate increases in commercial and industrial tariffs translates into higher rates for industrial and commercial consumers compared to residential consumers. In 2007, the average residential tariff was US$0.160 per kWh (LAC weighted average was US$0.115 in 2005), while the average industrial tariff was 0.230 (LAC weighted average was US$0.107 per kWh in 2005) and the average commercial tariff was as high as US$0.290 per kWh.\n\n\nSubsidies\nElectricity subsidies are estimated to exceed US$ 1 billion in 2008, corresponding to a stunning 3% of GDP. The need for subsidies has increased due to higher oil prices while electricity tariffs have been kept constant. Subsidies are channeled through two major mechanisms: The Blackout Reduction Program and the Tariff Stabilization Fund.\nThe Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) is targeted to poor areas. Due to low collections rates, these consumers have been receiving virtually free electricity since the program's inception.\nResidential consumers outside the PRA areas and thus likely not to be among the poorest, are charged below-cost electricity prices for consumption below 700 kWh/month, a very high threshold by international standards. About 80% of residential users outside the PRA areas fall into this category. This subsidy is drawn from the Tariff Stabilization Fund (FET), which was designed to reduce the impact of high oil prices. The financial burden in this case is transferred to the distribution companies, which have found themselves unable to cover their costs in a scenario of rising oil prices, low efficiency and a limited customer base that could be charged to finance the cross-subsidy. This situation has forced the government to provide much higher than expected subsidies to the sector, which in turn translates into reduced ability to finance investments in other key sectors such as health and education. The government has started to reduce cross-subsidies gradually, with the final objective of limiting them to households with monthly consumption below 200 kWh, which is closer to thresholds for subsidized residential electricity encountered in other countries.\n\n\nInvestment and financing\nThe power sector attracted an important amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) following the privatization of the main generation facilities and the distribution companies in 1999 and the subsequent expansion in generation capacity. In the period 1996-2000, the sector accounted for over 28% of FDI, reaching 37% in 2001.\n\n\nGeneration\nAs previously described, the precarious situation of the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic is not caused primarily by limited generation capacity. Although a reduction of losses may provide a more economic way of resolving the crisis, there are plans for significant new investments in new generation capacity, especially in hydropower.\nThe private generation companies raise capital in the market. For example, in April 2007 EGE Haina raised US$ 175m in capital through 10-year bonds that were more than 10 times oversubscribed.\nAs for hydropower, Egehid's has identified in its 2006-2012 expansion plan new projects for an estimated value of US$1,442 million. The construction of first three dams (Pinalito, Palomino and Las Placetas) and associated hydropower plants will be partially financed through tied export financing from the Brazilian Development Bank BNDES approved in November 2006. The loans for the Palomino and Las Placetas projects total US$ 152.5 million, while the total costs of the facilities is estimated at US$ 512.5 million. A loan for the Pinalito project had already been approved earlier. Additional financing is provided by commercial Banks such as ABN and BNP Paribas.\n\n\nTransmission\nThere are bottlenecks in the transmission system that need to be addressed. The owner of the system, the CDE, lacks financial resources to improve the grid and the existing legislation has not allowed other mechanisms to mobilize private sector resources for transmission.\nThe Electricity Transmission Company (ETED) has produced an expansion plan for the transmission network to be executed in the period 2006-2012. Financing of US$284 million has been secured for the 2006-2008 period, with an additional US$80.75 million in process. Furthermore, US$222.5 million will be needed to finance the projects contemplated in the expansion plan for the period 2008-2012.\n\n\nRural electrification\nThe Dominican Government claims to have plans to invest, through the Rural and Suburban Electrification Unit (UERS), about RD$1,500 million (US$890 million) in large number of scattered projects.\n\n\nSummary of private participation in the electricity sector\nIn 1998–1999, the Public Sector Enterprises Reform Law provided the framework for the privatization and restructuring of the power sector, previously controlled by the vertically state-owned monopoly, Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE). A comprehensive regulatory framework was enacted in 2001, which determined the government's operational presence in the sector through three entities: CDE(generation), EGEHID (hydroelectric generation), and ETED (transmission). As for distribution, two of the three existing companies, EdeNorte and EdeSur, are owned by the government, who also holds 50% ownership of the third one, EdeEste.\n\n\nElectricity and the environment\n\n\nResponsibility for the environment\nThe Secretaría de Estado de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales is the institution in charge of the conservation, protection and regulation of the sustainable use of the natural resources and the environment in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nOLADE (Latin American Energy Organization) estimated that CO2 emissions from electricity production in 2003 were 7.63 million tons of CO2, which corresponds to 46% of total emissions from the energy sector. This high contribution to emissions from electricity production in comparison with other countries in the region is due to the high share of thermal generation.\n\n\nCDM projects in electricity\nCurrently (December 2007), there is just one registered CDM project in the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic, the El Guanillo wind farm, with estimated emission reductions of 123,916 tCO2e per year.\n\n\nExternal assistance\n\n\nWorld Bank\nThe World Bank is currently financing a Power Sector Technical Assistance Project. The US$10 million project will receive US$7.3 million funding from the Bank in the period 2004-2009. This project aims to: (i) strengthen the Government's regulatory and consumer protection performance, (ii) improve policy formulation and implementation, (iii) design the transmission grid and the wholesale power market, (iv) increase the quantity and quality of electricity for the poor, and (v) protect the environment. \nThe World Bank is also financing the Second Generation Power Sector Reforms of the Dominican Republic Power Sector Program through US$150 million of financing in the period 2005-2008. The power sector program, which consists of two policy-based loans and an investment loan for transmission and service expansion, seeks to support the Government's strategy for the recovery of the power sector, and in particular to: improve the quality of service, especially by reducing the widespread blackouts of recent years; establish conditions that would permit the financial sustainability of all efficiently-operated companies in the sector; and, increase the percentage of the population with access to electricity.\n\n\nInter-American Development Bank\nThe Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) supported the electricity sector reforms of the late 1990s, the creation of a National Energy Council and demand-side management to reduce electricity consumption through various technical assistance projects approved between 1996 and 2001. The IDB's private-sector arm also provided loans to the private electricity distribution companies Ede Sur and Ede Norte in 1999.\n\n\nSee also\n\nEconomy of the Dominican Republic\nWater supply and sanitation in the Dominican Republic\nHistory of the Dominican Republic\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic\n\n\nSources\nComisión Nacional de Energía, 2004.

    "summary": "The power sector in the Dominican Republic has traditionally been, and still is, a bottleneck to the country's economic growth. A prolonged electricity crisis and ineffective remedial measures have led to a vicious cycle of regular blackouts, high operating costs of the distribution companies, large losses including electricity theft through illegal connections, high retail tariffs to cover these inefficiencies, low bill collection rates, a significant fiscal burden for the government through direct and indirect subsidies, and very high costs for consumers as many of them have to rely on expensive alternative self-generated electricity. According to the World Bank, the revitalization of the Dominican economy depends greatly on a sound reform of the sector.",

The album was produced by Joe Henry and was released on May 3, 2019 by Nonesuch Records.\nThe track \"I'm on My Way\" from the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\nCritical reception\n\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, There is No Other received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 from 8 critic scores.\nThe album, which primarily features Giddens and Turrisi playing together on several instruments, presents a mixture of  interpretations to a diverse collection of songs from around the world with two original songs (by Giddens). Since its release, There Is No Other was publicly introduced as an album which is \"Tracing the overlooked movement of sounds from Africa and the Arabic world and their influence on European and American music...\" and which \"...illuminates the universality of music and the commonality of the human experience\".\nThe reviews usually followed these lines of introduction, and mainly praised the unique implementation and the high quality outcome. However, among the writing concerning the album there is an article which stands out for reviewing There Is No Other in a wider musicological context, pointing out its relation to the work of Peter Van der Merwe, especially  Van der Merwe's meticulously researched book \"Origins of the Popular Style\".\nThe article, written by John Jeremiah Sullivan (as an in-depth examination of the cultural and historical context of Giddens' work as a whole) explains that in his research: \"Van der Merwe shows how the “gliding chromaticism” characteristic of the blues spread via Islamic influence into West Africa (in particular the Senegambia region) and, via Spain, into Ireland and the “Celtic fringe.” From those places, these styles and sounds rode farther west, to North America, on slave ships and immigrant ships. In the American South, the Celtic and the African musical traditions met. It was an odd family reunion. Each culture had its own songs, but the idioms understood one another. The result was American music.\". Against that background, Sullivan therefore opines that \"the album that Giddens and Turrisi have made together functions as a kind of proof of Van der Merwe’s musicological thesis\".\n\"To my ears, the album is the first true Rhiannon Giddens record. Joe Henry produced it, beautifully, by getting as far out of the way as possible. The arrangements are stark. The engineering and the mike placement are direct and intimate. It’s the sonic equivalent of a long still shot in natural light\".\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nReferences",

They are based on a full quantum theory, and form a closed set of integro-differential equations for the quantum dynamics of microscopic polarization and charge carrier distribution. The SBEs are named after the structural analogy to the optical Bloch equations that describe the excitation dynamics in a two-level atom interacting with a classical electromagnetic field. As the major complication beyond the atomic approach, the SBEs must address the many-body interactions resulting from Coulomb force among charges and the coupling among lattice vibrations and electrons. \n\n\nBackground\nThe optical response of a semiconductor follows if one can determine its  macroscopic polarization \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {P} }\n  \n as a function of the electric field \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {E} }\n  \n that excites it.

At this level of sophistication, one can use the SBEs to predict optical response of semiconductors without phenomenological parameters, which gives the SBEs a very high degree of predictability. Indeed, one can use the SBEs in order to predict suitable laser designs through the accurate knowledge they produce about the semiconductor's gain spectrum. One can even use the SBEs to deduce existence of correlations, such as bound excitons, from quantitative measurements.\nThe presented SBEs are formulated in the momentum space since carrier's crystal momentum follows from \n  \n    \n      \n        ℏ\n        \n          k\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\hbar \\mathbf {k} }\n  \n.

The eigenstates of the Wannier equation is analogous to bound solutions of the hydrogen problem of quantum mechanics. These are often referred to as exciton solutions and they formally describe Coulombic binding by oppositely charged electrons and holes.\nHowever, a real exciton is a true two-particle correlation because one must then have a correlation between one electron to another hole. Therefore, the appearance of exciton resonances in the polarization does not signify the presence of excitons because \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            \n              k\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{\\mathbf {k} }}\n  \n is a single-particle transition amplitude. The excitonic resonances are a direct consequence of Coulomb coupling among all transitions possible in the system. In other words, the single-particle transitions themselves are influenced by Coulomb interaction making it possible to detect exciton resonance in optical response even when true excitons are not present.\nTherefore, it is often customary to specify optical resonances as excitonic instead of exciton resonances. The actual role of excitons on optical response can only be deduced by quantitative changes to induce to the linewidth and energy shift of excitonic resonances.\nThe solutions of the Wannier equation produce valuable insight to the basic properties of a semiconductor's optical response. In particular, one can solve the steady-state solutions of the SBEs to predict optical absorption spectrum  analytically with the so-called Elliott formula. In this form, one can verify that an unexcited semiconductor shows several excitonic absorption resonances well below the fundamental bandgap energy. Obviously, this situation cannot be probing excitons because the initial many-body system does not contain electrons and holes to begin with. Furthermore, the probing can, in principle, be performed so gently that one essentially does not excite electron–hole pairs. This gedanken experiment illustrates nicely why one can detect excitonic resonances without having excitons in the system, all due to virtue of Coulomb coupling among transition amplitudes.\n\n\nExtensions\nThe SBEs are particularly useful when solving the light propagation through a semiconductor structure. In this case, one needs to solve the SBEs together with the Maxwell's equations driven by the optical polarization. This self-consistent set is called the Maxwell–SBEs and is frequently applied to analyze present-day experiments and to simulate device designs.\nAt this level, the SBEs provide an extremely versatile method that describes linear as well as nonlinear phenomena such as excitonic effects, propagation effects, semiconductor microcavity effects, four-wave-mixing, polaritons in semiconductor microcavities, gain spectroscopy, and so on. One can also generalize the SBEs by including excitation with terahertz (THz) fields that are typically resonant with intraband transitions. One can also quantize the light field and investigate quantum-optical effects that result. In this situation, the SBEs become coupled to the semiconductor luminescence equations.\n\n\nSee also\nAbsorption\nSemiconductor-luminescence equations\nElliott formula\nQuantum-optical spectroscopy\nOptical Bloch equations\nWannier equation\nGain spectroscopy of semiconductors\nSemiconductor laser theory\nNonlinear theory of semiconductor lasers\n\n\nFurther reading\nAshcroft, Neil W.; Mermin, N.

    "summary": "The  semiconductor Bloch equations (abbreviated as SBEs) describe the optical response of semiconductors excited by coherent classical light sources, such as lasers. They are based on a full quantum theory, and form a closed set of integro-differential equations for the quantum dynamics of microscopic polarization and charge carrier distribution. The SBEs are named after the structural analogy to the optical Bloch equations that describe the excitation dynamics in a two-level atom interacting with a classical electromagnetic field. As the major complication beyond the atomic approach, the SBEs must address the many-body interactions resulting from Coulomb force among charges and the coupling among lattice vibrations and electrons.

He was a postgraduate student supervised by Adrian Bird at the Wellcome Centre for Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, where he studied the methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2, part of the DNA methylation system, which is associated with Rett syndrome. He obtained his Doctor of Philosophy in 2005.\n\n\nCareer and research\nKlose spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Yi Zhang, who was based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, identifying a novel family of histone lysine demethylase enzymes. He then moved to the University of Oxford where, in 2008, he established himself as a Principal Investigator at the Department of Biochemistry at Oxford supported by a Wellcome Trust career development fellowship. Five years after this, he secured a Wellcome Trust senior research fellowship. Since then, he has been a Monsanto senior research fellow, a post associated with Exeter College, Oxford, and in 2014 was appointed as professor of cell and molecular biology. In 2017 he was appointed Professor of Genetics, University of Oxford, a chair held at the department of biochemistry and associated with a fellowship at Keble College, Oxford.\nKlose's work throughout his career has sought to explain how, during development, cell types with the same DNA use chromatin-based and epigenetic mechanisms to restrict gene expression to the correct complement of genes in a stable and heritable way. In particular, he has focused on understanding how DNA encoded regulatory elements in vertebrates, called CpG islands, help to achieve appropriately controlled gene usage.\n\n\nAwards and honours\nKlose was awarded a European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) young investigator programme fellowship in 2010 and was awarded a Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine Research prize in 2011.

    "text": "Alexey Vyacheslavovich Klokov (Russian: Алексей Вячеславович Клоков; born August 2, 1965) is a Russian painter and a member of the Creative Union of Artists of Russia.\n\n\nBiography\nAlexey Klokov (one of his pseudonyms is Romanov:) was born on August 2, 1965, in the village called Beloomut, situated in the Moscow region. Raised in the family of the interior designer, in 1982 he graduated from Beloomut Secondary School No. 1 then enlisted in the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School and served in Russian army until 1984.\nIn 1985, Klokov became acquainted with the avant-garde master Anatoly Zverev, who turned out to be his first mentor until his death in 1986. Subsequently, Alexey entered the Leningrad Higher School of Art and Industry named after V.I. Mukhina, which he graduated from 1991 as a restorer and artist. From 1991 to 1994 he trained in the workshops at the Hermitage (Saint Petersburg) and the Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), and from 1994 to 1998 he was engaged in the restoration of Old Russian Art.\nSince 2005, he has been developing his own method of visualizing desires, namely ILG-ART (Image, Line, Gold), which is a blend of art, psychology of success and chromo therapy techniques.\nHe has been a member of the Creative Union of Artists of Russia since 2009.\n\n\nWork\nAlexey Klokov started his exhibition activity in 1998 and is widely exhibited in Russia, Japan, Austria, Great Britain, Canada and the USA. He creates his paintings without preliminary sketches and the use of a palette-knife, premium art materials, which include Belgian linen, high-quality oils and enamels, high karat gold, gold leafing, antique objects and coins.\nAmong the characteristic features of the artist, is an open color, a textured stroke and volume. The art critic Stanislav Aydinyan calls him \"expressive, intense and a prolific colorist\". The works of Alexey Klokov, according to the art critic Alexander Evangely, are associated with the illustration of Jungian ideas; a \"balance between abstraction and figurativeness\". According to the opinion of the art critic Mikhail Andreev, his style is \"dialectic in color\".\nThe most expensive work of Alexey Klokov is the installation of an antique Madeira wine bottle of the early 20th century which incorporates a gold 585 fineness sheet on a background of 19th century French wine barrels. The cumulative weight of the gold amounts to 1546 grams.\nAnother dimension of the artist is a technique, which he titles \"randomness\". Klokov believes that at times paints may be dissimilar in their structure and that while involuntarily mixing, they may react and \"boil\". Knowing this interaction and \"the laws of confrontation\" of basic solvents, this process can be controlled.\nAt the Seyhoun Art Gallery exhibition, held in Los Angeles in February 2016, his oils of various genres  were presented which included \"Harmony of Two\", \"Spring Solo\" and \"Autobiography\" and other paintings. Following this exhibition, a year later in the spring of 2017 in New York Klokov introduced a new collection of his abstract works entitled \"Suggestive Abstract\" and \"Abstract Moderne\".\nHis paintings are included in the collections of notables, Silvio Berlusconi, Hillary Clinton, the family of Emir of Qatar, Tony Blair, Condoleezza Rice, Madeleine Albright, Boris Johnson, Quentin Tarantino, Emir Kusturica, Patrick Swayze, Paco Rabanne, and Marwan Chatila.\n\n\nPersonal exhibitions\nAlexey Klokov started his exhibition activity in 1998. By 2017, the number of exhibitions totaled 35, among them\n\n1998 - Central House of Artists, Moscow, Russia\n1999-2001 - Permanent exhibition at the President Hotel, Moscow\n2001 - Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Moscow\n2001 - Central House of Artists, Moscow\n2002 - Embassy of Russia, Tokyo, Japan\n2003 - Art Tower Mito, Mito, Japan\n2004 - Russian Cultural Foundation, Moscow\n2004 - Council of Federation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, Moscow\n2005 – Housing Complex \"Filippovskiy\", with the support of the development company \"Don Stroi\", Moscow\n2005 - Housing Complex \"Novopeskovskiy\", with the support of the development company \"Don Stroi\", Moscow\n2006 - State Duma of the Russian Federation, Moscow\n2006 – Housing Complex \"Vorobyovy Gory\", with the support of the development company \"Don Stroi\", Moscow\n2007 - Russian Center for Science and Culture, Vienna, Austria\n2008 - \"Kulturkreis Wien\" Gallery with the support of the Russian Embassy, Vienna\n2009 - Embassy of Russia, London, Great Britain\n2010 - Jewelry house «Chatila», London\n2010 - «BSI group» for VIP-clients, London\n2010 - Art-Manege (group)\n2011 - Gallery «Harrods», London\n2011 – Shopping Mall \"Afimoll\", a joint project with the jewelry house Adamas and Lena Lenina, Moscow\n2011 - restaurant \"Casino\", a joint project with Lena Lenina, Moscow\n2012 - Gallery «Harrods», London\n2012 - Sberbank central office for VIP clients, Moscow\n2012 - restaurant-gallery \"Belyi Kvadrat\", a joint project with Lena Lenina, Moscow\n2013 - Regional Savings Bank, Moscow\n2014 — «Royal Yacht Club», Moscow\n2014 — «I.B.Clark Gallery», New Hope, Pennsylvania, United States\n2014 — (E)merge Art Fair, Washington, D.C., USA\n2015 — Santa Fe Art Fair, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA\n2016 — «Seyhoun Gallery», Los_Angeles, USA\n2016 – «Subzero & Wolf» VIP Preview, Toronto, Canada\n2016 – «ArtaGallery», Toronto\n2017 – The Artist Project Art Fair, Toronto\n2017 – ArtExpo, New York, USA\n2017 – Red Dot Miami, Miami, USA\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOfficial website of the project ILG-ART",

    "text": "Samuel Michael Patrick \"Fuzzy\" Dolan (August 14, 1884 – December 30, 1944) was an American college football player, coach, and referee. He played collegiately for the University of Notre Dame and coached for two seasons at Oregon Agricultural College (today's Oregon State University).\nAfter leaving the coaching profession, Dolan became a football official, gaining a reputation for competence and fairness over a period of two decades.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nEarly years\nDolan was born August 14, 1884, in Folkestone, England of Irish parentage. He came to the United States with his family when he was about six, moving to Portland, Oregon, where he attended the Josiah Failing School in the south part of the city.\n\n\nPlaying career\nDolan began his collegiate football career as a student at Albany College (today's Lewis & Clark College) in Albany, Oregon.\nIn 1905, Dolan attended Oregon Agricultural College in neighboring Corvallis, Oregon, starting on the school's football team as a tackle.\nDolan played football at Notre Dame from 1906 to 1909. While at Notre Dame, Dolan was a starter at right guard. In his four seasons as a player, the Fighting Irish were 27–2–2.\nDolan also attended school at Oregon Agricultural College in 1909, however did not play football for OAC.\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1911, Dolan became the head football coach at Oregon State. During that 1911 season, OAC did not play their in state rivals, the University of Oregon in an annual rivalry game due to a riot at the game previous year. The OAC student body decided to cancel all athletic events between the two schools for the 1911 season. \nThe game was brought back for the 1912 season but was moved to a neutral site in Albany, Oregon. The neutral field idea came from an Albany cigar-maker named Billy Eagles, Dolan's brother-in-law.\nDolan served as the head coach for two seasons, posting an 8–6 overall record.\n\n\nLife after coaching\nDolan married the former Arlene Train, daughter of a former postmaster of Albany and publisher of the Albany Herald.\n\nDolan made his career as a professor of civil engineering at Oregon State College. In addition to an academic career spanning three decades, Dolan worked as a practicing engineer in the field, taking a leave of absence in 1934 to work for the Oregon State Highway Commission as senior engineering inspector of the Coos Bay Bridge and serving as an engineering examiner in Portland until 1936.\nAfter his time as a head coach, Dolan became a prominent referee in the Pacific Coast Conference, working in important games for a period of twenty years. \"He was known as one of the best officials, keeping complete control of the game but exercising his powers impartially,\" the Albany Democrat-Herald recalled in a memorial editorial published at the time of his death. \nDolan frequently worked important contests as a referee, including the \"Big Game\" between Stanford University and the University of California and the Rose Bowl Game. He retired from officiating in about 1939.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nDolan died December 30, 1944, at his home in Bend, Oregon, from complications resulting from influenza and heart disease. He was 60 years old at the time of his death.\nAt the time of his death Dolan was eulogized with an editorial in The Oregonian, the largest-circulation newspaper in the state, which lauded Dolan's \"thirty-five years of association with the college, his faithfulness, and unflagging support\":\n\n\"Samuel Michael Patrick Dolan and the late Dr. [J.R.N.] Bell, stout and enthusiastic Presbyterian minister for whom Bell Field was named, were two men whose interest never faltered and who left their impress upon generations of college students by their character even more than by their works. If Oregon State ever has another field to name it should be for Sam Dolan. He played the game hard and fair and he loved it.\"\nAfter services at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Corvallis, Dolan's body was laid to rest at Riverside Cemetery in Albany.\n\n\nHead coaching record\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Stri Parva (Sanskrit: स्त्री पर्व) (\"Book of the Women\") is the eleventh of the eighteen parvas (books) of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It traditionally has 4 parts and 27 chapters, as does the critical edition.\nSometimes spelled Stree Parva, it describes the grief of women because of the war, through the words of the Kaurava mother, Gandhari. The parva recites the grief of men too, such as of Dhritrashtra and the Pandava brothers. The chapters include a treatise by Vidura and Vyasa on passage rites with words of comfort for those who have lost loved ones, as well as the saṃsāra fable of the man and a well.\n\n\nStructure and chapters\nThe Stri Parva has 2 upa-parvas (parts, little books) and 27 adhyayas (chapters).\n\n\nJalapradanika Parva (chapters: 1–15)\nStri Parva recites the trauma and grief of women after the war. It opens with a statement of Dhritrashtra's grief at the death of all his sons and grandsons. Vidura, prime minister of the kingdom of Hastinapura and sage Vyasa console his grief with a treatise on death and emotional loss. These chapters present the theory of birth-rebirth. Dhristrashtra and the Kaurava women then visit the battlefield. Dhritarashtra on his way meets with the 3 remaining Kuru warriors. Having met the king thus, those brave warriors, separate from one another. Kripa goes to Hastinapura, Kritavarman repairs to his own kingdom, while the son of Drona sets off for the asylum of Vyasa, where he later encounters the sons of Pandu in Sauptika Parva and is vanquished by them. The women express their grief from loss and question war - they criticize both sides for unleashing the war and death.\nThe Pandava brothers and women from the Pandava side meet Dhristrashtra. The Kaurava king attempts to kill Bhima by crushing him with his arms in retaliation for Duryodhana's death. Ascertaining his evil intentions towards Bhima, Krishna drags away the real Bhima and presents the king with an iron statue. Dhritarashtra breaks that statue, then laments Bhima's death. Krishna tells him the truth and criticizes his actions, at which Dhristrashtra repents. The Pandavas with Krishna and sages thereafter go to see Gandhari, the upset and weeping Kaurava mother who had lost all her sons and grandsons in the war. Gandhari, afflicted with grief on account of the death of her sons, wants to curse king Yudhishthira. Sage Vyasa appears and reminds her of the wisdom she taught to her sons, \"victory follows righteousness\", then counsels her that the war was one fought for righteousness. Gandhari replies that she forgives the war, but finds it difficult to forgive actions during the war that were unjust. She demands to know why the rules of just war were abused, why cruelty (adharma) was practiced during the war. They debate whether the promise of quicker peace justify the use of weapons that kill indiscriminately, other war crimes and horrors by one side against the other side. Then she gets angry with Bhimasena's actions during his duel with her son and also his other cruel acts in war, like drinking Dussasana's blood. Sage Vyasa then reminds her of her sons cruel acts against Pandavas. Gandhari then wrathfully asks where king Yudhishthira is. King Yudhishthira, trembling and with joined hands, approaches her. He accepts his faults and in soft words tells her that he deserves to be cursed. Toward Yudhishthira who spoke such words, who is overcome with fear, Gandhari anger becomes pacified. The sages then present a different perspective. After Gandhari, the Pandava brothers meet Kunti and Draupadi, two women on the side of Pandavas, who express their own grief for the war. They grieve and suggest war is easy to start but war never ends, and its consequences are painfully long.\n\n\nStri-vilapa Parva (chapters: 16–27)\nSource:\nIn later chapters of Stree Parva, Gandhari absorbed in grief, ascribed every fault to Kesava, for not doing anything even though he had the power to prevent the slaughter and unjust actions during the war. She then curses Krishna that his own Yadava clan will perish in similar manner as Kuru clan perished. And ladies of his race, shall weep and cry even as the ladies of the Bharata race. Krishna accepts her curse, and with faint smile said unto her that she aided him in the accomplishment of his task, of slaughtering all human beings in this world, possessing knowledge of celestial weapons, for what he came to earth. Dhristarashtra asks Yudhishthira as to how many people died and escaped from the 18-day Kurukshetra War on the two sides. Yudhishthira replies more than 1,660,000,000 men died, while 240,165 people escaped the Kurukshetra war. Then Dhritarashtra asked the king to perform funeral rites of those that have none to look after them. Kunti's son Yudhishthira of great wisdom commanded his priests to perform it. Those dead bodies were piled together in thousands of heaps and, at the command of Yudhishthira, were caused to be burnt by Vidura.\nThe two sides then together perform passage rites in river Ganges, in the memory of those who gave their lives during the war, with spouses of heroes, presented a spectacle of sorrow and cheerlessness. Then Kunti, weepingly addressed her sons that Karna was their eldest brother. Offer oblations of water unto that eldest brother of theirs who was born of her by the god of day, with a pair of ear-rings and mail. Hearing these painful words of their mother, the Pandavas began to express their grief for Karna. Copiously indulging in lamentations like these, king Yudhishthira the just uttered loud wails of woe, then offered oblations of water unto his deceased brother. All the ladies then griefs with loud wails and king Yudhishthira, then caused the wives and members of Karna's family to be brought before him. Having finished the ceremony, the king, with his senses exceedingly agitated, rose from the waters of Ganga.\nStri parva includes Vyasa's and Vidura's treatise about death and grief, passage rites in last two Chapters, as well as saṃsāra through the fable of the man, the forest, the bees, the honey, the elephant and a well in Chapters 2 through 7.\n\n\nAlternate grouping\nAn alternate grouping of the sub-parvas:\n\n1.

The translations vary with each translator's interpretations.\nClay Sanskrit Library has published a 15 volume set of the Mahabharata which includes a translation of Stri Parva by Kate Crosby. This translation is modern and uses an old manuscript of the Epic. The translation does not remove verses and chapters now widely believed to be spurious and smuggled into the Epic in 1st or 2nd millennium AD.\nDebroy, in 2011, notes that updated critical edition of Stri Parva, after removing verses and chapters generally accepted so far as spurious and inserted into the original, has 4 parts, 27 adhyayas (chapters) and 713 shlokas (verses).\nThe entire parva has been \"transcreated\" and translated in verse by the poet Dr. Purushottama Lal published by Writers Workshop.\n\n\nQuotes and teachings\n\nJalapradanika parva, Chapter 2:\n\n\nSee also\nPrevious book of Mahabharata: Sauptika Parva\nNext book of Mahabharata: Shanti Parva\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nStri Parva, English Translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli.\nStri Parva, English Translation by Manmatha Nath Dutt\nStri Parva in Sanskrit by Vyasadeva and commentary by Nilakantha (Editor: Kinjawadekar, 1929)\nStri Parva in Sanskrit and Hindi by Ramnarayandutt Shastri, Volume 4",

    "text": "The Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation (or BSRC, referred to locally in short as Restoration) is a community development corporation based in Brooklyn, New York, and the first ever to be established in the United States.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nDecline of Bedford–Stuyvesant\nIn the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, New York, was home to middle class German, Dutch, Italian, Irish, and Jewish immigrants and their descendants. In the 1920s, African-Americans migrating from the South settled in the area. Starting in 1930, people from Harlem moved into the neighborhood, seeking better housing. As the impoverished black population increased, banks reduced lending to local residents and businesses. By 1950, the number of blacks had risen to 155,000, comprising about 55 percent of the population of Bedford–Stuyvesant. Over the next decade, real estate agents and speculators employed blockbusting to make quick profits. As a result, formerly middle-class white homes were turned over to poorer black families. By 1960, eighty-five percent of the population was black. \nBy the mid-1960s, 450,000 residents occupied the neighborhood's nine square miles. Bedford–Stuyvesant had become Brooklyn's most populous neighborhood and had the second largest concentration of African-Americans in the United States. Garbage pickup decreased and local schools deteriorated. The streets became dangerous as juvenile delinquency, gang activity, and heroin use increased. Around 80 percent of residents were high school dropouts and about 36 percent of children were born to unmarried mothers. Economic downturn was in part facilitated by the decline of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the closure of a Sheffield Farms milk-bottling plant on Fulton Street. Almost half of the housing was officially classified as \"dilapidated and insufficient.\" Rates of venereal disease were among the highest in the United States, while infant mortality was the highest.\n\n\n1964 riot and reaction\n\nOn July 16, 1964, an off-duty white police lieutenant, Thomas Gilligan, shot and killed a 15-year old black boy, James Powell. Two nights later, violence broke out in Harlem, and on July 20 rioting started at the intersection of Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue in Bedford–Stuyvesant. This carried on for three nights in the latter neighborhood and resulted in 276 arrests, 22 injuries, and 556 incidents of property damage which cost an estimated $350,000. The riot brought national attention to Bedford–Stuyvesant, but concern soon faded; after six months, the only improvement in the community was the paving of an empty lot.\nOn November 21, the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council hosted an all-day conference at Pratt Institute in response to the summer riot. 600 local civic, religious, and political leaders discussed ways to improve the area. In the end it was decided that the Pratt Institute's Planning Department would conduct a six-month survey of local challenges and the potential for redevelopment. The study focused on a 12-block section of the community, finding much of the housing in the area at the point of decay. However, it was found that chances of rehabilitation in the area were \"greatly enhanced\" by the fact that 22.5 percent of buildings were owner occupied, 9.7 percent of buildings were owned by individuals that lived close by, and the average homeowner resided in the area for 15 years. The Planning Department's report concluded that New York City should \"mobilize all necessary antipoverty and other social welfare and educational programs\" to save the neighborhood from further decline. However, Youth-in-Action, the community's city anti-poverty agency, was only allocated $440,000 out of a requested $2.6 million budget for 1965, forcing it to cut many of its programs.\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy's involvement\n\nLate in 1965 Robert F. Kennedy, the junior senator of New York, decided to give an address on race and poverty. Disturbed by the Watts riots in Los Angeles, he was worried that America's racial crisis was shifting from the rural South to the urban North. He was also concerned that white support for black demands within the community was declining and that race relations were near to boiling over.\nKennedy gave three consecutive speeches in Manhattan on January 20, 21, and 22, 1966. Most of the content was in line with John F. Kennedy's New Frontier programs, with proposals for job training, rent subsidies, students loans for the poor, and housing desegregation. He also broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society rhetorical optimism, arguing that the situation for black Americans was worsening instead of improving. He asserted that welfare and stricter code enforcement were not solving the problems facing ghettos and that community involvement and action from the private sector were necessary to effectively combat urban poverty. Kennedy warned that failure to act could lead to more race riots. Several days later, Kennedy decided to create his own anti-poverty program. He told speechwriter Adam Walinsky, \"I want to do something about all this. Some kind of project that goes after some of these problems[...]see what you can put together.\" \nIn mid-February, Kennedy spent an afternoon touring Bedford–Stuyvesant, led by CBCC member Elsie Richardson. Afterwards, he attended a meeting with community activists at the local YMCA building. Similar in manner to the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting of 1963, Brooklyn community leaders were bitter towards the senator and lectured him on the problems black residents of the neighborhood faced. Civil Court Judge Thomas R. Jones said, \"I'm weary of study, Senator. Weary of speeches, weary of promises that aren't kept[...]The Negro people are angry, Senator, and, judge that I am, I'm angry, too. No one is helping us.\"\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nPlanning and design\nThroughout the summer of 1966 Senator Kennedy's aides, Walinsky and Thomas Johnston, planned an anti-poverty program. As part of their research, they traveled across the country to consult black militants, urban theorists, federal administrators, journalists, mayors, foundation leaders, and banking and business executives. Johnston spent much of his time in Bedford–Stuyvesant trying to sort out differences between the community's middle-class leadership. Earl G. Graves, Sr., a former real-estate broker from the area, was brought in to assist him. Realizing that the Johnson administration and Brooklyn's white Democrats felt politically threatened by his project, Kennedy secured support from \nMayor John Lindsay and the senior senator from New York, Jacob Javits, both Republicans. He also earned corporate support from Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM, William S. Paley of CBS, investment banker André Meyer, and former Secretary of Treasury C. Douglas Dillon. Only David Rockefeller declined to support the project.\nBy October, Kennedy, his staff, and community leaders had resolved to launch a community development corporation for the near-entirety of the ghetto of Bedford–Stuyvesant. Kennedy later said, \"An effort in one problem area is almost worthless. A program for housing, without simultaneous programs for jobs, education, welfare reform, health, and economic development cannot succeed. The whole community must be involved as a whole.\" Initial plans included coordinated programs for the creation of jobs, housing renovation and rehabilitation, improved health sanitation, and recreation facilities, the construction of two \"super blocks,\" the conversion of the abandoned Sheffield Farms milk-bottling plant into a town hall and community center, a mortgage consortium to provide subsidized loans for homeowners, the founding of a private work-study community college for dropouts, and a public campaign to convince corporations to invest in industry in the neighborhood. \nA few days before the project was going to be publicly unveiled, Kennedy said \"I'm not at all sure this is going to work. But it's going to test some new ideas, some new ways of doing this, that are different from the government's. Even if we fail, we'll have learned something. But more important than that, something has to be done. People like myself can't go around making nice speeches all the time. We can't just keep raising expectations. We have to do some damn hard work, too.\"\n\n\nFirst founding\nOn December 9, 1966, Kennedy, together with Mayor Lindsay and Senator Javits, announced his anti-poverty program at New York Public School 305. He told the audience, \"The program for the development of Bedford–Stuyvesant will combine the best of community action with the best of the private enterprise system. Neither by itself is enough, but in their combination lies our hope for the future.\" The plan was met with mixed reactions in the press, with some liberals accusing the project of relying too heavily on the private sector while conservative elements were more hopeful of its chances for success.\nInitially, the responsibility of the revival of the neighborhood rested with two private, nonprofit corporations. The first, Bedford–Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation (R & R), consisted of 20 established civic and religious community leaders under the leadership of Judge Thomas R. Jones. Its purpose was to design anti-poverty programs and retain basic decision-making authority. The second, Distribution and Services (D & R) was to secure financial and logistical support for the former. It was run by an all-white board of businessmen that included Watson, Paley, Meyer, Dillon, David Lilienthal and Jacob Merrill Kaplan. Roswell Gilpatric, James Oates, and Benno C. Schmidt Sr. were later added.\n\n\nInternal disputes and second founding\nThe community corporation's membership was almost entirely middle class and about one-third female. Many factions in Bedford–Stuyvesant felt underrepresented, resulting in bitter political infighting. In March 1967 Judge Jones reached an impasse with the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council. With the support of Kennedy and Lindsay, he demanded that the R & R board resolve to expand itself to include a wider array of community leaders and give him three weeks to revise the corporation's structure. The ultimatum lost by a single vote and Jones angrily resigned.\nThe ensuing dispute threatened to derail the entire project. Kennedy tried to salvage it by dissolving the R & R and creating a new restoration corporation. Arguing that a more representative group was needed to secure federal and private grants, he won the support of Lindsay and Javits to proceed. On April 1, Jones announced the formation of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation (BSRC). It was the first community development corporation in the United States. The new board included Sonny Carson, Albert Vann, and Milton Galamison. Franklin A. Thomas selected to be the first President and CEO of the new corporation.\n\n\nInitial activities\nThe corporations received their first grants from the Stern Family Fund, J. M. Kaplan Fund, Ford Foundation and Astor Foundation. Seven months later they received a $7 million grant from the Department of Labor made possible by a 1966 amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 drafted by Kennedy and Javits to provide the private sector with incentive payments in exchange for investments in impoverished areas. In spite of a public awareness campaign and support from several prominent Republicans, the project only received modest support from private businesses. Investments from IBM, Xerox, and U.S. Gypsum notwithstanding, most corporate executives believed there was little profit in poorer communities and were concerned about hostile working environments. Most of the residents of Bedford–Stuyvesant were initially skeptical of the project's intentions.\nPlanning occurred throughout the early months of 1967. By March, a strategy had been laid out for the physical reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bedford–Stuyvesant. It centered around a two-block-wide commercial zone to be located between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue which would serve as a principal point for local business and community organizations. Several lightly trafficked roads were chosen to be transformed into landscaped walkways. Architect I. M. Pei was commissioned for the establishment of the two \"superblocks\". Local residents believed the proposal was purely cosmetic and insisted that housing and employment programs be given greater attention. Pei was eventually able to convince more of the more corporation staff to support his plan. \nMeanwhile, members of the still-functional D & S board were working on areas of their expertise; Paley began exploring the development of communications infrastructure, George S. Moore focused on project financing and mortgage pooling, Schmidt assisted small businesses, Watson managed job training and employment programs, and Meyer worked on real estate problems and strategized for the corporation's overall funding. Wanting to earn the trust of the community, Thomas organized the \"Community Home Improvement Program\" (CHIP). With labor drawn from unemployed youth, various houses would be chosen by lottery to have their exteriors refurbished. In turn, homeowners would provide a token payment of $25 (for work valued at $325). The corporation would continue to maintain the houses after rehabilitation. Though seen by Judge Jones as \"superficial\", the program went into effect with a $500,000 federal grant and quickly became popular. The D & S board gradually began to lose its supremacy over the BSRC. Thomas lobbied for an end of D & S control over funding and created a joint account to be managed by both corporations. In December 1967 Kennedy brought in John Doar to be the new executive director of the D & S board. One of his first actions was to relocate the businessmen corporation's staff into the BSRC's offices. It was seen by community leaders as a hindrance and eventually dissolved.\nThe BSRC also produced a television series about the neighborhood, Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant, which premiered in April 1968. By December, the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation had restored 400 brownstones and tenements with the help of 272 local residents, 250 of whom were later hired in full-time construction jobs. Two \"Neighborhood Restoration Centers\" for free advice and legal consultation had been opened, 14 new black-owned businesses had been established, and 1,200 residents had received vocational training. IBM located a computer cable plant in the neighborhood, creating 300 new jobs, while the City University of New York had agreed to coordinate with community leaders for the construction of a new community college in the area. A mortgage pool fund run by a consortium of 65 banks loaned $1.5 million to homeowners. Still, progress was slow and journalist Jack Newfield estimated that of Bedford–Stuyvesant's 450,000 inhabitants, only about 25,000 had been affected by the corporation's work.\nIn 1968 the BSRC purchased the abandoned milk-bottling plant on Fulton street for rehabilitation. Its restoration was completed in 1972 and it became the new corporate headquarters for the BSRC, entitled Restoration Plaza. In 1979, Pathmark opened the first supermarket in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the plaza.\nIn 1971, the BSRC looked to stimulate the region's economy through employment, education, and healthcare programming. This included a textile project by the Design Works of Bedford-Stuyvesant, founded by  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, shown at a gala event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \n\n\n21st century\n\nAs of 2010, Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation had constructed or rehabilitated 2200 housing units in the neighborhood, provided mortgage financing to nearly 1500 homeowners, brought $375 million in investments to the community, and created over 20,000 jobs.\nRestoration Plaza currently serves as an office and mall complex for the surrounding area and as the unofficial downtown of Bedford–Stuyvesant. In addition to housing utilities services and a post office, the building hosts the BSRC's Center for Arts and Culture. This includes the Billie Holiday Theatre, Restoration Dance Theater, and the Skylight Art Gallery. The Youth Arts Academy, Under One Sun, and Phat Tuesday programs are also run from the plaza. In 2023 the architect David Adjaye unveiled the design the addition of 600,000 square feet of office space, a remodeled public plaza, and an expansion to existing facilities, including the Billie Holiday Theatre.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The bay whiting (Sillago ingenue) is a species of coastal marine fish of the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. The bay whiting's range extends throughout the west Indian Ocean, including northern Australia, Thailand, India and Taiwan, where it inhabits protected waters. It is benthic in nature, preying on shrimps, polychaetes and molluscs, however little else is known of its biology. Bay whiting are an important part of some inshore fisheries around Australia and Asia, where subsistence and commercial fishermen regularly take the species.\n\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nThe bay whiting is one of over 30 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of five genera belonging to the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae, this family was previously considered to be part of the Percoidea, a suborder of the Perciformes. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World classifies the Sillaginidae in the order Spariformes.\nThe species was first identified and named Sillago ingenuua by Roland McKay in his comprehensive 1985 review of the family Sillaginidae, with the holotype collected near Chantaburi, in the Gulf of Thailand in 1975. Prior to this official naming, the species had been misidentified as Sillago argentifasciata by Shao and Chang in 1978 and again in 1980 by Dutt and Sujatha. The binomial name is derived from the Latin ingenuus, meaning \"freeborn\", in reference to Thailand where the holotype was collected. The only common name, bay whiting is in reference to the species usual habitat.\n\n\nDescription\nAs with most of the genus Sillago, the bay whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the two rows of cheek scales and head. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 17 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 17 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 66 to 70 lateral line scales and a total of 33 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of 20 cm.\nThe swim bladder has a short anterior extension, which is significantly longer in older individuals, while there are also 5 short, pointed anterolateral projections. There is a single, poorly developed posterior projection and a poorly developed duct like process on the ventral surface.\nThe bay whiting has a pale sandy brown head and body, ranging to a light fawn with no obvious mid-lateral silvery band as in S. argentifasciata. All fins are hyaline in appearance, and the pectoral fin has no dark spot at the base. Th operculum is almost clear, with the inner dark brown surface showing through. The tip of the nose is occasionally dark.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe bay whiting is known from a fairly patchy distribution, inhabiting the Gulf of Thailand, India, Taiwan and northern Australia from Shark Bay around the northern coast to Adolphus Passage, north-eastern Queensland. McKay suggests that it may be far more widespread, but commonly misidentified as S. argentifasciata, or in the case of small subsistence fisheries, has not been reported at all.\nThe species inhabits inshore coastal waters, and is known from depths between 20 and 50 m. Bay whiting, like many other sillaginids are known to inhabit estuaries, but little research has been done on their habitat preference.\n\n\nDiet\nThe diet of bay whiting has been the focus of a study investigating trophic relations between this species, Sillago sihama, and other similarly distributed fish of the South China Sea. In this location, it was found bay whiting predominantly prey on a variety of shrimp species, polychaete worms and Mantis shrimp, with minor amounts of crabs, sea urchins, bivalves and copepods. Unlike other species of sillaginid, the bay whiting doesn't have a large dietary shift as it moves to adulthood, causing parents to compete with offspring to an extent. The diet is, however, offset from the co-occurring S. sihama, preventing significant competition from this species.\n\n\nRelationship to humans\nThe bay whiting is often taken by trawlers operating on the northwest shelf of Western Australia and  southward to Shark Bay. This species is very commonly trawled near Torres Straits to the north of Queensland. It is also one of the most important species to traditional and minor commercial fisheries along the Asian coast. It is marketed fresh throughout its range. Bay whiting are occasionally caught by recreational fishermen, with the largest recorded fish caught by an angler weighing only 0.047 kg.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBay whiting at Fishbase\nColour picture of bay whiting and other sillaginids",

    "text": "Charles Wooden VC (24 March 1829 – 24 April 1876) was a German-born soldier in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\n\n\nCrimean War\nHe was awarded the Victoria Cross for acts of gallantry during the Crimean War. He was 25 years old, and a sergeant-major in the 17th Lancers (Duke of Cambridge's Own), British Army. On 26 October 1854, in the Crimea, at Balaklava, Sergeant-Major Wooden went out with surgeon James Mouat to the assistance of an officer who was lying seriously wounded in an exposed position, after the retreat of the Light Cavalry. He helped to dress the officer's wounds under heavy fire from the enemy.\n\nLord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front, follow the enemy, and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troop Horse Artillery may accompany. French cavalry is on your left. Immediate. (signed) R. Airey\nThis order, carried by the young Captain Louis Nolan and misinterpreted by Lord Lucan, began one of the most famous of all military engagements – The Charge of the Light Brigade – on 25 October 1854. Charles Wooden rode in this action.\nCaptain William Morris of the 17th Lancers, with about 20 men as yet comparatively unscathed in the sea of carnage all around, came upon a squadron of Russian Hussars. Ordering his men to keep together, he rode straight at the Russian leader, running him through with his sword with such force that he toppled him over the side of his horse, and, unable to disengage his hand from his sword, fell with him. The Russians closed on Morris and slashed at him with their sabres, cutting through his forage cap until he lost consciousness. He was taken prisoner but, in the confusion of the field, managed to slip away, capture a horse and make a dash for freedom, only to fall from his horse due to his wounds. Pursued by the Russians through the thick smoke of the battlefield, he caught another horse, but fell again when the horse was shot. This time the horse fell on him, trapping his leg. When he came to, in agony from a broken right arm, broken ribs and three deep head wounds, he managed to free his leg and stagger towards the British lines. By a strange coincidence he came across the body of his good friend Captain Nolan; and lay down beside it. (Morris and Nolan had earlier exchanged the letters customary between friends before battle, promising to inform the other's loved ones should anything happen to them.) Once again, Morris lapsed into unconsciousness.\nAn attempt was made by Turkish troops to recover the two men; but, as Russian fire rained down upon them, they abandoned it. A message was then sent to the 17th Lancers; and Sergeant-Major Charles Wooden of the 17th Lancers (who had ridden in the charge, and had had his horse shot from under him) and Surgeon Mouat of the 6th Dragoons, set out under heavy fire to rescue the stricken Morris. After roughly dressing his wounds, they succeeded in returning to their lines. For this action both were to be awarded Britain's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross. Morris survived his wounds, and died four years later in India.\nSergeant-Major Wooden was something of a character in the 17th Lancers. One night, returning to camp the worse for wear after a drinking session, he was challenged by the sentry on guard duty, but could not remember the password. \"'tish me\", Wooden whispered in a slurred voice. \"Who?\" asked the sentry. \"'tish me, 'tish me!\" came the answer. Down came the sentry's lance as he demanded to know just which 'me' it was.\nBy now in a temper, Wooden bellowed: \"'tish me, the Devil\". The sentry, now exercising his better judgement on recognising his Sergeant-Major retorted: \"Pass, 'tish me the Devil!\" From that moment the nickname stuck and for the remainder of his service with the 'Death or Glory Boys', Wooden remained \"Tish me the Devil\".\nWooden, a German by birth, was not a popular man in the regiment possibly because of his odd demeanour and strong German accent. Even the award of his VC was controversial. At first he was not entered for the award although Dr Mouat was. Wooden wrote to Dr Mouat saying that if Mouat was to receive a VC then so should he as he had been at Mouat's side during the rescue of Lt Col Morris. Dr Mouat agreed, and wrote to the Horse Guards supporting Wooden's claim.\nThe reply to his letter reads: \"His Royal Highness feels very unwilling to bring any further claim for the Victoria Cross for an act performed at so distant a period but as the decoration has been conferred on Dr James Mouat for the part he took in the rescue of Lt. Col. Morris and Sergeant-Major Wooden appears to have acted in a manner very honourable to him on the occasion and, by his gallantry, been equally instrumental in saving the life of this officer, His Royal Highness is induced to submit the case.\" Wooden's VC was gazetted on 26 October 1858.\nHis VC citation reads:\n\nHER Majesty has also been graciously pleased to confer the Decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Non-commissioned Officer of Her Majesty's Army, who has been recommended to Her Majesty for that Decoration, on account of an Act of Bravery performed by him in the Crimea, during the late War, as recorded against his name; viz.:\n17th Lancers, Serjeant-Major Charles Wooden\nDate of Act of Bravery, 26th October 1854\n\nFor having, after the retreat of The Light Cavalry, at the Battle of Balaclava, been instrumental, together with Dr James Mouat CB, in saving the life of Lieutenant Colonel Morris CB, of the 17th Lancers by proceeding under a heavy fire to his assistance, when he was lying very dangerously wounded in an exposed situation.\nWooden's other medal entitlements are the Crimea Medal (with bars Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman and Sebastopol), Turkish Medal, French War Medal and the Indian Mutiny Medal.\n\n\nLater service\nHe exchanged into the 6th Dragoons to become Quartermaster there (presumably with promotion to the rank of officer) in 1860, exchanged into the 5th Lancers in 1865, retired on half-pay in 1871, and was appointed Quartermaster of the 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers) in 1872.\nOn 14 April 1876 Wooden shot himself following a drinking session, having complained of severe head pains the previous week. An inquest recorded death by suicide due to temporary insanity. He was 47 years old and had served 30 years with the army. He is buried in St James's Cemetery, Dover.\n\n\nThe Medal\nHis VC is on display in The Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum in Thoresby Park, Nottinghamshire.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nIngleton, Roy (2011).

The appellation Bachitar Natak is sometimes confusingly only applied around the Dasam Granth. The Bachitar Natak Granth, not to be confused with the Bachittar Natak composition, contains a large corpus of the Dasam Granth canon.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Bachittar Natak is part of the Dasam Granth, the second holy scripture of Sikhism. The composition covers various aspects, including the lineage of Guru Gobind Singh, the persecution of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the author's own rebirth, and the defense and spread of dharma (righteousness). It also includes descriptions of battles, hunting expeditions, and journeys in Punjab and the Himalayan foothills. The Bachitar Natak consists of fourteen chapters, sometimes also called \"Apni Katha\" (meaning \"my story\"), which provides an autobiographical account of Guru Gobind Singh's life until the year 1696. \n\n\nSynopsis\nThe Bachitar Natak is partly an autobiography of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, in which he narrates the events and circumstances of the first 32 years of his life. It outlines the history and challenges faced by the Sikh community during that time. It states the author was meditating in the Himalayan foothills on a 7-peaked mountain before being called to take birth. This previous incarnation of Guru Gobind Singh is known as Dusht Daman.\nThe Bani (composition) starts with a praise of the Akal Purakh (the ultimate being) and then provides a genealogy of the Bedis and Sodhis, tracing their lineage back to Lava and Kush. It also includes the author's own biography and discusses significant events such as the Battle of Nadaun, \"the Husaini Battle\", and the arrival of Prince Muazzam in Punjab. The composition concludes around AD 1696.\nThe Bachitar Natak contains 14 chapters.\n\n\nHistoriography\nHistorical sources from the 18th century, such as Gur Sobha Granth, Gurbilas Patshai Dasvin, Bansavlinama Dasan Patshahian Ka, and Rahitnamas, mention the compositions of the Dasam Granth, including the Bachitra Natak. These sources attribute the writings to Guru Gobind Singh.\n\n\nBachitra Natak Granth\n\nThe Bachitra Natak Granth refers to a large corpus of compositions within the Dasam Granth, the compositions referenced as part of the Bachitra Natak Granth include:\n1. Apni Katha (the Bachittar Natak proper)\n2. Chandi Charitra I\n3. Chandi Charitra II\n4. Chaubis Avatar\n5. Brahma Avatar\n6. Rudra Avatar\nThese compositions follow a specific pattern, with Apni Katha discussing various avatars and their reinterpretation in line with Sikh thought and philosophy.\nThe Bachitra Natak Granth is a part of the Dasam Granth, but the Dasam Granth is not solely the Bachitra Natak Granth. The confusion arises from the fact that many compositions within the Dasam Granth mention the words \"Bachitra Natak Likhyate,\" but there is more to the Dasam Granth than just the Bachitra Natak.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Burmester's theory",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=25856869",
    "text": "In kinematics, Burmester theory comprises geometric techniques for synthesis of linkages. It was introduced in the late 19th century by Ludwig Burmester (1840–1927). His approach was to compute the geometric constraints of the linkage directly from the inventor's desired movement for a floating link. From this point of view a four-bar linkage is a floating link that has two points constrained to lie on two circles.\nBurmester began with a set of locations, often called poses, for the floating link, which are viewed as snapshots of the constrained movement of this floating link in the device that is to be designed. The design of a crank for the linkage now becomes finding a point in the moving floating link that when viewed in each of these specified positions has a trajectory that lies on a circle. The dimension of the crank is the distance from the point in the floating link, called the circling point, to the center of the circle it travels on, called the center point. Two cranks designed in this way form the desired four-bar linkage.\nThis formulation of the mathematical synthesis of a four-bar linkage and the solution to the resulting equations is known as Burmester Theory. The approach has been generalized to the synthesis of spherical and spatial mechanisms.\n\n\nFinite position synthesis\n\n\nGeometric formulation\nBurmester theory seeks points in a moving body that have trajectories that lie on a circle called circling points. The designer approximates the desired movement with a finite number of task positions; and Burmester showed that circling points exist for as many as five task positions. Finding these circling points requires solving five quadratic equations in five unknowns, which he did using techniques in descriptive geometry. Burmester's graphical constructions still appear in machine theory textbooks to this day.\n\nTwo positions: As an example consider a task defined by two positions of the coupler link, as shown in the figure. Choose two points A and B in the body, so its two positions define the segments A1B1 and A2B2. It is easy to see that A is a circling point with a center that is on the perpendicular bisector of the segment A1A2. Similarly, B is a circling point with a center that is any point on the perpendicular bisector of B1B2. A four-bar linkage can be constructed from any point on the two perpendicular bisectors as the fixed pivots and A and B as the moving pivots. The point P is clearly special, because it is a hinge that allows pure rotational movement of A1B1 to A2B2. It is called the relative displacement pole or also instant centre of rotation.\nThree positions: If the designer specifies three task positions, then points A and B in the moving body are circling points each with a unique center point. The center point for A is the center of the circle that passes through A1, A2 and A3 in the three positions. Similarly, the center point for B is the center of the circle that passes through B1, B2 and B3. Thus for three task positions, a four-bar linkage is obtained for every pair of points A and B chosen as moving pivots.\nFour positions: Graphical solution to the synthesis problem becomes more interesting in the case of four task positions, because not every point in the body is a circling point. Four task positions yield six relative displacement poles, and Burmester selected four to form the opposite pole quadrilateral, which he then used to graphically generate the circling point curve (Kreispunktcurven). Burmester also showed that the circling point curve was a circular cubic curve in the moving body.\nFive positions: To reach five task positions, Burmester intersects the circling point curve generated by the opposite pole quadrilateral for a set of four of the five task positions, with the circling point curve generated by the opposite pole quadrilateral for different set of four task positions. Five poses imply ten relative displacement poles, which yields four different opposite pole quadrilaterals each having its own circling point curve. Burmester shows that these curves will intersect in as many as four points, called the Burmester points, each of which will trace five points on a circle around a center point. Because two circling points define a four-bar linkage, these four points can yield as many as six four-bar linkages that guide the coupler link through the five specified task positions.\n\n\nAlgebraic formulation\nBurmester's approach to the synthesis of a four-bar linkage can be formulated mathematically by introducing coordinate transformations [Ti] = [Ai, di], i = 1, ..., 5, where [A] is a 2×2 rotation matrix and d is a 2×1 translation vector, that define task positions of a moving frame M specified by the designer.\nThe goal of the synthesis procedure is to compute the coordinates w = (wx, wy) of a moving pivot attached to the moving frame M and the coordinates of a fixed pivot G = (u, v) in the fixed frame F that have the property that w travels on a circle of radius R about G. The trajectory of w is defined by the five task positions, such that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        [\n        \n          T\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ]\n        \n          w\n        \n        =\n        [\n        \n          A\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ]\n        \n          w\n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            d\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        i\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        5.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {W} ^{i}=[T_{i}]\\mathbf {w} =[A_{i}]\\mathbf {w} +\\mathbf {d} _{i},\\quad i=1,\\ldots ,5.}\n  \n\nThus, the coordinates w and G must satisfy the five equations,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          G\n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          G\n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        i\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        5.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} )\\cdot (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} )=R^{2},\\quad i=1,\\ldots ,5.}\n  \n\nEliminate the unknown radius R by subtracting the first equation from the rest to obtain the four quadratic equations in four unknowns,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          G\n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          G\n        \n        )\n        −\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          G\n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          G\n        \n        )\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n        \n        i\n        =\n        2\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        5.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} )\\cdot (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} )-(\\mathbf {W} ^{1}-\\mathbf {G} )\\cdot (\\mathbf {W} ^{1}-\\mathbf {G} )=0,\\quad i=2,\\ldots ,5.}\n  \n\nThese synthesis equations can be solved numerically to obtain the coordinates w = (wx, wy) and G = (u, v) that locate the fixed and moving pivots of a crank that can be used as part of a four-bar linkage.

The levers are hinged to a ground frame and are called the input and output cranks, and the connecting rod is the called the coupler link. Burmester's approach to the design of a four-bar linkage can be used to locate the coupler so that five specified angles of the input crank result in five specified angles of the output crank. \nLet θi, i = 1, ..., 5 be the angular positions of the input crank, and let ψi, i = 1, ..., 5 be the corresponding angles of the output crank. For convenience locate the fixed pivot of the input crank at the origin of the fixed frame, O = (0, 0), and let the fixed pivot of the output crank be located at C = (cx, cy), which is chosen by the designer. The unknowns in this synthesis problem are the coordinates g = (gx, gy) of the coupler attachment to the input crank and the coordinates w = (wx, wy) of the attachment to the output crank, measured in their respective reference frames.\nWhile the coordinates of w and g are not known their trajectories in the fixed frame are given by,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        [\n        A\n        (\n        \n          θ\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        ]\n        \n          g\n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        [\n        A\n        (\n        \n          ψ\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        ]\n        \n          w\n        \n        +\n        \n          C\n        \n        ,\n        \n        i\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        5\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {G} ^{i}=[A(\\theta _{i})]\\mathbf {g} ,\\quad \\mathbf {W} ^{i}=[A(\\psi _{i})]\\mathbf {w} +\\mathbf {C} ,\\quad i=1,\\ldots ,5,}\n  \n\nwhere [A(•)] denotes the rotation by the given angle.\nThe coordinates of w and g must satisfy the five constraint equations,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        i\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        5.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} ^{i})\\cdot (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} ^{i})=R^{2},\\quad i=1,\\ldots ,5.}\n  \n\nEliminate the unknown coupler length R by subtracting the first equation from the rest to obtain the four quadratic equations in four unknowns,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n        −\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ⋅\n        (\n        \n          \n            W\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            G\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n        \n        i\n        =\n        2\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        5.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} ^{i})\\cdot (\\mathbf {W} ^{i}-\\mathbf {G} ^{i})-(\\mathbf {W} ^{1}-\\mathbf {G} ^{1})\\cdot (\\mathbf {W} ^{1}-\\mathbf {G} ^{1})=0,\\quad i=2,\\ldots ,5.}\n  \n\nThese synthesis equations can be solved numerically to obtain the coordinates w = (wx, wy) and g = (gx, gy) that locate the coupler of the four-bar linkage.\nThis formulation of the input-output synthesis of a four-bar linkage is an inversion of finite-position synthesis, where the movement of the output crank relative to the input crank is specified by the designer. From this viewpoint the ground link OC is a crank that satisfies the specified finite positions of the movement of the output crank relative to the input crank, and Burmester's results show that its existence guarantees the presence of at least one coupler link. Furthermore, Burmester's results show that there may be as many as three of these coupler links that provide the desired input-output relationship.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nIan R.

    "summary": "In kinematics, Burmester theory comprises geometric techniques for synthesis of linkages. It was introduced in the late 19th century by Ludwig Burmester (1840–1927). His approach was to compute the geometric constraints of the linkage directly from the inventor's desired movement for a floating link. From this point of view a four-bar linkage is a floating link that has two points constrained to lie on two circles.\nBurmester began with a set of locations, often called poses, for the floating link, which are viewed as snapshots of the constrained movement of this floating link in the device that is to be designed. The design of a crank for the linkage now becomes finding a point in the moving floating link that when viewed in each of these specified positions has a trajectory that lies on a circle. The dimension of the crank is the distance from the point in the floating link, called the circling point, to the center of the circle it travels on, called the center point. Two cranks designed in this way form the desired four-bar linkage.\nThis formulation of the mathematical synthesis of a four-bar linkage and the solution to the resulting equations is known as Burmester Theory. The approach has been generalized to the synthesis of spherical and spatial mechanisms.",

    "text": "The conservation and restoration of performance art is the process of documenting, collecting, and prolonging the life of Performance Art. Performance Art often features a live presentation initially documented by an artist, cultural institution, or host location. This genre of art can take place in a wide range of mediums, and is usually based on four core elements: Time, Space, the Performer's body, and the relationship between viewers and performer. These variables determine how it can be collected and conserved within museums or cultural institutions.\n\n\nHistory of performance art\nPerformance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in Asia and Latin America. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. Twentieth century performance art originated from early avant-garde genres such as Futurism, Dada and Surrealism. The choreographed movements combined elements of traditional theater performances and styles of political rallies. The origins of the post-war performance art movement can be credited to composer John Cage and dancer Merce Cunningham at North Carolina's Black Mountain College. Cage's teaching in New York shaped the work of artists such as George Brecht, Yoko Ono, and Allan Kaprow, who formed part of the impetus behind the Fluxus movement and the creation of \"happenings\", which were then preceded by Abstract expressionism and Action painting. Since the 1960s the List of performance artists has continued to increase, and the styles of the genre are never confined.\n\n\nArtistic intent\nIn experiencing painting, film, literature, theatre, dance, music, and other arts, is it useful to consider the artist's intent, including evidence from previous work, external statements, and historical and personal contexts.\nArt and nature, non-aesthetic intent, the artist's testimony, historical context, situational approaches, intent for audiences, and textual intent are factors that take part in what or how the artist allows their work to be represented. The Artist's statement is another form in determining the conditions of their performance. These preferences include how the work can be documented, collected, and preserved.\n\n\nEthical concerns\nPerformance art is often undefined in its boundaries, so this may raise concern for where and how it is exhibited. Additional concerns are raised in participatory performances. There are several Codes of Ethics for professionals working in conservation and preservation-related fields. In the United States, the main conservation Code of Ethics is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. However, many of the professional organizations have their own codes, such as the Society of American Archivists Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics.\n\n\nConserving performance\nPerformance art contains a history of disregarding a standard definition or description, which presents a series of questions and discussions to qualify its conservation. Conserving and preserving Performance art was originally questioned if it was possible and for what reasons should it be collected. Projects such as the Variable Media Network and Collecting the Performative legitimized the field.\nWith input from artists, art educators and historians, conservators, and curators, a wider perspective is being generated for cultural institutions to develop new techniques in conserving and restoring live, time based works through workshops like The International Symposium \"Collecting and Conserving Performance Art\", held in Wolfsburg, Germany.\nSeveral discussions have been published about the conservation of performance art. Already in 2018, references included: Pip Laurenson's and Vivian van Saaze's text on collecting performance art; the Issue on Performing Documentation in the Conservation of Contemporary Art, chapters in Authenticity in Transition: Changing Practices in Art Making and Conservation; articles in the Studies in Conservation special issue dedicated to the IIC LA Congress on Modern Art; contributions in ICOM-CC Triennial meetings; articles in the Journal of the Institute of Conservation; VDR-Journal \"Beiträge zum Erhalt von Kunst- und Kulturgut\" (Volume 2/2017 and 1/2018). \nA broad discussion of what context the live works could be preserved has also been presented by David Smith of Asia Art Archive and Athena Christa Holbrook from Museum of Modern Art. These authors discuss the legitimacy of how a performance can be conserved and the resulting value of the work after by the artist, collection, and for the public. \nRecently, the project Documentation and Conservation of Performance, led by Tate, produced tools, workflows and critical perspectives. The project Reshaping the Collectible: When Artworks Live in the Museum, also led by Tate, also looked into the conservation of performance.\n\n\nCultural institutions\nCultural institutions like Museum of Modern Art and Tate Modern have developed conservation techniques on media-specific preservation needs, like securing equipment, updating exhibition-mode technology, and developing ways to re-create duration-based presentations. Their lists and policies establish a consistent method of collecting and preserving Performance Art by examining the license to \"re-perform\" the work, existing practices used to bring live works into a collection, and looking at past participants and producers.\nLiterature includes: Giguère's PhD, Alessandra Barbuto's (MAXXI) looks at the role of the museum in the preservation of performance art (see Performing Documentation), and Irene Müller discusses conservation and the relationship with archives. Glenn Wharton refers to the acquisition of VALIE EXPORT’s Abstract Film No. 1 by the Museum of Modern Art.\nThe book Histories of performance documentation (ed. by Gabriella Giannachi and Jonah Westerman) includes contributions from museum practitioners.\n\n\nThe artist\nThe artists/creators of the performance are the original source for the intentions for conserving the work. The artist's intent can determine how or to what degree the live work can be preserved. Popular performance artist Marina Abramović has spent much of her career recreating new versions of past performances by either replicating the physical actions or by selecting a reoccurring location, theme, or medium. She has also spent time as an educator in Performance Art so that her similar methods and styles are repeated. Marina has used several resources in copyrighting her work to ensure its authenticity and the work can be preserved in its current state.  \nPerformance scripts have also been used to preserve a live performance. With these written instructions or steps, the original live work can be re-performed or accurately represented keeping the artist's intentions true to the original work. Although curators and art critics have questioned if these scripts are sufficient materials for preserving and collecting the work; this method can be argued with similar conservation methods used in theater and performing arts.\n\n\nConservation and restoration treatment methods\nPerformance art that includes video, film, slide, audio, or computer technologies often falls under the conservation and restoration of time-based media art because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. Collecting, preserving, and exhibiting these performances raises complex technical and ethical challenges to conservators. Reside from Performance art fall under two main categories for either physical objects, and digital objects or New media associated with the work. While performances can have either category or combination to document the performance, exhibit, and preserve the existence or transformation of the work; the digital component has become the dominant method of prolonging the existence of the performance. \nSome strategies of overcoming the challenges of collecting live work are addressed in Marta Rodriguez's analysis.\n\n\nMediums\nPerformance art can take the form of several mediums with the possibility for combination such as but not limited to:\n\nBioArt\nCyberformance\nDigital art\nDigital poetry\nElectronic art\nEvolutionary art\nGenerative art\nInformation art\nInteractive art\nInternet art\nKinetic art\nLight art\nMotion graphics\nNet art\nPhotography\nSound art\nVideo art\nVirtual art\nThese mediums can be the result of documentation for the performance or be directly involved in the art itself. The mediums often determine how the work is collected, conserved, and restored.\n\n\nPhysical objects\nPhysical props, tools, clothing, etc. remaining or created as a result of the performance can be a common representation to document and preserve the Performance. Collections care guides and policies manage best practices for prolonging the life of the work.\n\n\nPreventive care and maintenance\nMany works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and exposure to visible light and ultraviolet radiation. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.\nOther causes of deterioration include:\n\nPollution\nPoor Storage\nPoor Handling and Use\nCollections care is an essential element of museum policy. It is a \"responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. Cultural institutions should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.\"\n\n\nDigital\nDigital mediums can be used for documentation or be a result of a performance such as digital photography, video, and audio files.  Conservation and restoration of new media art can establish best practices for individuals, artists, and cultural institutions to prolong the life of the work.\n\n\nDigital preservation\nWorks of new media art such as film, tapes, web browsers, software operating systems eventually become obsolete, and New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to preserve artwork beyond the time of its contemporary production. The digital archiving of media (see the Rhizome ArtBase, and the Internet Archive), and the use of emulators to prolong the life of work that depend on obsolete software or operating systems.\n\n\nPreventive care and maintenance\nInstability and change are inherent to these artworks, since artist-selected equipment and technologies fail and become obsolete. Many time-based media artworks are ephemeral by nature; rather than being composed of a unique original, they exist only when they are installed, so every iteration can be considered a different representation of the artwork. To preserve the fragile identity of time-based media artworks, conservators must proactively manage the degree of change that may be introduced to each.\n\n\nMethods of preservation\nThe Variable Media Questionnaire (VMS) has developed into a significant tool in relation to digital preservation.\n\nRefreshing – The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format.\nRestoration – The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original.\nNetworked storage – The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives.\nMigration – To upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original. This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel.\n\n\nAcquisition and storage\nPhysical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term strategy, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or outdated. Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as Internet art, performance art and live electronic music.\n\n\nCauses of deterioration\nFor the residue and documentation of performance art, new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and metadata standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the Open Archival Information System model.\nThe practice of digital preservation and web archiving offers special challenges and opportunities. Where scientific data and legal records may be easily migrated from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions. Emulation and Reinterpretation are additional approaches for prolonging the life of digital objects and documentation.\n\n\nPest management\nFor physical objects and props relating to a performance piece, conservators must follow proper pest management standards. Integrated Pest Management policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Policies and checklists specific to museum integrated pest management, for example from the National Park Service and Smithsonian Institution, discuss best practices, to include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition and storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nVariable Media Questionnaire\nM.

    "summary": "The conservation and restoration of performance art is the process of documenting, collecting, and prolonging the life of Performance Art. Performance Art often features a live presentation initially documented by an artist, cultural institution, or host location. This genre of art can take place in a wide range of mediums, and is usually based on four core elements: Time, Space, the Performer's body, and the relationship between viewers and performer. These variables determine how it can be collected and conserved within museums or cultural institutions.",

In January 1993, military government gave way to the Fourth Republic after presidential and parliamentary elections in late 1992. The 1992 constitution divides powers among a president, parliament, cabinet, council of state, and an independent judiciary. The government is elected by universal suffrage.\n\n\nGovernment\n\nPolitical parties became legal in mid-1992 after a ten-year hiatus. There are more than 20 registered political parties under the Fourth Republic. The two main parties are the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party. The National Democratic Congress is the successor organisation to Jerry John Rawlings' Provisional National Defence Council which was in power from 1981 to 1992.\nThe New Patriotic Party, found in 1992, is the successor to the Gold Coast's The Big Six independence achiever party United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC); the People's National Convention, and the Convention People's Party, successor to Kwame Nkrumah's original party of the same name, which was the incumbent government of Ghana for 10 years from declaration of independence in 1957 to 1966, winning elections in 1956, 1960, and 1965.\nThe National Democratic Congress won the presidential and parliamentary elections in 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012. The New Patriotic Party won the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000, 2004, and 2016. In 2020, the NPP won the Presidency, yet tied in the parliamentary elections with the NDC and the single seat that remained was filled by an independent, turning the NPP into the Fourth Republic’s first minority government. The following election in 2024, the National Democratic Congress \nmanaged to return to power, winning both the Presidency and parliament handedly, making their candidate, former President John Mahama (2012-2017), the first President to serve a non-consecutive second term.\n\n\nForeign relations\n\nSince independence, Ghana has been devoted to ideals of nonalignment and is a founding member of the non-aligned movement. Ghana favors international and regional political and economic co-operation, and is an active member of the United Nations and the African Union.\nMany Ghanaian diplomats and politicians hold positions in international organisations. These include Ghanaian diplomat and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, International Criminal Court Judge Akua Kuenyehia, former President Jerry John Rawlings and former President John Agyekum Kuffour who have both served as diplomats of the United Nations.\nIn September 2010, Ghana's former President John Atta Mills visited China on an official visit. Mills and China's former President Hu Jintao, marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two nations, at the Great Hall of the People on 20 September 2010. China reciprocated with a visit in November 2011, by the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhou Tienong who visited Ghana and met with Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama.\n\n\nJudicial system\n\nThe legal system is based on the 1992 constitution, customary (traditional) law, and British common law. Court hierarchy consists of Supreme Court of Ghana (highest court), courts of appeal, and high courts of justice. Beneath these bodies are circuit, magisterial, and traditional courts. Extrajudicial institutions include public tribunals. Since independence, courts are relatively independent; this independence continues under the Republic. Lower courts are being redefined and reorganized under the Republic.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nThere are sixteen administrative regions of the Republic of Ghana which are divided into 6 metropolitan assemblies; 55 Municipal assemblies; and 216 districts, each with its own district assembly. Below districts are various types of councils, including 58 town or area councils; 108 zonal councils; and 626 area councils. Over 16,000 unit committees exist on the lowest level.

    "title": "Ryukyu Kingdom",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=611482",
    "text": "The Ryukyu Kingdom was a kingdom in the Ryukyu Islands from 1429 to 1872. It was ruled as a tributary state of the Ming dynasty by the Ryukyuan monarchy, who unified Okinawa Island to end the Sanzan period, and subsequently extended the kingdom to the Amami Islands and Sakishima Islands. The Ryukyu Kingdom played a central role in the maritime trade networks of medieval East Asia and Southeast Asia despite its small size. The Ryukyu Kingdom became a vassal state of the Satsuma Domain of Japan after the invasion of Ryukyu in 1609 but retained de jure independence until it was transformed into the Ryukyu Domain by the Empire of Japan in 1872. The Ryukyu Domain was formally annexed by Japan in 1879 and reorganized as Okinawa Prefecture, and the Ryukyuan monarchy was integrated into the new Japanese nobility.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nOrigins of the Kingdom\nIn the 14th century small domains scattered on Okinawa Island were unified into three principalities: Hokuzan (北山; Northern Mountain), Chūzan (中山; Central Mountain), and Nanzan (南山; Southern Mountain). This was known as the Sanzan (三山; Three Mountains) period. Hokuzan, which constituted much of the northern half of the island, was the largest in terms of land area and military strength but was economically the weakest of the three. Nanzan constituted the southern portion of the island. Chūzan lay in the center of the island and was economically the strongest. Its political capital at Shuri, Nanzan was adjacent to the major port of Naha, and Kume-mura, the center of traditional Chinese education. These sites and Chūzan as a whole would continue to form the center of the Ryukyu Kingdom until its abolition.\nMany Chinese people moved to Ryukyu to serve the government or to engage in business during this period. At the request of the Ryukyuan King, the Ming Chinese sent thirty-six Chinese families from Fujian to manage oceanic dealings in the kingdom in 1392, during the Hongwu Emperor's reign. Many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers. They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations. On 30 January 1406, the Yongle Emperor expressed horror when the Ryukyuans castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs to serve in the Ming imperial palace. Emperor Yongle said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and did not deserve castration, and he returned them to Ryukyu, and instructed the kingdom not to send eunuchs again.\nThese three principalities (tribal federations led by major chieftains) battled, and Chūzan emerged victorious. The Chūzan leaders were officially recognized by Ming dynasty China as the rightful kings over those of Nanzan and Hokuzan, thus lending great legitimacy to their claims. The ruler of Chūzan passed his throne to King Hashi; Hashi conquered Hokuzan in 1416 and Nanzan in 1429, uniting the island of Okinawa for the first time, and founded the first Shō dynasty. Hashi was granted the surname \"Shō\" (Chinese: 尚; pinyin: Shàng) by the Ming emperor in 1421, becoming known as Shō Hashi (Chinese: 尚巴志; pinyin: Shàng Bāzhì).\nShō Hashi adopted the Chinese hierarchical court system, built Shuri Castle and the town as his capital, and constructed Naha harbor. When in 1469 King Shō Toku, who was a grandson of Shō Hashi, died without a male heir, a palatine servant declared he was Toku's adopted son and gained Chinese investiture. This pretender, Shō En, began the Second Shō dynasty. Ryukyu's golden age occurred during the reign of Shō Shin, the second king of that dynasty, who reigned from 1478 to 1526.\n\n\nInvasion of neighbouring islands and the Amami islands\n\nIn 1429, during the reign of King Shō Hashi, Ryukyu invaded Okinoerabu Island and Yoron Island. This was the first stage of Ryukyu's southward policy(南下政策) out of Okinawa island. In 1447, King Shō Shitatsu conquered Amami Oshima. In 1466, King Shō Toku attacked Kikai Island on two occasions. The fierce resistance of the islanders resulted in many casualties, but the island was finally placed under the control of the Kingdom of Ryukyu. King Shō Toku himself led 2,000 soldiers in large-scale operations but the cost of the war became a cause of domestic discontent. The Amami Islands became part of the Ryukyu Kingdom's territory from the Muromachi period onwards, along with the other Nansei Islands.\nThe Amami Islands (Amami Oshima, Tokunoshima, Okinoerabu Island, Kikai Island, etc.) traded with the Dazaifu, as mentioned ‘Aakumi Island’(掩美嶋) in the Mokkan. During the Kamakura - Nanbokucho periods, Amami was under the Hojo Tokumune's property. Later Chikama-Shi(千竃氏) was reorganised as stewards(Jitō 地頭) of the Satsuma Province(薩摩国), a territory of Shimazu clan. Chikama Tokiie Josho(千竈時家譲状) ind 14 April 1306 states that he gave “Kikaijima, Oshima ” etc. to his heir Sadayasu, “Erafu Island” to his second son Tsuneie, seven islands to his third son Kumayashamaru and “Tokushima” to his daughter Himekuma.\nDuring this era, the Ryukyu kingdom expanded north and south and new territory provided a stable basis for trade in the kingdom thereafter.\n\n\nGolden age of maritime trade\nFor nearly two hundred years the Ryukyu Kingdom would thrive as a key player in maritime trade with Southeast and East Asia. Central to the kingdom's maritime activities was the continuation of the tributary relationship with Ming dynasty China, begun by Chūzan in 1372, and enjoyed by the three Okinawan kingdoms which followed it. China provided ships for Ryukyu's maritime trade activities, allowed a limited number of Ryukyuans to study at the Imperial Academy in Beijing, and formally recognized the authority of the King of Chūzan, allowing the kingdom to trade formally at Ming ports. Ryukyuan ships, often provided by China, traded at ports throughout the region, which included, among others, China, Đại Việt (Vietnam), Japan, Java, Korea, Luzon, Malacca, Pattani, Palembang, Siam, and Sumatra.\n\nJapanese products—silver, swords, fans, lacquerware, folding screens—and Chinese products—medicinal herbs, minted coins, glazed ceramics, brocades, textiles—were traded within the kingdom for Southeast Asian sappanwood, rhino horn, tin, sugar, iron, ambergris, Indian ivory, and Arabian frankincense. Altogether, 150 voyages between the kingdom and Southeast Asia on Ryukyuan ships were recorded in the Rekidai Hōan, an official record of diplomatic documents compiled by the kingdom, as having taken place between 1424 and the 1630s, with 61 of them bound for Siam, 10 for Malacca, 10 for Pattani, and 8 for Java, among others.\nThe Chinese policy of haijin (海禁, \"sea bans\"), limiting trade with China to tributary states and those with formal authorization, along with the accompanying preferential treatment of the Ming Court towards Ryukyu, allowed the kingdom to flourish and prosper for roughly 150 years. In the late 16th century, however, the kingdom's commercial prosperity fell into decline. The rise of the wokou threat among other factors led to the gradual loss of Chinese preferential treatment; the kingdom also suffered from increased maritime competition from Portuguese traders.\n\n\nRebellion against the Shuri government Court and Centralization power\n\nIn 1493, Ryukyu and the “Japanese warships”(日本甲船) were involved in a conflict in Amami and Ryukyu was victorious in the incident. In 1500, the Oyake Akahachi Rebellion broke out in Ishigaki Island, one of Yaeyama Islands. King Shō Shin deployed approximately 3,000 troops and 46 warships to conquer the region. In 1507, he invaded Kume Island, and in 1522, he suppressed the rebellion of Onikō in Yonaguni (与那国・ 鬼 虎 の乱). In 1537 and 1571, he suppressed rebellions in the Amami region. \nIn 1509, as stated in stone tablet \"Momourasoe-no-Kanmei\" (百浦添之欄干之銘), the so-called “sword hunt”(刀狩り) was carried out, and all weapons possessed by the nobility called Samure (士族) and civilians were confiscated and stored in the royal armory under the strict control of the Shuri royal government. To suppress the rebellion of the ajis (按司 local lords), he forced them to reside in the vicinity of Shuri Castle and effectively dismantled the military capabilities of their subordinate troops.\nAs Shuri royal government concentrated its forces in Naha, central region were poorly defended, where the Satsuma army landed.\n\n\nSatsuma Clan's invasion and subordination\n\nAround 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi asked the Ryukyu Kingdom to aid in his campaign to conquer Korea. If successful, Hideyoshi intended to then move against China. As the Ryukyu Kingdom was a tributary state of the Ming dynasty, the request was refused. The Tokugawa shogunate that emerged following Hideyoshi's fall authorized the Shimazu family—feudal lords of the Satsuma domain (present-day Kagoshima Prefecture)—to send an expeditionary force to conquer the Ryukyus. The subsequent invasion took place in 1609, but Satsuma still allowed the Ryukyu Kingdom to find itself in a period of \"dual subordination\" to Japan and China, wherein Ryukyuan tributary relations were maintained with both the Tokugawa shogunate and the Chinese court.\nOccupation occurred fairly quickly, with some fierce fighting, and King Shō Nei was taken prisoner to Kagoshima and later to Edo (modern-day Tokyo). To avoid giving the Qing any reason for military action against Japan, the king was released two years later and the Ryukyu Kingdom regained a degree of autonomy. However, the Satsuma domain took back the control over some territory of the Ryukyu Kingdom, notably the Amami-Ōshima island group, which was incorporated into the Satsuma domain and remains a part of Kagoshima Prefecture, not Okinawa Prefecture.\nThe kingdom was described by Hayashi Shihei in Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu, which was published in 1785.\n\n\nTributary relations\n\nIn 1655, tribute relations between Ryukyu and Qing dynasty (the China's dynasty that followed Ming after 1644) were formally approved by the shogunate. This was seen to be justified, in part, because of the desire to avoid giving Qing any reason for military action against Japan.\nSince Ming China prohibited trade with Japan, the Satsuma domain, with the blessing of the Tokugawa shogunate, used the trade relations of the kingdom to continue to maintain trade relations with China. Considering that Japan had previously severed ties with most European countries except the Dutch, such trade relations proved especially crucial to both the Tokugawa shogunate and Satsuma domain, which would use its power and influence, gained in this way, to help overthrow the shogunate in the 1860s.\nThe Ryukyuan king was a vassal of the Satsuma daimyō, after Shimazu's Ryukyu invasion in 1609, the Satsuma Clan established a governmental office's branch known as Zaibankaiya (在番仮屋) or Ufukaiya (大仮屋) at Shuri in 1628, and became the base of Ryukyu domination for 250 years, until 1872. The Satsuma Domain's residents can be roughly compared to a European resident in a protectorate. However, the kingdom was not considered as part of any han (fief): up until the formal annexation of the islands and abolition of the kingdom in 1879, the Ryukyus were not truly considered de jure part of Edo Japan. Though technically under the control of Satsuma, Ryukyu was given a great degree of autonomy, to best serve the interests of the Satsuma daimyō and those of the shogunate, in trading with China. Ryukyu was a tributary state of China, and since Japan had no formal diplomatic relations with China, it was essential that China not realize that Ryukyu was controlled by Japan. Thus, Satsuma—and the shogunate—was obliged to be mostly hands-off in terms of not visibly or forcibly occupying Ryukyu or controlling the policies and laws there. The situation benefited all three parties involved—the Ryukyu royal government, the Satsuma daimyō, and the shogunate—to make Ryukyu seem as much a distinctive and foreign country as possible. Japanese were prohibited from visiting Ryukyu without shogunal permission, and the Ryukyuans were forbidden from adopting Japanese names, clothes, or customs. They were even forbidden from divulging their knowledge of the Japanese language during their trips to Edo; the Shimazu family, daimyōs of Satsuma, gained great prestige by putting on a show of parading the King, officials, and other people of Ryukyu to and through Edo. As the only han to have a king and an entire kingdom as vassals, Satsuma gained significantly from Ryukyu's exoticness, reinforcing that it was an entirely separate kingdom.\nAccording to statements by Qing imperial official Li Hongzhang in a meeting with Ulysses S. Grant, China had a special relationship with the island and the Ryukyu had paid tribute to China for hundreds of years, and the Chinese reserved certain trade rights for them in an amicable and beneficial relationship. Japan ordered tributary relations to end in 1875 after the tribute mission of 1874 was perceived as a show of submission to China.\n\n\nAnnexation by the Japanese Empire\n\nIn 1872, Emperor Meiji unilaterally declared that the kingdom was then Ryukyu Domain. At the same time, the appearance of independence was maintained for diplomatic reasons with Qing China until the Meiji government annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom when the islands were incorporated as Okinawa Prefecture on 27 March 1879. The Amami-Ōshima island group which had been integrated into Satsuma Domain became a part of Kagoshima Prefecture.\n\nThe last king of Ryukyu was forced to relocate to Tokyo, and was given a compensating kazoku rank as Marquis Shō Tai. Many royalist supporters fled to China. The king's death in 1901 diminished the historic connections with the former kingdom. With the abolition of the aristocracy after World War II, the Sho family continues to live in Tokyo.\n\n\nMajor events\n1187 – Shunten becomes King of Okinawa, based at Urasoe Castle.\n1272 – Envoys from the Mongol Empire are expelled from Okinawa by King Eiso.\n1276 – Mongols are violently driven off the island again.\n1372 – The first Ming dynasty envoy visits Okinawa, which had been divided into three kingdoms during the Sanzan period.

    "summary": "The Ryukyu Kingdom was a kingdom in the Ryukyu Islands from 1429 to 1872. It was ruled as a tributary state of the Ming dynasty by the Ryukyuan monarchy, who unified Okinawa Island to end the Sanzan period, and subsequently extended the kingdom to the Amami Islands and Sakishima Islands. The Ryukyu Kingdom played a central role in the maritime trade networks of medieval East Asia and Southeast Asia despite its small size. The Ryukyu Kingdom became a vassal state of the Satsuma Domain of Japan after the invasion of Ryukyu in 1609 but retained de jure independence until it was transformed into the Ryukyu Domain by the Empire of Japan in 1872. The Ryukyu Domain was formally annexed by Japan in 1879 and reorganized as Okinawa Prefecture, and the Ryukyuan monarchy was integrated into the new Japanese nobility.",

    "text": "MicroLED, also known as micro-LED, mLED or μLED is an emerging flat-panel display technology consisting of arrays of microscopic LEDs forming the individual pixel elements. Inorganic semiconductor microLED (μLED) technology was first invented in 2000 by the research group of Hongxing Jiang and Jingyu Lin of Texas Tech University (TTU) while they were at Kansas State University (KSU). The first high-resolution and video-capable InGaN microLED microdisplay in VGA format was realized in 2009 by Jiang, Lin and their colleagues at Texas Tech University and III-N Technology, Inc. via active driving of a microLED array by a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) IC. \nCompared to conventional LCD displays, microLED displays offer greatly reduced energy requirements while also offering pixel-level light control and a high contrast ratio. Compared to OLEDs, the inorganic nature of microLEDs gives them a longer lifetime and allows them to display brighter images with minimal risk of screen burn-in. Compared to other display technologies used for 3D/AR/VR, the sub-nanosecond response time of μLED has a huge advantage since 3D/AR/VR displays need high frames per second and fast response times to minimise ghosting. MicroLEDs are capable of high speed modulation, and have been proposed for chip-to-chip interconnect applications.\nAs of 2021, Sony, Samsung, and Konka started to sell microLED video walls. LG, Tianma, PlayNitride, TCL/CSoT, Jasper Display, Jade Bird Display, Plessey Semiconductors Ltd, and Ostendo Technologies, Inc. have demonstrated prototypes. Sony already sells microLED displays as a replacement for conventional cinema screens. BOE, Epistar, and Leyard have plans for microLED mass production. MicroLED can be made flexible and transparent, just like OLEDs.\nAccording to a report by Market Research Future, the MicroLED display market will reach around USD 24.3 billion by 2027. Custom Market Insights reported that the MicroLED display market is expected to reach around USD 182.7 Billion by 2032.\n\n\nResearch\nFollowing the first report of electrical injection microLEDs based on indium gallium nitride (InGaN) semiconductors in 2000 by the research group of Hongxing Jiang and Jingyu Lin, several groups have quickly engaged in pursuing this concept. Many related potential applications have been identified. Various on-chip connection schemes of microLED pixel arrays have been employed by AC LED Lighting, LLC (a company funded by Jiang and Lin) allowing for the development of single-chip high voltage DC/AC-LEDs to address the compatibility issue between the high voltage electrical infrastructure and low voltage operation nature of LEDs and high brightness self-emissive microdisplays.\nThe microLED array has also been explored as a light source for optogenetic applications and for visible light communications.\nEarly InGaN based microLED arrays and microdisplays were primarily passively driven. The first actively driven video-capable self-emissive InGaN microLED microdisplay in VGA format (640 × 480 pixels, each 12 μm in size with 15 μm between them) possessing low voltage requirements was patented and realized in 2009 by Jiang, Lin and their colleagues at Texas Tech and III-N Technology, Inc.(a company funded by Jiang and Lin) via integration between microLED array and CMOS integrated circuit (IC) and the work was also published in the following years.\nThe first microLED products were demonstrated by Sony in 2012. These displays, however, were very expensive.\nThere are several methods to manufacture microLED displays. The flip-chip method manufactures the LED on a conventional sapphire substrate, while the transistor array and solder bumps are deposited on silicon wafers using conventional manufacturing and metallization processes. Mass transfer is used to pick and place several thousand LEDs from one wafer to another at the same time, and the LEDs are bonded to the silicon substrate using reflow ovens. The flip-chip method is used for micro displays used on virtual reality headsets.  Another microLED manufacturing method involves bonding the LEDs to an IC layer on a silicon substrate and then removing the LED bonding material using conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques. The current bottleneck in the manufacturing process is the need to individually test every LED and replace faulty ones using an excimer laser lift-off apparatus, which uses a laser to weaken the bond between the LED and its substrate. Faulty LED replacement must be performed using high accuracy pick-and-place machines and the test and repair process takes several hours. The mass transfer process alone can take 18 days, for a smartphone screen with a glass substrate. Special LED manufacturing techniques can be used to increase yield and reduce the amount of faulty LEDs that need to be replaced. Each LED can be as small as 5 μm across. LED epitaxy techniques need to be improved to increase LED yields.\nThe characterization of microLEDs remains highly challenging due to their small size and the complexity of measuring their optical and electrical performance at scale. Techniques for efficient, non-destructive testing are still under development.\nExcimer lasers are used for several steps: laser lift-off to separate LEDs from their sapphire substrate and to remove faulty LEDs, for manufacturing the LTPS-TFT backplane, and for laser cutting of the finished LEDs. Special mass transfer techniques using elastomer stamps are also being researched. Other companies are exploring the possibility of packaging 3 LEDs: one red, one green and one blue LED into a single package to reduce mass transfer costs.\nQuantum dots are being researched as a way to shrink the size of microLED pixels, while other companies are exploring the use of phosphors and quantum dots to eliminate the need for different-colored LEDs. Sensors can be embedded in microLED displays.\nOver 130 companies are involved in microLED research and development. MicroLED light panels are also being made, and are an alternative to conventional OLED and LED light panels.\nDigital pulse-width modulation is well-suited to driving microLED displays. MicroLEDs experience a color shift as the current magnitude changes. Analog schemes change current to change brightness. With a digital pulse, only one current value is used for the on state. Thus, there is no color shift that occurs as brightness changes.\nCurrent microLED display offerings by Samsung and Sony consist of \"cabinets\" that can be tiled to create a large display of any size, with the display's resolution increasing with size. They also contain mechanisms to protect the display against water and dust. Each cabinet is 36.4 inches (92 cm) diagonally with a resolution of 960 × 540.\n\n\nCommercialization\nMicroLEDs have already demonstrated performance advantages over LCD and OLED displays, including higher brightness, lower latency, higher contrast ratio, greater color saturation, intrinsic self-illumination, better efficiency and longer lifetime.  Compared with OLED displays and LCDs, microLED displays stand out for their combination of high performance, durability, and energy efficiency.  Ultrahigh brightness is particularly relevant for applications in augmented-reality displays that compete with the Sun's brightness in outdoor environments.\nGlo and Jasper Display Corporation demonstrated the world's first RGB microLED microdisplay, measuring 0.55 inches (1.4 cm) diagonally, at SID Display Week 2017. Glo transferred their microLEDs to the Jasper Display backplane.\nSony launched a 55-inch (140 cm) \"Crystal LED Display\" in 2012 with 1920 × 1080 resolution, as a demonstration product. Sony announced its CLEDIS (Crystal LED Integrated Structure) brand which used surface mounted LEDs for large display production. As of August 2019, Sony offers CLEDIS in 146-inch (3.7 m), 182-inch (4.6 m) and 219-inch (5.6 m) displays. On 12 September 2019, Sony announced Crystal LED availability to consumers ranging from 1080p 110-inch (2.8 m) to 16K 790-inch (20 m) displays.\nSamsung demonstrated a 146-inch (3.7 m) microLED display called The Wall at CES 2018. In July 2018, Samsung announced plans on bringing a 4K microLED TV to consumer market in 2019. At CES 2019, Samsung demonstrated a 75-inch (1.9 m) 4K microLED display and 219-inch (5.6 m) 6K microLED display. On June 12 at InfoComm 2019, Samsung announced the global launch of The Wall Luxury microLED display configurable from 73-inch (1.9 m) in 2K to 292-inch (7.4 m) in 8K. On October 4, 2019, Samsung announced that The Wall Luxury microLED display shipments had begun.\nIn March 2018, Bloomberg reported Apple to have about 300 engineers devoted to in-house development of microLED screens. At IFA 2018 in August, LG Display demonstrated a 173-inch (4.4 m) microLED display.\nAt SID's Display Week 2019 in May, Tianma and PlayNitride demonstrated their co-developed 7.56-inch (19.2 cm) microLED display with over 60% transparency. China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSoT) demonstrated a 3.3-inch (8.4 cm) transparent microLED display with around 45% transparency, also co-developed with PlayNitride. Plessey Semiconductors Ltd demonstrated a monolithic monochrome blue GaN-on-silicon wafer bonded to a Jasper Display CMOS backplane 0.7-inch (18 mm) active-matrix microLED display with an 8 μm pixel pitch.\nAt SID's Display Week 2019 in May, Jade Bird Display demonstrated their 720p and 1080p microLED microdisplays with 5 μm and 2.5 μm pitch respectively, achieving luminance in the millions of candelas per square metre. In 2021, Jade Bird Display and Vuzix have entered a Joint manufacturing agreement for making microLED based projectors for smart glasses and augmented reality glasses \nAt Touch Taiwan 2019 on September 4, 2019, AU Optronics demonstrated a 12.1-inch (31 cm) microLED display and indicated that microLED was 1–2 years from mass commercialization. At IFA 2019 on September 13, 2019, TCL Corporation demonstrated their Cinema Wall featuring a 4K 132-inch (3.4 m) microLED display with maximum brightness of 1,500 cd/m2 and 2,500,000∶1 contrast ratio produced by their subsidiary China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSoT).\n\nAs of 2024, Samsung has already launched microLED display products including The Wall. Samsung's microLED display technology transfers micrometer-scale LEDs into LED modules, resulting in what resembles wall tiles composed of mass-transferred clusters of almost microscopic lights.\n\nSamsung has also debuted at 2024 CES their Transparent MicroLED display.\nLG has also debuted at 2024 CES their microLED display, called LG MAGNIT. \nIn terms of microLED microdisplay, Jade Bird Display launched 0.13\" series of MicroLED displays which has an active area of 0.13\" (3.3 mm) in diagonal and a resolution of 640X480 for AR and VR display products.\nApple reportedly invested billions of dollars in development of microLED displays in the years leading up to 2024, intending to transition its products to the technology beginning with the Apple Watch Ultra, before ultimately abandoning the effort after deciding it was unviable.

Gofrette also has a grandmother, Granny Smith (named after an Australian apple cultivar), who is only mentioned and shown in photographs. He is voiced by Sonja Ball. Gofrette's favourite exclamation is \"Zowie!\", sometimes with a variation such as, \"Zowie zow zow!\".\nFudge. An anthropomorphic dog with big floppy ears. Fudge is sometimes reluctant to get into what he thinks of as scary or embarrassing situations, but he is usually a good sport once participating. He is a bit fussy with his ears, and a source of his reluctance to participate in things. He owns a van called the Zanimo Wagon that he also lives in. He has been friends with Gofrette since they were a puppy and a kitty. He often uses the catchphrase, \"Wowie Zowie Gofrette.\" He has a big brother named Moocher, who is a mechanic and artist. He is voiced by Mark Camacho. He is also known as \"Blue\" in books.\nEllie Coptor. A pink-coloured bird with a propeller on her head that twirls depending on her mood. She operates a hair salon in her treehouse and plays with a quite bit in fashion and makeovers. As best friends with Gofrette and Fudge, Ellie rounds out the three with her fun, creative, and sometimes nervous–but–always–strong personality. Ellie's favourite snack is worms (which grosses out Fudge). She is voiced by Lucinda Davis. She has an aunt named Edna who wrote a book (in the cartoon) called \"Trapeze is For the Birds\".\n\n\nEpisodes\n\"The Diving Lesson\" — 2007.09.08\n\"Blue Torteloony\" — 2007.09.15\n\"Hot Chocolate Moose\" — 2007.09.22\n\"Silence... and Action\" — 2007.09.29\n\"To Fly a Kite\" — 2007.10.06\n\"Blueberry Fish Soup\" — 2007.10.13\n\"Finding Fudge\" — 2007.10.20\n\"3 Little Pigs\" — 2007.10.27\n\"For the Birds\" — 2007.11.03\n\"Where's Long Ears\" — 2007.11.10\n\"A Day at the Beach\" — 2007.11.17\n\"Surprise Party\" — 2007.11.24\n\"Zanimosaurus\" — 2007.12.01\n\"Moocher Returns\" — 2007.12.08\n\"The Snail Race\" — 2007.12.15\n\"Miss Know-It-All\" — 2007.12.22\n\"Monster Hunting\" — 2007.12.29\n\"Starstruck\" — 2008.01.05\n\"Wendell's Makeover\" — 2008.01.12\n\"The Birdysitter\" — 2008.01.19\n\"The Barber of Zanimo!\" — 2008.01.26\n\"One Silly Fusilli Cat!\" — 2008.02.02\n\"The Pirates of Zanimo\" — 2008.02.09\n\"The Falling Out\" — 2008.02.16\n\"Bellybutton Day!\" — 2008.02.23\n\"Zippety Hair Do Day\" — 2008.03.01\n\"Red's Day Out\" — 2008.03.08\n\"The Falling Star\" — 2008.03.15\n\"Crazy Flu!\" — 2008.03.22\n\"Mystery Presents\" — 2008.03.29\n\"To Catch the Wind\" — 2008.04.05\n\"Bike Rally\" — 2008.04.12\n\"Home Sweet Home\" — 2008.04.19\n\"Zanimo Man\" — 2008.04.26\n\"Quicky Slows Down\" — 2008.05.03\n\"The Scary Sleepover\" — 2008.05.10\n\"The Legend of The Zanimozopogo\" — 2008.05.17\n\"Camping Diva\" — 2008.05.24\n\"Goodbye Fusillis\" — 2008.05.31\n\"Super Hero's Super Sale\" — 2008.06.07\n\"The Blossom Tree\" — 2008.06.14\n\"To the Top\" — 2008.06.21\n\"Mr. Babaloonie\" — 2008.06.28\n\"To Catch a Cuckoo\" — 2008.07.05\n\"Butterfly Garden\" — 2008.07.12\n\"Munching Plant\" — 2008.07.19\n\"The Crossing Guard\" — 2008.07.26\n\"Wendell's Dinner\" — 2008.08.02\n\"Ride 'Em Cowboy\" — 2008.08.09\n\"The Tricky Trickster\" — 2008.08.16\n\"The Disappearing Magician\" — 2008.08.23\n\"The Stinky Cheese Thief\" — 2008.08.30\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nGofrette at IMDb",

    "text": "Melanelia microglabra is a rare species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling) foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. It is found in high-elevation locations in Sikkim, India. \n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe lichen was formally described as a new species in 2003 by lichenologists Pradeep Divakar, Dalip Kumar Upreti, Gopal Prasad Sinha, and John Elix. The type specimen was collected by the third author in the Llonakh valley of Mangan district in Sikkim, at an altitude of 4,500 m (14,800 ft). It is named for its similarity to the bark-dwelling Australian species Melanelia pseudoglabra, from which it differs by its smaller thallus, narrower lobes, substrate preference, and chemistry.\n\n\nDescription\nThe foliose thallus of Melanelia microglabra, which is somewhat loosely attached to its rock substrate, has a leathery texture and reaches a diameter of up to 1.5 cm (0.6 in). The individual lobes comprising the thallus measure 0.2–1.0 mm wide, with incised tips and lacking any cilia at the margins. The upper thallus surface is brown to black, with a rugulose to warty texture, and lacking isidia, soredia, pustules, pseudocyphellae, apothecia and pycnidia, while the lower thallus surface is black, with brown apices. The rhizines are sparse, simple, and black.\nMelanelia microglabra contains gyrophoric acid and a major metabolite, ovoic acid as a submajor substance, and both lecanoric acid and 2-O-methyllecanoric acid and minor components. The expected results of standard chemical spot tests are K−, HNO3+ (pale red) in the cortex, and K−, C+ (pink), KC+ (red), and P− in the medulla.\n\n\nHabitat and distribution\nAt the time of its original publication, Melanelia microglabra had only been collected at the type locality. It has since been enumerated as one of the approximately 200 lichen taxa recorded in the Kangchenjunga biosphere reserve in the eastern Himalayas.\n\n\nReferences",

It was created by magician André Kole and illusion designer Ken Whitaker for magician Melinda Saxe. It was one of Saxe's signature tricks and featured as a highlight in her various First Lady of Magic shows.\nThe illusion featured in several network television magic specials. It was first shown on television in November 1995, when Melinda performed it on The World's Greatest Magic II broadcast by NBC. It later served as one of the big set pieces in Melinda's own Melinda, First Lady of Magic special produced by Disney and broadcast on CBS in March 1997. The television special 50 Greatest Magic Tricks, broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 in May 2002, named Drill of Death as number 41 in its list of the 50 greatest magic tricks of all time.\nDuring Melinda's performing career she was the only magician presenting the illusion. She ceased performing in 2002  to raise a family, and since then, the drill has been performed by two illusionists in Europe, German illusionist Jan Rouven and  Dutch Christian Farla. It featured in the 2005 edition of the annual German television special Stars in der Manege, in which actress, model, and TV presenter Arabella Kiesbauer played the role of victim.\n\n\nDescription of the effect\nThe effect is similar in some ways to the illusion Impaled, although Drill of Death is larger and features additional elements. It can be presented either as a straightforward penetration illusion or as an \"escape gone wrong\" piece, in which the audience is first given the impression it is an escapology act of the \"predicament escape\" type, and then given the shock of seeing it appear to go wrong with apparently fatal consequences for the performer.\nThe apparatus consists of a massive drilling machine mounted on a framework that is somewhat like a short section of railroad track. At one end of the track, nearest the audience, is a raised frame large enough to hold a person. At the beginning of the performance, the drill is positioned at the far end of the track with its long, helical drill bit pointing horizontally forwards. The performer is chained to the frame with her torso in line with the drilling axis. A cover, consisting of translucent paper stretched on a circular frame, is attached to the apparatus in front of the performer, obscuring the center of her torso. The machine is then started; the drill bit rotates and the machine begins advancing slowly towards the performer. Then, the device appears to go out of control and speeds up (sometimes with pyrotechnics for added drama). The drill appears to penetrate through the struggling performer, whose legs, shoulders, arms, and head remain in full view, and whose lower torso is seen in silhouette through the translucent cover. The tip of the drill emerges and rips through the cover, when both the forward motion and rotation of the drill bit stop. The cover is removed to show the limp body of the performer seemingly impaled on the end of the drill. The machine then begins to tilt the drilling axis upwards, in the process pulling the performer from her restraints and raising her high into the air. When the drill's axis is vertical, the bit begins to rotate again, spinning the performer's limply spreadeagled body around. The drill then stops and lowers the performer back onto the frame, where assistants cover her torso with a blanket and seemingly push the drill back out of her. The performer then appears to revive and steps from the apparatus to take a bow.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPublicity photo by R Scott Hooper\nMagic Cafe discussion of the illusion",

    "text": "The Bangkok Christian Hospital (Thai: โรงพยาบาลกรุงเทพคริสเตียน) is one of the oldest general hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. Situated on Silom Road, Bang Rak District.\n\n\nHistory\nThe first Christian missionaries arriving in Thailand in 19th century often combined preaching with medical help for local population. They considered medical healing as part of their mission, as Jesus had commanded them to \"Heal the Sick\".\nIn 1840 the Presbyterian Mission was established in Bangkok and expanded its offices over the country for evangelism together with the healing mission. Initially, clinics were set up which gradually developed into better equipped hospitals.\nAfter the Second World War, the American Presbyterian Mission and the Church of Christ in Thailand purchased a land between Silom Road and Surawong Road with several wooden buildings. After renovation, the buildings were officially inaugurated as the Bangkok Christian Hospital in 1949.\nA new Outpatient Department of the Hospital was opened in 1957 with dentistry, laboratory, and pharmacy facilities along with a chapel. A few years later, an operating building (1961) and the Inpatient Department (1965) was added.\nIn the 1970s, an office building in honour of the \"Church of Christ in Thailand\", was constructed on Surawong Road, and the 13-storey \"Mo Bradley Building\", named after the pioneer missionary and doctor Dr. Dan Beach Bradley in Thailand, was completed in 1981. The 17-storey \"Mo Welles Building\" was completed in 2006, named after the first director of the Hospital, Marshall Phillip Welles. It received hospital accreditation since 2013.\n\n\nMission\nAt present The Bangkok Christian Hospital has special centers (International Refractive Center, Skin care & laser Center, Health Screening Center, Dental Care Center) and specialized departments (internal medicine, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, orthopedics, surgery, radiology, anesthesiology).\nBesides medical care it provides pastoral care with its same name division.\nThe hospital is considered to be good and much cheaper than other similar quality hospitals by the expatriate community in Thailand.\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial page of the Bangkok Christian Hospital\n\n\nReferences",

Comedians such as Andy Kaufman, Billy Crystal, Rodney Dangerfield, David Steinberg, Jimmie Walker, David Brenner and Nipsey Russell also performed on the show.

    "title": "Denman Arena",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=4382662",
    "text": "Denman Arena was an indoor arena located in the West End neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia. The arena was located at 1805 West Georgia Street at the northwest corner with Denman Street. It opened in December 1911 and was destroyed by fire in 1936. Its primary use was for ice sports such as ice hockey. It was the home ice rink of the Vancouver Millionaires professional ice hockey team, and was the location of the 1915 Stanley Cup championships. The arena was also used for other sports, musical performances, and public assemblies. It was an assembly point for Canadian servicemen during World War I. The 10,500-seat arena was the largest in Canada at the time, and introduced mechanically frozen or \"artificial\" ice to Canada.\n\n\nConstruction\nIn January 1911, Joe Patrick sold his Nelson, British Columbia lumber business for $440,000. The Patrick family moved to Victoria and the decision was made to use the proceeds of the company sale to go into the business of professional ice hockey. The family built the Denman Arena to support the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association professional ice hockey league, to be run by Joe's sons Frank and Lester Patrick. Both Frank and Lester were professional ice hockey players and had played in the National Hockey Association and other early professional leagues in Eastern Canada. Simultaneously, the Patricks also built the 4000-seat Patrick Arena in Victoria.\nTo build the Vancouver arena, the Patricks bought a parcel of land consisting of thirteen lots from the water's edge of Coal Harbour to Georgia Street, bounded by Denman and Chilco Streets. The location was near Stanley Park to the west, and was connected to the downtown business district by a streetcar line along Georgia Street. The site was previously the location of the Kanaka Ranch, which was settled in the 1860s by Hawaiian families, who grew fruit and vegetables, and produced charcoal, on the site.\nTo finance the construction of the Arena, the Patricks formed the Vancouver Arena Company Limited, capitalized at $200,000. The company was divided into 1000 preferred shares and 1000 common shares, with a 10% annual dividend. The company issued an initial share offering, but by September 1911, the offering had only raised $1400. Two more investors signed on, but it was up to the Patricks to take the rest. To facilitate the playing of ice hockey in Vancouver's moderate climate, the Patricks imported mechanical ice freezing equipment that Frank and Lester Patrick had seen in operation at New York's St. Nicholas Arena. The Denman Arena opened on December 20, 1911, attracting 1500 people for a session of public ice skating. Denman Arena held 10,500 people, making it at the time, the largest indoor arena in Canada, one of the world's largest indoor arenas, and the second largest indoor arena in North America, after the second Madison Square Garden in New York City. The Arena was built at a cost of $226,382.\nIn 1927, the Patricks built the 2,500 seat Denman Auditorium next to the Arena. The Auditorium, which was multi-purpose, survived the fire of 1936 and was renovated in 1952. It re-opened on September 10, 1952, as the Georgia Auditorium concert hall. It only lasted seven years before it was demolished in 1959, after the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre.\n\n\nUsage\nThe Arena was the permanent home of the professional Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Arena was also the home of the New Westminster Royals from 1911 until 1914. The Patricks had hoped to set up teams in Calgary and Edmonton in the PCHA for the opening season, but the plans fell through. To avoid having a two-team league, the Patricks formed the Royals, to represent the neighbouring town of New Westminster and encourage fans to come to the Arena. Although the Royals were an unexpected necessity, the Royals were the winners of the first PCHA championship. The Royals were disbanded in 1914, when the PCHA formed a team in Portland, Oregon. The Millionaires were later renamed the Maroons and were disbanded in 1926 when the Western Canada Hockey League discontinued operations.\nThe Arena hosted the Stanley Cup \"World Series\" championship series four times. The 1915 series pitted the Millionaires versus the National Hockey Association's Ottawa Senators, the first Stanley Cup series held west of Winnipeg. The series was won by the Millionaires, and remains the only Stanley Cup won by a Vancouver team. The Arena also hosted Stanley Cup series in 1921, won by Ottawa, the 1923 series won by Ottawa and game two of the 1925 series, won by the Victoria Cougars.\nDuring construction, the Patricks organized a four-team amateur ice hockey league, the Vancouver Amateur Hockey League, composed of the Vancouver Athletic Club, the Bankers, the Columbians and the Vancouver Rowing Club. In 1921, the Arena hosted the first international women's championship of ice hockey, organized by the PCHA. After the collapse of the Western Canada league, a new Pacific Coast Hockey League was organized, with the  Vancouver Lions playing out of the Arena. The PCHL lasted three years. In 1933, the Lions were revived in the North West Hockey League. The Lions continued after the destruction of the Arena, and a reconstituted PCHL began operations with the Lions as a member.\nTwo other ice sports clubs had their start at the Denman Arena. The Arena also had four curling rinks in the basement and the Vancouver Curling Club was established in December 1911. Curling was discontinued during World War I to make way for the armed forces. The Club re-organized in 1931 at the Pacific National Exhibition's Forum. The Club built its own facility in 1949. The Connaught Skating Club also was established in December 1911, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011. During the 1920s, the Club held competitions and an annual \"Carnival\" show at the Arena. After the Arena burned down, Connaught moved to the Forum as well, and in 1965 moved to Richmond, British Columbia to Richmond's Minoru Arena.\nThe Arena and Auditorium were also used for boxing and wrestling matches. The North Shore Indians of the Inter-City League played box lacrosse in the Arena in the 1930s.\nIn 1914, the Arena was used to house over 1,000 soldiers who were assembling to form the 23rd Infantry Brigade. The soldiers left Vancouver in August 1914 to be deployed as the first Canadian troops in World War I.\nOn October 21, 1924, the Arena was the site of a political radio broadcast by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who spoke at Denman Arena during a tour of the west. It may have been the first political broadcast in Canada. Later that year, the telephone line installed was used for the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game in British Columbia.\nOn April 28, 1935, over 16,000 assembled at the Arena for a political rally by the CCF, the largest indoor gathering in Vancouver up until that time.\nThe Denman Auditorium was taken over during World War II by the Canadian navy, then used as storage by Boeing Aircraft. It was bought in 1945 by H. M. Singer, who converted it back to a venue. Two notable rock and roll concerts took place in 1957, by a touring group of musicians known as \"The Biggest Show of Stars.\" The lineup included Paul Anka, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, Fats Domino, The Drifters, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Buddy Knox and others. The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra regularly played at the venue during the 1950s. The final event at the Georgia Auditorium took place on June 19, 1959. It was a free show by the CBC Talent Caravan.\nOther musical performances at the Arena and Auditorium included performances by Maurice Ravel, Dizzy Gillespie, Glenn Gould, Charlie Parker, Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, Jeanette MacDonald, Margaret Truman and others.\n\n\nDestruction by fire\nThe Arena was built of wood in 1911. Not long before 1936, the Arena was clad in brick to reduce its risk of burning due to fire. On the night of August 19, 1936, 4,000 fans had attended a boxing match by Max Baer. By 1:30 AM that night, a fire had broken out in the adjacent Coal Harbour area. Despite the recently added brick veneer, the fire spread to inside the Arena. The interior exploded into flame and the Arena could not be saved by Vancouver firemen. Stan Patrick, the youngest brother of Frank and Lester Patrick, and manager of the auditorium, attended the fire and was quoted as saying \"You think this is a good fire? You should have seen the one in Victoria. That was a pip!\" A lack of wind prevented the huge fire from spreading into downtown Vancouver. The overall damage of the fire was estimated at $500,000. Two persons were killed and three firemen injured. The Arena was destroyed, along with seven industrial buildings, two homes and fifty-eight small boats. The concrete floor of the Arena was not destroyed, and it was adapted into an outdoor dance floor named the Starlight.\nIn 1945, the site of the arena was sold by Lester Patrick to Vancouver theatre owner H. M. Singer for $80,000. Singer planned to build a $1 million sports arena on the site, but the arena was never built. Singer managed the Auditorium as a concert venue until 1959.\n\n\nSite today\nThe site today is now part of Devonian Harbour Park. A historical marker has been placed at the foot of Denman Street, with information about the Arena, the Georgia Auditorium and Coal Harbour.\n\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBowlsby, Craig.

    "text": "The Brain That Wouldn't Die (also known as The Head That Wouldn't Die or The Brain That Couldn't Die) is a 1962 American science fiction horror film directed by Joseph Green and written by Green and Rex Carlton. The film was completed in 1959 under the working title The Black Door but was not theatrically released until May 3, 1962, under its new title as a double feature with Invasion of the Star Creatures.\nThe film focuses upon a mad doctor who develops a means of keeping human body parts alive. He keeps his fiancée's severed head alive for days, along with a lumbering, malformed brute (one of his earlier failed experiments) imprisoned in a closet.\nThe specific plot device of a mad doctor who discovers a way to keep a human head alive had been used in fiction earlier (such as Professor Dowell's Head from 1925), as well as other variants on this theme. It shares several key plot devices with the West German horror film The Head (1959).\nThe film was in the public domain in the United States from the day of its release due to a flawed copyright notice.\n\n\nPlot\n\nDr. Bill Cortner saves a patient who had been pronounced dead, but the senior surgeon, Bill's father, condemns his son's unorthodox methods and theories of transplanting.\nWhile driving to his family's country house, Bill and his beautiful fiancée Jan Compton become involved in a car accident that decapitates her. Bill recovers her severed head and rushes to his country house basement laboratory. He and his disabled assistant Kurt revive the head in a liquid-filled tray. But Jan's new existence is agony, and she begs Bill to let her die. He ignores her pleas, and she grows to resent him.\nBill decides to commit murder to obtain a body for Jan. He hunts for a suitable specimen at a burlesque nightclub, on the streets, and at a beauty contest. Jan begins communicating telepathically with a hideous mutant, an experiment gone wrong, locked in a laboratory cell. When Kurt leaves a hatch in the cell door unlocked, the monster grabs and tears off Kurt's arm. Kurt dies from his injuries.\nBill lures an old girlfriend, figure model Doris Powell, to his house, promising to study her scarred face for plastic surgery. He drugs her and carries her to the laboratory. Jan protests Bill's plan to transplant her head onto Doris's body. He tapes Jan's mouth shut.\nWhen Bill goes to quiet the monster, it grabs Bill through the hatch and breaks the door from its hinges. Their struggles set the laboratory ablaze. The monster, a seven-foot giant with a horribly deformed head, bites a chunk from Bill's right cheek. Bill dies, and the monster carries the unconscious Doris to safety. As the lab goes up in flames, Jan says \"I told you to let me die\". The screen goes black, followed by Jan's maniacal cackle, welcoming her long-awaited death.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\nThe film was shot independently around Tarrytown, New York, in 1959 under the working title The Black Door. Producer Rex Carlton suggested calling the film I Was a Teenage Brain Surgeon in the style of the similar titles of the time. The title was later changed to The Head That Wouldn't Die. Some prints of the film use both the opening title The Brain That Wouldn't Die and the closing title The Head That Wouldn't Die.\nThe monster in the closet was played, in his first cinematic role, by Eddie Carmel, a well-known Mandatory Palestine-born circus performer, who worked under the name \"The Jewish Giant\". He was the subject of a photograph by Diane Arbus, titled \"The Jewish Giant at Home with His Parents in the Bronx, N.Y., 1970\".\nThe main theme, titled \"The Web\", was composed by Abe Baker and Tony Restaino and was noted for creating a sinister mood.\n\n\nRelease\n\nThe movie was picked up for release by AIP and released in 1962 on a double bill with Invasion of the Star Creatures. AIP cut it for theatrical release.\n\n\nHome media\nAn uncut, 35 mm print was used in the Special Edition release by Synapse Films in 2002. Running 85 minutes, this version features more of the stripper catfight, as well as some extra gore.\nIn December 2015, Shout! Factory released a Blu-ray edition of the uncut film, with a high-definition transfer taken from the negative.\n\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 episode\nThe film was featured in episode 513 of Mystery Science Theater 3000, first airing on Comedy Central on October 30, 1993.\nThis film was the first movie watched by Mike Nelson in Mystery Science Theater 3000, after he replaced Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson) on the series. The theme song was altered for this change, and the \"doorway sequence\" into the theater was also updated.\nIn a poll of Bring Back MST3K Kickstarter backers, which raised money for an eleventh season of the show, The Brain that Wouldn't Die was ranked #23. Writer Jim Vorel ranked the episode considerably lower, at #131 in his ranking of MST3K episodes from the first twelve seasons, saying, \"It’s a dark, fairly ugly movie with extremely cheap sets, but Mike’s presence puts the crew into an upbeat, energetic state that contrasts nicely with it.\"\nThe MST3K episode was released on VHS by Rhino Home Video in 1996 and as a single-disc DVD in April 2000; the uncut version of the original movie was also included as a bonus feature. Shout! Factory released the episode on DVD as part of the box set Mystery Science Theater 3000: The 25th Anniversary Edition on December 10, 2013. The Brain That Wouldn't Die shared a disc with Mitchell (episode #512); the disc also included an interview with actress Marilyn (Hanold) Neilson. Other episodes included in the collection are Moon Zero Two (episode #111), The Day the Earth Froze (episode #422), The Leech Woman (episode #802), , and Gorgo (episode #909).\n\n\nReception and legacy\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on 13 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 4.63/10.\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 1.5 out of four stars, calling it \"poorly produced\".\nOn his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar gave the film a mostly negative review, noting that, although it managed to work up a certain amount of tension and featured some good gore effects, it was ruined by its lack of likable and intelligent characters and its \"inability to decide just how it wants to be taken\".\nBrian J. Dillard from AllMovie said of the film: \"Hokey, overwrought, and poorly paced, this venerable creature feature still commands a sizable following on the basis of its campy, low-grade special effects, its T&A exploitation, and its many pseudo-philosophical soliloquies\".\nTV Guide awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it \"one of the most genuinely bizarre 'brain' movies\".\n\n\nAdaptations\nThe movie also inspired the musical stage production The Brain That Wouldn't Die! In 3D!!! by Tom Sivak and Elizabeth Gelman, that premiered at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in October 2011.\nIn 2015, Pug Bujeaud's musical theatrical production The HEAD! That Wouldn't Die was mounted in Olympia, Washington by Theater Artists Olympia. Lyrics and music were written by the ensemble cast and the TAO collective.\nSoon thereafter, Hollywood screenwriter Bruce Bernhard adapted the script as a staged musical comedy, creating a completely new score for it with songwriter Chris Cassone. The official world premiere for The Brain That Wouldn’t Die!…the Musical was at the Footlight Players Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina on October 13, 2016.\nA satirical feature film adaptation of the same title was filmed on location in Portland, Oregon. The film premiered on June 21, 2020, as part of the Portland Horror Film Festival.\nIn 2024, a new musical adaptation titled The Brain That Wouldn't Die! (The Musical) premiered at the Riverside Arts Center in Ypsilanti, Michigan, produced by Star Jelly Performance Company. The production featured an all-original book, music, and lyrics written by Carla Margolis. This version expands on the original 1960s B-movie’s plot, adding contemporary themes such as body autonomy, ethical dilemmas in scientific experimentation, and the complexities behind good people making bad decisions. The musical retains the campy, tongue-in-cheek spirit of the original film while delivering a fresh perspective through Margolis's original score and comedic lyrics. With a professional cast and live musicians, the production highlights dark humor, bizarre science, and dramatic musical numbers. The Brain That Wouldn't Die! (The Musical) was designed to be a unique blend of horror, comedy, and musical theater, providing audiences with an immersive experience. The show had a limited run from October 25 to November 2, 2024.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe film was featured on the nationally syndicated television show Cinema Insomnia, hosted by Mr. Lobo.\nThe film inspired the title and premise of the stage play The Head that Wouldn't Die by Rand Higbee.\n\n\nSee also\nIsolated brain\nThe Lady and the Monster, a 1944 film about a living brain kept inside a jar.\nEyes Without a Face, a 1960 horror film about organ transplantation.\nThe Brain, another film released in 1962 featuring an isolated brain.\nDonovan's Brain, a 1953 black-and-white science fiction horror film featuring Nancy Davis (later Nancy Reagan).\nThe Man with Two Brains, 1983 film\nRe-Animator (1985 film), another take on the subject, loosely based on a Lovecraft novelette, spawning two sequels and a cult status.\nFrankenhooker (1990 film), also about a mad scientist bringing his decapitated wife back to life with stolen body parts.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nFurther reading\nFleming, Chet (February 1988).

    "summary": "The Brain That Wouldn't Die (also known as The Head That Wouldn't Die or The Brain That Couldn't Die) is a 1962 American science fiction horror film directed by Joseph Green and written by Green and Rex Carlton. The film was completed in 1959 under the working title The Black Door but was not theatrically released until May 3, 1962, under its new title as a double feature with Invasion of the Star Creatures.\nThe film focuses upon a mad doctor who develops a means of keeping human body parts alive. He keeps his fiancée's severed head alive for days, along with a lumbering, malformed brute (one of his earlier failed experiments) imprisoned in a closet.\nThe specific plot device of a mad doctor who discovers a way to keep a human head alive had been used in fiction earlier (such as Professor Dowell's Head from 1925), as well as other variants on this theme. It shares several key plot devices with the West German horror film The Head (1959).\nThe film was in the public domain in the United States from the day of its release due to a flawed copyright notice.",

Registration for all interested clubs closed on December 31, 2013. CONCACAF broadened the possibilities for participation and further indicated that the competition was not limited to professional clubs only. Therefore, clubs with amateur status were also eligible for participation.\nA total of 13 teams from 9 CFU associations entered the competition. Valencia (Haiti) was given a bye to the final round as the best performer among the entrants both in the 2013 CFU Club Championship and the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League. The other 12 teams entered the first round.\n\nThe following associations did not enter a team:\n\n\nFirst round\nIn the first round, the 12 teams were divided into three groups of four, with each group containing at least two league champions.

Both finalists and the winner of the third place match would qualify for the 2014–15 CONCACAF Champions League.\nOn March 31, 2014, the CFU announced that Valencia, which were given a bye to the final round, could not participate in the competition after the Haitian Football Federation failed to confirm the club as an active member of the federation due to a fallout between the club and the federation. After consultation with CONCACAF and the three first round group winners which were to play with Valencia in the final round, the three group winners, Bayamón FC, Waterhouse, and Alpha United, were chosen to represent the CFU in the 2014–15 CONCACAF Champions League, subject to the clubs meeting the minimum standards for participation.

    "text": "Saving Private Ryan: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album for the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. The album was produced by composer John Williams and distributed by DreamWorks Records. Recorded in Symphony Hall, Boston, Massachusetts, the scores were performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with two of the ten compositions featuring vocals from the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. The soundtrack runs for just over an hour, while the film itself lasts over two hours.\nThroughout the compositions, brass (especially French Horns), and strings were used to evoke a variety of emotions and tones. The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics, but was still nominated for several major awards, of which it won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television. Soundtrack opener \"Hymn to the Fallen\" received some radio play, in particular on the United States holidays Veterans Day and Memorial Day. The soundtrack was remastered and reissued as a commemorative twentieth anniversary edition by La-La Land Records in 2018.\n\n\nBackground\nSteven Spielberg and John Williams had worked together on fifteen films before Saving Private Ryan (1998). The score was recorded at Symphony Hall in Boston, Massachusetts with the assistance of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. After having recorded the re-edited version of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and some of Schindler's List (1993) at Symphony Hall previously, this was the third time Spielberg and Williams worked on a soundtrack at this location. Spielberg chose Symphony Hall as the site for the recording because the hall gives \"rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling\" and allows you to \"hear the air,\" which some soundstages do not allow you to do. Spielberg stated he chose to work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra because the film deals with a \"company of soldiers\" and the orchestra was an \"experienced company of musicians.\" Over the course of a three-day period in February 1998, the score for the film was recorded at a rate of around $100,000 an hour.\nSpielberg and Williams both watched a rough cut of the film to determine what scenes would have music. The two decided to leave music out of the fighting sequences, in favor of playing it over long sequences of eight to nine minutes that lack action. The playing of music between fighting sequences gives a moment of reflection for what happened. Tom Hanks came to a portion of the recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams. This caused the musicians to shuffle their feet in appreciation.\nWilliams chose to use different families and types of instruments to convey and evoke certain tones within the score. String instruments were chosen to provide a warm sound, brass instruments were utilized for \"solemn\" sections of the pieces, and horn instruments were used to give off a pensive tone. Military drums were used largely in the piece entitled \"Hymn to the Fallen.\" The Tanglewood Festival Chorus provided a vocal chorus for \"Hymn to the Fallen\" that served as a memory to those who have fallen in combat. \"Hymn to the Fallen\" and its reprise are the only two tracks that feature any sort of vocals and bookend the album. Spielberg chose to place \"Hymn to the Fallen\" on the closing credits because it will \"stand the test of time and honor forever the fallen of this war and possibly all wars\" and felt it showed Williams' \"sensitivity and brilliance.\" The album was released on July 21, 1998. The soundtrack was remastered and reissued as a commemorative twentieth anniversary edition by La-La Land Records on August 28, 2018, and included two new tracks.\n\n\nReception\n\nAuthor Emilio Audissino felt that the music offered no \"perspective\" as Williams' scores normally do, but was instead rooted in emotion. Classic FM believed that despite the restrictions placed on Williams, he still managed to create a \"moving theme.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed, stating Williams added \"sentiment wherever he could nonetheless.\" Hillel Italie of the Associated Press found the soundtrack to be \"bland\" and \"out of place.\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post found the soundtrack created by Williams to be \"quietly heroic, full of survivalist determination and pragmatic melancholy.\" In regard to all of Williams' soundtracks for Spielberg films, Harrington believed that this soundtrack was the most \"subtle.\" Calgary Herald writers felt Williams' created a \"reflective score\" that \"is sensitive without sensationalizing the subject.\"\nIan Black of The Sun (Sheridan, Oregon) compared the music for Flags of Our Fathers (2006) with that of Saving Private Ryan stating that it was \"nowhere close\" to the latter. Barbera Vancheri of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that \"John Williams' symphonic score soars in the background like church music.\" Edmonton Journal writer Ted Shaw found the \"meditative quality\" of Williams' score to be a surprise when compared to the intensity of the fighting sequences. He added that the music was an \"elevating\" component of the film. Thomas Doherty also noted that the music \"lacks the bombast of the incoming shells,\" stating that it was \"quietly martial\" with its use of trumpets and mild percussion.\nIn addition to the film itself, the soundtrack received several nominations for various awards. The score won the Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television. In addition, the score was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, but failed to win the awards.\nIn 2003, the Cleveland Institute of Music published a list of uplifting classical music pieces that featured \"Hymn to the Fallen\" and \"Omaha Beach.\" Within the United States, \"Hymn to the Fallen\" received minor radio airplay on Veterans Day and Memorial Day. Classic FM voted the soundtrack to its \"Movie Music Hall of Fame\" that consists of the top 100 movie soundtracks chosen by fan votes. The soundtrack placed sixteenth on the list, two places lower than the previous year.

    "title": "The Quadroons",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=61908557",
    "text": "\"The Quadroons\" is a short story written by American writer Lydia Maria Child (1802-1880) and published in The Liberty Bell in 1842. The influential short story depicts the life and death of a mixed-race woman and her daughter in early nineteenth century America, a slave-owning society. \nChild originated the trope of the \"tragic mulatta\", which became well-known in the anti-slavery literature of the time, was taken up also by many other writers. Years later, Harriet Jacobs's autobiography Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (edited by Lydia Maria Child) featured the same theme, but with important changes, effectively giving her an agency Child's main characters never had.\n\n\nBackground\nLydia Maria Child (1802-1880) was an influential writer who advocated for Native Americans, women, and enslaved people. Already an abolitionist, she and her husband joined a group of antislavery reformers under the influence of William Lloyd Garrison in the 1830s.\nScholars credit Child with the invention of the \"tragic mulatta\", a mixed-race woman in a slave-owning society whose life ends tragically, and being the first to introduce the trope in American Literature. Many legal codes in the United States dealt with miscegenation; mixed-race marriages were forbidden, and the legal doctrine of Partus sequitur ventrem meant that children had to accept the status of the mother, meaning that an enslaved mother's children would automatically \"belong\" to the person enslaving the mother. The \"tragic mulatta\", then, is a mixed-race woman who almost passes for white and falls in love with a white man, but is legally (and sometimes psychologically) incapable of living independently from that man. The narrative almost always ends in tragedy, and often suicide.\n\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe setting of the story is a cottage in Augusta, GA, before the Civil War. The two main characters, Rosalie, a \"quadroon\", and her husband Edward, a \"Georgian,\" are living together in \"a marriage sanctioned by Heaven, though unrecognized on earth\" Rosalie, as a partly African-American woman, cannot legally marry a White man, but they live together as if they are man and wife, and she makes no legal claim on her common-law husband. They have a daughter named Xarifa, who grows up sheltered.\nEdward develops political ambition, and for leverage he marries a wealthy white woman, the daughter of an important politician, essentially destroying the marriage between him and Rosalie. He asks her to be his mistress but she declines, finding it morally repulsive. Rosalie and Xarifa live alone in the cottage until Rosalie died of heart break from losing Edward. Xarifa had been taken care of by teachers including George Elliot, a young man hired by her father, but Edward becomes an alcoholic due to the guilt he feels after Rosalie's death. His drinking becomes his downfall: he falls off his horse when drunk, and dies--without a will, but his wife makes no change and continues to provide for his daughter.  \nXarifa and her harp teacher fall in love and plan to move to France together, but Xarifa was sold before this could occur: \"Rosalie, though she knew it not, had been the daughter of a slave; whose wealthy master, though he remained attached to her to the end of her days, had carelessly omitted to have papers of manumission recorded\". Because Rosalie's mother had never been manumitted, her daughter and her granddaughter are still legally the property of the owner's family. Xarifa was auctioned off to the highest bidder, who is a man who tries to \"win her favor, by flattery and presents\", but she refuses to become his lover. Xarifa and George plan an escape but are betrayed by another enslaved person who is a double agent, and George is shot and killed in the attempt. Afterward, Xarifa's owner, having lost his patience, rapes her and she takes her own life--for the tragic mulatta, sexual violence and death are the only options.\n\n\nCharacters\nRosalie, the \"quadroon\" of the title, is a young woman who can almost pass for white; she loves Edward knowing that she cannot marry him. She and their child, Xarifa, live in a secluded cottage in Georgia until Edward moves out to marry a White woman.\nEdward, a well-to-do scion of an established Southern family, he falls in love with Rosalie and lives with her, until political ambition makes him take up with an important man's daughter. He marries her, becomes an alcoholic, and dies having fallen off his horse, drunk.\nXarifa, Rosalie's daughter, is an octoroon, living an isolated tragic life that ends in tragedy and death when her grandmother's \"owner\"'s family discovers the papers that claim ownership. Since slavery descends matrilineally, Xarifa legally belongs to them, and they put her on the auction block.\nGeorge was the harp teacher Edward hired to teach Xarifa. He fell in love with Xarifa and planned to run away to France with her, but the plan was betrayed and he was shot during the attempt.\n\n\nThemes\n\n\nLove\nThe detailed description of the landscape in \"The Quadroons\" was seen as a metaphor for Rosalie and Edward's relationship. The passion flower, which is described as being exotic, represents Rosalie's mixed race, and the magnolia represents Edward as being a southern man. Their love, of course, could not legalized as marriage: \"The couple have a genuine love for one another, and because of this love, Rosalie wants to sanctify their marriage to the heavens, even if it cannot be sanctified under law\".\n\n\nDeath: tragic, suicidal, homicidal\nEvery one of the main characters dies: Rosalie soon dies after she sees Edward and his new wife, Charlotte, a year after their marriage. A year before, Rosalie had refused to be Edward's mistress. Child makes it clear to point out that Rosalie felt inadequate with herself, referring to her blackness or her otherness, that was seen as weak and submissive. This is the reason she ultimately succumbed to her death. Edward takes her death very hard and blames himself, turning to drink--which kills him. George Elliot, their daughter's music teacher, is killed in the attempt to escape, and Xarifa commits suicide after being raped by the man who bought her. Child makes sure that readers know how slavery and this society has caused the destruction of the entire family, and that the tragic mulatta, who was already the product of sexual violence, in turn becomes a victim of sexual violence, with death either as an attendant outcome or as an alternative.\n\n\nInfluence\nChild's works tackled economical, social, racial and sexual issues that provoked movements inside and outside the literary world. A work that was influenced by \"The Quadroons\" is Clotel by William Wells Brown. Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, although an autobiography and not a work of fiction, has been interpreted as \"a retelling\" of \"The Quadroons\".\n\n\nPublication history\nThe story was first published in 1842 in the Liberty Bell, an annual abolitionist gift book published from 1839 to 1858. It was republished in 1846 in a collection called Fact and Fiction: A Collection of Stories.\n\n\nReception\n\"The Quadroons\" is a work that is seldom discussed without being pulled into Child's other short works at the time. Most critics at the time of its publishing did not receive her works very well; many would say that Child would add details to her stories to exaggerate issues. In a letter sent to Maria Weston Chapman, Lydia Maria Child said she wanted to get the attention of those that are younger and interested in romantic stories rather than those critiquing her work. This has led to people arguing whether \"The Quadroons\" would be considered a success or failure. Child could continue to influence other writers with her perspective on slavery, feminism, and even transcendentalism.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\"Tragic mulatto\" narratives\n\"Désirée’s Baby\" by Kate Chopin\nImitation of Life by Fannie Hurst\nIola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted by Frances Harper\nPassing by Nella Larson\nThe Quadroon by Thomas Mayne Reid\n\"The Sheriff's Children\" by Charles W.

    "summary": "\"The Quadroons\" is a short story written by American writer Lydia Maria Child (1802-1880) and published in The Liberty Bell in 1842. The influential short story depicts the life and death of a mixed-race woman and her daughter in early nineteenth century America, a slave-owning society. \nChild originated the trope of the \"tragic mulatta\", which became well-known in the anti-slavery literature of the time, was taken up also by many other writers. Years later, Harriet Jacobs's autobiography Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (edited by Lydia Maria Child) featured the same theme, but with important changes, effectively giving her an agency Child's main characters never had.",

    "text": "The 1997 Ardabil earthquake occurred on 28 February with a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The strike-slip earthquake occurred in northern Iran, near the city of Ardabil.\n\n\nBackground and tectonics\nArdabil and the surrounding province which bears its name are agricultural lands, primarily populated by Azeris. Two other earthquakes damaged northern Iran the month before, killing at least 79 people.\n\n\nDamage and casualties\nThe earthquake occurred at 12:57 UTC (4:27 p.m. Iran Standard Time) and lasted for 15 seconds. At least 1,100 people were killed, 2,600 injured, 36,000 homeless, 12,000 houses damaged or destroyed and 160,000 livestock killed in the Ardabil area of northwestern Iran. Severe damage was observed to roads, electrical power lines, communications and water distribution systems around Ardabil. Hospitals and other medical buildings were overflowing with patients as a result of the earthquake. More than 83 villages experienced some form of damage.\nWithin the village of Villadareh, 85 corpses were recovered from the rubble. In Varania, another small village near the epicenter that had previously had a population of 85, all but 20 residents had perished.\n\n\nAftershocks\nRoughly 350 aftershocks followed the main Ardabil earthquake. The largest one had a magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale. Aid workers and rescuers approximate death toll as high as 3,000.\n\n\nAftermath and relief efforts\nIn the aftermath of the tremor, 18 inches (46 cm) of snow fell, hampering rescue efforts. The Iranian government declared three days of mourning to honor victims. Iranian president visited the damaged area on 4 March. Rescue workers at the scene disputed the official government death toll, claiming it was as much as three times higher.\nNonetheless, head of the Iranian Branch of Red Crescent Seifollah Vahid Dastjerdi was satisfied with the pace of relief work. More than 8,700 tents, 21,800 blankets, 15,300 heaters and lanterns, 2,000 bottles of baby formula and 80 tons of bread were given to the victims. Additionally, 60 ambulances, 127 trucks and vans and two helicopters transported victims, relief workers, and supplies to and from the affected region.\n\n\nAir crash\nOn 3 March, a small aircraft on a relief mission crashed about 16 miles (25 km) northeast of Ardabil. Its wreckage was discovered the following day. There were four people on board the Falcon aircraft but no survivors. The crash was blamed on poor weather and heavy snowfall.\n\n\nSee also\n1997 Bojnurd earthquake – An earlier earthquake affecting Iran that same month\nList of earthquakes in 1997\nList of earthquakes in Iran\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nZare, M.

    "text": "The Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) is a network in the U.S. of community-based units initiated and established by local organizations aimed at meeting the public health needs of their communities. It is sponsored by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The MRC consists of medical and non-medical volunteers who contribute to local health initiatives, such as activities meeting the Surgeon General's [1] priorities for public health, and supplement existing response capabilities in times of emergency. The MRC provides the structure necessary to pre-identify, credential, train, and activate medical and public health volunteers.\nThe Medical Reserve Corps Program (MRC PO) is the national \"clearinghouse for information and guidance to help communities establish, implement, and sustain MRC units nationwide.\"\nAs of January 2020, there are 839 local MRC units and 175,283 volunteers. MRC units are present in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., Guam, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n\nHistory\nFollowing the September 11th attacks in 2001, President George W. Bush called for the establishment of the USA Freedom Corps, a \"Coordinating Council... working to strengthen our culture of service and help find opportunities for every American to start volunteering\". The Freedom Corps was to have three components: responding to crisis, rebuilding communities, and sharing compassion with the world. The Medical Reserve Corps was created as an extension of the Freedom Corps. As of 2017, there are 957 active MRC units.\n\n\nAffiliations\nThe MRC is a partner program of Citizen Corps, a national network of volunteers dedicated to ensuring hometown security. Citizen Corps, along with the Corporation for National and Community Service and the Peace Corps, are part of the President's USA Freedom Corps.\nThe MRC PO also has a cooperative agreement with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO). This agreement enables NACCHO to assist the ASPR's Medical Reserve Corps Program Office in enhancing MRC units' ability to meet local, state, and national needs through collaboration, coordination, and capacity-building activities.  These activities include:\n\nCoordinating the distribution of grant funding\nDeveloping a national marketing strategy\nPublishing a quarterly national newsletter\nAssisting in the planning of regional and national meetings\nDeveloping materials, resources, and tools to strengthen the knowledge and skills of MRC members\nIn addition, NACCHO's relationship with almost 3,000 local health departments further serves as an avenue to promote the MRC program at the local level.\n\n\nLocal and national organization\nLocally, each MRC unit is led by an MRC Unit Director and/or Coordinator, who matches community needs with volunteer capabilities. Local MRC leaders are also responsible for building partnerships, ensuring the sustainability of the local unit, and managing resources. Partnerships typically include local public health and emergency response agencies, community businesses, and neighboring MRC's.  Local MRC units are typically housed under Health Departments or other local governmental organizations.\nNationally, the MRC is guided by the Medical Reserve Corps Program Office, housed in the HHS ASPR Office of Emergency Management. The MRC Program Office serves as a clearinghouse for information and best practices to help communities establish, implement, and maintain MRC units nationwide. It is authorized by the Public Health Service Act, Sec. 2813 42 U.S.C. 300hh-15, and its budget has been $6 million per year, reduced to $3.9 million in FY 2020\nand FY 2021.\nIt sponsors an annual leadership conference, hosts a Web site, and coordinates with local, state, regional, and national organizations and agencies to help communities' preparedness. There are also Regional Coordinators (RCs) in all ten of the Department of Health and Human Services regions.\nMany states have appointed State MRC Coordinators to help plan, organize and integrate MRC activities within the State. The MRC Program Office staff and the RCs collaborate with the State Coordinators to better integrate with local and state planning and response activities. All local MRC units are encouraged to collaborate with State Coordinators.\n\n\nSkills and training\nMembers include doctors, nurses, mental health counselors, health educators, and other medically trained people, as well as people without medical training, including administrators, chaplains, drivers, interpreters, logistics specialists, radio operators, trainers, etc. Members receive free training in emergency response and decide how many hours they are willing to volunteer each year.\nLocal chapters can verify credentials to be ready for emergencies,\nor use the Emergency System for Advanced Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals. \nLiability insurance varies by state.\n\n\nLocal activities\nMembers do activities and training on their own time, which may be outside working hours, \nor time off work arranged with their employer. Activities include, but are not limited to:\n\nSupporting local public health while also advancing the priorities of the U.S. Surgeon General; which are to promote disease prevention, improve health literacy, eliminate health disparities, and enhance public health preparedness\nEmergency Sheltering\nDisaster Medical Support and Mass-Casualty Incidents\nAssisting local hospitals, clinics, and health departments with surge personnel needs\nParticipating in mass prophylaxis and vaccination exercises and community disaster drills\nTraining with local emergency response partners\nProviding first aid services for fundraising and other events\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nNational Medical Reserve Corps Web Site",

    "text": "The Republican Villagers Nation Party (Turkish: Cumhuriyetçi Köylü Millet Partisi, CKMP), alternatively translated Republican Peasants' Nation Party, was a political party in Turkey.\n\n\nFusions\nThe party was founded after the fusion of two smaller nationalist parties.\nOne of these parties was the Villagers Party, founded by Remzi Oğuz Arık on16 May 1952. Most of the members of this party were former Democrat Party members and they were known as Nationalists. After the death of the founder in a plane crash in 1954, the party could not gain any seats in the parliament in the 1954 and 1957 elections.\nAnother party was Osman Bölükbaşı's Republican Nation Party, which was founded on 27 January 1954. But unlike Turkey Villagers Party, the Republican Nation Party was actually the continuation of Bölükbaşı's former party named Nation Party which was banned in 1953. Both in 1954 and in 1957 elections they were able to gain seats in the Parliament. On October 17, 1958, the Villagers Party merged with the Republican Nation Party to form the Republican Villagers' Nation Party. The chairman of the party was Osman Bölükbaşı.\n\n\n1960s\nOn June 12, 1960, following the May 27 coup d’état, the junta, dubbed the \"National Unity Committee\", dissolved the parliament and on June 13, closed the district organizations of all political parties. In 1961, when the civil parliamentary system was once again in effect, on October 15, the general elections were held, at which the Republican Villagers’ Nation Party received 14% of the votes to emerge as the third party and win 54 seats in the parliament and 16 senators. However, Osman Bölükbaşı refused to take place in the coalition government.\nThe CKMP members of parliament along with the members from the four remaining parties and the independent members signed a declaration on October 11, 1962, stating that they are \"determined and decisive to confront any transgressions of the foundation built by the national revolution of May 27.\" Subsequently, the parliament decided a partial pardon for political prisoners. On June 15, 1962, the CKMP became part of the coalition led by İsmet İnönü.\n\n\nSplit in the party\nIn 1962, the party faced with the problem of coalition partnership. Up to 1962, CKMP had always been an opposition party. Also in 1962, the CKMP was offered to take part in İsmet İnönü's coalition government for the first time. (see the 27th government of Turkey.) Although this offer was attractive for most of the party members, Osman Bölükbaşı was against serving under İsmet İnönü. Thus, a group of MPs under the leadership of Osman Bölükbaşı issued from the party. The new chairman of the party was Ahmet Oğuz. The party participated in the coalition government and one member, Hasan Dincer, became the deputy prime minister. But without the rhetoric of Osman Bölükbaşı the party began to lose support. Between the general elections in 1961 and 1965 the support dropped from 14% to 2.2%. Meanwhile, in 1965 Bölükbaşı refounded the Nation Party, which received 6.3% in the elections of that year.\n\n\nConversion into MHP\nIn 1965, a meeting took place with opposition leaders, including the president of CKMP, Ahmet Oğuz and of the revived Nation Party (see below), Osman Bölükbaşı, which caused the government to resign. The new government led by independent senator Suat Hayri Ürgüplü had four ministers from the CKMP. In spring 1965, Alparslan Türkeş, along with \"the 14s\" who were expelled from the National Unity Committee, joined the CKMP. In August 1965 Türkeş became the new president at the expense of Ahmet Oğuz and many other senior politicians of the party. This enabled Alparslan Türkeş to a major influence over the party and during the party congress in 1967, the party's program was redesigned in line with the Nine Lights Doctrine. The CKMP gained a more nationalistic and Pan-Turkist ideology, and was hierarchically restructured after the old leadership was eliminated from the administration. Türkeş reportedly stated that: \"Whoever joins the cause and becomes a traitor, kill him.\"\nGeneral elections were held on October 10, 1965, at which CKMP won 11 seats at the parliament and four at the senate. However, the 2.2%  of votes meant that it was losing ground. On February 6–9, 1969, at the extraordinary party congress, the name of the Republican Villager's Nation Party was changed to Nationalist Movement Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi – MHP) and it opened itself for the Islamist electorate. Several of the nationalist party members who opposed the new party program which included an Islamic notion, where subsequently expelled. The MHP to this day is one of Turkey's major political parties and its most prominent far-right nationalist party.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nParti code (in Turkish)",

It was recognised as a country park in 1980, and it is the only country park in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, Scotland's first national park.  Balloch Country Park features nature trails, guided walks, a walled garden, and picnic lawns with views of the Loch.  It was originally developed in the early 19th century by John Buchanan, a partner in the Glasgow and Ship Bank, and the gardens were significantly improved by the Dennistoun-Browns, who bought the estate in 1851.  Buchanan also built Balloch Castle, which now serves as the park's visitors' center.\n\n\nBalloch Castle\n\nBalloch Castle was built in the Scottish baronial style as a residence in 1808 by the architect Robert Lugar at the order of John Buchanan of Ardoch.\nThe new castle used stone from an earlier castle built near the current site by the Earl of Lennox in 1238 and occupied by the Lennox family until approximately 1390. Situated nearer the water than the present day castle, the only remnant of the original structure is a mound that once formed the moat.  This site is given statutory protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.\nThe current castle used to serve visitors centre and the headquarters of the Countryside Ranger Service in the park, but now lies derelict. The castle grounds offers a car park and walled garden with trees and shrubs, including the rhododendrons and azaleas that reach full bloom in late May and early June.\n\n\nEvents\nBalloch Park is host to the annual Loch Lomond Highland games each summer. Events such as caber tossing and typical Scottish cuisine attract many visitors.\nIn June 1991 Scottish folk-rock band Runrig played to an audience of 50,000. Oasis played a gig to 80,000 people over two nights in the summer of 1996, as did R.E.M. in 2005.\nBBC Radio 1 roadshow used the park as a location for annual live shows in the 90's with Travis, Skunk Anansie, Billie Piper and Jason Donovan playing.\nIn August 2007 the first Live at Loch Lomond music festival took place in the grounds of the park. The second Live At Loch Lomond was also a success generating respect from the crowd.\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Loss function",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=442137",
    "text": "In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function) is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.\nIn statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nRegret\n\nLeonard J. Savage argued that using non-Bayesian methods such as minimax, the loss function should be based on the idea of regret, i.e., the loss associated with a decision should be the difference between the consequences of the best decision that could have been made under circumstances will be known and the decision that was in fact taken before they were known.\n\n\nQuadratic loss function\nThe use of a quadratic loss function is common, for example when using least squares techniques. It is often more mathematically tractable than other loss functions because of the properties of variances, as well as being symmetric: an error above the target causes the same loss as the same magnitude of error below the target.  If the target is t, then a quadratic loss function is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        C\n        (\n        t\n        −\n        x\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda (x)=C(t-x)^{2}\\;}\n  \n\nfor some constant C; the value of the constant makes no difference to a decision, and can be ignored by setting it equal to 1. This is also known as the squared error loss (SEL).\nMany common statistics, including t-tests, regression models, design of experiments, and much else, use least squares methods applied using linear regression theory, which is based on the quadratic loss function.\nThe quadratic loss function is also used in linear-quadratic optimal control problems. In these problems, even in the absence of uncertainty, it may not be possible to achieve the desired values of all target variables. Often loss is expressed as a quadratic form in the deviations of the variables of interest from their desired values; this approach is tractable because it results in linear first-order conditions. In the context of stochastic control, the expected value of the quadratic form is used. The quadratic loss assigns more importance to outliers than to the true data due to its square nature, so alternatives like the Huber, log-cosh and SMAE losses are used when the data has many large outliers.\n\n\n0-1 loss function\nIn statistics and decision theory, a frequently used loss function is the 0-1 loss function\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              y\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  0\n                \n                \n                  \n                    if \n                  \n                  y\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        y\n                        ^\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  1\n                \n                \n                  \n                    if \n                  \n                  y\n                  ≠\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        y\n                        ^\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L({\\hat {y}},y)={\\begin{cases}0&{\\text{if }}y={\\hat {y}}\\\\1&{\\text{if }}y\\neq {\\hat {y}}\\end{cases}}}\n  \n\nIn information theory, this loss function is known as Hamming distortion.\n\n\nConstructing loss and objective functions\n\nIn many applications, objective functions, including loss functions as a particular case, are determined by the problem formulation.  In other situations, the decision maker’s preference must be elicited and represented by a scalar-valued function (called also  utility function) in a form  suitable for optimization — the problem that Ragnar Frisch has highlighted in his Nobel Prize lecture.\nThe existing methods for constructing objective functions are collected in the proceedings of two dedicated conferences.\nIn particular, Andranik Tangian showed that the most usable objective functions — quadratic and additive — are determined by a few indifference points. He used this property in the models for constructing these objective functions from either ordinal or cardinal data that were elicited through computer-assisted interviews with decision makers. \nAmong other things, he constructed  objective functions to optimally distribute budgets for 16 Westfalian universities\nand the European subsidies for equalizing unemployment rates among 271 German regions.\n\n\nExpected loss\n\nIn some contexts, the value of the loss function itself is a random quantity because it depends on the outcome of a random variable X. \n\n\nStatistics\nBoth frequentist and Bayesian statistical theory involve making a decision based on the expected value of the loss function; however, this quantity is defined differently under the two paradigms.\n\n\nFrequentist expected loss\nWe first define the expected loss in the frequentist context. It is obtained by taking the expected value with respect to the probability distribution, Pθ, of the observed data, X.

One then should choose the action a* which minimises this expected loss, which is referred to as Bayes Risk.  \nIn the latter equation, the integrand inside dx is known as the Posterior Risk, and minimising it with respect to decision a also minimizes the overall Bayes Risk. This optimal decision, a* is known as the Bayes (decision) Rule - it minimises the average loss over all possible states of nature θ, over all possible (probability-weighted) data outcomes. One advantage of the Bayesian approach is to that one need only choose the optimal action under the actual observed data to obtain a uniformly optimal one, whereas choosing the actual frequentist optimal decision rule as a function of all possible observations, is a much more difficult problem.  Of equal importance though, the Bayes Rule reflects consideration of loss outcomes under different states of nature, θ.\n\n\nExamples in statistics\nFor a scalar parameter θ, a decision function whose output \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              θ\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\theta }}}\n  \n is an estimate of θ, and a quadratic loss function (squared error loss) \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        (\n        θ\n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              θ\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        (\n        θ\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              θ\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L(\\theta ,{\\hat {\\theta }})=(\\theta -{\\hat {\\theta }})^{2},}\n  \n the risk function becomes the mean squared error of the estimate, \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        (\n        θ\n        ,\n        \n          \n            \n              θ\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          E\n          \n            θ\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        \n          [\n          \n            (\n            θ\n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  θ\n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              )\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          ]\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R(\\theta ,{\\hat {\\theta }})=\\operatorname {E} _{\\theta }\\left[(\\theta -{\\hat {\\theta }})^{2}\\right].}\n  \nAn Estimator found by minimizing the Mean squared error estimates the Posterior distribution's mean.\nIn density estimation, the unknown parameter is probability density itself.

Thus, in the applied use of loss functions, selecting which statistical method to use to model an applied problem depends on knowing the losses that will be experienced from being wrong under the problem's particular circumstances.\nA common example involves estimating \"location\". Under typical statistical assumptions, the mean or average is the statistic for estimating location that minimizes the expected loss experienced under the squared-error loss function, while the median is the estimator that minimizes expected loss experienced under the absolute-difference loss function. Still different estimators would be optimal under other, less common circumstances.\nIn economics, when an agent is risk neutral, the objective function is simply expressed as the expected value of a monetary quantity, such as profit, income, or end-of-period wealth. For risk-averse or risk-loving agents, loss is measured as the negative of a utility function, and the objective function to be optimized is the expected value of utility.\nOther measures of cost are possible, for example mortality or morbidity in the field of public health or safety engineering.\nFor most optimization algorithms, it is desirable to have a loss function that is globally continuous and differentiable.\nTwo very commonly used loss functions are the squared loss, \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L(a)=a^{2}}\n  \n, and the absolute loss, \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        a\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L(a)=|a|}\n  \n.  However the absolute loss has the disadvantage that it is not differentiable at \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a=0}\n  \n.  The squared loss has the disadvantage that it has the tendency to be dominated by outliers—when summing over a set of \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n's (as in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        L\n        (\n        \n          a\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\sum _{i=1}^{n}L(a_{i})}\n  \n), the final sum tends to be the result of a few particularly large a-values, rather than an expression of the average a-value.\nThe choice of a loss function is not arbitrary. It is very restrictive and sometimes the loss function may be characterized by its desirable properties. Among  the choice principles are, for example, the requirement of completeness of the class of symmetric statistics in the case of i.i.d. observations, the principle of complete information, and some others.\nW. Edwards Deming and Nassim Nicholas Taleb argue that empirical reality, not nice mathematical properties, should be the sole basis for selecting loss functions, and real losses often are not mathematically nice and are not differentiable, continuous, symmetric, etc. For example, a person who arrives before a plane gate closure can still make the plane, but a person who arrives after cannot, a discontinuity and asymmetry which makes arriving slightly late much more costly than arriving slightly early. In drug dosing, the cost of too little drug may be lack of efficacy, while the cost of too much may be tolerable toxicity, another example of asymmetry. Traffic, pipes, beams, ecologies, climates, etc. may tolerate increased load or stress with little noticeable change up to a point, then become backed up or break catastrophically. These situations, Deming and Taleb argue, are common in real-life problems, perhaps more common than classical smooth, continuous, symmetric, differentials cases.\n\n\nSee also\nBayesian regret\nLoss functions for classification\nDiscounted maximum loss\nHinge loss\nScoring rule\nStatistical risk\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAretz, Kevin; Bartram, Söhnke M.; Pope, Peter F.

    "summary": "In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function) is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.\nIn statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.",

She was also president of the Araucanian Women's Society Yafluayin and secretary of the Araucanian Federation.\n\n\nEarly life\nShe was born in Collimalliñ, Chile, in 1910, the daughter of Manuel Aburto Panguilef, founder and president of the Araucanian Federation between 1922 and 1940, and Abelina Colihueque Lemunao, both members of the Mapuche people.\nUnlike many Mapuche women and those from lower classes, Herminia was able to access education, learning to read and write. This allowed her to become an editor for the Araucanian Federation's documentary production, excelling in her role as she was responsible for drafting documentation related to the Mapuche's claims to their usurped lands.\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1935, Herminia Aburto Colihueque ran as an independent candidate for councillor of Temuco in that year's municipal elections, which were the first in which women exercised their right to vote in the country. However, Herminia was not elected, but became the first Mapuche woman to run for public office in Chile. From that year onwards, there was growing political participation by the Mapuche people.\nIn 1938, she became president of the Araucanian Women's Society Yafluayin, one of the first Mapuche women's associations, which was created in 1937. In April 1939, this organisation participated in the Araucanian National Congress. That same year, she was part of the Mapuche delegation—along with Chepo Antimán, Colilla Marilla, and Marihuán Rapimán—that met with the Pro-Emancipation Movement of Women of Chile (MEMCH). From the 1940s onwards, Herminia settled in the city of Valparaíso and later in Santiago de Chile.\nShe died in 1992 in Gorbea, Chile.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Marvel Adventures, formerly Marvel Age, was an imprint of Marvel Comics intended for younger audiences, including small children. Unlike the standard comics published by Marvel, which often take place in story arcs spanning several issues, each Marvel Adventures comic tells a standalone story. In April 2012 it was replaced by the all new All Ages line tied to the Marvel Universe block on Disney XD.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nAge\nThe idea was initially established as the Marvel Age imprint in 2003. The Marvel Age name had last been used as the title of a promotional magazine published by Marvel from 1983 to 1994. The initial idea for the imprint was to reuse the early plots, written by Stan Lee in the 1960s, in a modern-day setting, with new writers and artists retelling the stories. The stories would be published in the standard comic book format and quickly collected and reprinted in manga-style digest size. Several titles from Marvel's failed Tsunami line, as well as several other Marvel series, were also collected in this format and released under the Marvel Age banner. Each book also contained character concept sketches by the artists on the last pages.\n\n\nAdventures\nIn 2005 Darwyn Cooke was brought on to develop a new all-ages book based on Marvel's heroes. The stories would be independent from the Marvel 616 Universe and feature an array of Marvel's most popular characters. Cooke was eventually left behind by Marvel and the book carried on without him where a new batch of creators were brought on to tell stories Cooke never intended to tell. The Marvel Age imprint was relaunched as Marvel Adventures, with Marvel Age: Spider-Man and Marvel Age: Fantastic Four being restarted as Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man and Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four. This time around, the stories would be original and not based on existing stories. In order to be able to tell standalone stories and to escape the trappings of having to reflect the events of other Marvel titles, none of the titles take place within the primary Marvel Universe continuity.\nThe titles published consist of Marvel Adventures: The Avengers, Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man and Marvel Adventures: Super Heroes. Two other titles, Marvel Adventures: Iron Man and Marvel Adventures: Hulk, were both canceled after brief runs. Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four ended its run, after 48 issues, in May, 2009. It was followed two months later by a Fantastic Four Giant-Size Adventures one-shot.\nIn 2010, the line was ended and then rebooted with only two titles, Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man and Marvel Adventures: Super Heroes returning. Both titles started over with a new first issue. Both titles ended in March 2012, and were replaced by new titles tied to the \"Marvel Universe\" cartoon block on Disney XD, and are titled Ultimate Spider-Man Adventures and The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Adventures, respectively.\n\n\nDigests\nMarvel Digests were collections of Marvel Age/Adventures comic books compressed into smaller digest-sized books, rather than the original larger magazine form.

The school, a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin, opened in August 2009. It is administered by the diocese.\n\n\nHistory\nAfter the closure of Austin's only diocesan Catholic high school in 1972, a private Catholic high school, Saint Michael's Catholic Academy, was built in 1984. In 2002 a second Catholic High School, San Juan Diego Catholic High School, was established by the diocese to serve low income students in Austin. With both located in southern Austin, and no Catholic high school to serve the fast-growing northern part of the metropolitan area, pressure had grown to start a new high school.  Groundbreaking was April 20, 2008  with construction to occur in three phases.  The first phase has capacity for 350 students, but when fully built out St. Dominic Savio High School will be one of the largest private schools in the area.  The high school is named after Saint Dominic Savio, the youngest non-martyr ever canonized.\n\n\nBackground\nSt. Dominic Savio Catholic High School, which is named for the Catholic saint, opened to incoming 9th and 10th graders on August 31, 2009.  The 45-acre (180,000 m2) campus is located in north Austin and is the first Catholic high school, and one of the few private high schools, in rapidly growing Williamson County.\n\n\nCurriculum\nSt. Dominic Savio Catholic High School is a college preparatory diocesan high school. Over 40 PreAP, AP, and dual-enrollment courses are offered.\n\n\nAthletics\nSt. Dominic Savio competes in the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, fielding varsity teams in the following sports:\n\nBaseball\nBasketball\nCheerleading\nCross Country\nFootball\nGolf\nSoccer\nSoftball\nSwimming\nTennis\nTrack\nVolleyball\n\n\nAcademics and fine arts\nSaint Dominic Savio has an active fine arts program which includes annual performances of plays and musicals.  It also competes in the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools in Music and Art. In 2011, 2012, and 2013 Dominic Savio won the TAPPS 3A State Music championship.

    "text": "Maldon District is a local government district in Essex, England. The district is managed by Maldon District Council, which is based in Maldon, the largest town in the district. The district also includes the town of Burnham-on-Crouch and numerous villages, including Heybridge, Wickham Bishops, Southminster, Tolleshunt D'Arcy and Tollesbury. The district covers the Dengie peninsula to the south of Maldon and the Thurstable Hundred area to the north of the Blackwater Estuary, a total area of 358.78 km2.\nThe majority of people live in the small rural villages, many of which have their origins in connections with the coast or agricultural economy. The district has a long association with sailing, as is referenced in the council's logo.\n\n\nAdministrative history\nThe district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:\n\nBurnham-on-Crouch Urban District\nMaldon Municipal Borough\nMaldon Rural District\nThe new district was named Maldon after its largest town.\nWitham Urban District was originally planned to be in Maldon district, it was later decided to place it in Braintree district.\n\n\nGovernance\n\nMaldon district is a non-metropolitan district, with Maldon District Council forming the middle layer of a three-tier structure of local government. Above the district level, Essex County Council provides county-level services. At the lower level the district is divided into civil parishes.\n\n\nPolitical control\nThe council has been under no overall control since 2020. The council remained under no overall control following the 2023 election.\nThe first election to Maldon District Council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:\n\n\nLeadership\nThe leaders of the council since 2008 have been:\n\nFormer leader of Maldon district council John Smith, who led the council between 1991 and 1993, was killed along with two family members while he commanded a light aircraft flight from Oban bound for Andrewsfield, Essex on 9 April 2007.\n\n\nComposition\nFollowing the 2023 election, and by-elections and changes of allegiance up to May 2025, the composition of the council was:\n\nOf the independent councillors, four form the \"District Support Group\" and the other four do not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.\n\n\nPremises\nThe council is based at the Council Offices on Princes Road in Maldon. The original building was previously an orphanage called \"The Retreat\", which had been purchased in 1939 by the Maldon Rural District Council for £4,500. Large extensions were added in the 1980s to the north and south of the original building.\n\n\nElections\n\nSince the last boundary changes in 2003, the council has comprised 31 councillors elected from 17 wards. Elections are held every four years.\nThe area is part of the parliamentary constituency of Maldon.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first evidence of a settlement to the north of Maldon at Elms Farm is from the Middle Bronze Age 3500 years ago. From 500 BC onwards the red hills of the Crouch and Blackwater show us that there was a continuous and extensive activity in the salt making which still prospers today.\nLater, during the Iron Age, about 100 BC, there was a port, set among the marshlands at the junction of the Blackwater and Chelmer rivers. This settlement may have been of regional religious significance, and there is evidence that it traded luxury goods with Europe.\nElms Farm continued as a port and market place but was clearly superseded in importance by Colchester in the 1st century AD, when Colchester became the first capital of the Roman administration.\nThe Romans founded Othona in the 3rd century. It was a Saxon Shore fort at the mouth of the Blackwater, built to protect the estuary from Saxon pirates. It was here in 654 AD that St Cedd founded the church of St Peter-on-the-Wall, the oldest church in England to retain much of its original fabric.\nIn 664 AD St Cedd attended the Synod of Whitby which merged the Anglo-Celtic Church with the Church of Rome. Recent changes in the coastline have revealed the remains of extensive Saxon 5-7th century fish traps. The Church stands today overlooking the North Sea from whence came further invaders in the 10th century - the Danes.\nIn 912 AD and 914 AD King Edward the Elder camped at Maldon to organise defences in the desperate fight against the Danes. In 917 AD the Saxons were defeated at Colchester and besieged at Maldon, but eventually, the Danes were defeated.\nIn 991 AD there was a major battle between the pillaging Danes led by Olaf Trygvassen who had already attacked Ipswich, and Earl Byrhtnoth’s men who were defending Maldon on the instruction of the Saxon King Æthelred the Unready. Earl Byrhtnoth was in his sixties. The battle was recorded in a poem which is regarded as one of the finest examples of early English literature.\nThe famous Battle of Maldon took place beside the River Blackwater on 10 August 991, during the reign of Æthelred the Unready. The Anglo-Saxons, led by Byrhtnoth and his thegns, fought against a Viking invasion, a battle which ended in defeat for the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n\nGeology, landscape and ecology\n\nThe district is in the east of Essex (51°41′N 0°45′E).  Most of the district is the Dengie peninsula. Still, a significant area is also the area above the Blackwater Estuary, bounded by the River Blackwater to the west until near Kelvedon, the boundary then continues south of Tiptree to the Salcott inlet on the Blackwater Estuary.  There are very few settlements on the boundary of the district with the North Sea, in contrast with other coastal districts of Essex, due to the Dengie Marshes.\nThe district has a rural character ranging from the tidal salt marshes to farmland and rolling wooded ridges.  A network of country lanes provides access to the countryside from the towns and villages.  A remote area of tidal mud-flats and saltmarshes at the eastern end of the Dengie peninsula forms the Dengie Special Protection Area.  The River Blackwater and River Crouch are of international importance for nature conservation particularly for their extensive population of wildfowl and waders.\n\n\nParishes\n\nThe district is divided into 34 civil parishes. In Burnham-on-Crouch and Maldon, the parish councils operate under the name \"Town Council\". In addition, some of the parishes share a grouped parish council, meaning there are just 31 parish councils. The current parishes are:\n\n\nArms\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMaldon District Council\nBurnham-on-Crouch Lifeboat\nBurnham-on-Crouch Weather Station\nLive Weather from Burnham-on-Crouch\nChristian Outreach Centre Heybridge and Maldon - a church meeting in Maldon\nMaldon Town Council",

    "text": "Theloderma palliatum (common name: cloaked moss frog) is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is endemic to Vietnam and so far only known from the Bidoup Núi Bà and Chư Yang Sin National Parks. This species, together with Theloderma nebulosum, was first found by Australian and Vietnamese scientists in Tay Nguyen in 2011.\n\n\nDescription\nAdult males measure about 26 mm (1.0 in) in snout–vent length. An adult female, first described as a distinct species, Theloderma chuyangsinense, measures 28 mm (1.1 in) in snout–vent length. The body is relatively slender. The head is slightly longer than it is wide. The snout is bluntly truncate in dorsal view and truncate in profile. The tympanum is distinct. Both finger and toe discs are well-developed, but the finger discs are larger than the toes discs . The fingers are unwebbed whereas the toes have basal webbing. The dorsum is weakly rugose with sparsely scattered minute, pearly asperities. The ventral surface of thighs and belly are coarsely granular, while the chest and throat are smooth. In specimens from the Bidoup Núi Bà National Park, the dorsum is pale coppery brown with distinct dark warm brown markings, which are more distinct at night. The specimen from Chư Yang Sin National Park had pale-yellow to light straw-brown dorsum, with dark-brown blotches and spots of various sizes and shapes.\n\n\nNomenclature\nScientists named this frog palliatus for the Latin word for \"cloaked\" or \"in disguise,\" a reference to the frog's cryptic appearance.\n\n\nHabitat\nTheloderma palliatum is known from montane evergreen forests at elevations of 1,500–2,000 m (4,900–6,600 ft) above sea level. Specimens have been recorded sitting on leaves 1–2 metres above ground and on the ground. Some specimens were collected near streams while others were found further away. It is rare in the Bidoup Núi Bà National Park, with only three specimens collected during 20 surveys conducted over a three-year period. However, the apparent rarity of the species could simply be caused by poor detectability associated with its small size and arboreal habits.\n\n\nConservation\nHabitat loss and modification, caused by aquaculture, agriculture (coffee), infrastructure, and harvest of forest products, are occurring inside the Bidoup Núi Bà National Park. As a consequence, this species is believed to be declining.\nScientists speculate that people might harvest this frog for the international pet trade, but it is so difficult to see with the naked eye that this may not be an issue.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "A quarter tone is a pitch halfway between the usual notes of a chromatic scale or an interval about half as wide (orally, or logarithmically) as a semitone, which itself is half a whole tone. Quarter tones divide the octave by 50 cents each, and have 24 different pitches.\n\nQuarter tones have their roots in the music of the Middle East and more specifically in Persian traditional music. However, the first evidenced proposal of the equally-tempered quarter tone scale, or 24 equal temperament, was made by 19th-century music theorists Heinrich Richter in 1823 and Mikhail Mishaqa about 1840. Composers who have written music using this scale include: Pierre Boulez, Julián Carrillo, Mildred Couper, George Enescu, Alberto Ginastera, Gérard Grisey, Alois Hába, Thomas Heberer Ljubica Marić, Charles Ives, Tristan Murail, Krzysztof Penderecki, Giacinto Scelsi, Ammar El Sherei, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Tui St. George Tucker, Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Iannis Xenakis, and Seppe Gebruers (See List of quarter tone pieces.)\n\n\nTypes\n\n\nEqual-tempered tuning systems\n\nThe term quarter tone can refer to a number of different intervals, all very close in size. For example, some 17th- and 18th-century theorists used the term to describe the distance between a sharp and enharmonically distinct flat in mean-tone temperaments (e.g., D♯–E♭). In the quarter-tone scale, also called 24-tone equal temperament (24-TET), the quarter tone is 50 cents, or a frequency ratio of 24√2 or approximately 1.0293, and divides the octave into 24 equal steps (equal temperament). In this scale the quarter tone is the smallest step. A semitone is thus made of two steps, and three steps make a three-quarter tone or neutral second, half of a minor third. The 8-TET scale is composed of three-quarter tones. Four steps make a whole tone.\nQuarter tones and intervals close to them also occur in a number of other equally tempered tuning systems. 22-TET contains an interval of 54.55 cents, slightly wider than a quarter-tone, whereas 53-TET has an interval of 22.642 cents, which doubled makes up for over 90% the spectral range of a quarter tone. 72-TET also has equally tempered quarter-tones, and indeed contains three quarter-tone scales, since 72 is divisible by 24. The smallest interval in 31 equal temperament (the \"diesis\" of 38.71 cents) is half a chromatic semitone, one-third of a diatonic semitone and one-fifth of a whole tone, so it may function as a quarter tone, a fifth-tone or a sixth-tone.\n\n\nJust intonation tuning systems\nIn just intonation the quarter tone can be represented by the septimal quarter tone, 36:35 (48.77 cents), or by the undecimal quarter tone (i.e. the thirty-third harmonic), 33:32 (53.27 cents), approximately half the semitone of 16:15 or 25:24. The ratio of 36:35 is only 1.23 cents narrower than a 24-TET quarter tone. This just ratio is also the difference between a minor third (6:5) and septimal minor third (7:6).\nComposer Ben Johnston, to accommodate the just septimal quarter tone, uses a small \"7\" () as an accidental to indicate a note is lowered 49 cents, or an upside down \"7\" () to indicate a note is raised 49 cents, or a ratio of 36:35. Johnston uses an upward and downward arrow to indicate a note is raised or lowered by a ratio of 33:32, or 53 cents. The Maneri-Sims notation system designed for 72-et uses the accidentals  and  for a quarter tone (36:35 or 48.77 cents) up and down.\n\n\nPlaying quarter tones\n\nAny tunable musical instrument can be used to perform quarter tones, if two players and two identical instruments, with one tuned a quarter tone higher, are used. As this requires neither a special instrument nor special techniques, much quarter toned music is written for pairs of pianos, violins, harps, etc. The retuning of the instrument, and then returning it to its former pitch, is easy for violins, harder for harps, and slow and relatively expensive for pianos.\nThe following deals with the ability of single instruments to produce quarter tones. In Western instruments, this means \"in addition to the usual 12-tone system\". Because many musical instruments manufactured today (2018) are designed for the 12-tone scale, not all are usable for playing quarter tones. Sometimes special playing techniques must be used.\nConventional musical instruments that cannot play quarter tones (except by using special techniques—see below) include:\n\nMost standard or unmodified non-electronic keyboard instruments, such as pianos, organs, and accordions\nFretted string instruments such as guitars, bass guitars, and ukuleles (though on these it is possible to play quarter tones by pitch-bending, with special tunings, or with customized necks)\nPitched percussion instruments, if standard techniques are used, and if the instruments are not tunable\nWestern wind instruments that use keys or valves\nWoodwind instruments, such as clarinets, saxophones, flutes, and oboes (though with many of these, it is still possible using non-standard techniques such as special fingerings or by the player manipulating their embouchure, to play at least some quarter tones, if not a whole scale)\nValved brass instruments (trumpet, tuba) (though, as with woodwinds, embouchure manipulation, as well as harmonic tones that fall closer to quarter-tones than half-tones, make quarter-tone scales possible; the horn technique of adjusting pitch with the right hand in the bell makes this instrument an exception)\nHarmonica (although note bending is a common technique)\nConventional musical instruments that can play quarter tones include\n\nElectronic instruments:\nSynthesizers, using either special keyboard controllers or continuous-pitch controllers such as fingerboard controllers, or when controlled by a sequencer capable of outputting quarter-tone control signals.\nTheremins and other continuously pitched instruments\nFretless string instruments, such as the violin family, fretless guitars, fretless electric basses, ouds, and members of the huqin family of instruments.\nString instruments with movable frets (such as the sitar)\nSpecially fretted string instruments (such as the Turkish bağlama).\nFretted string instruments specially tuned to quarter tones\nPedal steel guitar\ncertain non-valved wind instruments, like Duduk\nWind instruments whose main means of tone-control is a slide, such as trombones, the tromboon invented by P. D. Q. Bach, the slide trumpet and the slide whistle\nSpecially keyed woodwind instruments. A quarter tone clarinet was built by Fritz Schüller (1883–1977) of Markneukirchen, and a quarter tone mechanism for flutes by Eva Kingma.\nValved brass instruments with extra, quarter-tone valves, and natural brass instruments that play through the 11th and 13th partials of the harmonic series\nVoice\nKazoo\nPitched percussion instruments, when tuning permits (e.g., timpani), or using special techniques\nOther instruments can be used to play quarter tones when using audio signal processing effects such as pitch shifting.\nQuarter-tone pianos have been built, which consist essentially of two pianos with two keyboards stacked one above the other in a single case, one tuned a quarter tone higher than the other.\n\n\nMusic of the Middle East\n\nMany Persian dastgah and Arabic maqamat contain intervals of three-quarter tone size; a short list of these follows.\n\nBayati (بیاتی): D E F G A B♭ C D\n\nRast (راست):\nC D E F G A B C (ascending)\nC B A G F E D C (descending)\n\nSaba (صبا): D E F G♭ A B♭ C D♭\n\nSegah (سه گاه): E F G A B C D E\n\n‘Ajam (عجم)\nHoseyni\nThe Islamic philosopher and scientist Al-Farabi described a number of intervals in his work in music, including a number of quarter tones.\nAssyrian/Syriac Church Music Scale:\n\nQadmoyo (Bayati)\nTrayono (Hussayni)\nTlithoyo (Segah)\nRbiʿoyo (Rast)\nHmishoyo\nShtithoyo (ʿAjam)\nShbiʿoyo\nTminoyo\n\n\nQuarter-tone scale\nKnown as gadwal in Arabic, the quarter-tone scale was developed in the Middle East in the eighteenth century and many of the first detailed writings in the nineteenth century Syria describe the scale as being of 24 equal tones.\nThe invention of the scale is attributed to Mishaqa who wrote a book devoted to the topic but made clear that his teacher, Sheikh Muhammad al-Attar (1764–1828), was one among many already familiar with the concept.\n\nThe quarter tone scale may be primarily a theoretical construct in Arabic music. The quarter tone gives musicians a \"conceptual map\" they can use to discuss and compare intervals by number of quarter tones, and this may be one of the reasons it accompanies a renewed interest in theory, with instruction in music theory a mainstream requirement since that period.\nPreviously, pitches of a mode were chosen from a scale consisting of seventeen tones, developed by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi in the thirteenth century.\n\nComposer Charles Ives chose the chord C–D–F–G–B♭ as good possibility for a \"secondary\" chord in the quarter-tone scale, akin to the minor chord of traditional tonality. He considered that it may be built upon any degree of the quarter tone scale Here is the secondary \"minor\" and its \"first inversion\":\n\n\nIn popular Western music\n\nThe bass descent of Nancy Sinatra's version of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" includes quarter tone descents.\nSeveral quarter-tone albums have been recorded by Jute Gyte, a one-man avantgarde black metal band from Missouri, US.\nAnother quartertone metal album was issued by the Swedish band Massive Audio Nerve.\nAustralian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard's albums Flying Microtonal Banana, K.G., and L.W. heavily emphasize quarter-tones and used a custom-built guitar in 24 TET tuning.\nJazz violinist / violist Mat Maneri, in conjunction with his father Joe Maneri, made a crossover fusion album, Pentagon (2005), that featured experiments in hip hop with quarter tone pianos, as well as electric organ and mellotron textures, along with distorted trombone, in a post-Bitches Brew type of mixed jazz / rock.\nLater, Seppe Gebruers started playing and improvising with two pianos tuned a quarter-tone apart. In 2019 he started a research project at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent, titled 'Unexplored possibilities of contemporary improvisation and the influence of microtonality in the creation process'.\nWith two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart Gebruers recorded 'The Room: Time & Space' (2018) in a trio formation with drummer Paul Lovens and bassist Hugo Anthunes. In his solo project 'Playing with standards' (album release January 2023), Gebruers plays with famous songs including jazz standards. With Paul Lytton and Nils Vermeulen he forms a 'Playing with standards' trio.\n\n\nAncient Greek tetrachords\nThe enharmonic genus of the Greek tetrachord consisted of a ditone or an approximate major third, and a semitone, which was divided into two microtones. Aristoxenos, Didymos and others presented the semitone as being divided into two approximate quarter tone intervals of about the same size, while other ancient Greek theorists described the microtones resulting from dividing the semitone of the enharmonic genus as unequal in size (i.e., one smaller than a quarter tone and one larger).\n\n\nInterval size in equal temperament\nHere are the sizes of some common intervals in a 24-note equally tempered scale, with the interval names proposed by Alois Hába (neutral third, etc.) and Ivan Wyschnegradsky (major fourth, etc.):\n\nMoving from 12-TET to 24-TET allows the better approximation of a number of intervals. Intervals matched particularly closely include the neutral second, neutral third, and (11:8) ratio, or the 11th harmonic. The septimal minor third and septimal major third are approximated rather poorly; the (13:10) and (15:13) ratios, involving the 13th harmonic, are matched very closely. Overall, 24-TET can be viewed as matching the 11th and 13th harmonics more closely than the 7th.\n\n\nSee also\nMusical temperament\nList of quarter tone pieces\nList of meantone intervals\nHoldrian Comma\nKoron, Sori\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\"quarter-tone / 24-edo\", TonalSoft.com",
