It highlighted the work of women, aiming to give them improved representation and encourage others to better appreciate them. 18,000 visitors attended over the course of the exhibition.\n\n\nHistory\n\nInspired by a previous Bristol exhibition called the Industrial and Fine Art Exhibition the previous year, Helen Blackburn formed a committee to organise an exhibition to encourage \"opportunities afforded women for scientific study and technical training\" who began contacting local women's societies and employers around the country. These organisations then submitted exhibitions to the committee for approval.\n\n\nExhibition\n\nThe exhibition ran from 26 February to the end of April 1885 and was located at the Queen's Villa in the Clifton suburb of Bristol. Only the work of women was exhibited, though several of the 303 exhibitors were men. The works shown at the exhibition were \"done by women who make a profession in their pursuit, either for art's sake, or for the sake of earning a livelihood\", according to the official catalogue. While the works were often made by working class women, the exhibition prioritised the visibility of the philanthropic women hosting their works.\nExhibitions at the event included oil paintings, pottery, architecture, floral displays, and metalwork. One room highlighted, with portraits, women who had been among the first in, or made important contributions to, their field.\nA reduced price was offered on Saturdays to working class visitors. 18,000 visitors attended the exhibition over the course of its run.\nAttendees complained that there often wasn't sufficient space for visitors, with the Pall Mall Gazette commenting that \"every nook and corner of the moderate sized house in which the Exhibition is held is full\".\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Botrivier is a small town of approximately 10 000 people, situated in the Overberg region of the Western Cape in South Africa.\nVillage in the former Caledon district, 93 km southeast of Cape Town. It takes its name from the Bot River on the west bank of which it is situated. The form Botrivier is preferred for official use.\n\n\nHistory\nLong before Western settlement, this east-facing glen was home to prosperous herders, the Khoi-Khoi, who pastured their livestock in rich pastures along the banks of the “Couga River”. The river flows south towards the marsh Botrivier estuary, and was for centuries the home of contented tribes who savoured the privilege of fresh waters in the water-scarce Cape.\n“Rich in fat”, was the river’s name – a tribute to the area’s reputation for “lots of butter”, which the early settlers came in search of to barter for. It was this creamy “botter” (Afrikaans) which gave the “Bot River” its ultimate name.\nLater, the hamlet was to become an 18th-century outpost for the Dutch East India Company at Compagnes Drift farm in Botrivier, now home to Beaumont Wines, where the owners have cherished and protected its early heritage. At the same time that a company of soldiers was stationed at the drift at Bot River to monitor who crossed the Cape frontier, Compagnes Drift also developed as a loan farm. Loan farms were owned by the Dutch East India Company. Under this scheme, burghers could rent the land, farm it and profit from it, but they could not own it.\nAs Napoleon extended his control over Europe, including Holland, the British sought to pre-empt possible French control of the Cape. In January 1806 British forces defeated the Dutch at the battle of Blouberg. Among the handful of Dutch burghers who rendered loyal service in the battle was Servaas Daniel de Kock. As a reward for his service, the Dutch East India Company gave him ownership of the farm he had worked on loan. De Kock planted wheat, vines, fruit trees, vegetables and turmeric—a spice that was in high demand in the curry-loving kitchens of the Cape of Good Hope.\nA major event in the life of Botrivier was the arrival of the railway line from Cape Town to Caledon in 1902. In much the same way as the American railway teams forged west in the USA, the Cape tracks were forged through the Hottentots-Holland mountain range above Somerset West – a great engineering feat - and this brought the village of Bot River to its feet when the first trains ran in 1912, allowing villagers, farmers and traders to journey to the Mother City of Cape Town faster than ever before. And the traffic grew from the City into the countryside too.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBotrivier Xplorio Community Website for Botrivier\nBotrivier History",

    "text": "Heaven Awot, a seven-year-old girl was brutally raped, mutilated and killed by her mother's landlord Getnet Baye in Bahir Dar, Amhara Region, Ethiopia in August 2023. Getnet was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The murder has heavily sparked public outrage, who demand appropriate punishment for the assailant, and circulated in social media. Getnet appealed to the court and the case adjourned until October 2024.\nSeveral women's and children right organizations voiced condemnation for the murder. Among those, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA) said  the \"murder by itself should have been enough to sentence him to life imprisonment or to death…\". The Minister for Women and Social Affairs Ergoge Tesfaye also condemned the murder by saying \"inhumane\" in her Facebook page.\n\n\nBackground\nHeaven Awot was a seven-year-old girl from Bahir Dar in Amhara Region. Her family was separated during the conflict in Tigray. Heaven's father is an ethnic Tigrayan, who during the war, was imprisoned for several months. After being released from prison, he left Amhara Region to Tigray, as he believed he would raise suspicion in the region during ethnic profiling against Tigrayans. Heaven's mother, Abekyelesh Adeba, was a nurse who raised Heaven and her younger sister in a tenancy with landlord Getnet Baye. Abekyelesh told the BBC that she had never felt any threat to her daughter. She was related to the landlord's wife which made her feel even more at ease. At the time of the murder in August 2023, Abekyelesh was at work and the girl's aunt, a 15 year old guardian, was informed by Heaven that she was going to the bathroom and did not return.\nSuspicious, the aunt attempted to find Heaven but was unsuccessful. Later that day, Heaven’s younger 3 year old sister found Heaven and informed the aunt about Heaven laying outside. The aunt found Heaven's body at the entrance of her home, her body strangled and mutilated, sand along with water and pebbles stuffed in her mouth. Her genitalia was completely torn and damaged so badly that one could easily see her spinal cord through it.\n\n\nAftermath and reactions\nThe case was not publicized until the next year, sparking widespread public outrage in Ethiopia with many arguing the sentencing of the alleged perpetrator was too \"merciful\". More than 200,000 people signed a petition demanding appropriate justice for Getnet's alleged crime. Getnet was apprehended and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Following his sentence, Getnet appealed to the court, which adjourned the case until October 2024. Heaven's mother, Abekyelesh Adeba told the BBC that she felt \"lifeless\" after hearing of her death.\nHeaven's death also created great outrage among women's and children's rights groups. The Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA) released a statement stating the \"murder by itself should have been enough to sentence him to life imprisonment or to death…\". Similarly, the Minister for Women and Social Affairs Ergoge Tesfaye condemned the murder as \"inhumane\" on her Facebook page and said the office would investigate the case with stakeholders.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Communist League (Ligue communiste) was a French Trotskyist party established in 1930, which published the journal La Vérité. It brought together French members of the International Left Opposition before the proclamation of the Fourth International in 1938. Following the far-right riots of February 6, 1934, it joined the SFIO as an organized tendency, forming the \"Bolshevik-Leninist group\" (BL), which was expelled at the SFIO Congress in Mulhouse in June 1935. During this period, the Ligue communiste officially continued to exist but was dormant and its members split. \n\n\nFormation\nCreated in April 1930 as a secret entryist tendency within the PCF, the Ligue communiste organized around the magazine La Vérité, launched in August 1929 under the direction of Alfred Rosmer. Rosmer, under direct instruction from Leon Trotsky, sought to unify two rival factions of French Trotskyism, divided primarily by personal disputes. These factions included Pierre Naville and Gérard Rosenthal on one side, and Raymond Molinier and Pierre Frank on the other.\nThe recently started La Lutte de Classe (Class Struggle) continued its publication and became the theoretical journal of the Communist League.\nThe Ligue communiste initially comprised about fifty militants, with a small leadership circle around Pierre Naville and Raymond Molinier. After disputes, Naville and Rosenthal ousted Molinier and Frank from leadership roles, angering Trotsky, who sought arbitration through an international delegation including Andrés Nin and Amadeo Bordiga in 1931. Rosmer eventually resigned from the Ligue communiste in December 1930.\n\n\nEntryism into the SFIO\nAfter the 6 February 1934 riots, Trotsky advocated for entryism, which led the Ligue communiste to join the SFIO and form the Bolshevik-Leninist group. This strategy, known as the French Turn, mirrored similar efforts worldwide, such as the Workers Party of the United States joining the Socialist Party of America in 1936.\nThe approach faced challenges, and at the SFIO Congress in Mulhouse (June 1935), Trotskyists were sidelined as Léon Blum favored alignment with the French Communist Party.\n\n\nSplits and reorganizations\nIn August 1935, after insurrectionary strikes, Trotsky abandoned entryism, advocating for an independent revolutionary party. During this period, the Ligue communiste officially continued to exist but was dormant and its members split after being expelled from the SFIO. Most members, including Pierre Naville, joined the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (POI) founded in 1936, while others, such as Raymond Molinier and Pierre Frank, joined the Internationalist Communist Party (PCI), with some focusing on direct worker soviet structures.\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nBibliography\nMichel Roger, Envers et contre tout, de l'opposition de gauche à l'union communiste (1924–1939), Ni patrie ni frontières, Paris, 2017.",

The village was deserted after the Second World War, allowing its medieval plan and vernacular buildings in the South Bohemian Folk or Rural Baroque style to remain intact.  It was restored and repopulated from 1990, and it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 because of its exceptional preservation of a traditional Baroque-era village.\n\n\nHistory\nHolašovice is first mentioned in 1263. In 1292, King Wenceslaus II gave the village and several others to the Cistercian monastery of Vyšší Brod. It remained the property of the monastery until 1848.\n\nBetween 1520 and 1525, Holašovice was nearly wiped out by the bubonic plague. Only two of its inhabitants survived. A column erected over the plague grave at the north end of the village commemorates this event. The monastery gradually repopulated the village with settlers from Bavaria and Austria. By 1530, the population had risen to 17, according to the monastery's records, and it had become a mainly German-speaking enclave within the Czech language area. By 1900, there were 163 inhabitants of German ethnic origin and 1 of Czech ethnic origin.\nAfter the displacement of German residents at the end of the Second World War, many farms in the village were deserted and fell into disrepair. Holašovice became a desolate and abandoned place under the Czech post-war Communist regime.\nFrom 1990, the village was lavishly restored and inhabited once more. It now has a population of around 140.\n\n\nBuildings and architecture\nHolašovice is a typical Bohemian village for the Hlubocká Blata area around České Budějovice. It consists of 23 brick farmsteads containing 120 buildings, with a fish pond, a forge, and chapel. The farms were constructed in the South Bohemian Folk Baroque style, in \"U\" shapes with farmyard in the middle and with their stucco gable ends facing a central broad village green. \nThe buildings date from the 18th to 20th century, with most of them built in the second half of the 19th century.

    "text": "The Balwen is a United Kingdom breed of sheep originating in Wales. It originates in the Tywi valley of Wales and forms part of the Welsh Mountain group of breeds.\nIt has a distinctive colour pattern: a black body with white extremities. It is reared primarily for meat.\n\n\nHistory\nThe name of the breed derives from the Welsh words bal, 'blaze', and wen, 'white'.\nThe Balwen originated in one small area of Wales – the Tywi valley. This area was hit badly by the very severe winter of 1946–1947, and the breed was nearly wiped out – only one ram was amongst the survivors.  All modern Balwen sheep are therefore presumably descended from this one ram, although it is possible that some of the ewes may have been in lamb to rams that did not survive the winter.  Outcrossing with other types of Welsh Mountain sheep may also have occurred, and this would have increased the genetic diversity of the breed.  During the 1950s and 1960s a steady increase took place, and in the 1970s people outside the valley began to take an interest in the breed.  The Balwen Welsh Mountain Breed Society was formed in 1985, and numbers are gradually increasing further.\nThe breed is listed by the British Rare Breeds Survival Trust as vulnerable.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe Balwen has a base colour of black, fading to brown in sunlight and greying with age.  It has a white blaze on the face, four white feet (referred to as socks), and white covering the last half or more of the tail – the tail is normally left undocked. Otherwise it is of similar type to other Welsh Mountain Sheep. Males have horns, and females are naturally polled.\n\n\nUse\nThe Balwen is becoming popular among smallholders and farmers alike, mainly due to its attractive markings, hardiness, ease of care and excellent meat.  The ewes make excellent mothers, having very few lambing problems and plenty of milk to feed the lambs. At their first lambing, most ewes have single lambs. But after that, under the right conditions many twin, and some have even reared triplets. The wool is medium-soft, with a staple length of 5–7.5 cm and a fibre diameter of 32.3 μm, and is easy to spin.\n\n\nSee also\nZwartbles, an unrelated breed with a similar colour pattern\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Siege of Valencia (1812)",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=30979549",
    "text": "The siege of Valencia from 3 November 1811 to 9 January 1812, saw Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's French Army of Aragon besiege Captain General Joaquín Blake y Joyes's forces in the city of Valencia, Spain, during the Peninsular War. The 20,000 to 30,000 French troops compelled 16,000 Spanish soldiers to surrender at the conclusion of the siege, although another 7,000 Spaniards escaped from the trap. Suchet quickly converted Valencia into an important base of operations after this Napoleonic Wars action. Valencia, modern-day capital of the Valencian Community, is located on the east coast of Spain.\n\n\nBackground\n\nOn July 8, 1811, Marshal Suchet received his baton, making him the only French general to be appointed Marshal of France for winning victories in Spain. He won this honor specifically for his victory in the siege of Tarragona. The port of Tarragona fell to the French on 29 June 1811 as a British naval squadron stood helplessly offshore. Suchet pressed the siege ruthlessly and lost 4,300 troops during the operation, but Spanish losses were far heavier. The loss of the port involved most of the Army of Catalonia and therefore left Spanish forces in the area gravely weakened.\nEmperor Napoleon I of France ordered his newly minted marshal to capture Valencia. During the summer and fall of 1811, Suchet seized Montserrat, triumphed over Captain General Blake at Benaguasil, and captured the port of Oropesa del Mar. On 15 September, 25,000 French invaded Valencia and once again defeated Blake at the Battle of Saguntum on 26 October, where Suchet sustained a severe wound in his shoulder. Reinforced by two additional divisions, the French relentlessly advanced.\n\n\nSiege\n\nSuchet commanded 20,595 men in five infantry divisions under Generals of Division Louis François Félix Musnier, Jean Isidore Harispe, Pierre-Joseph Habert, Giuseppe Frederico Palombini, and Claude Antoine Compère, plus cavalry and artillerists. Musnier's 1st Division consisted of the 114th and 121st Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each, and the 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments of the Legion of the Vistula, two battalions each. Harispe's 2nd Division included the following infantry regiments, 7th Line, four battalions, 44th Line and 3rd Vistula Legion, two battalions each, and 116th Line, three battalions. Habert's 3rd Division comprised the 16th and 117th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each, and the 15th Line Infantry Regiment, two battalions.\nPalombini's Kingdom of Italy Division had the 2nd Light and 4th and 6th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each, and the 5th Line Infantry Regiment, two battalions. Compère's weak Kingdom of Naples Division consisted of the 1st Light and the 1st and 2nd Line Infantry Regiments, one battalion each. General of Brigade André Joseph Boussart led Suchet's cavalry, including the 13th Cuirassier, 4th Hussar, and Italian Napoleone Dragoon Regiments, four squadrons each, 24th Dragoon Regiment, two squadrons, and Neapolitan Chasseurs à Cheval, one squadron. One authority asserted that Suchet had 30,000 men and added General of Division Honoré Charles Reille's infantry division to the French order of battle. Another source gave Suchet 33,000 soldiers and the divisions of both Reille and General of Division Filippo Severoli.\nBlake disposed of 28,044 soldiers for the defense of Valencia, organized in three groups, the Expeditionary Corps, the 2nd Valencian Army, and the 3rd Murcian Army. The Expeditionary Corps' included the infantry divisions of Generals Miguel Lardizabal y Uribe and José Pascual de Zayas y Chacón plus General Casimiro Loy's cavalry and two horse artillery batteries, a total of 6,041 men. The 2nd Army consisted of the infantry divisions of Generals Miranda, José Obispo, Villacampa, and Velasco, plus General San Juan's cavalry. The 2nd Army mustered 16,468 men, two foot and one horse artillery batteries. Counting 5,535 troops, the 3rd Army had the brigades of Generals Creagh and Montijo plus eight squadrons of cavalry and one horse artillery battery.\n\nBlake deployed his army facing generally north with his right wing on the coast, his right-center in Valencia, his left-center at Mislata, and his left at Manises. The divisions of Obispo and Villacampa, which had performed poorly at the Battle of Sagunto, held the left flank. To their right stood Creagh's brigade. Next in line were the good-quality divisions of Lardizabal and Zayas. Miranda's division occupied Valencia while some irregulars held the gap between the city and the coast. Blake posted his cavalry at Aldaia and Torrent, behind his left flank. Though the line as far as Manises was fortified and protected by canals and ditches, the left flank hung in the air.\n\nSuchet discerned that Blake's left flank was the weak point and determined to envelop it. He planned to take the divisions of Harispe, Musnier, Reille, and Boussart in a wide sweep around the open Spanish flank. Suchet directed Habert to break through along the coast, while Palombini attacked Mislata and Compère observed the Spanish lines. If all went well, Suchet might bag Blake's entire army. On the night of 25 December, Suchet led his main column across the river Túria at Riba-roja de Túria.\nAt first, Habert's attack on his right flank fooled Blake into thinking it was Suchet's main effort. Then Palombini's attack at Mislata diverted his attention. Despite persistent assaults, the Italians failed to break through and suffered heavy losses. Suchet's main column reached Blake's left rear virtually unopposed. As Harispe approached the village of Aldaia, he sighted the Spanish cavalry reserve. With a single squadron of the 4th Hussars, Boussart rashly attacked a vastly superior force. The handful of French horsemen were wiped out, while Boussart was cut down and left for dead, his sword and decorations pilfered. The bulk of the French cavalry under General of Brigade Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort soon came up and routed the Spanish troopers, driving them beyond the Rio Júcar and depriving Blake of much-needed cavalry support.\n\nGeneral Nicolás de Mahy, in overall command of the left flank, realized that his troops were in danger of being encircled. He ordered an immediate retreat and the divisions of Obispo and Villacampa, as well as Creagh's brigade made their escape to the south. Blake ordered Lardizabal and Zayas to retire within Valencia. The veteran units cleanly disengaged but were doomed to be trapped in the city. Suchet rapidly ringed the city with his army.\nWith a population of 100,000, a lack of food, and obsolete defenses, Valencia was in no condition to sustain a siege. On the night of 28 December, Blake tried to break out of the city. The attempt failed except for a spearhead of 500 troops which got away. Suchet wasted little time, digging the first siege parallels on 1 January and taking the outer defenses under fire three days later. As the bombardment intensified, Blake capitulated and handed over Valencia on 9 January.\n\n\nResults\n\nFor the loss of about 2,000 killed and wounded, Suchet succeeded in capturing 16,270 Spanish soldiers, 21 colors, and 374 guns. In addition, 4,011 Spanish troops died in battle or from disease. All of Blake's cavalry, plus the units of Obispo, Villacampa, and Creagh avoided capture, but his best troops became prisoners. Blake performed poorly throughout the siege and the citizens of Valencia despised him for his feeble efforts. The French held the Spanish general in prison near Paris until 1814. Suchet levied an indemnity on the surrendered city of 53 million francs. Boussart received a promotion to General of Division and would die from his many battle injuries in August 1813.\nSuchet continued to advance to the south, capturing the port of Dénia. However, with Napoleon transferring troops from Spain to support his upcoming invasion of Russia, operations soon ground to a halt due to a lack of soldiers. Suchet also fell seriously ill with a fever and was out of action for weeks. This allowed the remnants of Blake's army under Mahy to recover. In the meantime, Napoleon ennobled his victorious marshal with the title Duke of Albufera, after the name of a lagoon south of Valencia.\nFar to the north, General Joaquín Ibáñez Cuevas y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles ambushed a French battalion at a place on the coast southwest of Tarragona called Col de Balaguer. On 18 January, 4,000 Spanish troops, including 250 cavalry and two cannons, captured one battalion of the 121st Line Infantry Regiment. Out of about 850 troops, only the governor of the fortress of Tortosa, General of Brigade Jacques Mathurin Lafosse and 22 dragoons escaped the trap. General of Division Maurice Mathieu exacted revenge on Eroles less than a week later. In heavy fog, Eroles engaged what he thought was an enemy battalion on 24 January, in the Battle of Altafulla. In fact, it was Mathieu's 8,000-strong division of six French and two German battalions. At the cost of a few casualties, the French crushed the outnumbered Spanish force, inflicting a loss of 2,000 killed, wounded, and captured as well as taking both cannons.\nOn 20 January, Severoli laid siege to Peñiscola with his division of 3,000 men and six guns. The port, between Valencia and Tarragona, was known as \"Little Gibraltar\" because it seemed virtually impregnable. The Spanish commander General Garcia Navarro, however, was pro-French and quickly came to terms with Severoli, handing over the castle on 2 February and surrendering his 1,000 troops.\nArthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington's crushing defeat of Marshal Auguste Marmont at the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July 1812 caused King Joseph Bonaparte to abandon Madrid on 11 August. Because Suchet had a secure base at Valencia, Joseph and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan retreated there and were joined by Marshals Suchet and Nicolas Soult. Together, Joseph and the three marshals worked out a plan to recapture Madrid and drive Wellington from central Spain. Their subsequent counteroffensive caused the British general to lift the Siege of Burgos and retreat to Portugal in the autumn of 1812.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe guerilla war proceeded till the end of the Peninsular war.\nThe Spanish conventional warfare proceeded \ntill the end of the Peninsular war.\nNapoleon had ended his invasion of Spain with the occupation of Madrid.\nThe third Portuguese campaign ended with the French retreat out of Portugal.\nThe Allied campaign in Spain started with the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBodart, Gaston (1908).

    "summary": "The siege of Valencia from 3 November 1811 to 9 January 1812, saw Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's French Army of Aragon besiege Captain General Joaquín Blake y Joyes's forces in the city of Valencia, Spain, during the Peninsular War. The 20,000 to 30,000 French troops compelled 16,000 Spanish soldiers to surrender at the conclusion of the siege, although another 7,000 Spaniards escaped from the trap. Suchet quickly converted Valencia into an important base of operations after this Napoleonic Wars action. Valencia, modern-day capital of the Valencian Community, is located on the east coast of Spain.",

Since her marriage to George Engle, the \nvivacious Sandy has practically become a recluse. Kate's suspicion that something is wrong \nleads her to hire what she thinks is a detective to pose as her boyfriend during a weekend \nhouse party at the Engle's estate high in the central California mountains. Instead of a \ndetective, though—because of a manpower shortage at the Gregory Agency—Kate gets a \nstand-in: Marty Bowman, an L.A. lifeguard with vague ambitions of following in his brother's \nprivate-eye footsteps. \nThe guests at the party seem to have little in common until George Engle turns up dead at the\nbottom of his swimming pool with Marty Bowman's lucky silver dollar clenched in his fist.\nThe murder investigation by slow-moving local sheriff Frank Toland finds the thread that \nconnects most of the guests: they were being blackmailed by George. Marty becomes the \nprime suspect in the murder and to save his own neck has to stay one step ahead of Toland. \nAs he subtly conducts an independent investigation under Toland's nose, Marty discovers that \nin addition to blackmailing his house party guests—and many others—George has conned his \nwife into believing she has tuberculosis. \nSlipping past the guard of sheriff Toland's rookie assistant, Marty and Sandy pay an after-hours \nvisit to a clinic in the valley, where Marty, with the help of an X-ray technician, proves to \nSandy that her ill health is an illusion. After bar-hopping with a jubilant Sandy for the rest of \nthe evening, Marty resists her drunken advances (and beds Kate instead). The next morning, however, \nMarty finds that Sandy too has been murdered. Unbeknownst to the sheriff, Sandy had retained possession \nof some of the evidence her husband had used to blackmail their guests, a fact that led George's\nmurderer to kill once more.\nThe murderer, sensing that Marty is closing in on the truth, sets for him the same \nunderwater death trap used on George. Fortunately, Marty's familiarity with swimming pool hydraulics \nenables him to anticipate the trap, foil it, and turn the tables \non the killer. A struggle ensues, followed by the climactic denouement.\n\n\nReferences",

Abdullakhan Madrasah (Bukhara) is located opposite. Currently, it is included in the national list of real estate objects of material and cultural heritage of Uzbekistan\n\n\nHistory\nModarikhan madrasah is one of the madrasahs built in honor of Abdullah Khan II's mother. Modarikhan madrasah was built in 1566–1567. Hafiz Tanish Bukhari, one of the court historians who lived in this period, recorded in his work Abdullanoma (Persian: عبد الله نامه) that the people of Bukhara actively participated in the construction of the madrasah. The main gable of the madrasah is facing west and is decorated with flowers. \nThe main motifs of the Modarikhan madrasah have been preserved on the pediment. The patterns of the madrasah are mainly preserved in white, blue, blue, dark brown, and dark colors. The word \"Allah\" is written in Handasavi Kufic form on the upper pediment of Modarikhan madrasah. Above the gate of the madrasah there is an inscription on the tile in white letters. In this inscription, there were names of the orderer of the construction of the madrasah, Abdullah Khan II, the person who compiled the text of the book, the chief judge of Bukhara, Nuriddin Qazi Muhammad, and the date of completion. \nIn 1998–1999, the Modari Khan madrasah was renovated and replaced with a new book. Verses 1–5 of Surah \"Alaq\" from the Holy Qur'an are written on a blue background with white letters in suls script on the front of the madrasah. Above it, the word \"Mulk-Allah's\" is repeated in Kufic letters in yellow letters. On the right and left sides of the entrance gate of Modarikhan madrasah, the name \"Muhammad\" is pinned in the Kufic form. As a result of the earthquakes, the books of the Modarikhan Madrasah were damaged. The inscription above the madrasah gate is the only surviving epigraphic inscription. Makur Kitaba inscription is written in tile style with white letters on a dark blue background. But this book has also been partially restored on the basis of archival photographs of 1998.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nLiterature\n\nРажабов, Қ.; Иноятов, С. (2016).

Her parents were educated, and Abdel-Halim gained a university education. Abdel-Halim was involved in political causes such as marching for Egyptian independence from colonial Britain, joining the Young Egypt Party, and supporting an independent Palestine. Abdel-Halim's uncle was arrested for criticising President Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies, and physically and psychologically traumatised while in jail.\nAbdel-Halim migrated to Australia in 1970 with her husband and two children. In 1973, Abdel-Halim began wearing a hijab as a sign of solidarity with other Muslim women and because she wanted to make the statement \"I am a Muslim woman. If you want to know about Islam, ask me.\"\n\n\nCareer\nIn Australia, Abdel-Halim and her husband taught English, Arabic, English as a Second Language (ESL) and Muslim scripture. She was one of the founders of the Islamic Egyptian Society, and its first vice-president. Abdel-Halim and her husband organised events and projects to support and empower Muslim women and represent their views to media and government organisations, forming the Muslim Women's National Network Australia where Abdel-Halim was president for many years and is currently listed as an Advisor.\nAbdel-Halim writes on aspects of Islam and the role of women. In 1977, she wrote a chapter in a book discussing the role of women in different religions, Deliver Us from Eve.\nAbdel-Halim was involved in campaigns to save the multicultural TV channel SBS, to change official forms to use the term 'given name' rather than 'Christian name,' and to let women to wear their hijab for their driver's licence photos.\nAbdel-Halim was a member of John Howard's Muslim Community Reference Group, where she led the Muslim Women sub-group, to advise the government on issues pertaining to Muslims. She has been described by The Australian as \"Australia's most prominent female Muslim leader\". She has additionally held the roles of Chairperson of the Women Movement South-East Asia and the Pacific, Vice President of the Regional Islamic Dawah Council of South-East Asia and the Pacific (RISEAP), and board member of the Council for Australian-Arab Relations.\nAbdel-Halim wrote Did You Know: Refuting Interpretations Concerning The Position of Women in Islam, and Muslim's interaction with non-Muslims, published in 2008 by the Muslim Women's National Network Australia, and funded by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship as part of the \"National Action Plan to Build on Social Cohesion, Harmony and Security\". The book aims to address the \"misinterpretation and misapplication of Islam as it affects the role, position and rights of Muslim Australian women.\" It has been distributed across Australia through schools, universities, public libraries, migrant resource centres, government departments, politicians. The book was launched in July 2008 by Laurie Ferguson, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services.\n\n\nAwards and honours\nIn 1989, Abdel-Halim was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of her services to the Muslim community, particularly to women.\nIn 2008, Abdel-Halim was the recipient of the \"Australian Muslim Lifetime Achiever Award\" for more than 25 years of Excellence in Community/Professional service.\nIn 2019, Abdel-Halim was the recipient of the RISEAP Award \" in recognition of her invaluable contributions and exemplary leadership over three decades in the service of Muslim minorities in the South East Asia and Pacific region.\"\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "Starlite Terrace",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=72666039",
    "text": "Starlite Terrace is a contemporary novel in four stories about the American film milieu written by Patrick Roth, published by Seagull Books in 2012.\n\n\nSetting and structure\n\"Starlite Terrace\" is the name of the Los Angeles apartment complex arranged around a swimming pool, where the plot unfolds in 2002 and 2003. Four tenants tell their Hollywood-tinged life stories to a fifth, who is also the main narrator (who remains nameless). Attracted by the glamour of show business, Rex, Moss, Gary and June had moved to the movie capital at a young age. In conversations with the narrator, they recount key events and turning points in their lives, great expectations and bitter disappointments. Their stories, mostly rendered as dialogues, revolve around love and guilt, death and redemption, existential themes, which find expression in archetypal images. Each narrative is based on biographical-historical facts embedded in a mythical-supra-temporal context. The author himself describes the narratives as fictionalized testimonies of people on the fringes of the American film and music industries, shaped and assembled into four \"individuation stories\".\nThe opening of the mundane everyday world into the mythical background of life gives the four stories the character of a novel. The anonymous narrator remains predominantly in the background of events in his role as an objective observer. Interspersed references to his person open up autobiographical references: his German origin, his extensive knowledge of film, and the narrative procedure of collecting slivers of life as material for dramatic stories point to an identity of author and narrator and identify Starlite Terrace as autofictional prose. \"The Starlite Terrace narratives are part of Roth's own life story, a condensation of his forty-year experience with the film city Los Angeles, where he arrived in 1975 to study filmmaking at the University of Southern California (USC).\"\nThe volume, which does not bear a genre designation, presents itself as a four-part narrative cycle that depicts a development in four stages or four narratives. The basic theme of transformation is already alluded to in the title. \"Starlite Terrace\" refers to an actual apartment building in Los Angeles and, at the same time, to the stepwise ascent to knowledge and a new consciousness. The four narratives that constitute the novel are linked by a variety of structural parallelisms and recurring motifs. Also it contains numerous direct and hidden references to film, the Bible, pop music and literature. The continuity of the overarching narrator figure, the central theme of film and movie stars, and the overall unity of place, time, and action weave the individual narratives into an organic body of work imbued with diagnostic power for the times.\n\n\nPlot\n\n\n1. The Man at Noah's Window\n\nThe first story revolves around the dying of old Rex. Over breakfast at \"Noah's Deli\", the former movie extra, who grew up without parents, reminisces about his childhood and youth, years that were illuminated only by the movies. Rex recounts that his father, a small shoe salesman with ostensibly beautiful hands, doubled Gary Cooper's hands during the filming of the western classic High Noon. As a young man, Rex had once stalked the star in the streets of Beverly Hills. Vainly, he attempted to shake the star's hand. The existential abandonment of the \"man at Noah's window\" becomes palpable in his nickname, \"Rex Iudaeroum\" (King of the Jews). This teasingly bestowed biblical title alludes to both demise and resurrection: Like Jesus on the cross, Rex, the \"old king\", dies a lonely, godforsaken death at the end of the narrative. Much like his idol Gary Cooper, he is dying of cancer. The narrator reproaches himself for not recognizing the signs of the approaching end:And who, by the way, was Rex? What was he to me that I had listened to him for so long, had wanted to find the scenes containing the hands? [...] And what if I had listened to Rex that time at Noah's because I had a premonition that he was on the edge of the abyss? Not only that, but listened so closely, listened to Rex so breathlessly because I knew he was speaking of both himself and me. That it was my destiny being announced.A dream by the narrator links the external events surrounding Rex to internal, biblical images. A \"thrasing wind from the north\" breaks into the window of the breakfast deli and tears the \"man at Noah's window\" with it, while the narrator seeks shelter in the adjacent room. Crouching on the floor in the darkness, he encounters the numinous figure of a \"Überschreiter\" (transcender), a \"captive liberator\" who strides over him into the open and rides away, whereupon the destructive storm subsides and calm returns. At last, the narrator steps out into the night, \"into the wind, back to the Starlite Terrace.\"\n\n\n2. Solar Eclipse\n\nThe second narrative focuses on the troubled life of Moss McCloud. A former actor and casting agent from New York, he struggles with the loss of his relationship to his only daughter, whose visit he expects any day now. The drama of the 40-year separation becomes acute again when he loses the manuscript of his life's story. The narrator accompanies his distraught neighbor as he searches for the lost script. In dialogue, Moss recalls scenes of his marriage from the first kiss at a stage rehearsal of Thornton Wilders play Our Town to the abrupt end three years later. The gamut of conflicting emotions of love and hate, anger and revenge, insight and abandonment is reflected in a breathlessly associative monologue. Narratively, Moss gathers together the fragments of the relationship, becoming aware of the larger factor behind his life. At the height of the conflict, this Other had appeared to him as a vision in the reflecting window of a bank building, ready to pour out his \"vessel of anger\". By the end of his wanderings, his search for the manuscript, Moss finds what he had lost on another plane: By now it was completely dark. Moss and I were standing in the unlit alley behind the shops on Ventura Boulevard. We had long since given up the search. But Moss had dragged me along, drawing me deeper into his story with every word, holding me captive. He had spoken to me as if every word were testimony. And now — I could see it as he finished speaking — they were standing before him, the woman and his daughter. He had them back.Solar Eclipse is designed as a frame story. The first-person narrator functions in the role of mediator and therapist, guiding the cognitive process through presence and empathy. At the end, the narrative levels intertwine in a metafictional gesture when Moss places his story in the hands of the narrator and instructs him to pass it on to posterity as his personal legacy.\n\n\n3. Rider on the Storm\n\nThe Iraq War forms the contemporary historical background of the third story. It depicts Gary, an unsuccessful drummer and member of the Christian fundamentalist community \"Keepers of the Flame\". Influenced by the drug and hippie culture of the 1960s, he wants to rebuild his guilt-ridden life and seeks forgiveness from a young actress with whom he has newly fallen in love. He conquers his fractious temper with marijuana, his tendency to violent outbursts with a gun he secretly carries in his pocket. With his stories about the music scene of the sixties, he lures the narrator on a car trip to Laurel Canyon. As they drive by the homes of legends like Joni Mitchell, Frank Zappa and John Mayall, Gary describes episodes from his life. The bright beginning as drummer with The Turtles and the marriage with a Beatles groupie were followed by his exit from the band shortly before their hit Happy Together, his divorce and a steady descent into depression:\"Forty days of flood — that's what your Armenian buddy was describing. You know, sometimes I have the feeling I've been up to my neck in water for forty years. Always close to drowning. Never having firm ground under my feet... I'm fifty years old, man! And what do I have to show for it? Zilch.\"With the narrator as listener, Gary confesses his misconduct and transgressions with women and family. The destination of the car ride turns out to be a party in the Hollywood Hills, where he expects to join up with the woman he longs to start over with. The narrator witnesses Gary mingling with the guests, wandering through the backyard in the pouring rain, a gun at the ready. The final image shows him at the bottom of a gazebo, drawn to an open fire, reaching into it with his hands. The motif of hand-clasped burning logs alludes to the beginning of the narrative, when the Armenian Ara recalls his first film experience among friends: a 50s low budget swords-and-sandals movie, centered around the biblical Flood, tells of a man, Ur, a contemporary of Noah's, and his love for his wife. After an encounter with a magician, Ur's wife is transformed and smuggled into the saving ark. During the ordeal in the fiery floods, Ur clings to the exterior planks of the ark. Through a crevice, the couple is able to hold contact, never taking their eyes off one another.\n\n\n4. The Woman in the Sea of Stars\n\nThe fourth story and final narrative step, The Woman in the Sea of Stars, shows the narrator alone among women. The narrator's opening dream — about an unknown woman lying poolside as she sketches a section of the cosmos into a black book — has the effect of freeing him from a fever. June, the long-divorced manager of the \"Starlite Terrace\" is of German descent and the only female heroine in the book. Her niece Jennifer, a storyboard artist, is visiting with her. The three of them sit together in the courtyard of the \"Starlite\" while The Conqueror, a 1950s movie starring John Wayne, plays on a TV monitor in the background. \n\nJune, who shares her birthday and ex-husband with Marilyn Monroe, talks about her time as a secretary at Disney and 20th Century Fox. The glamorous names of studio bosses and movie gods are associated not only with abuse of power and sexual coercion, but also with death and crime. Whether it's the radioactively contaminated filming location in the Nevada desert, which also became Wayne's undoing, the Mafia execution of Las Vegas founder and godfather Bugsy Siegel through the window of a Beverly Hills mansion, or the alleged suicide of Marilyn Monroe involving the Kennedy brothers - June is aware of the dark underbelly of the dream factory. She herself is completely absorbed in the lives of those in the spotlight: She fell silent for a moment. Maybe she realized she was going around in circles. That Marilyn's name and all the names and happenings of which she was speaking, as though they were timeless — for that was the undertone whenever June talked about the stars — were forcing her into a fateful circle, never letting her reach the center. Only the memory of her encounter with the holocaust brings June back to herself. At Columbia, she had the task of logging film footage, of translating images into words. What was revealed \"shot by shot\" was the horror of extermination captured on camera by the liberators of the concentration camps in the spring of 1945. June then tells of her father, who had been abandoned as a child by his father, an immigrant German Jew.\nAt the end of the evening, coinciding with her 77th birthday, June symbolically reunites the torn family ties in the courtyard of the \"Starlite Terrace\". She pours the ashes of her unknown grandfather into the pool and jumps in. The narrator, who witnesses the spontaneous ritual from the pool's edge, poetically renders the union taking place within the ancestral ashes in the cosmic imagery of a marriage: \"With three or four powerful kicks June reached the bottom [of the pool] and groped along, more slowly now, through the sparkling threads of ash as they drifted apart. She dove upward, as if under the billowing hem of bridal gown, into the midst of the drifting figure, into the center of the light-pierced dancing cloud.\"\n\n\nCritical reception\nLiterary scholars regard Starlite Terrace as an exemplary example of the current trend of postsecular fiction in the wake of Charles Taylor's study A Secular Age (2007), which is characterized by a new interest in spiritual content and existential experiences. Accordingly, the four narratives illustrate religiously alienated life in the radically secularized society of the film city Los Angeles; at the same time, they reveal the search movements of the four protagonists for the transcendent center of life. Starlite Terrace in this sense documents the disappearance of religious practice and religious knowledge in Western societies and at the same time reveals the tendency to search for the lost center of meaning in the substitute world of film and its deified stars: \"The stories in Starlite Terrace impressively illustrate the transformations of the religious sphere in Western societies under the conditions of what Charles Taylor has described as the secular age. [...] Religion is individual, unfinishable search for meaning.\"\nThis constellation is reflected in the narrative method. Due to its metafictional structure, Roth's neorealistic narrative exhibits postmodern experimental traits; it resorts to cinematic methods in order to intensify the impact of certain effects and to open up mythical depth dimensions. The narrative structure is reminiscent of a layered model: \"The world projected in Starlite Terrace rests on a double foundation, insofar as the archetypal world of the psyche appears beneath the external Los Angeles culture, communicating itself in [...] interwoven dreams - as a compensatory supplement, conveyed in timelessly mythical images, to the superficially trivial everyday reality, which is thus seen from a larger, transpersonal point of view.\"  What characterizes post-secular literature are religious experiences in the form of \"ontological openings\" - sudden intrusions of another, larger world in the form of archetypal dreams and visions. Basically, the novel-like narrative cycle is distinguished by the postmodern interweaving of topoi from Judeo-Christian symbolism (e.g., the motif of the Flood, the Messiah as Redeemer, the Apocalypse, and the death on the cross as images of the end and renewal) with film images and film figures from Hollywood cinema.\nStarlite Terrace has been described as highly self-reflexive prose in which storytelling as a medium is critically scrutinized. In reflecting on the stories he gathers, the narrator himself is subjected to a transformation that extends beyond the boundaries of the text. The poetological intention is \"to unleash in the literary demonstration of the creation of reality through storytelling a dialectical countermovement to the aesthetic freezing of communication in the writtenness of the text, a countermovement which ultimately - in the act of reading and rereading the work - also takes hold of the relationship between author and audience.\"\n\n\nEditions\nPatrick Roth: Starlite Terrace, Frankfurt a.

It is 18.6 miles (29.9 km) east of Nottingham, five miles (8.0 km) west of Grantham on the A52 and 12.5 miles (20.1 km) north of Melton Mowbray. It lies on the border of Leicestershire and Lincolnshire, two miles east of Bottesford. The River Devon (pronounced Deevon) flows through the village. In 1931 the parish had a population of 218. On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished and merged with Bottesford.\n\n\nFacilities\nThe parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. It is in the Belvoir Group of parishes, based in Bottesford, and under the Diocese of Leicester.\nMuston Meadows is a nearby 41-hectare (100-acre) grassland nature reserve featuring 33 types of grass and over 100 other species of flowering plant. The reserve is notable for its colony of over 10,000 Green-winged Orchids. The 14th-century cross on the village green is a Grade II* listed structure. The Viking Way, a long-distance footpath between North Lincolnshire and Rutland, passes one-half mile (0.80 km) to the east of the village.\nThe village lies near the Bingham–Bottesford–Grantham bus route, which runs about once an hour in the daytime on weekdays but does not stop at Muston. The local pub, the Muston Gap, occupies a Grade II listed building dating back to the 18th century. It stands on the A52, 110 yards (100 metres) from the Nottingham–Grantham railway line, where the nearest station is Bottesford 1.8 miles away (3 km). Muston also has a café (the Old Forge Tea Rooms), bed and breakfast facilities (Glebe House, a Grade II listed building, and Chantry Cottage), a children's play area and a village hall (Old School Muston).\n\n\nMuston of old\nMuston belonged to the ancient hundred or wapentake of Framland. Muston Gorse wharf on the Grantham Canal was the terminus of the private Belvoir Tramway to Belvoir Castle, which opened in 1793. Some detailed, amply illustrated information on Muston and its past appears on the Bottesford Living History website.\nJohn Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72): \"MUSTON... stands on the River Devon, adjacent to the boundary with Lincolnshire, near the Grantham Canal, 1½ mile east-south-east of Bottesford railway station, and 5½ west by north of Grantham; and has a post office under Nottingham. The paZrish comprises 1,623 acres. Real property, £2,694. Pop., 360. Houses, 74. The property is divided among a few. The manor belongs to the Duke of Rutland. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Peterborough. Value, £400.*Patron, the Lord Chancellor. The church is a handsome structure; and consists of nave, aisles, chancel and two porches, with central tower and spire. There are (sic) a Wesleyan chapel and a national school.\"\n\n\nFamous people\nProperty in Muston was owned by Nathaniel Hallowes (1582–1661) of Derby, an English politician who sat in the English House of Commons from 1640 to 1653 and again in 1659. He was an active Parliamentarian during the English Civil War.\nThe poet George Crabbe (1754–1832) moved to Muston Rectory (later Glebe House) from a curacy at Stathern in 1789, having previously been chaplain to the Duke of Rutland from 1782 to 1784. He was a resident incumbent of Muston and of nearby West Allington, Lincolnshire until 1792, but then an absentee until 1805. He remained resident for most of the period up to 1814, when he became rector of Trowbridge, Wiltshire. His Natural History of the Vale of Belvoir was a pioneering study of the district.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nParish Council (shared with Bottesford)\nLeicestershire Villages",

    "text": "Ikuo Hayashi (林 郁夫, Hayashi Ikuo; born January 23, 1947) is a Japanese terrorist and former Aum Shinrikyo member convicted for his participation in the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway.\n\n\nBackground\nPrior to joining Aum, Hayashi was a senior medical doctor with \"an active 'front-line' track record\" at the Japanese Ministry of Science and Technology (now a part of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, or MEXT in short). Himself the son of a doctor, Hayashi graduated from Keio University, one of Tokyo's top universities. He was a heart and artery specialist at Keio University Hospital, which he left to become head of Circulatory Medicine at the National Sanitorium Hospital in Tokai, Ibaraki (north of Tokyo). Somewhere along the line Hayashi became disillusioned and decided to look beyond conventional medicine. He found AUM during his search.\nIn 1990 Hayashi resigned his job and left his family to join Aum and become a renunciate. He was believed to be one of Shoko Asahara's favorites and was appointed the group's \"Minister of Health\" with responsibilities encompassing a broad range of activities from development of a balanced \"Aum diet\" and supervision over \"Aum hospital\" to experimentations with the illegal psychedelic drug LSD (which reportedly was used in one of Aum's initiations sometime in 2002).\nBesides involvement in Tokyo subway sarin gas attack and LSD drug affair, Hayashi was convicted in a number of other crimes. For example, he assisted in kidnapping of Kiyoshi Kariya, the 68-year-old brother of a 62-year-old woman who planned to become a renunciate but went missing (Hayashi believed she was held against her will by her brother to prevent her from becoming a nun). Hayashi and several other men injected Kariya with a drug to find the woman, but Kariya unexpectedly died, either from miscalculated dosage or weak physical health. Previously Hayashi helped another Aum member to recover from a forced drug treatment administered by the follower's father (also to prevent him from becoming a renunciate).\n\n\nTokyo subway sarin attack\n\nDuring the Tokyo sarin gas attack, Ikuo Hayashi and Tomomitsu Niimi were involved in delivering the sarin containers on the Chiyoda line as a part of the Tokyo sarin attacks. Niimi served as the driver. Hayashi, wearing a surgical mask of the type commonly worn by Japanese during cold and flu season, boarded the southwestbound 7:48 a.m. Chiyoda line train number A725K on the first car. He was about to puncture the sarin packs but had second thoughts due to seeing dozens of commuters and fearing that releasing the sarin would endanger their lives, he also thought of aborting the attack.\nHayashi punctured only one bag of sarin at the next stop, Shin-Ochanomizu Station in the central business district. Two transit authority staff in the subway were killed by the sarin, including the assistant station-master, and 231 suffered serious injuries. Both perpetrators did not attempt to hide and returned to Aum facilities.\nSometime after the news of the attack gained worldwide attention, Hayashi later surrendered to the Japan police wherein he provided details of the attack and its perpetrators to investigators and also included additional information about Aum activities post-attack. A huge raid of Aum facilities and arrest of Aum members were conducted.\n\n\nTrial and legal proceedings\nIn court, the two reacted differently. While Niimi refused to cooperate with prosecution saying that the \"four meditative concentrations\" he experienced under guidance of Asahara prevent him from testifying against his Guru, Hayashi accepted responsibility in the attack and testified in court. He was quoted as saying that he regrets that \"while he became a doctor to help, he used his skills to inflict sufferings\". He apologized to the victims and said that he views the death penalty as an appropriate punishment for his deeds. Niimi, citing different reasons (loyalty to Asahara and Buddhist fatalistic ideas), also said that he would \"gladly\" accept the capital punishment.\nHayashi was given a life sentence with a possibility of parole in 20 years, while Niimi was sentenced to death (and later executed in 2018). As of 2025, Hayashi remains imprisoned.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSee also",

The term barracks here does not refer to military barracks, but to the workers' barracks-type primitive dormitories in which the industrial workers lived in many places in the Russian Empire of the time.\nIn the ideology of the Soviet Union the term was applied to theories of \"some ideologues in China\" of the 1950s-1970s. During the Soviet perestroika period, the term was used to apply to the history of the Soviet Union itself.\n\n\nOrigin\nA relevant section of Sergey Nechayev's \"The Fundamentals of the Future Social System\" reads as follows: The ending of the existing social order and the renewal of life with the aid of the new principles can be accomplished only by concentrating all the means of social existence in the hands of our committee, and the proclamation of compulsory physical labour for everyone.\nThe committee, as soon as the present institutions have been overthrown, proclaims that everything is common property, orders the setting up of workers' societies (artels) and at the same time publishes statistical tables compiled by experts and pointing out what branches of labour are most needed in a certain locality and what branches may run into difficulties there.\n\nFor a certain number of days assigned for the revolutionary upheaval and the disorders that are bound to follow, each person must join one or another of these artels according to his own choice... All those who remain isolated and unattached to workers' groups without sufficient reason will have no right of access either to the communal eating places or to the communal dormitories, or to any other buildings assigned to meet the various needs of the brother-workers or that contain the goods and materials, the victuals or tools reserved for all members of the established workers' society; in a word, he who without sufficient reason has not joined an artel, will be left without means of subsistence. All the roads, all the means of communication will be closed to him; he will have no other alternative but work or death.\nIn their report \"The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association\", an explanation and justification of the expulsion of Bakunin's faction from the International, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels quote the above text and comment sarcastically as follows: What a beautiful model of barrack-room communism! Here you have it all: communal eating, communal sleeping, assessors and offices regulating education, production, consumption, in a word, all social activity, and to crown all, our committee, anonymous and unknown to anyone, as the supreme director.

It stars Whoopi Goldberg as a lounge singer forced to hide in a convent after being placed in a witness protection program. It also features Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Mary Wickes, and Harvey Keitel.\nReceiving mixed to favorable reviews, Sister Act was one of the most financially successful comedies of the early 1990s, grossing $231.6 million worldwide against a $31 million budget. Its success extended to the home video market, and it was the most rented film of 1993 in the United States. The film spawned a franchise, which consists of the critically panned 1993 sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit and a musical adaptation, which premiered in 2006. A third film is in development for Disney+.\n\n\nPlot\nIn 1968, Deloris Wilson is a young Catholic school student who does not take her studies seriously and greatly embarrasses her nun teachers while showing an affinity for music.\nTwenty-four years later, in 1992, Deloris (performing as Deloris Van Cartier) is a lounge singer in Reno, Nevada, in a club owned by her married gangster boyfriend Vince LaRocca. She receives a shallow gift from Vince and attempts to return it, only to witness Vince executing an informant. When Vince sets out to murder her as well, Deloris goes to the police for help.\nPolice lieutenant Eddie Souther places her in witness protection and brings her to the struggling convent of Saint Katherine's Parish, located in a run-down San Francisco neighborhood. Both Deloris and the disgruntled head nun of St. Katherine's, Reverend Mother, object to this arrangement. However, Souther and Monsignor O'Hara, the parish priest, convince them to go along with it, with the added deal that the police will pay the failing convent a good sum of money.\nDisguised as \"Sister Mary Clarence\", Deloris initially has difficulty dealing with the rigid and simple convent life and butts heads with Reverend Mother, but she befriends the other nuns, including the optimistic and upbeat Sister Mary Patrick, the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus, and the shy young Novice Sister Mary Robert. One night, after a poorly attended Sunday Mass—with a lackluster performance from the convent choir led by Mary Lazarus—Deloris decides she needs a break and sneaks out to a bar, followed by Mary Patrick and Mary Robert. They are caught by the Reverend Mother, who considers kicking Deloris out, but instead orders Deloris to join the struggling choir. With her singing experience, Deloris is elected to take over as their director and transforms the choir.\nAt the next Sunday Mass, Deloris leads the much-improved choir in a traditional hymn of \"Hail Holy Queen\", then shifts into a combined gospel and rock and roll interpretation. Although Reverend Mother is infuriated, Monsignor O'Hara congratulates the choir for their unorthodox performance, as new people were attracted to the service. Convinced by Deloris (who cleverly credits Reverend Mother with the idea), he allows the nuns to clean the church and help revitalize the neighborhood. Their singing and efforts attract media attention, and the parish thrives.\nMeanwhile, Vince has placed a bounty on Deloris' head and is intent on finding her. Souther chastises Deloris for nearly being exposed on national TV. She assures him she will try to keep a lower profile, and Souther attends a Mass. The choir continues to amaze parishioners and visitors, especially with a rendition of \"My Guy\" – rewritten and performed as \"My God\".\nO'Hara informs the convent that Pope John Paul II, having heard of the choir's success, will visit the church and would like to hear them perform. Deloris tells Reverend Mother that Vince's upcoming trial means she will soon leave; the Mother reveals she has resigned as abbess, believing she is no longer useful to the convent as her authority was unintentionally undermined. Deloris tries to convince her to stay and keep the parish thriving as it is, but the Mother retorts that she believes herself too old-fashioned and incapable of doing so.\nSouther discovers a corrupt detective in his own department who has disclosed Deloris's location to Vince and rushes to San Francisco to warn her. Though he arrives in time, Deloris  insists on staying, feeling a sense of responsibility to her friends in the convent. Vince's men kidnap Deloris and Mary Robert, but Deloris helps Mary Robert escape. When Mary Robert returns to the convent, Reverend Mother reveals Deloris' true identity to the nuns and explains why she had been hiding in their convent. The nuns decide to rescue Deloris, and Reverend Mother leads them in guilting a local helicopter pilot to fly them to Reno.\nIn Reno, Vince orders his men to kill Deloris, but they cannot bring themselves to shoot her while she is dressed in a nun's habit. Arriving at the casino, the nuns find Deloris after she escapes Vince's men and try to sneak her out, but are cornered by Vince and his entourage in the lounge. Deloris prepares to sacrifice herself, but Vince's men still refuse to shoot her. Vince is hesitant himself, but works up the courage to shoot her. He hesitates just long enough for Souther to shoot him in the arm and arrest him and his men.\nThanking Deloris for her actions, Reverend Mother decides to remain as abbess. Returning to San Francisco, the choir, led by Deloris, sings \"I Will Follow Him\" to a packed audience in a refurbished Saint Katherine's, receiving a standing ovation from all including Reverend Mother, the Pope, Monsignor O'Hara, and Souther. Deloris continues to guide and coach the choir as a touring musical group.\nDuring the closing credits, the group sings a cover of the Isley Brothers' \"Shout\".\n\n\nCast\n\nChoir nuns\n\n\nProduction\n\nScreenwriter Paul Rudnick pitched Sister Act to producer Scott Rudin in 1987, with Bette Midler in mind for the lead role. The script was brought to Disney. However, Midler turned down the role, fearing that her fans would not want to see her play a nun. Eventually, Whoopi Goldberg signed on to play the lead. As production commenced, the script was rewritten by a half dozen screenwriters, including Carrie Fisher, Robert Harling, and Nancy Meyers. With the movie no longer resembling his original script, Rudnick asked to be credited with a pseudonym in the film, deciding on Joseph Howard.\nThe church in which Deloris takes sanctuary is St. Paul's Catholic Church, located at Valley and Church Streets in Noe Valley, an upper-middle-class neighborhood of San Francisco. The storefronts on the opposite side of the street were redressed to give the appearance of a run-down neighborhood. Filming took place from September 23, 1991 (1991-09-23) to December 20, 1991 (1991-12-20).\nThough the order of the nuns in the film is said to be a Carmelite one by Sister Mary Patrick, their religious habit is similar in appearance to that of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis (minus the cross). Members of the real-life Order, however, no longer wear their traditional habit.\n\n\nSoundtrack\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on June 9, 1992, in conjunction with the film, and contained the musical numbers performed by actors in the film itself, pre-recorded songs that were used as part of the background music, and instrumental music composed by Marc Shaiman for the film. The soundtrack album debuted at #74 and eventually reached #40 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart where it charted for 54 weeks. The album received a Gold certification from the RIAA for shipment of 500,000 copies on January 13, 1993. The album was certified platinum in Australia.\n\n\"The Lounge Medley\" (\"(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave\"/\"My Guy\"/\"I Will Follow Him\") — Deloris & The Ronelles\n\"The Murder\" (Instrumental)\n\"Getting into the Habit\" (Instrumental)\n\"Rescue Me\" — Fontella Bass\n\"Hail Holy Queen\" — Deloris & The Sisters\n\"Roll With Me Henry\" — Etta James\n\"Gravy for My Mashed Potatoes\" — Dee Dee Sharp\n\"My Guy (My God)\" — Deloris & The Sisters\n\"Just a Touch of Love (Everyday)\" — C+C Music Factory\n\"Deloris Is Kidnapped\" (Instrumental)\n\"Nuns to the Rescue\" (Instrumental)\n\"Finale: I Will Follow Him ('Chariot')\" — Deloris & The Sisters\n\"Shout\" — Deloris & The Sisters & The Ronelles\n\"If My Sister's in Trouble\" — Lady Soul\nThe singing voice for the character of Mary Robert was performed by Andrea Robinson.\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nReception\n\n\nCritical response\nThe film received a mixed to favorable reception from critics, holding a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Looking for a sweet musical comedy about a witness to a crime hiding out from killers in a convent? There's nun better than Sister Act.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. He wrote that Goldberg and Wickes both offered humorous performances, but the film overall \"plays like a missed opportunity\" due to slow pacing and trouble integrating the organized crime scenes into a comedy film. Metacritic gave the film a score of 51 based on the 23 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\nBox office\nThe film was a box-office success, grossing $139.6 million in the U.S. and $92 million in other countries, effectively grossing $231.6 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1992. It sat at the #2 spot for four weeks, behind Lethal Weapon 3, Patriot Games,  and Batman Returns in succession.\n\n\nAccolades\n\nThe film is also recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nAFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs — Nominated\n\n\nLawsuits\nOn June 10, 1993, actress Donna Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc. filed a $200 million lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming the film was plagiarized from the book A Nun in the Closet, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson argued that, in 1985, they had developed a screenplay for the book, which had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. The lawsuit noted over 100 similarities between the movie and the book/screenplay as evidence of plagiarism. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer in an attempt to win the case. The judge found in favor of Disney and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, \"They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail.\"\nIn November 2011, a nun named Delois Blakely filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and Sony Pictures claiming that The Harlem Street Nun, an autobiography she wrote in 1987, was the basis for the 1992 film. She alleged that a movie executive expressed an interest in the movie rights after she wrote a three-page synopsis. She sued for \"breach of contract, misappropriation of likeness and unjust enrichment.\" Blakely dropped the original lawsuit in January 2012 to serve a more robust lawsuit in late August 2012 with the New York Supreme Court, asking for $1 billion in damages from Disney. In early February 2013, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, awarding no damages to Blakely.\n\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on VHS on November 13, 1992 by Touchstone Home Video. It proved very successful in the video rental market, and ended up as the top rental of 1993 in the United States. The Region 1 DVD was released on November 6, 2001; however, the disc has no anamorphic enhancement, similar to early DVDs from Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Special Features include the film's theatrical trailer; music videos for \"I Will Follow Him\" by Deloris and the Sisters, and \"If My Sister's in Trouble\" by Lady Soul, both of which contain clips from the film; and a featurette titled \"Inside Sister Act: The Making Of\".\nThe all-region Blu-ray including both films was released on June 19, 2012, with both films presented in 1080p. The three-disc set also includes both films on DVD with the same bonus features as previous releases.\n\n\nMusical\n\nThe musical Sister Act, directed by Peter Schneider and choreographed by Marguerite Derricks, premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California on October 24, 2006, and closed on December 23, 2006. It broke records, grossing $1,085,929 to become the highest grossing show ever at the venue. The production then moved to the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, where it ran from January 17 to February 25, 2007.\nThe musical then opened in the West End at the London Palladium on June 2, 2009, following previews from May 7. The production was directed by Peter Schneider, produced by Whoopi Goldberg together with the Dutch company Stage Entertainment, and choreographed by Anthony Van Laast, with set design by Klara Zieglerova, costume design by Lez Brotherston and lighting design by Natasha Katz. Following a year-long search, 24-year-old actress Patina Miller was cast as Deloris, alongside Sheila Hancock as the Mother Superior, Ian Lavender as Monsignor Howard, Chris Jarman as Shank, Ako Mitchell as Eddie, Katie Rowley Jones as Sister Mary Robert, Claire Greenway as Sister Mary Patrick and Julia Sutton as Sister Mary Lazarus. The musical received four Laurence Olivier Awards nominations, including Best Musical. On October 30, 2010, the show played its final performance at the London Palladium and transferred to Broadway.\nThe musical opened at the Broadway Theatre on April 20, 2011, with previews beginning March 24, 2011. Jerry Zaks directed the Broadway production with Douglas Carter Beane rewriting the book. Miller, who originated the role of Deloris in the West End production, reprised her role, making her Broadway debut. She was replaced by Raven-Symoné, also making her Broadway debut. The original Broadway cast featured Victoria Clark (Mother Superior), Fred Applegate (Monsignor), Sarah Bolt (Sister Mary Patrick), Chester Gregory (Eddie), Kingsley Leggs (Curtis), Marla Mindelle (Sister Mary Robert) and Audrie Neenan (Sister Mary Lazarus). The musical received five Tony Award nominations including Best Musical.\nThe musical closed, in August 2012, after 561 performances.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nSister Act at IMDb\nSister Act at the TCM Movie Database\nSister Act at Box Office Mojo",

    "text": "WNBC (channel 4) is a television station in New York City. It is the flagship station of the NBC television network, owned and operated through its NBC Owned Television Stations division. Under common ownership with Linden, New Jersey–licensed Telemundo outlet WNJU (channel 47), the two stations share studios and offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan, co-located with NBC's corporate headquarters, and broadcast from the same transmitter at One World Trade Center; WNJU's facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey, also serve as WNBC's New Jersey news bureau.\nWNBC holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously operating commercial television station in the United States.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nExperimental operations\nWhat is now WNBC traces its history to experimental station W2XBS, founded by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA, a co-founder of the National Broadcasting Company), in 1928, just two years after NBC was founded as the first nationwide radio network. Originally a test bed for the experimental RCA Photophone theater television system, W2XBS used the low-definition mechanical television scanning system. Later it was used mostly for reception and interference tests. The call letters W2XBS meant W2XB-south, with W2XB being the call letters of the first experimental station, started a few months earlier at General Electric's (GE) main factory in Schenectady, New York, which evolved into today's WRGB. GE was the parent company of both RCA and NBC, and technical research was done at the Schenectady plant.\nThe station originally broadcast on the frequencies of 2.0 to 2.1 MHz. In 1929, W2XBS upgraded its transmitter and broadcast facilities to handle transmissions of 60 vertical lines at 20 frames per second, on the frequencies of 2.75 to 2.85 MHz. In 1928, Felix the Cat was one of the first images ever broadcast by television when RCA chose a papier-mâché (later Bakelite) Felix doll for an experimental broadcast on W2XBS. The doll was chosen for its tonal contrast and its ability to withstand the intense lights needed in early television. It was placed on a rotating phonograph turntable and televised for about two hours each day. The doll remained on the turntable for nearly a decade as RCA fine-tuned the picture's definition, and converted to electronic television.\nThe station left the air sometime in 1933 as RCA turned its attention to all-electronic cathode-ray tube (CRT) television research at its Camden, New Jersey facility, under the leadership of Dr. Vladimir K. Zworykin.\nIn 1935, the all-electronic CRT system was authorized as a \"field test\" project and NBC converted a radio studio in the RCA Building in New York City's Rockefeller Center for television use. In mid-1936, small-scale, irregularly scheduled programming began to air to an audience of some 75 receivers in the homes of high-level RCA staff, and a dozen or so sets in a closed circuit viewing room in 52nd-floor offices of the RCA Building. The viewing room often hosted visiting organizations or corporate guests, who saw a live program produced in the studios many floors below.\nViewership of early NBC broadcasts was tightly restricted to those authorized by the company, whose installed set base eventually reached about 200. Technical standards for television broadcasting were in flux as well. Between the time experimental, electronic transmissions began in 1935 and the beginning of commercial television service in 1941, picture definition increased from 343 to 441 lines, and finally (in 1941) to the 525-line standard used for analog television from the start of full commercial service until the end of analog broadcasts in mid-2009. The sound signal was also changed from AM to FM, and the spacing of sound and vision carriers was also changed several times. Shortly after NBC began a semi-regular television transmission schedule in 1938, DuMont Laboratories announced TV sets for sale to the public, a move that RCA was saving for the opening of the World's Fair on April 30, 1939, the day that regularly scheduled television programming was to begin in New York on NBC with much fanfare. In response, NBC ceased all TV broadcasting for several weeks until RCA sets went on sale; regular NBC telecasts commenced the day the fair opened.\n\n\nFirsts for W2XBS\nAs W2XBS broadcasting on \"Channel 1\" (44–50 MHz), the station scored numerous \"firsts\". These included: the first televised Broadway drama (June 1938); the first live news event covered by a mobile unit (a fire in an abandoned building in November 1938); the first live telecast of a presidential speech (Franklin D. Roosevelt opening the 1939 New York World's Fair); the first live telecasts of college and Major League Baseball (both in 1939), the first telecast of a National Football League game (also in 1939); the first telecast of a National Hockey League game (early 1940); the first broadcast of religious services (Easter Sunday 1940); the first network (multi-city) telecast of a political convention (the 1940 Republican National Convention, held June 24–28 in the Philadelphia Civic Center) seen also on W3XE in Philadelphia (now KYW-TV) and W2XB in Schenectady (now WRGB); and the broadcast of the feature film The Crooked Circle on June 18, 1940.\nIn August 1940, W2XBS transmissions were temporarily put on hold, as \"Channel 1\" was reassigned by the FCC to 50–56 MHz; technical adjustments needed to be made for the conversion. The station returned to the air in October, just in time to broadcast Franklin D. Roosevelt's second and final appearance on live television, when his speech at Madison Square Garden on October 28, 1940, was telecast over W2XBS.\n\n\nFirst commercial television station\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XBS received a commercial license under the calls WNBT (for \"NBC Television\"), thus becoming one of the first two fully licensed commercial television stations in the United States, alongside CBS's WCBW on channel 2 (now WCBS-TV), which had evolved from experimental W2XAB. NBC and CBS were instructed to sign on simultaneously on July 1 so that neither of the major broadcast companies could claim exclusively to be \"first\". However, WNBT signed on at 1:30 pm, one full hour before WCBW. As a result, WNBC (and essentially, NBC) inadvertently holds the distinction as the oldest continuously operating commercial television station (and television network, respectively) in the United States, and also the only one ready to accept sponsors from its beginning. The first program broadcast at 1 p.m. EST by the sign-on/opening ceremony with the U.S. national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", followed by an announcement of that day's programs and the commencement of NBC television programming.\nWNBT originally broadcast on channel 1. On its first day on the air, WNBT broadcast the world's first official television advertisement before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.\nAlthough full commercial telecasting began on July 1, 1941, with the first paid advertisements on WNBT, there had been experimental, non-paid advertising on television as far back as 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid, television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, a game between the Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939, over W2XBS. To secure the rights to show the game on television, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors at the time to have one commercial during the telecast; these were done by Dodger announcer Red Barber. For Ivory Soap, he held up a bar of the product, for Mobil gas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel, and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the cereal, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful.\nThe pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, became the first regularly scheduled TV program not featuring news or sports when it began on WNBT on November 29, 1943. (Though a one-time-only, trial episode of Truth or Consequences aired on WNBT's first week of programming two years earlier; it eventually returned to TV in the 1950s.)\nDuring World War II, RCA diverted key technical TV staff to the U.S. Navy, which was interested in developing a television-guided bomb. WNBT's studio and program staff were placed at the disposal of the New York City Police Department and used for civil defense training telecasts, with only a limited number of weekly programs for general audiences airing during much of the war. Programming began to grow on a small scale during 1944. On April 10, 1944, WNBT began feeding The Voice of Firestone Televues each week to a small network of stations including General Electric's Schenectady station (now called WRGB) and Philco-owned WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia, both of which are now affiliated with CBS (in KYW-TV's case, they are owned by CBS). This series is considered to be the NBC Television Network's first regularly scheduled program.\nOn May 8, 1945, WNBT broadcast hours of news coverage on the end of World War II in Europe, and remotes from around New York City. This event was pre-promoted by NBC with a direct-mail card sent to television set owners in the New York City area. At one point, a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the Astor Hotel in New York City panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in Europe. The vivid coverage was a prelude to television's rapid growth after the war ended. In the spring of 1946, the station changed its frequency from VHF channel 1 to channel 4 after channel 1 was removed from use for television broadcasting. From 1946 to 2009, it occupied the 66–72 MHz band of frequencies which had been designated as \"channel 3\" in the pre-1946 FCC allocation table. It was renumbered Channel 4 in the post-war system (DuMont-owned WABD, now WNYW—had been designated as \"Channel 4\", before that station moved to the current channel 5 but was only required to retune its video and audio carriers downward by 2 MHz under the new system). In October 1948, WNBT's operations were integrated with those of sister stations WNBC radio (660 AM) and WNBC-FM (97.1).\nThe station changed its call letters on October 18, 1954, to WRCA-TV (for NBC's then-parent company, Radio Corporation of America or RCA) and on May 22, 1960, channel 4 became WNBC-TV. NBC had previously used the callsign on its television station in New Britain, Connecticut, from 1957 until it was sold earlier in 1960 (that station is now WVIT, and is once again an NBC-owned station). WNBC-TV also earned a place in broadcasting history as the birthplace of The Tonight Show. It began on the station in 1953 as a local late night program, The Steve Allen Show, and NBC executive Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver brought it to the network in 1954. Studio 6B, the show's home under Jack Paar, Johnny Carson and today Jimmy Fallon, was the news studio for WNBC while Tonight was produced in Los Angeles.\nOn June 1, 1992, channel 4 dropped the \"-TV\" suffix from its call letters (following the sale in 1988 of its sister radio station WNBC, which is now WFAN) and became simply WNBC, with the new branding slogan along with a new station logo and name \"4 New York\". The accompanying station image campaign was titled \"We're 4 New York\" and featured a musical theme composed by Edd Kalehoff. WNBC was rebranded again as \"NBC 4\" on September 5, 1995, with its newscasts being renamed NewsChannel 4. In July 2007, the \"4 New York\" branding was revived part time, but in March 2008, it was revived full time.\nDuring the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WNBC, as well as eight other New York City area television stations and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the World Trade Center. WNBC broadcast engineer Bill Steckman died in the attack, along with Don DiFranco of WABC-TV; Gerard Copolla of WNET; Steve Jacobson of WPIX; and Bob Pattison and Isaias Rivera of WCBS-TV. In the immediate aftermath, the station temporarily fed its signal to three UHF stations that were still broadcasting (PBS member station WLIW and independent stations WMBC-TV and W26CE). After resuming over-the-air transmissions, the station broadcast from the former transmitter site of Channel 68 in West Orange, New Jersey. Since 2005, WNBC has broadcast its signal from the Empire State Building in midtown Manhattan, returning to the original transmitter site used from the 1930s to the 1970s. On May 9, 2017, it was announced that WNBC would return broadcasting from lower Manhattan at One World Trade Center by the end of the year.\nIn 2004, WNBC served as the model station for NBC Weather Plus, a 24-hour digital weather channel that aired on its second digital subchannel (4.2) and several local cable systems; other NBC-owned stations launched their own Weather Plus channels in 2005, although Weather Plus was discontinued at the end of 2008.\nWNBC ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, at 12:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its transition period UHF channel 28, using virtual channel 4.\nAs part of the SAFER Act, WNBC kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition. During this time, the station would participate in the \"Analog Nightlight\" program for two weeks, with a looped video in English and Spanish explaining how to switch to digital reception.\nIn February 2015, WNBC and the other NBC-owned stations offered live, web-based streaming of programming to subscribers of participating cable and satellite television providers, as provided through the TV Everywhere mobile apps.\nOn March 15, 2016, NBCUniversal pulled the signals of WNBC and WNJU along with co-owned cable channels USA Network, Bravo, Syfy, MSNBC and CNBC from Dish Network's lineup in the New York metropolitan area as a result of a dispute between NBC and Dish; despite that, Dish claimed NBCUniversal had demanded that it renew its carriage of ten NBC-owned stations and sixteen Telemundo-owned stations, including those removed due to the dispute. Three days later, Dish announced it would continue to carry WNBC, WNJU and five other cable channels for another ten days while the FCC sought arbitration.\nOn April 13, 2017, it was revealed that WNBC's over-the-air spectrum had been sold in the FCC's spectrum reallocation auction, fetching $214 million. As a result, WNBC's signal was co-located with that of sister station WNJU, which re-located its transmitter to One World Trade Center in 2017. NBC had won similar spectrum bids using Telemundo stations in Chicago and Philadelphia (which entered into in similar arrangements with NBC O&Os WMAQ-TV and WCAU), but stated that in this case, the Telemundo station had a superior signal. WNBC ceased broadcasting on UHF digital channel 28 from the Empire State Building on April 2, 2018, in favor of the shared broadcast with WNJU on channel 36 from One World Trade Center.  WNBC along with WNJU later moved channels again on August 1, 2019, at 1 p.m. (EDT) to digital channel 35.\n\n\nProgramming\n\nWNBC has long presented events such as the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, the National Puerto Rican Day Parade (until 2006, when coverage moved to WNYW and currently WABC-TV), the Columbus Day Parade (until 2010, when coverage moved to WABC-TV), the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting. The Tree Lighting aired exclusively in New York on WNBC until 1997, when NBC began airing it nationally. WNBC has sponsored an annual two-day Health & Fitness Expo Fair at MetLife Stadium every summer. The station has sponsored a Food Drive together with local retailer Stop & Shop named \"Feeding Our Families\" which has been held on the second Saturday in April since 2017. Beginning in 1995, they were the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual New York City Marathon until 2013 when WABC-TV took over. From 2010 to 2014, the station was an official local broadcast partner of Discovery Times Square. From 2012 to 2014, the station along with the New York Daily News had partnerships with Mount Sinai Health System, Live Well New York and Popular Community Bank (Popular Tips). The station, along with Maury Povich and Fox owned-and-operated WNYW, co-funded the 1998 PBS documentary NY TV: By the People Who Made It produced by WNET. During the Christmas season, the station has an annual Holiday Sing-Along. The station also produces Visiones, a weekly segment about Hispanic culture, that also airs in Spanish on sister Telemundo station WNJU, and Positively Black, a weekly segment about African-American culture.\nAs of March 2025, WNBC is one of nine NBC-owned stations that distributes programming either nationally and/or regionally (along with KNTV, KNBC, KNSD, WCAU, WVIT, WTVJ, WMAQ-TV and KXAS-TV).\n\n\nSports programming\nThrough NBC's coverage of the National Football League, WNBC has televised two Super Bowl championships won by New York teams: the Jets' upset victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, and the Giants' win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. WNBC served as the official flagship carrier of Giants preseason football games until 2023 when WNYW took over the following season.  WNBC is the New York area station for NBC's national broadcasts of Sunday Night Football featuring either one of the two teams. The station also served as the default home station of the Jets from 1965 (when NBC became the broadcaster for the American Football League of which the Jets were then a part) until 1997, when WCBS-TV became the new broadcast rightsholder (through CBS) of what was by now the American Football Conference; it also aired occasional New York Giants games from 1970 (with the completion of the AFL/NFL merger) to 1997; these were limited to home interconference contests.\nEven as the station became the first to broadcast Major League Baseball games in 1939 with the pioneer broadcast being that of an August 26 doubleheader at Ebbets Field between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, it does not have any broadcasts today. They are currently on WNYW and WPIX during the season. Baseball broadcasts were expected to return to the station in 2020 as part of the network-wide coverage of the baseball events of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with on-air news updates during the duration of the event; however, the games were postponed to 2021 due to the global effects of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. The station has aired numerous New York Mets (since 1962) and New York Yankees games (and before 1957, games of the Dodgers and Giants) as part of MLB's broadcast contract with NBC from 1947 to 1989, The Baseball Network in 1995, and playoff-only coverage from 1996 to 2000. The station has aired 18 of the Yankees' World Series appearances (12 of which the team won), and three Mets World Series appearances (two of which the Mets won).\nAs the network's flagship station, per its NHL on NBC obligations (which ended in 2021), it broadcast several Stanley Cup playoff games all the way to the Cup Finals, in addition to the NHL Game of the Week (if the Rangers, Islanders or New Jersey Devils were playing). It would be only in 2012 when it aired the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the network-wide coverage when the Devils lost out to the Los Angeles Kings. Also, the station aired the 2014 Cup Finals, where the Rangers also lost to the Kings.\nFrom 1990 to 2002, the station aired New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets games through the NBA on NBC; this included the Knicks' appearances in the 1994 and 1999 NBA Finals, as well as the Nets' appearance in the 2002 NBA Finals.\n\n\nNews operation\nFrom the late 1960s through the 1980s, WNBC was involved in a fierce three-way battle with WCBS-TV and WABC-TV for the top spot in the New York television ratings. This continued during a lean period for NBC as a whole. WNBC's hallmark over the years has been strong coverage of breaking stories, the combination of straight news items and those with light-hearted and/or entertainment elements (as could be seen in such programs as Live at Five and Today in New York), and the generally low turnover of their on-air talent. Many of WNBC's personalities have been at the station for over 20 years. For instance, Chuck Scarborough has served as the station's lead anchor since the debut of NewsCenter 4 on April 29, 1974. Scarborough represents one half of the longest-serving anchor duo in New York television history, the other half being Sue Simmons, who anchored the 11 p.m. report with Scarborough from 1980 to 2012. Len Berman served as lead sports anchor for 27 years, from 1982 to 2009. Senior correspondent Gabe Pressman was at the station from 1956 until his death in 2017, save for a seven-year stint (from 1972 to 1979) at WNEW-TV (now WNYW).\nWNBC-TV was the first station on the East Coast to air a two-hour nightly newscast, and the first major-market station in the country to find success in airing a 5 p.m. report, when NewsCenter 4 (a format created for WNBC by pioneering news executive Lee Hanna) was introduced in 1974, a time when channel 4 ran a distant third in the city's local news ratings. The NewsCenter format debuted with a futuristic set described by Hanna as being \"the most modern, electronically complicated and sophisticated\" facility in the country at that time. A direct, unique style of presenting the news was also implemented, incorporating hard news reports with separate segments devoted to consumer reports, features, and a dedicated weather desk. Hanna declared at the outset, \"there will be no happy talk [...] we're not in business to be comedians\", a veiled reference to the style of WABC's highly-successful Eyewitness News format. The NewsCenter format became a major success in New York, and NBC subsequently brought it to their owned-and-operated stations in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.\nThe NewsCenter4 title was kept by WNBC until September 1, 1980, when the newscasts were renamed News 4 New York. Shortly before then the 5 p.m. program was renamed Live at Five, and the hour was reformatted from a straight news program to a mix of hard news and celebrity interviews, a style that would become known as infotainment. Live at Five eventually became the most-successful local program in New York City, a feat that resulted in landing the show's hosts on the cover of New York magazine. For most of the time during the News 4 New York era of the 1980s and early 1990s, WNBC-TV used various music cues created by Scott Schreer. His theme for News 4 New York was based on a synthesized version of the NBC chimes, with a graphics package featuring a lightning bolt striking its logo from 1980 to 1990, a fancy die-cut \"4\".\nIn 1992, the station began calling itself 4 New York and the campaign song, written by Edd Kalehoff, was quickly adopted as the theme for the newscast. The theme was briefly brought back after the September 11 attacks in 2001. In 1995, after the station rebranded itself as \"NBC 4\" and its newscasts as NewsChannel 4, Kalehoff wrote a new theme called \"NBC Stations\" featuring the aforementioned NBC chimes. It remained in use for eight years, along with a graphics package using a simple red line for the lower thirds.\nThe 2003 graphics package was created by Emmy Award-winner Randy Pyburn of Pyburn Films. Pyburn has produced several promotions for the station and the now-defunct Jane's New York specials hosted by former WNBC reporter Jane Hanson. The graphics package was also used on other NBC stations. The music was written by Rampage Music and featured a brassy version of the NBC chimes, and lower thirds featured a shimmering peacock. In March 2008, concurrent with the restoration of the 4 New York branding, the newscasts began to be called News 4 New York once more.\nMany WNBC personalities have appeared, and have also moved up to the NBC network, including: Marv Albert, Len Berman, Contessa Brewer, Chris Cimino, Fran Charles, Darlene Rodriguez, Maurice DuBois, Michael Gargiulo, Tony Guida, Jim Hartz, Janice Huff, Matt Lauer, Tom Llamas, Dave Price, Al Roker, Scarborough, and Tom Snyder. In the past, Albert, Berman, Brewer, Charles, Cimino, DuBois, Guida, Hartz, Lauer, Llamas, Roker, Scarborough, and Snyder have worked at WNBC and NBC at the same time. Price, Rodriguez, Huff, and Gargiulo currently work for both. One monthly feature was Berman's Spanning the World, a reel of odd and interesting sports highlights from the past month, including a recorded introduction and closing by NBC staff announcer Don Pardo. The segment aired monthly on Today.\nWhen Simmons joined the station in early 1980, she was paired with Scarborough on both the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts. However, for most of the time until 2005, WNBC's weeknight anchor rotation had Simmons and another male anchor (including Jack Cafferty, Guida, Lauer, and briefly Scarborough) at 5 pm; Scarborough and various anchors (John Hambrick, Pat Harper, and Michele Marsh among them) at 6 pm; and Scarborough and Simmons together at 11 pm. That changed in 2005 as Live at Five anchor Jim Rosenfield jumped back to WCBS-TV, where he had once been the noon and 5 p.m. anchor and took on the role as lead anchor for their 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts.\nFormer reporter Perri Peltz returned to WNBC to co-anchor Live at Five with Simmons, making New York City one of the few large markets with two female anchors on an evening newscast. The move harkened back to three decades earlier, when the station paired Pia Lindström with Melba Tolliver on its 5 p.m. news hour, creating one of the first all-female anchor teams on a major-market American television station. It was short-lived as Simmons and Peltz were both displaced from Live at Five because of changes in the station's early evening news lineup that went into effect on March 12, 2007: David Ushery and Lynda Baquero became co-anchors of a truncated, 30-minute-long Live at Five broadcast, followed by Peltz with a 30-minute, soft-news program, News 4 You. Simmons was moved to co-anchor at 6 p.m. with Scarborough. On September 13, 2006, WNBC became the first New York City television station to broadcast its newscasts in high definition. On May 5, 2007, WNBC brought back its popular campaign song \"We're 4 New York\", composed by Kalehoff, after nearly six years off air (after the September 11, 2001, attacks).\nIn early autumn 2007, additional changes were brought to WNBC's early-evening lineup. On September 10, the station moved the newsmagazine series Extra to 5 pm, and cancelled Live at Five. News 4 You remained at 5:30 pm, but was replaced on October 15, 2007, with a traditional newscast, anchored by Simmons and Michael Gargiulo. The 6 p.m. newscast became anchored by Ushery and Baquero, and New York Nightly News, a new half-hour newscast with Scarborough as sole anchor, debuted at 7 p.m.\nThese changes did not lead to an increase in WNBC's ratings in the November 2007 sweeps period, partially because of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. The most shocking of WNBC's ratings decreases was its 11 p.m. newscast, which fell to third place, behind WCBS and WABC. WNBC altered its 5–6 p.m. hour on January 2, 2008, swapping the half-hour news at 5:30 p.m. with Extra. On March 9, 2009, with the launch of New York Nonstop on digital subchannel 4.2, New York Nightly News was moved to the subchannel and expanded to one hour, while Extra was moved back to 7 p.m. and a full hour of news returned to the 5 p.m. hour. Still, WNBC's ratings struggled: during the March 2009 sweeps period, its newscasts were a distant third in all-time slots, except during the weekday mornings, where it remained in second.\n\nOn May 7, 2008, NBC Universal announced plans for a major restructuring of WNBC's news department. The centerpiece of the restructuring was the creation of a 24-hour all-news channel on WNBC's second digital subchannel (4.2). Channel 4's news operations were revamped and melded into the all-news channel, which serves as a \"content center\" for the station's various local distribution platforms. The digital news channel was launched on March 9, 2009. In the fall of 2008, WNBC started beta-testing a new website which was apparently poised to be one of the major platforms for the content center. On November 17, 2008, WNBC moved its news studio from Studio 6B to 7E and rolled out a new set design, graphics package, and theme song written by veteran TV composer Frank Gari. This move came after months of planning the new content newsroom with its 24-hour news digital subchannel. It was also their debut of the updated 4 New York logo, using letters in Media Gothic Bold font and the \"New York\" wording was switched from its script font to All caps font, which is designed by Brit Redden of Modal Pictures.\nOn June 16, 2009, WNBC announced that its 5 p.m. newscast would be replaced in September by a one-hour daily lifestyle and entertainment show by LXTV entitled LX New York. After this change, WNBC, with only three hours per day of local news, had the shortest airtime devoted to local news of any \"big three\" network-owned station. In the fall of 2009, WNBC began sharing its news helicopter with Fox owned-and-operated WNYW (channel 5) as part of a Local News Service agreement. The SkyFox HD helicopter operated by WNYW when used by WNBC was called \"Chopper 4\" on-air. This agreement ended in 2012, with WNBC returning to use its own helicopter when the contract expired. In the summer of 2010, The Debrief with David Ushery began to air on Sunday at noon on WNBC after launching on New York Nonstop; it now airs Sunday mornings at 5:30 a.m.\nLX New York was renamed to New York Live on May 26, 2011. The program was set to move to 3 p.m. on September 12, 2011; at that time, WNBC would resume airing a 5 p.m. newscast. However, due to Hurricane Irene, the 5 p.m. newscast's start date was moved up to August 29, 2011, with New York Live moving to its new 3 p.m. slot then. On November 18, 2011, WNBC launched a noon newscast that replaced The Rundown with Russell and Llamas as the anchors.\nIn December 2011, WNBC struck a news partnership with non-profit news-reporting organization ProPublica. The organization, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2010, already has partnerships with several media outlets including USA Today, Reader's Digest, HuffPost and Businessweek. However, ProPublica's reports are incorporated across all NBC O&O stations, not just WNBC. This is part of larger efforts for NBCUniversal's television stations to partner with nonprofit news organizations following its acquisition by Comcast.\nWNBC relocated from Studio 7E to Studio 3C (the studio previously used by NBC Nightly News, which now originates from Studio 3B) on April 21, 2012. Channel 4 also updated its graphics and switched to the \"L.A. Groove\" theme that has been in use by sister station KNBC. On June 15, 2012, Sue Simmons left WNBC as her contract with the station was not renewed. In January 2013, the station expanded its Sunday 11 p.m. newscasts to one hour, possibly to compete with WABC which expanded its late news in January 2012.\nOn June 6, 2016, WNBC revamped its website. On June 11, 2016, beginning with the 11 p.m. newscast, its news graphics were also changed and it began using Look N graphics from NBC Artworks, becoming the first NBC-owned station to use the new graphics that were rolled out to other NBC-owned stations around this time. On June 13 of the same year, the station debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, thus becoming the second New York television station to expand its newscasts to that time period after WABC-TV (which had their 4 p.m. newscasts since May 2011).\nOn October 10, 2016, WNBC relocated from studio 3C to studio 3K (the studio also used by Dateline NBC and sister cable network MSNBC), which bears similarities to the previous set in 3C, albeit a lot larger in size and with several changes (i.e. a new weather center area, a touchscreen display similar to Today's Orange Room, an LED wall, and a work space and presentation pod). In fall 2016, WNBC entered a content-sharing agreement with WOR to include news and weather content supplied by the station; WNBC's weather content is also heard on other iHeartMedia radio stations throughout the New York metropolitan area. On December 21, 2016, WNBC announced that it would be launching a new S band weather radar system, called Storm Tracker 4, which is planned to launch in winter 2017. On December 27, 2016, the station announced it would move the midday newscast to 11 a.m. (the first and only 11 a.m. midday newscast in the New York media market), and its locally produced lifestyle/entertainment program New York Live to 11:30 a.m. beginning January 16, 2017. As part of the changes of the daytime lineup at the station, it would move Days of Our Lives from the network's default Eastern Time Zone slot of 1 p.m. to the early time slot of 12 pm, followed by Access Hollywood Live at 1 pm.\nOn June 30, 2017, it was announced that Chuck Scarborough would step down as the anchor of the 11 p.m. newscast on July 14 but would continue to anchor the 6 p.m. newscast. 4 p.m. anchor Stefan Holt, whose father Lester presides over NBC Nightly News down the hall from Studio 3K, assumed duties for the late newscast beginning July 17.\nOn July 31, 2017, the station expanded its morning newscast Today in New York by a half an hour, beginning at 4 a.m. for a total of three hours; this is the first 4 a.m. newscast in the New York media market since WPIX had one from 2010 to 2014. Six days later on August 6, 2017, the Sunday edition of the morning newscast had an extra half-hour added after 9:30 am; the 6–8 a.m. portion remained unchanged. As part of the changes to the station's Sunday morning lineup, Sunday Today with Willie Geist was moved to the network's recommended time of 8 a.m. followed by the LXTV-produced program Open House NYC at 9 a.m. Meet the Press remained at 10:30 am.\nIn November 2017, WNBC opened the San Juan news bureau led by bilingual reporter Julio \"Gaby\" Acevedo; the bureau delivers daily English and Spanish-language news and updates for the station and its sister station WNJU as well as all NBC and Telemundo-owned stations across the country; the new bureau operated through February 2018.\nOn August 19, 2020, it was announced that after four years with the station, Stefan Holt would be leaving to rejoin Chicago sister station WMAQ-TV to anchor its 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscasts, beginning in October. On August 31, 2020, the station announced that 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. news anchor David Ushery would succeed Holt on the 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, beginning October 12, 2020; however, due to Holt's early departure on September 25, the official start date was moved up to September 28. Meanwhile, weekend anchor Adam Kuperstein succeeded Ushery in the 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. newscasts.\nOn June 7, 2021, WNBC started airing a new half-hour weekday 7 p.m. newscast.\nIn January 2022, WNBC announced plans to launch a new FAST channel called \"NBC New York News\"; this announcement follows the simultaneous rollout of streaming news channels from its sister stations in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and Boston on January 20. The channel was launched on March 17, 2022. In 2024, WNBC launched an exclusive 7 a.m. newscast on the channel.\nIn the summer of 2022, WNBC indicated it would return to Studio 3B, which will be split with WNJU once that station relocates operations to Rockefeller Center.\n\n\nNotable current on-air staff\n\nAnchors\nPat Battle (also reporter)\nMichael Gargiulo\nDarlene Rodriguez\nDavid Ushery\nWeather\nJanice Huff (Member, AMS) – chief meteorologist\nMaria LaRosa (Member, AMS) – meteorologist\nRaphael Miranda (AMS Seal of Approval) – meteorologist\nDave Price\nSports team\nBruce Beck – sports director; also host of Sports Final with Bruce Beck\nReporters\n\n\nNotable alumni\n\n\nControversies and incidents\n\n\nChopper 4 helicopter crashes\n1998 saw the introduction of a brand-new Chopper 4, a Eurocopter EC135 that the station heavily promoted. The new chopper ended up crashing into the Passaic River near Harrison and Newark, New Jersey on December 3, 1998; reporter Kai Simonsen and pilot Terry Hawes survived.\nHence, the older model, a Eurocopter AS350, was returned to service and remained until May 4, 2004, when it crashed while covering a shooting in Brooklyn. Reporter Andrew Torres, pilot Russ Cowry and pilot trainee Hassan Taan survived the crash and were taken to area hospitals. The crash occurred at about 6:30 p.m. as the crew was preparing for a live report from the scene of a shooting in East Flatbush. Before the cut-in, Chopper 4 appeared to begin a steep nosedive. WABC's own helicopter captured the initial nosedive and the chopper's subsequent tailspin until crashing into a rooftop.\n\n\n2008 weeknight infomercial issue\nOn March 25, 2008, WNBC carried a paid program leading into NBC's Tuesday night prime time and after the 7 p.m. newscast for mortgage lender Lend America, replacing that night's Access Hollywood. Several 'Big Four' stations throughout the United States had carried paid programs leading into prime time in a period during the Great Recession to some varied controversy (and often do to this day during Saturday evenings, a little-trafficked time period with no complaint), but the one airing in New York of the Lend America infomercial, which was hosted by ex-WNBC reporter Joe Avellar, attracted massive criticism from viewers and local media critics, especially involving Avellar's role as host and Lend America's part in the housing crisis, and to a much lesser extent, preemption of regular weeknight programming. Earning the station $130,000 for the 28+1⁄2-minute program, it generated low ratings and led to a quick fallout, with general manager Frank Comerford resigning his position from the station for approving the airtime sale. Although Lend America expressed interest in buying more early access time on the station, WNBC has never again carried a paid program before prime time on weeknights.\n\n\nSue Simmons \"F-bomb\" incident\nOn May 12, 2008, a prime time promo for that night's 11 p.m. newscast was thought by anchor Sue Simmons to be on tape for later broadcast but was actually going out live. After completing the first portion of the tease, Simmons noticed co-anchor Chuck Scarborough distracted with something on his on-desk laptop, and thinking the take would be trashed and another take would be shot for air, shouted \"The fuck are you doing?\" towards him in a manner seemingly meant as an inside joke among colleagues, while YouTube b-roll of a cruise ship departing Manhattan continued to roll before the promo's end.\nLater during the actual newscast, Simmons profusely apologized for the live outburst, saying, \"I have to acknowledge an unfortunate incident. I used a word that many people find offensive. It was a mistake I made and I'm truly sorry.\" No further comment was made by the station or Simmons about the incident.\nLate Show with David Letterman used clips from the promo in several sketches mocking the incident.\n\n\nI-Team Super Bowl promo editing controversy\nOn February 5, 2012, the station premiered the I-Team promo during NBC Sports' coverage of Super Bowl XLVI featuring former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly, but later on the day after the Super Bowl, they edited out Kelly's clip due to some complaints from rival WCBS-TV. However, the spokesman declined to comment, and criticisms arose from WABC-TV, WNYW, and WPIX, the station's rivals. Station general manager Michael Jack said in the statement that \"our investigative team is among the most experienced in the industry, and to suggest that the station won't cover the NYPD fairly, accurately and with balance simply because the commissioner appeared in a station promotional spot is simply not true\". After the promo was edited out at the station, Lynda Baquero resigned from the investigative team but continued as a reporter for the station. She was replaced by Pei-Sze Cheng and Jonathan Vigliotti (though Vigliotti later left for WCBS-TV).\n\n\nTweet regarding anti-Semitic violence\nOn January 2, 2020, WNBC posted a tweet on its Twitter account linking to an Associated Press wire article, syndicated to its website, on the recent wave of anti-Semitic violence in the United States, coming three weeks after a targeted shooting at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey. The text of the message, likely automatically generated by the station's content management system, featured one of three bullet points summarizing the article as a whole, and stated that Orthodox Jews moving from the core of New York and New Jersey and into their own self-established communities on the fringe of the Tri-State area due to gentrification was a reason for an increase of violent anti-Semitic attacks in the broader region;\n\n\"With the expansion of Orthodox communities outside NYC has come civic sparring, and some fear the recent violence may be an outgrowth of that conflict\"\nWNBC's headline, and its inclusion in the tweet, was met with backlash from Jewish groups and people, including the progressive Zionist group Zioness and the Republican Jewish Coalition, which called out the station for \"blaming the Orthodox community for the attacks\". Others prominent in the community also questioned the message, including Bari Weiss, former New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, and The Forward's Batya Ungar-Sargon. The station later apologized for the original headline, deleted the original tweet, and then re-sent the article tweet with an edited headline.\n\n\nTechnical information and subchannels\n\nWNJU and WNBC transmit using WNJU's spectrum from an antenna atop One World Trade Center. The stations' signals are multiplexed:\n\nOn December 20, 2012, WNBC and other NBC-owned stations began carrying Cozi TV. It replaced NBC (New York) Nonstop, which had been carried on digital subchannel 4.2 since 2009.\n\n\nSee also\n\nChannel 4 virtual TV stations in the United States\nChannel 35 digital TV stations in the United States\nEarly television stations\nList of television stations in New York (by channel number)\nList of television stations in New York (by region)\nMedia in New York City\nNew Yorkers in journalism\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\n\"History Cards for WNBC\".

    "text": "Anstey's Building is an art deco building in the city of Johannesburg. The building took its name from the original owner of the building, Norman Anstey, founder of one of the best known department stores in the city (and mayor from 1913 to 1915). The Norman Anstey and Company department store was housed in the four-storey podium of the building, which features a curved facade to address the street corner.\n\n\nHistory\nThis is the third Anstey's building. The first was demolished, and the second is still standing, directly across the road on the corner of Kerk and Joubert Streets.\nAnstey's Building was designed by architectural firm Emley & Williamson and was built in 1935, completed in 1937. It is situated in stand 118/9/20 on the corner of Joubert and Jeppe Streets in Johannesburg. Standing 20 storeys high, the building is one of Johannesburg's landmark high-rise buildings from the Art Deco era.\n\n\nRecent history\nThe building faced demolition in 1989 but was saved by the developer's architect who refused to apply for demolition. A Preservation Trust was established, owning the ground floor podium, and the flats above were sold on sectional title. The refurbishment of Anstey's commenced in January 1994 under the direction of the architect Denzil Hersch. The building has a diverse demographic and it has become a popular place for young middle-class people to live in town. The building is also home to a medical centre, a creche and also the Urban Arts Platform, an initiative to encourage city residents to engage in arts of all forms.\nThe building is currently undergoing refurbishment and restoration under the guidance of architect Brian Kent McKechnie. The project includes the renovation of public areas and the ground floor Art Deco lobby. The exterior renovation and restoration will see Anstey's painted grey by 2017.\n\n\nDescription\nThe building is designed in a dramatic ziggurat style, recessing the top from the street. The building consists of two stepped wings, set at right angles to each other, with corner flats featuring bay window balconies.\nThe stepped, right angle design necessitated by the 59 degrees bylaw had resulted in the beautiful large terraces for which Anstey's was well known, while the cylindrical glazed windows at the re-entrant level had provided interesting, unusual detail.\nConstructed in reinforced concrete, Anstey's Building features Crittal-Hope steel windows and doors. Decorative bronze and chrome grilles were fabricated by Frederick Sage & Co (SA) Ltd. The building was painted with ‘Snowcem’ paint in the early 1950s.\nThe Anstey's department store featured large plate glass windows to the ground floor street frontage, and their window displays were renowned. Internally, the building was designed to have a minimal number of structural pillars so as to provide good views through the store. The interior featured high quality parquet flooring, traditional timber doors and timber detailing such as picture rails.\n\n\nHeritage Status\nThe Anstey's Building is a provincial heritage site and is historically and culturally significant for the following reasons:\n\nAnstey's Building is a good example of Art Deco architecture in Johannesburg\nAnstey's Building is one of the older high rise buildings in the city\nAnstey's Building is associated with the architectural firm of Emley & Williamson\nAnstey's Building is associated with The Norman Anstey and Company department store\nIt is a landmark building in Johannesburg\nIt is related to Manners Mansions directly across the road and was designed by the same architect\n\n\nReferences",

    "title": "French battleship Gaulois",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=13758486",
    "text": "Gaulois was one of three Charlemagne-class pre-dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy (Marine Nationale) in the mid-1890s. Completed in 1899, she spent most of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron (Escadre de la Méditerranée). The ship accidentally rammed two other French warships early in her career, although neither was seriously damaged, nor was Gaulois.\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Gaulois escorted troop convoys from French North Africa to France for a month and a half. She was ordered to the Dardanelles in November 1914 to guard against a sortie into the Mediterranean by the ex-German battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim. In 1915, Gaulois joined British ships in bombarding Ottoman fortifications. She was badly damaged during one such bombardment in March and had to beach herself to avoid sinking. She was refloated and sent to Toulon for permanent repairs. Gaulois returned to the Dardanelles and covered the Allied evacuation in January 1916. She was en route to the Dardanelles after a refit in France when she was torpedoed and sunk on 27 December by a German submarine; four crewmen were lost.\n\n\nDesign and description\nThe Charlemagne-class ships were smaller versions of the preceding Bouvet, albeit with an improved armament. They were 117.7 metres (386 ft 2 in) long overall and had a beam of 20.26 metres (66 ft 6 in). At deep load, the ships had a draught of 7.4 metres (24 ft 3 in) forward and 8.4 metres (27 ft 7 in) aft. They displaced 11,260 tonnes (11,080 long tons) normally, and 11,415 tonnes (11,235 long tons) at deep load. When serving as flagships, their crew numbered 750 men, but had 32 officers and 660 ratings as private ships. The ships were powered by three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers. These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce 14,200 metric horsepower (10,444 kW; 14,006 ihp) to give the Charlemagne class a speed of 17 knots (31 km/h; 20 mph). During her sea trials, Gaulois reached a top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) from 14,220 metric horsepower (10,459 kW; 14,025 ihp). The ships carried enough coal to give them a range of 3,776 nautical miles (6,993 km; 4,345 mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).\nThe Charlemagnes carried their main battery of four Canon de 305 mm (12 in) Modèle 1893 guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of ten Canon de 138.6 mm (5.5 in) Modèle 1893 guns, eight of which were mounted in individual casemates and the remaining pair in shielded mounts on the forecastle deck amidships. They also carried eight Canon de 100 mm (3.9 in) Modèle 1893 guns in open mounts on the superstructure. The ships' anti-torpedo boat defences consisted of twenty Canon de 47 mm (1.9 in) Modèle 1885 and two 37 mm (1.5 in) Maxim guns, fitted in platforms on both masts, on the superstructure, and in casemates in the hull. The ships mounted four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside, one submerged and the other above water. As was common with ships of their generation, they were built with a plough-shaped ram.\nThe Charlemagne-class ships had a complete waterline belt of nickel-steel armour that ranged in thickness from 300 to 400 mm (11.8 to 15.7 in) and was thickest amidships. The armour plates were 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high with the upper 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) above the design waterline and they tapered to a maximum thickness of 150 mm (5.9 in) at their bottom edges. The thicknesses of the bottom edges of the plates gradually reduced to 134 mm (5.3 in) at the bow and 110 mm (4.3 in) at the stern. The gun turrets were protected by 320 mm (12.6 in) of Harvey armour and their barbettes had 270-millimetre (10.6 in) plates of the same type of armour. The main armoured deck was 70 mm (2.8 in) thick and there was a 40-millimetre-thick (1.6 in) splinter deck below it. The conning tower had a 326-millimetre-thick (12.8 in) face and 276 mm (10.9 in) sides.\n\n\nConstruction and career\n\nGaulois, named after the tribes that inhabited France during Roman times, was ordered on 22 January 1895 from the Arsenal de Brest. Her sister ship Charlemagne was being built in the slipway intended for Gaulois so the latter ship's construction was delayed until the former was launched. Gaulois was laid down on 6 January 1896 and launched on 6 October of the same year. She was commissioned (armement définitif) on 15 January 1899. The ship was initially assigned to the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord), but was then assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the Mediterranean Squadron on 30 September, together with Charlemagne.\nThe sisters remained based in Brest until they departed for Toulon on 18 January 1900. The following month, while exercising in the harbour at Hyères, Gaulois accidentally rammed the destroyer Hallebarde, gouging a 4-by-1.5-metre (13.1 by 4.9 ft) hole in the smaller ship. Hallebarde reached Toulon where she was repaired, while the battleship was barely damaged. On 18 July, after combined manoeuvres with the Northern Squadron, the ship participated in a naval review conducted by the President of France, Émile Loubet, at Cherbourg. The following year, Gaulois and the Mediterranean Squadron participated in an international naval review by Loubet in Toulon with ships from Spain, Italy and Russia.\nIn October 1901, the 1st Battleship Division, under the command of Rear-Admiral (contre-amiral) Leonce Caillard, was ordered to proceed to the port of Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, then owned by the Ottoman Empire. After landing two companies of marines that occupied the major ports of the island on 7 November, Sultan Abdul Hamid II agreed to enforce contracts made with French companies and to repay loans made by French banks. The 1st Division departed Lesbos in early December and returned to Toulon. In May 1902, the ship became the flagship of Vice-Admiral (vice-amiral) François Fournier who led a small delegation to celebrate the unveiling of the statue of Comte de Rochambeau in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. On 23 May President Theodore Roosevelt was received aboard and the ship visited New York City and Boston before heading back to France. She made another port visit to Lisbon, Portugal, before arriving back at Toulon on 14 June.\nDuring exercises off Golfe-Juan on 31 January 1903, Gaulois accidentally rammed Bouvet. The latter was barely damaged, but Gaulois lost two armour plates from her bow; both captains were relieved of their commands. Captain (Capitaine de vaisseau) Pierre Le Bris assumed command of Gaulois on 20 March. In April 1904, she was one of the ships that escorted Loubet during his state visit to Italy. Later that year, the ship made port visits in Thessaloniki and Athens, Greece, with the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron. A wireless telegraph was installed aboard Gaulois in December 1905. Together with the battleships Iéna and Bouvet, the ship aided survivors of the April 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Naples, Italy. On 16 September she participated in an international naval review in Marseille, together with British, Spanish and Italian ships.\n\nFor the rest of the decade, she participated in exercises with the Mediterranean Squadron and made several port visits in France and its dependencies. In January 1907, the ships was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division and then to the 4th Battleship Division in July 1908 with her sisters. By 5 January 1909, the 4th Division had been reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron (Escadre de ligne). Gaulois sank the target ship Tempête on 18 March after she had been fired upon by four other battleships. By 5 January 1910 the divisions of the battle squadrons had been renumbered and the 4th Division was now the 1st Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. The squadron was transferred to Brest where it replaced the former Northern Squadron on 27 February. Shortly afterwards, one of Gaulois's torpedoes moderately damaged the bow of the destroyer Fanion while training. On 1 August 1911 the 2nd Battle Squadron was renumbered as the 3rd Battle Squadron and Gaulois participated in a large naval review by President Armand Fallières off Toulon on 4 September. The ship was reassigned to the Mediterranean Squadron on 16 October 1912 and she participated in a naval review by President Raymond Poincaré on 10 June 1913. The 3rd Battle Squadron was dissolved on 11 November 1913 and the ship was assigned to the Complementary Division (Division de complément) together with Bouvet and her sister Saint Louis. In June 1914, the Navy planned to assign Gaulois to the Training Division of the Squadron as of October, but this was cancelled upon the outbreak of war in August.\n\n\nWorld War I\n\nTogether with the older French pre-dreadnoughts, the ship's first mission in the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France. Later in September, her main turrets required repairs in Bizerte, French Tunisia, as the forward turret was having difficulty traversing. Gaulois was ordered to Tenedos Island, not far from the Ottoman Gallipoli Peninsula, in November to guard against a sortie by the ex-German battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim, relieving the battleship Suffren which needed a refit in Toulon. Gaulois became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Émile Guépratte upon her arrival on 15 November. He transferred his flag back to Suffren when she returned on 10 January 1915.\nOn 19 February, Gaulois supported Suffren as the latter ship bombarded Ottoman forts covering the mouth of the Dardanelles. Late in the day, Gaulois bombarded the fort at Orhaniye Tepe on the Asian side of the strait. During the subsequent bombardment on 25 February, the ship anchored some 6,000 metres (6,600 yd) from the Asiatic shore and engaged the forts at Kum Kale and Cape Helles. Their return fire was heavy enough to force Gaulois to up anchor before she could suppress their guns. Later in the day, she closed to within 3,000 metres (3,300 yd) of the forts and engaged them with her secondary armament. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but these did little damage.\nOn 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the Gulf of Saros, at the base of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Ottoman guns defending the Dardanelles while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. Gaulois was hit by a 15-centimetre (5.9 in) shell during this attack that caused little damage as it failed to detonate. Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Ottoman fortifications.\n\nThey returned to the Dardanelles to assist in the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the strait, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment; the first shell struck the quarterdeck, but caused little damage other than deforming the deck. The second shell hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and appeared to do little damage, but it had pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole 7 metres (23 ft) by 22 centimetres (8.7 in) through which water flooded. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and Captain André-Casimir Biard decided to head for the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. He ordered the non-essential crewmen off the ship in case she foundered en route, but managed to reach the islands, escorted by Charlemagne.\nGaulois was refloated on 22 March and departed for Toulon via Malta three days later, escorted by Suffren. They encountered a storm on 27 March off Cape Matapan and the ship began taking on water as the repairs began to leak under the pressure of the storm. She radioed for assistance later that night and the armoured cruiser Jules Ferry and three destroyers arrived several hours later. The ship arrived in the Bay of Navarin the following morning and more repairs were made with the assistance of the crew of the hulked old battleship Marceau. Gaulois arrived without further incident at Toulon on 16 April and entered drydock the following day. The Navy took the opportunity to increase her stability by lightening her masts, removing some armour from the superstructure and conning tower as well as dismounting two 100 mm and six 47 mm guns. The ship was also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges (soufflages) amidships to increase her beam and thus her stability.\nHer repairs were completed by early June and Gaulois departed for the Dardanelles on 8 June. She reached Lemnos on 17 June and relieved Saint Louis on 27 July. The ship anchored 1,000 metres (1,100 yd) off the shore on 11 August to bombard an Ottoman artillery battery at Achi Baba. Splinters from return fire detonated a 100 mm shell and started a small fire, but it was put out without much trouble. On her voyage home, Gaulois ran aground at the harbour entrance and had to unload most of her ammunition before she could be refloated on 21 August. Together with the pre-dreadnought République, the ship covered the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli in January 1916. Badly in need of a refit, she sailed for Brest on 20 July where her captain argued that the range of her main armament needed to be increased by 4,000 metres (4,400 yd) if she was to be considered fit for the battleline. Some thought was given to disarming her and converting her into a barracks ship, but nothing was done before the ship was ordered back to the Eastern Mediterranean on 25 November.\n\n\nFate\n\nBy 27 December, Gaulois had reached the Sea of Crete and was off the southern coast of Greece when she was torpedoed by the German submarine UB-47 at 08:03 despite being escorted by the destroyer Dard and two armed trawlers. The single torpedo hit slightly abaft the mainmast and started uncontrollable flooding below the waterline. It killed two crewmen and another pair drowned as they attempted to abandon ship; the rest of the crew was successfully rescued. The ship capsized at 09:03 and sank eight minutes later off Cape Maleas at 36°15′N 23°42′E in 480–500 metres (1,570–1,640 ft) of water.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\nCampbell, N.J.M.

Built in 1905 to replace a structure dating to the 1790s, it is architecturally reminiscent of mid-19th century rural Maine town halls.  It was used as town hall until 1985, and as a polling place until 2002.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\n\n\nDescription and history\nThe town house is a single-story wood-frame structure, with a front-gable roof and a small entrance portico.  The main (west-facing) facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows.  The entrance portico has a fully pedimented gable front on a simple entablature, and is supported by square posts decorated with sawn brackets.  Above the entry in the main gable end are a pair of narrower sash windows.  The building is four bays deep, and has two small additions in the rear.  One houses a pair of primitive toilets, and the other, a rectangular brick structure, houses a vault.\nThe interior of the town house's main block consists of a single large chamber, with doors at the east end leading to the toilets and vault.  The interior finish is varnished pine on the walls and ceiling, and fir flooring.  The wall finish is vertically laid wainscoting below the windows, and horizontal above the chair rail.  A simple, low rail-and-style fence separates a holding area for voting booths, and there is a raised platform for the selectmen's table near the doorway to the vault.  The building was electrified in 1937, retaining its original fixtures, and the vault was provided in 1935 by the Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Company of Cincinnati, Ohio.\nOtisfield's first town hall was in the style of a colonial meeting house, used for both religious and civic purposes, and was built c. 1795.  In 1838 the local congregation built a new meetinghouse for its use, and the town, rather than constructing a new building for civic use, moved the old structure a short way down the hill.  By the early 20th century, that building was failing, and the town built this structure on the old one's site.  It was used not just for town functions, but was also rented out for private events.  It housed Otisfield's town meetings until 1985, and was used as a polling place until 2002.\n\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Oxford County, Maine\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Hilkiah (Hebrew: חִלְקִיָּה(וּ), romanized: Ḥilqiyyā(hu), lit. 'my portion is Yahweh') was a Kohen (an Israelite priest) at the time of King Josiah (reigned c. 641–609 BCE).\n\n\nBiblical account\nHis name is mentioned in II Kings. He was the High Priest and is known for finding a lost copy of the Book of the Law at the Temple in Jerusalem at the time that King Josiah commanded that Solomon's Temple be refurbished according to 2 Kings 22:8. His preaching may have helped spur Josiah to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh, God of Israel.\nHilkiah may have been the same Hilkiah who was the father of Jeremiah of Libnah. As such, he would have lived in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, and was the father of an influential family in the Kingdom of Judah. However, it is possible that Jeremiah was the son of a different man named Hilkiah because this is not mentioned in genealogies recorded in the Book of Chronicles.\nHilkiah is attested in extrabiblical sources by the clay bulla naming a Hilkiah as the father of an Azariah and by the seal reading \"Hanan son of Hilkiah the priest.\"\n\n\nThe Book of the Law\nAccording to an account in 2 Kings (chapter 22) and 2 Chronicles (chapter 34), Hilkiah was High Priest at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah of Judah (639–609 BC) and the discoverer of \"the Book of the Law\" in the Temple in the 18th year of Josiah's reign (622 BC). Scholars almost universally agree that the book Hilkiah found was the Book of Deuteronomy.\n\n\nExtra-biblical sources\nHilkiah's name is mentioned on a seal ring and a bulla. The first object where his name is mentioned is a seal ring found in 1980. On the seal is a three-line inscription, in reverse letters, as is usual, so that the letters will read properly when impressed in a lump of clay. The script incised in the seal is what scholars call paleo-Hebrew, used by the Israelites before the Babylonian captivity, before the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The inscription reads: \"(Belonging) to Hanan, son (of) Hilkiah the priest\". It begins with the Hebrew letter lamed, meaning \"belonging to\", indicating the seal's ownership. Then the name of the seal's owner, the name of his father and the function of the seal's owner.\nThe second object is a bulla found in Jerusalem in 1982. A bulla was used to seal a document. The document's owner took a lump of soft clay; he affixed the clay to the string binding the document and then stamped it with his seal. This bulla was one of the fifty-one bullae discovered during excavations in the eastern slope of Jerusalem in a dated archaeological context. This collection of bullae was found in level 10, dated between Josiah's rule and the destruction of the city by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC, and more precisely from the highest ground of the building (level 10B). This level was destroyed by the final burning which baked the bullae and provided a better conservation. On one bulla is a two-line inscription, in paleo-Hebrew script as on the seal. The inscription reads: \"(Belonging) to Azaryah, son (of) Hilkiah\". The inscription indicates the name of the seal's owner and the name of his father, but not his function.\n\n\nAzariah and Hanan, sons of Hilkiah\nAzaryah and Hanan, sons of Hilkiah, both held a sacerdotal function in the Temple of Jerusalem. In the late roster of high priests referred to in 1 Chronicles (6:13, 9:11), Azaryah IV was the successor of Hilkiah in this function and probably his eldest son, while his other son, Hanan, served by his side as a priest. The seals of the two brothers Hanan and Azaryah, engraved by the same master engraver, belong to what has been called the \"generation of sons\" and date, not from Josiah's reign but from one of his successors' (before 586). The seal of Azaryah was made before he became high priest because his function is not mentioned on it. The seal of Hanan and the bulla of Azaryah, two sons of the high priest Hilkiah, represent testimonies of the last years of Solomon's Temple, the first Temple of Jerusalem, before its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586.\n\n\nPatrilineal Ancestry\nAs per 1 Chronicles chapter 6\n\n\nSee also\nList of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources\nEliakim, son of Hilkiah\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBiblical Archaeology Society Online Archive",

    "text": "Václav Jelínek (23 August 1944 – 8 February 2022) was a Cold War era spy for Communist Czechoslovakia, who worked in London under the assumed identity of Erwin van Haarlem.\n\n\nEarly life\nJelínek was born on 23 August 1944 in Modřany near Prague (now part of the city).\nThe real Erwin van Haarlem was born on 22 August 1944, the son of Johanna van Haarlem, a woman of Dutch and Jewish ancestry who had been raped by Gregor Kulig, a Nazi  soldier with whom she had been fraternising. Soon after Erwin's birth, by which time Kulig had already been killed in action, he was placed for adoption in Holešovice, Prague. He was later listed in the Netherlands as a missing person.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter compulsory national service, Jelínek became a sergeant, working for the Ministry of the Interior. He was recruited by the Czechoslovak secret police, the Státní bezpečnost (StB). In 1967 Václav Jelínek was transferred from the V. Directorate (Protection of State and Government Officials) to the I. Directorate of the Security Corps. Shortly afterwards, his special training to become a member of the illegal intelligence started. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. \nHe adopted van Haarlem's identity and moved to London in June 1975, using a genuine Dutch passport, illicitly obtained in van Haarlem's name. He obtained work at the Hilton Hotel restaurant on Park Lane, and began spying on the United Kingdom and United States, for the StB and for the KGB, their equivalent in the Soviet Union. His handler was Lieutenant colonel Josef Kafka. Jelínek was decorated by the KGB on 25 March 1986. Although he posed as a Dutch national, he never lived in the Netherlands.\nWhen Johanna van Haarlem contacted him, in 1977, believing him to be her real son, he was ordered to play along, in order not to blow his cover, and did so, even going so far as to visit her family in Holland. As a result of this deception, she was not reunited with her real son until February 1992.\n\n\nArrest and trial\nEventually, Jelínek tired of working as a waiter, and, with funding from the StB, bought a flat at Silver Birch Close in Friern Barnet, North London and set up as an art dealer. He was eventually arrested in the flat on 22 April 1988, while in the process of receiving coded messages by radio. His trial for espionage at London's Old Bailey opened on 6 February 1989 and was the first trial of a spy in the United Kingdom since 1961. A Metropolitan Police officer said he was \"probably the first person to be tried at the Old Bailey under an alias\". Among those to testify against him was Stella Rimington, using the alias \"Miss J\". The jury returned a guilty verdict after just 45 minutes deliberation, and on 3 March 1989 he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. He was subsequently held at HM Prison Parkhurst.  While he was in Parkhurst, the 1989 Velvet Revolution saw the overthrow of communism in Czechoslovakia. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Following an unsuccessful escape attempt and a period on hunger strike, as well as lobbying on his behalf by Czech diplomats, Jelínek was freed on 5 April 1993 and deported to the Czech Republic.\n\n\nLife after release\nIn 2006, VPRO, a radio station in the Netherlands, ran a two-part programme about van Haarlem, called Het Spoor Terug (The Trail Back). His memoirs, written up by Jaroslav Kmenta were published in Czech in 2010, under the title Český špion Erwin van Haarlem.\nAs of 2016, Jelínek was living in Prague.\n\n\nBooks\nKmenta, Jaroslav (2010).

    "text": "On the Edge of the Sea is a 1992 children's book written by Betty Paraskevas and illustrated by Michael Paraskevas. Using rhymes and acrylic paintings, the book describes a boy's dream of living in a sand castle by the sea.\n\n\nPlot\nIn the book, a boy narrates his dream of living in a sand castle on the shore. He begins his day by watching the sun rise and greeting his friends who have come to spend the day at the beach. They relax under the sun, play in the waves, and fly kites, while he serves them food. He later recalls how beach balls fill up the sky and how an iceberg was approaching the beach. At evening time, everyone leaves while he retreats to his castle. He climbs up the castle to greet the moon but in doing so, a breeze blows his hat away and he trips over the edge and falls; while falling, his mother wakes him up from the dream. At the end, the narrator, as an adult, fondly thinks of the dream and questions why he never found his hat.\n\n\nBackground and style\nMichael Paraskevas worked as an illustrator for magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated. In addition, his beach paintings were displayed at Giraffics Gallery in East Hampton, New York. His mother, Betty, wrote the book's rhyme while using some of his paintings. Newsday's Eileen Swift indicated that the book cover is \"everyone's nostalgic memory of sun, sand, beach and sand castles of long ago\". The events of On the Edge of the Sea are described using acrylic paintings in \"clear\" and \"glowing\" tones and rhyming couplets. Publishers Weekly thought that the style was inspired by \"the joyful naivete of folk art and the whimsy of such surrealists as Rene Magritte\".\n\n\nReception\nSwift said that On the Edge of the Sea is a \"catchy rhyming tale\". Rosemary Black of the New York Daily News called the book's illustrations \"dazzling\" and noted that the book is \"one of the most refreshing ways to soak up the sun\". In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Karen MacPherson wrote that with On the Edge of the Sea, the reader enjoys \"a lovely summer day at the beach\" and that the ending has a \"powerful emotional punch\".\nPublishers Weekly praised Michael's paintings for being \"a genuine pleasure\" and labeled On the Edge of the Sea a \"thoroughly winning debut\". Writing for the School Library Journal, Joy Fleishhacker deemed the poem uninventive and said that the artworks have a \"repetitive layout\". She concluded that since \"neither verbal nor visual images\" are exceptionally memorable, \"this day at the beach\" is \"easy to forget\". Both Publishers Weekly and Fleishhacker were ambivalent towards Betty's lyricism.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "France Charbonneau is a Canadian judge sitting on the Quebec Superior Court. She was appointed on 4 October 2004.\n\n\nCrown Attorney\nCharbonneau began her legal career in the 1970s as a legal secretary and complained that many of the grand seigneur lawyers whom she worked treated her a patronizing sexist manner, which inspired her to go into law school to study the law herself. Charbonneau served as a Crown attorney in Quebec for 26 years, beginning in 1979, and worked at as a legal aid lawyer. As a Crown Attorney, Charbonneau tried over 80 murder cases, including that of Maurice Boucher, and served as a prosecutor on Operation Carcajou. Of her 80 murder cases, she won convictions in 79.\nIn 1998, Charbonneau served as an assistant Crown Attorney aiding the main Crown Attorney, Jacques Dagnais, at the first murder trial of Boucher. Boucher's attorney, Jacques Larochelle, was a well respected Quebec City defense lawyer noted for suave, courtly manner; speaking his French with a strong upper class accent; and his ability to tear apart the credibility of the Crown's witnesses on the stand via a series of sharp, probing questions. Larochelle during his cross-examination of the Crown's star witness, Stéphane Gagné, was able to force Gagné to admit under oath that he had \"no respect for the truth\", a damming statement that he used to argue that Gagné had committed perjury. The trial ended in Boucher's acquittal. Charbonneau stated she was not impressed with Larochelle, saying that he struck her as the type of arrogant, upper class male attorney who had no respect for the abilities of female lawyers and that she found his upper-class accent and mannerisms patronizing and offensive.   \nIn a rare legal move, Charbonneau challenged double jeopardy and on 10 October 2000, the Quebec Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Boucher on the grounds that the judge at the 1998 trial, Justice Jean-Guy Boilard, had been biased towards the defense in his conduct of the trial and in his jury instructions. Charbonneau stated: \"The courtroom is my living room. It's my home\". Charbonneau described herself as a woman very passionate about the law who greatly enjoyed the sparring and arguing promoted by the adversarial English common law system used for criminal cases in Canada, where the courtrooms are the scenes of all-out struggles between the Crown attorneys vs. the defense counsel. \nCharbonneau prosecuted Boucher at his second trial in 2002. Boucher's first trial had ended with Larochelle portraying the Crown's main witness, the hitman Stéphane Gagné as unreliable and prone to perjury. Charbonneau ordered the police to review the evidence, and in turn the police found surveillance tapes that confirmed aspects of Gagné's testimony such as his statement that he was serving as Boucher's bodyguard on 5 December 1997 at a party to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Hells Angels arrival in Canada. The police team had failed to fully examine the photographs, videotapes, wiretaps and phone records before the first trial and instead relied upon civilian analysts to log the evidence. The analysts not being professional policeman and policewomen had missed the significant evidence. Charbonneau also managed to have two police wiretaps of Boucher's cell phone calls that Justice Boilard had excluded as evidence at the 1998 trial introduced at the 2002 trial, which confirmed other aspects of Gagné's testimony.  Gagné stated that an used car dealer, Daniel Foster, had supplied the get-away vehicles used in the murders, and the two cell phones calls made by Boucher to Foster on 4 and 27 June 1997 showed that Boucher had just purchased two used cars that were of the same make and model as the get-away cars used in the murder of Diane Lavigne. Other police tapes confirmed the Hells Angels hierarchy precisely in the manner that Gagné had described, which Charbonneau as evidence at the trial he was telling the truth.  \nCharbonneau was also helped by the fact that Serge Boutin, a leading Hells Angel had cut a deal with the Crown after he killed a police informer Claude Des Serres in February 2000. Boutin's testimony supported and confirmed Gagné's testimony. Boutin had been the boyfriend of the Hells Angel Paul \"Fonfon\" Fontaine who taken part in the second murder of the prison guard Pierre Rondeau alongside Gagné. Nancy Dubê, the teenager furniture store clerk, who testified at the first trial that she had seen Gagné flee from the burning get-away van after the murder of Pierre Rondeau, refused to testify at the second trial. Boucher had entered the store where she worked and starred at her intensely, which left Dubê so utterly terrified that she refused to testify as she stated that Boucher was a killer and a rapist who knew where she lived and worked. Charbonneau who spoken with Dubê in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade to testify stated: \"She almost died of fright\".     \nThe trial began on 26 March 2002. Charbonneau received constant death threats from the Hells Angels during the trial and was under 24-hour police guard. The trial was a bitter clash of wills as the journalists Julian Sher and William Marsden wrote: \"The trial did not go smoothly. It was  four weeks of acid and vinegar. Charbonneau fought for every inch of what she gained. Larochelle tried to rally, but it was clear he was uncomfortable with the Crown's aggression...Not a sarcastic gesture or comment went unpunished. If he signed or shrugged, ooohed or aahed as he cross-examined Gagné, she repeatedly objected to his sarcasm\". Charbonneau stated that Boucher was a killer and she was determined to see him convicted, regarding the trial as a sort of \"war\" against Larochelle and Boucher. The fact that Boucher had been convicted of rape in 1984 made him an especially appalling figure in Charbonneau's eyes.\nCharbonneau had the Hells Angels excluded the courtroom to prevent intimidation of the jury as she noticed at the first trial that jury seemed nervous at the presence of Hells Angels in the courtroom wearing their death's head patches on their biker vests. Charbonnneau did not permit joking in the courtroom and objected every time that Larcholle called Boucher \"Mom\" in an attempt to make him seem lovable, insisting that he be addressed as Monsieur Boucher. Charbonneau stated: \"I am a woman of conviction. I don't play\". Charbonneau regarded Larochelle as an arrogant grand seigneur, the type of lawyer who used to order her to get coffee when she was a legal secretary in the 1970s, and thought he had underestimated her because she was a woman. Charbonneau was convinced that Larochlle would blunder at some point and she carefully observed him, watching for any mistake on his part.\nThe key moment in the trial occurred when Gagné admitted to making mistakes when he gave his confession on 5 December 1997, saying he was tired. Larochelle stated: \"I've seen the video. And you don't look tired.\" Charbonneau seized upon Larchelle's statement to show in rebuttal the videotape of Gagné, saying: \"Let's see the video\". In the videotape, Gagné was clearly exhausted as he had much difficulty staying awake in his chair. For the rest of the trial, Charbonneau put Larochelle on trial in a sense, portraying him as a dishonest lawyer who would tell any lie, no matter how egregious, to secure the acquittal of his client. In her final address to the jury, Charbonneau stated: \"If I had not vigorously objected-an objection which my colleague so delicately described as a fit of hysterics-if I had not insisted that you see the video for yourselves, wouldn't you have been convinced, as Monsieur Larochelle had wanted, that Gagné lied when he said he was tired? Was that the search for the truth, the search for a just and fair trial?\" \nThe jury went into deliberations on 25 April 2002. On 5 May 2002, the jury convicted Boucher of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. At the end of the trial, Larochelle refused to shake hands with Charbonneau and instead walked out of the courtroom. Charbonneau smiled in the courtroom and congratulated her partner Yves Pardis. After the trial, Commander André Bouchard of the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal called Charbonneau to congratulate her. Bouchard recalled: \"She was crying on the phone\".\n\n\nJudge\nOn the recommendation of François Rolland, then Chief Justice of the Court, Premier Jean Charest named Charbonneau to chair an inquiry into corruption in the Quebec construction industry on 9 November 2011. Charbonneau headed the inquiry—now known as the Charbonneau Commission—from 2011 to 2015. There had been a similar inquiry in 1974-1975 headed by Justice Robert Cliche that examined corruption in the construction industry. The Cliche inquiry looked into the corruption surrounding the notoriously corrupt union boss, the Mafia-linked André Desjardins, known as le roi de la construction (\"the King Of Construction\").  \nThe commission started its hearings on 22 May 2012. On 15 June 2012, the former Montreal police chief Jacques Duchesneau testified at the commission that the Transport Minister Sam Hamel was indifferent to allegations of corruption in the construction industry and that 70% of all political contributions in Quebec were illegal. The next witness Charbonneau called was the Italian Mafia expert Valentina Tenti who testified that the Rizzuto family of Montreal was part of a wider international structure involving criminal elements in Italy, the United States and elsewhere. The next expert witness called to the commission was Detective Mike Amato of the York Regional Police who testified that the Mafia had taken control of a number of restaurants, transportation firms, and construction companies in both Ontario and Quebec. Charbonneau summoned as her next witness the former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Joseph D. Pistone, better known by his alias Donnie Brasco, who testified that the Mafia needed corrupt public officials to do its work. Pistone testified that the power of the Rizzuto family was only made possible by the culture of corruption in Quebec. Under his Brasco alias, Pistone had infiltrated the Bonanno family of New York between 1976-1981. The Rizzuto family of Montreal is merely the Canadian branch of the Bonanno family. Pistone never met Vito Rizzuto, the boss of the Rizzuto family, in his undercover work in New York, but he heard much about him.\nOn 27 September 2012, Lino Zambito, the former boss of the construction company Infrabec, testified that he had to pay kickbacks to win construction contracts in Montreal. Zambito stated that 2.5% of his profits had to go to the Rizzuto family, 3% to the governing Union Montreal party, and 1% to Gilles Surprenant, the chief engineer of Montreal. Zambito testified that in his invoices to the city of Montreal he billed for the wages of union workers while in fact employing illegal immigrants who were paid below the minimum wage for their work to order to pocket the difference. On 1 October 2012, Zambito testified that when the city opened up a bidding process to build the l'Acadie interchange, he received a phone call from his rival Tony Accurso, the owner of the Simard-Beaudry Construction company, who told him that he was to have the contract and wanted Zambito to drop out. Zambtio testified to resolve the dispute that he went to see Vito Rizzuto who told him that Accurso would have the contract. Zambito named the city employees Yves Themens, François Thériault, and Michel Paquette as being corrupt. Zambito further stated that city manager, Robert Abdallah and the chairman of the executive committee, Frank Zampino, were also corrupt. On 15 October 2012, Zambito testified that both the Parti libéral du Québec and the Parti Québécois had accepted illegal donations from himself in exchange for tolerating his corruption. \nCharbonneau called as a witness Surprenant who confirmed Zambito's testimony. Surprenant testified that as the chief engineer of Montreal that he had taken $700, 000 in bribes. Surprenant argued that his corruption was justified as he spent much of his bribe money on gambling, which he stated created jobs in the gambling industry. Surprenant testified that construction companies routinely overbilled the city between 20%-50% in excess of the actual work done, and stated that there was nothing wrong with this as corruption in Montreal was an \"open secret\" that everyone knew about. \nCharbonneau's next witness, Martin Dumont, a former official in the Union Montreal party testified that his former boss, Bernard Trépanier, the chief financial officer of the Union Montreal, had taken so many bribes that his office safe was overflowing with cash. Dumont testified that he and Trépanier had much difficulty in forcing all of the cash into his safe. Another city official, Luc Leclerc, testified to the commission on 31 October 2012 that he had taken $500, 000 in bribes in cash between 1995-2009 along with various bribes in the form of gifts that were equal in value to the cash. Leclerc testified that he done nothing wrong because corruption was the norm in Montreal and that \"when in Rome, do as the Romans\". On 9 November 2012, the mayor of Laval, Gilles Vaillancourt, resigned in disgrace as a number of the commission's witnesses had named him as corrupt. On 15 November 2012, the mayor of Montreal, Gérald Tremblay, resigned in disgrace as too many of the witnesses at the commission had implicated him in their corruption.  \nGilles Vézina, the former chief engineer of Montreal, was called by Charbonneau as her next witness. Vézina admitted that he had taken bribes such in the form of bottles of wine, dinners at expensive restaurants, tickets to see the Montreal Canadiens hockey team play at the Molson center and the services of prostitutes hired by the construction companies. Like the other witnesses, Vézina denied having done anything wrong as he told Charbonneau that corruption had been the norm in Montreal ever since he started working for the city in 1962. Charbonneau called as a witness Martin Carrier, the owner of Les Céramiques Lindo ceramic firm based in Quebec City. Carrier testified that he had warned by the Rizzuto family not to do any more work in Montreal. In support of his claims, Carrier played an audio tape of a phone call he received in 2004 from a man speaking French with an Italian accent who told him to cease work in Montreal because otherwise \"...you won't be walking away from here. You've been warned\". Carrier also testified that he received further death threats from a Rizzuto family member, Francesco Del Balso, after he made a bid on a contract in Montreal. Charbonneau thanked Carrier for his \"exceptional courage\" in coming forward despite all of the death threats against himself and his family.  \nCharbonneau's next witness was Michel Leclerc, the owner of the construction company Terremex. Leclerc testified that he tried to avoid paying kickbacks to the corrupt city officials and the Rizzuto family, but was finally forced to because it was the only way to win contracts in Montreal. André Durocher, the owner of the Excavatins Panthère company, likewise testified that he was forced to pay kickbacks as the price of doing business in Montreal. Michel Cadotte, the owner of the Ipex pipe-manufacturing company testified that the city cancelled its contract to buy his Terra-Brute pipes after he refused to pay a $150, 000 bribe.\nCharbonneau started January 2013 by calling as a witness, Michel Lalonde, the owner of Génius Counseil, who testified that he overbilled the city by 25%-30% in his construction work and donated the money to the politicians. In 2001 election, Lalonde had donated to the ruling mayor, Pierre Bourque, who lost the election to Tremblay. Lalonde testified that for the next two years it was impossible for Génius Counseil to win contracts until in 2003 he received a phone call from Trépanier who asked him to give $100, 000 in cash to Tremblay. After paying the $100, 000, Lalonde testified that he sat down with Trépanier who asked him what construction project he would like Génius Counseil to work on. Lalonde also testified that to win a contract in 2007 to build Autoroute 13 for the province of Quebec that he had paid $25, 000 in cash to Claude Millaire, the Transport Quebec official on charge of awarding the contract.  Lalonde named as the politicians whom he paid bribes to as Joseph Magri, the former mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles; Cosmo Maciocia, another former mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles; Gilles Deguire, the mayor of Montréal-Nord; Robert Coutu, the mayor of Montréal-Est; Michel Bissonnet, the mayor of Saint-Leonard; and Jean-François St-Onge, a borough councilor in Ahuntsic-Cartierville. The municipalities listed by Lalonde were all known strongholds of the Rizzuto family.  \nThe next witness Charbonneau called was Giuseppe Borsellino, the owner of Garnier Construction, who likewise testified that he paid bribes to win contracts, saying that it was the only way possible to win a contract from the corrupt city officials. Borsellino testified that he had paid $50, 000 to give a free vacation in Italy to Robert Marcil, the chief of  Montreal's Public Works department, as the price of winning a contract. Charbonneau questioned Borsellino about an incident in 2009 when three men broke into his office and beat him bloody. Borsellino said he had no idea why he was beaten. Charbonneau was displeased with this answer and told him: \"If you were beaten to the point that you were disfigured and had to be hospitalized for a reconstruction of your face, you must have some idea why you were beaten like that?\" Borsellino answered her: \"I have some ideas. Maybe I didn't pay my debts. Maybe I didn't do a job well. It was maybe two or three reasons. I did not make a complaint and I went on to my business and went back to work\". When Charbonneau suggested that it was Rizzuto family thugs who had beaten him in his office, Borsellino admitted that he was a friend of  Rizzuto family as he came from the same town in Sicily as they did, but denied that it was the Rizzuto family who had him beaten.\nCharbonneau had the commission played by a secret video recording made by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police where a construction company boss, Nicolo Milioto, arrived at the Consenza Social Club and handed a bag of cash to Nicolo Rizzuto. After counting the money, Rizzuto handed some of the cash back to Milioto, which he hid in his socks. Milioto visited Rizzuto at the Consenza Social Club 236 times between 2004-2006. Charbonneau had Milioto called as a witness. Milioto, known in Montreal as \"Mr. Sidewalk\", was accused of collecting kickbacks and extortion payments from the construction companies, which he handed over personally to Rizzuto. Milioto spoke with much fear in his voice as he denied that doing anything illegal as he claimed that he routinely performed \"errands\" for Rizzuto for which he was paid hundreds of dollars per errand. Milioto denied knowing what the Mafia was as he claimed \"I don't know\" when asked if he knew what the Mafia was. When Charbonneau asked Milioto if he was aware of pizzo (protection money), Miloto stated: \"I come from Italy, Madame, I know what a pizzo is\". However, Milioto claimed he had never paid pizzo in Canada and was unaware of any other Canadian businessmen who had paid pizzo. Of all the witnesses called by Charbonneau, Milioto provoked the most ridicule as the journalist Jerry Langton wrote that Milioto's testimony was \"ludicrous\" as he made a number of highly unlikely claims to explain his behavior.    \nCharbonneau's next witness, Charles Meunier, the owner of the BPR construction firm, testified he had to pay bribes because it was the only way to win contracts in Montreal. Charbonneau then summoned as her next witness, Yves Cadotte, the vice-president of SNC-Lavalin, who testified that his company had given $1 million in illegal donations annually to both the Parti libéral du Québec and the Parti Québécois for decades as part of the normal cost of doing business in Quebec. When Charbonneau asked Cadotte why SNC-Lavalin had given so much money in illegal donations, he answered her by saying: \"We want to make sure we can take in our activities and so we agree to the demands that are made\". The new mayor of Montreal, Michael Applebaum, in a speech on 21 March 2013 attacked Charbonneau, saying it was impossible for the city to have its potholes fixed because all of the construction companies in Montreal had been named as corrupt by her commission. Appelbaum's speech was widely seen as a crude threat to the people of Montreal to accept corruption as the price of having potholes fixed.\nCharbonneau summoned as a witness Trépanier, whose nickname in Montreal was Monsieur trois pour cent (\"Mr. Three Percent\"). Trépanier testified that no one in Quebec had ever followed the rules on campaign donations and that illegal campaign donations were the norm. Trépanier, who was very nervous when giving his testimony as Charbonneau had reminded him that he could indicted for perjury if he was caught out in a lie, denied all of the allegations against him, saying the  Monsieur trois pour cent nickname was a \"smear\" made up by his enemies. \nOn 17 June 2013, Applebaum was arrested for corruption, leading him to resign as mayor in disgrace. Charbonneau's next witness was Sergeant Alain Belleau of the Sûreté du Québec who testified that the Hells Angels were actively involved in the Quebec construction industry. During the hearings, the name of Larry Amero was mentioned as a Hells Angel from British Columbia who had moved to Montreal to replace the Hells Angels arrested in Operation SharQC in 2009. Charbonneau called as her next witness Paul Sauvé, the owner of LM Sauvé construction company, who testified that he was forced to take on the Hells Angel Normand \"Casper\" Quimet as a business partner in his firm after receiving death threats from the Hells Angels. Sauvé also testified that André Boisclair, the former leader of the PQ, had given LM Sauvé a secret provincial subsidy of $2.5 million in 2003 in exchange for illegal campaign donations to the PQ.\nThe next witness to be called by Charbonneau was Ken Pereira, a high-ranking official in the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec (FTQ) trade union. Pereira testified that the Hells Angels had taken control of the FTQ union and that the 2008 leadership race for presidency of the FTQ had been rigged by the Hells Angels to allow their candidate, Jacques Émond, to win. Pereira also showed documents that revealed that Jocelyn Dupuis, the boss of the FTQ's construction arm, had billed his union $50, 000 in fraudulent expenses. When Dupuis was called as a witness, he denied allegations of corruption, but admitted he helped Raynald Desjardins of the Rizzuto family win several construction contracts by removing his name from any documentation relating to the contracts.  \nThe Commission issued its final report on 24 November 2015. Langton wrote: \"As revealing as the Charbonneau Commission was, I'm not sure it actually accomplished that much work\". Langton wrote that the root problem in the Quebec construction industry was not the Rizzuto family nor the Hells Angels, but rather the climate of corruption which allowed these criminal syndicates to flourish, which the Charbonneau commission failed to address.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nCharbonneau was portrayed by Claudia Ferri in the television drama series Bad Blood, which debuted in 2017, surrounding the Rizzuto crime family.\n\n\nBooks\nLangton, Jerry (2015).

    "title": "Better Me for You (Brown Eyes)",

    "text": "\"Better Me for You (Brown Eyes)\" is a song by American singer Max McNown, released on November 15, 2024, as the third single from his second studio album Night Diving (2025). It was written by McNown, Jamie Kenney (who also produced the song), Trent Dabbs and Ava Suppelsa.\n\n\nBackground and composition\nThe song was composed in May 2024. At the time, Max McNown was living in Oregon and had recently started a long-distance relationship. When his co-writers asked him about his life for song ideas, McNown decided to write about how he felt about his girlfriend. They began playing a bright midtempo groove on acoustic guitars. McNown had already written the phrase \"I didn't know you'd have brown eyes\", which became the opening line of the chorus, where McNown also describes her as strong and \"deeper than a coal mine\". The closing line of the chorus, \"I gotta find a better me for you\", was developed from McNown being inspired by his girlfriend to become a better person.\nAfter finishing the chorus, the writers focused on the opening verse, in which the protagonist remembers a period in his past that was defined by unhealthy alcohol use and romantic encounters that were not serious. It essentially depicts his darker side before meeting his lover. The second verse begins with a metaphor of \"dipping toes in the water\" and is a reflection of a period when McNown worked at a coffee shop and was unwilling to make serious commitments. The writers completed the song with a bridge that starts with a descending melody, like the chorus, but with subtle differences. In this section, McNown inserted a reference to the long-distance relationship. His co-writers feared it would be confusing for listeners as this piece of information was not made known earlier in the song, but McNown insisted it fit him and they decided to follow his judgment. Consisting of five lines, the bridge finds McNown pledging his undying love.\nWhen the song was finished, McNown remained at Jamie Kenney's studio in Berry Hill, Tennessee and they worked through a rough demo of the song that used acoustic guitars and makeshift percussion to create a \"blurry picture\" which they wanted. McNown also added a scratch vocal with fragile falsetto, before returning to Oregon. Kenney continued work on the production in Nashville. He added more instruments, then enlisted Todd Lombardo to overdub banjo and rubber-bridge acoustic guitar; Aaron Sterling for the core drums; and Jedd Hughes to add electric guitars. Kenney inserted Dobro and a slide-guitar sample into the background. As Kenney worked to find a balance between the acoustics and electrics, McNown moved to Nashville and lived in a room at the studio for six months. He re-recorded his vocals three times before he was satisfied. They ended up using much of the original recording because of a \"bit of freshness to it\". Kenney enhanced the falsetto parts with a mandolin in the first chorus and electric guitar in the second to create a dreamy mood.\nMcNown introduced the song on the video-sharing app TikTok, beginning with short performances centering around the line \"I didn't know you'd have brown eyes\". As the song grew in popularity, he inserted \"(Brown Eyes)\" into the title for the song to make it easier to find. McNown originally did not plan on releasing the song as a single, but his uncle and manager, Brandon Ebel, convinced him to. Fugitive Recordings and Magnolia Music Group's promotion department sent the song to country radio via PlayMPE on December 16, 2024.\n\n\nLive performances\nMax McNown performed the song on The Kelly Clarkson Show on February 24, 2025.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nReferences",

In the same year, he represented Dhaka in the U-18 National Junior Football Tournament, after which he was named the tournament's Best Emerging Defender. In 1982, he joined Rahmatganj MFS in the First Division, playing as a right-back under coach, Abdur Rahim. He spent the following season at Team BJMC before returning to Rahmatganj in 1984 after BJMC's relegation from the First Division. His performance with Rahmatganj in the 1984 season earned him his first call-up to the Bangladesh national team.\n\n\nMohammedan SC\nFollowing his international debut, Kaiser joined Dhaka Mohammedan in 1985. He went on to spend the rest of his career with the Black and Whites, winning the First Division title in 1986, 1987, 1988–89, 1993, 1996, playing as a center-back. He played an ever-present role as Mohammedan were unbeaten in the First Division from 8 September 1985 to 15 March 1990, during which the club won 63 games from the 76 played, and also completed hat-trick league triumphs from 1986 to 1988–89.\nIn 1986, he marshalled Mohammedan's defense alongside Ranjit Saha, and finished the season with his first league title, playing a crucial role in victories over rivals, Dhaka Abahani and Dhaka Wanderers, in the final two games of the Super League round. He began the 1987 season by lifting the Federation Cup, and in the Super League round of the First Division, Kaiser starred as Mohammedan defeated Abahani 3–2, keeping their domestic double hopes alive, however, with both clubs on equal points, and the return play-off game ending as a stalemate, the players alongside the club officials agreed upon being crowned joint-champions. Nevertheless, the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) opted for a second play-off match at the Army Stadium, which saw Mohammedan win 2–0. In the same year, Kaiser also represented the club at the 1987 Asian Club Championship, under the coaching of Nasser Hejazi. Due to his performances at both club and international level, Kaiser eventually received the Sports Writers Association's Best Footballer Award in 1986 and the Best Sportsperson Award in 1988.\n\nKaiser also represented the club as it reached the semi-final league round of the 1988–89 Asian Club Championship, during which the Black and Whites defeated both Iran's Persepolis and North Korea's April 25. During the semi-final round held in  Kuantan, Malaysia, he scored in a 1–3 defeat to Saudi Arabia's Al-Ittifaq, as Mohammedan finished fourth in a five team group. In the 1989–90 season, Kaiser was appointed as club captain by coach Hejazi. Although the club won the Federation Cup under his captaincy, Mohammedan also ended their five-year unbeaten run in the First Division, and finished runners-up to arch-rivals Dhaka Abahani. In the 1989–90 Asian Club Championship, under Kaiser's captaincy, the Black and Whites crashed out of the qualifying group-stages held in Ahvaz, Iran, finishing runners-up to hosts Shahin Ahvaz. He remained club captain until the 1991 BTC Club Cup, in which Mohammedan lost the final to Abahani. In the same year, with the First Division not being held in Dhaka, Kaiser represented Kolkata Mohammedan in the Calcutta First Division League.\nHe remained a regular member of the team, helping Mohammedan win the league title in both 1993 and 1996. He was also renowned for his goal-scoring abilities, with one of his most notable goals coming during the DMFA Cup final against Dhaka Abahani in 1993, where he scored from a 30-yard free kick as Mohammedan won 3–2. In 1995, he was an irregular face in the team due to injury problems. He eventually lost his place in the team following the club's appointment of Kang Man-young, who preferred the younger Monwar Hossain Munna and Rajani Kanta Barman at central-defence, and would mainly use Kaiser as a substitute striker during Mohammedan's 1996 league triumph. On 17 December 1996, Kaiser played his final competitive match by coming on as a substitute as Mohammedan defeated Abahani 1–0 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in what was the 1996 Premier Division season finale.\n\n\nInternational career\n\nKaiser's performances for Rahmatganj MFS saw him earn a call-up to the Bangladesh national team for the 1984 South Asian Games held in Kathmandu, Nepal. His international debut came on 18 September 1984, in a 2–0 victory over Bhutan. Under coach Ali Imam, he played four games during the tournament as Bangladesh finished runners-up. Following his debut, Kaiser represented the national team from 1984 to 1993, making over 50 appearances throughout the decade.\nHe scored his first international goal on 2 April 1985, during a 2–1 victory against Indonesia in the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers held at the Dhaka Stadium. Notably, this was Bangladesh's first victory in the World Cup qualifiers. In the same year, he featured for the national team which finished runners-up to North Korea in the 1985 Quaid-e-Azam International Tournament in Peshawar, Pakistan. He was also part of the team which again finished runners-up in the 1985 South Asian Games and during the tournament he scored in a 8–0 victory over Maldives. In 1986, he represented Bangladesh at the Pakistan President's Gold Cup in Karachi, scoring in an embarrassing 1–4 defeat to Pakistan XI. Nevertheless, the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Pakistan, and finished the tournament in third-place.\nKaiser also appeared in the 1986 and 1990 editions of the Asian Games. He also represented the national team in the six editions of the South Asian Games from 1984 to 1993. Kaiser served vice-captain to Sayeed Hassan Kanan during the 1989 Bangladesh President's Gold Cup. He was eventually made captain in 1993 and led the nation at the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. During the qualifiers he scored in a 3–0 victory over Sri Lanka at the Al Maktoum Stadium. Later that year, following the appointment of Swiss coach Oldrich Svab, Kaiser's captaincy was controversially taken over by Arif Hossain Moon. His final appearances for the national team came at the 1993 South Asian Games, during which Svab deployed him as a right-back. In the opening match, Kaiser missed a penalty in a goalless draw with Maldives. His final appearance came on 24 December 1993, as Bangladesh crashed out of the tournament with a 0–1 defeat to Nepal.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nInternational\n\nScores and results list Bangladesh's goal tally first.\n\n\nFamily and personal life\nKaiser married Lopa Kaisar in 1993, with whom he has two sons and one daughter. His youngest son, Sadat Hamid, is a former professional footballer who played for Mohammedan SC in the Bangladesh Premier League until 2022. His only daughter, Kaarina Kaisar, is a comedian.\nIn 2003, Kaiser received the National Sports Award. On 10 April 2005, he was one of the ten footballers honored by the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) for their extraordinary services to the nation on the occasion of the inauguration of the BFF Bhaban.\nKaiser stood for Dhaka University Central Students' Union elections in 1989–90. Soon after retiring from football in 1996, Kaiser entered politics. He ran on a Zaker Party ticket in the Bangladesh national elections. In 2008, he was sued for attempted murder having reportedly hit a doctor of a state-owned hospital on the head with a pistol. In 2011, Kaiser was back in the news when police arrested former Nigerian footballer Emeka Ezeugo, who was found with Kaiser's licensed revolver.\nIn 2019, Kaiser was again arrested for embezzling investor funds. The case was filed with Banani police station in 2014 against Kaiser by several people who had invested money in Kaiser's company, New Way Multipurpose Cooperative Society, but never got any returns on their investments. Kaiser eventually received bail on 27 January 2019, after his lawyer argued in favor of his release, leading Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mamunur Rashid to approve bail on a Tk 10,000 bond.\n\n\nHonours\nDhaka Mohammedan\n\nDhaka First Division/Premier Division League: 1986, 1987, 1988–89, 1993, 1996\nFederation Cup: 1987, 1989, 1995\nMa-O-Moni Gold Cup: 1990\nIndependence Cup: 1991\nDMFA Cup: 1993, 1995\nBangladesh\n\nSouth Asian Games Silver medal: 1984, 1985, 1989; Bronze medal: 1991\nIndividual\n\n1986 − Sports Writers Association's Best Footballer Award.\n1988 − Sports Writers Association's Best Sportsperson Award.\n2003 − National Sports Award.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nHossain, Moharraf (1 October 2020). পদ্মার ঢেউ ও'রে ,মোর শূণ্য হৃদয় পদ্ম নিয়ে যা, যা..রে [The waves of river Padma, my empty heart take the lotus].

    "text": "John Alden (c. 1598 – September 12, 1687) was an English magistrate, settler, and cooper, best known for being a crew member on the 1620 voyage of the Mayflower which brought the English settlers, commonly known as Pilgrims, to Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. He was hired in Southampton, England, as the ship's cooper, responsible for maintaining the ship's barrels. He was a member of the ship's crew and not initially a settler, yet he decided to remain in Plymouth Colony when the Mayflower returned to England. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact.\nHe married fellow Mayflower passenger Priscilla Mullins, whose entire family perished in the first winter in Plymouth Colony. The marriage of the young couple became prominent in Victorian popular culture after the 1858 publication of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's fictitious narrative poem The Courtship of Miles Standish. The book inspired widespread depictions of John and Priscilla Alden in art and literature during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nAlden was one of Plymouth Colony's most active public servants and played a prominent role in colonial affairs. He was annually elected to the Governor's Council nearly every year from 1640 to 1686. He served as Treasurer of Plymouth Colony, Deputy to the General Court of Plymouth, a member of the colony's Council of War, and a member of the colony's Committee on Kennebec Trade, among other posts.\nHe was the last surviving signer of the Mayflower Compact upon his death in 1687. The approximate location of his grave in the Myles Standish Burial Ground was marked with a memorial stone in 1930. The site of his first house in Duxbury is preserved and marked with interpretative signs. The Alden Kindred of America began as a society of John and Priscilla's descendants, and it maintains the Alden House Historic Site in Duxbury, Massachusetts—likely built by Alden's son, Capt. Jonathan Alden.\n\n\nEnglish origins\n\nHistorians and genealogists have advanced many theories to the English origin of John Alden. According to the \"American Ancestors\" project of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, Alden genealogical expert Alicia Crane Williams has called two of the hypothesized origins \"tempting\"; however, she asserts that none are definitively proven.\nThe only definite primary source evidence regarding Alden's background comes from Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford's history Of Plymouth Plantation. Bradford wrote that Alden \"was hired for a cooper, at South-Hampton, wher the ship victuled; and being a hopefull yong man, was much desired, but left to his owne liking to go or stay when he came here; but he stayed, and maryed here\". Charles Edward Banks states that the employment of Alden \"at Southampton\" does not necessarily mean that he was a resident of the seaport and may have only been there to work temporarily when the Mayflower arrived.\nBanks cited research by certain historians and genealogists who offered theories as to Alden's origin based on inconclusive but possibly relevant evidence. One such theory was proposed by historian and genealogist B. Carlyon-Hughes who found evidence of an Alden family living in Harwich in Essex, England during the 17th century. Harwich is an ancient North Sea port, northeast of London, which was the home port of the ship Mayflower and home of its captain Christopher Jones. Carlyon-Hughes asserted that the Aldens of Harwich were related to Jones and also that a young John Alden of the Harwich Aldens was about the same age as the Mayflower passenger. A prior association with the captain of the Mayflower (although not definitively proven) could account, according to Banks, for Alden joining the crew. Historian George F. Willison subscribed to the Harwich origin theory and wrote that Alden's children \"remembered him as tall, blond, and very powerful in physique\". Willison, however, offers no specific source material for this description.\nAnother theory cited by Banks, which he called \"a fair presumption\", involves a John Alden of Southampton who \"may have been the son of George Alden the fletcher, who disappeared—probably dying in that year—leaving John, an orphan, free to take employment overseas. Jane, the widow, may have been his mother and Richard and Avys his grandparents\". The tax list of Holyrood Ward, Southampton in 1602 lists the names of George Alden and John's future father-in-law William Mullins. Banks even went so far as to postulate that, if the Alden and Mullins families both originated from Southampton, then perhaps their courtship began in Southampton.\nAlicia Crane Williams analyzed these and several other theories in The Mayflower Descendant, a scholarly journal of Pilgrim history and genealogy. She pointed out that some genealogists have connected John Alden of the Mayflower with John Alden, \"son and heir of John Alden of Swanscomb, Kent\" who obtained a Patent of Arms in 1607. There is no evidence that John Alden of the Mayflower was connected to this family or inherited this coat of arms. Williams states, \"This Alden coat of arms was published in the Encyclopædia Britannica and has led many unsuspecting [genealogists] astray.\"\n\n\nVoyage of the Mayflower\n\nAlden was hired by Capt. Christopher Jones in Southampton when he was about 21 years old to work as the ship's cooper during the Mayflower's voyage to America. According to historian Nathaniel Philbrick, the colonists encouraged him during the voyage to remain with them in America due to his useful skills as a barrel-maker and carpenter.\nThe Mayflower departed Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620. The 100-foot ship had aboard 102 passengers and a crew of about 20 to 30 in extremely cramped conditions. A lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for months caused illnesses that eventually proved fatal for many, particularly to women and children. There were two deaths during the ocean crossing, a crew member and a passenger.\nThe ship spotted Cape Cod on November 9, 1620, after about two months at sea. Their original destination had been the mouth of the Hudson River, which was then part of the Colony of Virginia. Capt. Jones made an attempt to round the southern end of Cape Cod, but he lacked an adequate chart of the area known as Pollock's Rip, and the strong currents and dangerous shoals there forced him to turn back. Jones determined that the colonists would have to disembark and settle in New England rather than the Hudson River due to widespread illness aboard ship and dwindling supplies. The Mayflower eventually came to anchor on November 11 in Provincetown Harbor at the northern tip of Cape Cod.\nThe decision to settle outside of Virginia Colony raised some problems. The group carried a patent which granted authority to their elected leaders and entitled them to establish their own plantation within the bounds of Virginia Colony. They were settling in New England, however, so the patent became irrelevant and some members began to question the authority of their leaders. To settle these questions, the colony's leadership drew up the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that they would work together, acting as \"a civil body politic\" in obedience to such laws as the colony might enact. The Mayflower Compact was signed by all free male settlers on November 11, the same day that they set anchor at Provincetown. John Alden signed the document, which is an indication that he had already made the decision to remain with the settlers. He was the youngest of the signers and the last survivor.\n\n\nEstablishing Plymouth Colony\n\nAfter exploring the inner shoreline of Cape Cod, the colonists chose to settle in Plymouth. The site offered a good harbor, several fresh water springs, and a large hill overlooking the harbor (which they would later name Burial Hill) suitable for a fort. A tribe known as the Patuxet (part of the Wampanoag peoples) had settled the site and cleared a large area of land for planting corn. By the time the Mayflower arrived, the Patuxet tribe had been wiped out by plagues, likely as a result of contact with English fishermen.\nDuring their first winter in Plymouth, most of the settlers fell ill and half died of disease. Priscilla Mullins (John Alden's future wife) lost her entire family—her father William, her mother Alice, and her brother Joseph. The fifty colonists who survived began building a fort atop Burial Hill and small wooden houses on either side of a \"street\" now known as Leyden Street, named in 1823 after the town in Holland where the Pilgrims lived for several years. A small plot of land at the foot of Burial Hill near the top of the street was designated for John Alden. He built a primitive house in this location and lived there for about seven years with his wife Priscilla and his growing family. The site of Alden's first house in Plymouth was marked in 1930 with a boulder and bronze plaque placed by the Alden Kindred of America. A recreation of this house stands today at Plimoth Patuxet, a living history museum which replicates the original Pilgrim settlement.\n\n\nMarriage to Priscilla Mullins\n\nThe exact date of John Alden's marriage to Priscilla Mullins was not noted in colonial records. According to the Pilgrim Society, it was likely in 1622 as Priscilla Mullins is not listed separately in the 1623 Division of Land. It was either the second or third marriage to take place in the colony.\nThe marriage of the two young colonists has been widely depicted in art and literature primarily due to the extraordinary popularity of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's narrative poem The Courtship of Miles Standish, published in 1858. The fictionalized story tells of a love triangle involving John Alden, Priscilla Mullins, and Myles Standish (the captain of the colony's militia). In the story, Standish is too timid to express his feelings to Priscilla Mullins and therefore asks Alden to speak for him. Alden's words of courtship on Standish's behalf prompt Mullins to offer an often-quoted quip, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\" The book sold 10,000 copies in London in a single day. In the United States, the story brought the Pilgrims to the forefront of American culture, contributing to the establishment of a national Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. The book made John and Priscilla Alden celebrated figures in American popular culture.\nWhile some historians state that the courtship story is \"loosely based\" on Alden family oral history, others dismiss it as complete fiction. A brief account of a rivalry between John Alden and Myles Standish for Priscilla's hand was first published in A Collection of American Epitaphs and Inscriptions by Timothy Alden in 1814. Longfellow, therefore, was not the originator of the story but he greatly embellished it. No part of the tale is supported by 17th century documentation. Historian John Goodwin pointed out several anachronisms and inconsistencies, asserting, there was no \"reason for believing any part of it.\"\n\n\nService to Plymouth Colony\nIn 1626, the colony's financial backers in London, known as the Merchant Adventurers, disbanded. This left the colonists with no means of settling their significant debts to those who had funded the effort. Eight of the Plymouth colonists, including John Alden, agreed to collectively assume, or undertake, the debt in exchange for a monopoly on the fur trade from the colony. These men who averted financial ruin for the colony became known as the \"Undertakers\". This agreement to grant the Undertakers a monopoly was signed by the 37 freemen of Plymouth Colony. The fact that Alden was among the Undertakers is indicative of his growing stature in the colony.\nAlden was elected Governor's Assistant (one of a small council of advisors to the Governor) in 1632 and was regularly reelected to that office until 1640 and then again from 1650 to 1686, because he was deputy from Duxbury from 1641 to 1642, and from 1645 to 1649, and a member of Captain Miles Standish's militia company from 1643. He also served as Deputy Governor on two occasions in the absence of the Governor in 1665 and 1677. The colonists elected him Treasurer annually from 1656 to 1658. Alden served on the colony's Council of War, an important committee to decide on matters pertaining to the defense of the colony, in 1642, 1643, 1646, 1653, 1658 and 1667. The Plymouth General Court appointed Alden to a number of important committees including the Committee to Revise Laws, the Committee on the Kennebec Trade, and a number of additional minor posts. He then served for several years as magistrate.\nPlymouth Colony held a patent entitling them to a monopoly on the fur trade at the Kennebec River in what would later become Maine. In 1634, a man named John Hocking from Piscataqua Plantation in New Hampshire interloped in the trade provoking a confrontation between him and traders from Plymouth Colony at Kennebec. Hocking shot a Plymouth colonist named Moses Talbot and, in turn, a Plymouth man shot Hocking. When the Plymouth traders arrived by boat at Boston, authorities there decided to imprison John Alden who was aboard the Plymouth vessel, even though he had not been present during the violence. It was only through the intervention of William Bradford that Alden was eventually released.\n\n\nSettlement of Duxbury\n\nIn January 1628, the land along Plymouth Bay was divided up into farm lots with each individual receiving 20 acres plus an additional 20 acres for each family member. John and Priscilla Alden, who had three children at that time, received 100 acres along the Bluefish River in the area known as Duxbury (sometimes spelled Duxburough or Duxborrow at that time). Grants were drawn by lot, so the location of Alden's farm was not his selection. By chance, as historian Dorothy Wentworth observed, the location was ideal as it included upland that had been partially cleared by Native Americans, woodland, and salt marshes (a good source of hay). Alden built their first small house in 1628. As they were required to travel to Plymouth every Sunday for Sabbath services (10 miles away), they lived seasonally on their Duxbury farm for the first few years, staying in Plymouth during the winter to avoid long travels in harsh weather. The site was professionally excavated by Roland Wells Robbins in 1960, unearthing many artifacts including a halberd blade which is now exhibited at Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth. The site is now part of the Duxbury school campus and is located next to a playing field. The footprint of the house is evident as a depression in the ground and is marked by a boulder, plaque, and other interpretive signage.\n\nIn 1632, Alden was one of several men who petitioned the colony to have Duxbury set off as a separate church congregation with their own minister. This would allow those with Duxbury grants to reside on their farms year-round. William Bradford and other colonial officials were reluctant to break apart the \"mother\" church congregation in Plymouth but nonetheless gave permission. Duxbury was incorporated as a separate town in 1637. John Alden became one of the leading men of the new town of Duxbury and a key figure in the colony. He served as Deputy from Duxbury to the General Court for most of the 1640s.\nLocal historians of the 19th and 20th centuries asserted that a later Alden house in Duxbury was the second home of John and Priscilla Alden and was constructed in 1653. As local historian Dorothy Wentworth wrote, the tradition \"has been accepted for so long that there seems no point in doubting it.\" This house is now owned by the Alden Kindred of America and maintained as a museum known as the Alden House Historic Site. Long-standing assumptions about the house turned out to be incorrect as Dendrochronological and architectural analysis conducted in 2003 suggest that the house was likely built about 1700 and therefore was not the home of John and Priscilla Alden. It was likely built by one of their children (possibly Jonathan Alden) or grandchildren.\nThe Alden's first Duxbury home site and the Alden House Historic Site were together granted National Historic Landmark status in 2008.\n\n\nFamily\n\nJohn and Priscilla Alden had ten children:\n\nElizabeth was born in 1623 in Plymouth and died in Little Compton, Rhode Island, on May 31, 1717. She married William Pabodie on December 26, 1644 in Duxbury and had thirteen children. Her grave and that of her husband are in the Old Commons Cemetery in Little Compton.\nJohn Jr. was born about 1626 in Plymouth and died in Boston on March 14, 1701/2. He married Elizabeth (Phillips) Everill on April 1, 1660, and had fourteen children. He became a prosperous maritime merchant. He also played a controversial role in dealings with Native Americans in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during King William's War. In 1692, he was accused of being a witch during the Salem witch trials and jailed, though he later escaped and fled to Duxbury.\nJoseph was born about 1628 and died in Bridgewater, Massachusetts on February 8, 1696/7. He married Mary Simmons about 1660 and had seven children.\nPriscilla was born about 1630. Little is known about her life except for a record which indicates she was alive and unmarried in 1688.\nJonathan was born about 1632 and died in Duxbury on February 14, 1697. He married Abigail Hallett on December 10, 1672, and had six children. Jonathan was buried in the Old Burying Ground in Duxbury. He was captain of the Plymouth Colony militia and documentation indicates that at his burial, the militia company attended in formation. During his burial, Rev. Ichabod Wiswall of Duxbury delivered a sermon. It is the first known instance of a sermon being delivered at a Plymouth Colony burial indicated changing religious customs. Prior to this, burials were simple affairs without religious ritual.\nSarah was born about 1634 and died before the settlement of her father's estate in 1688. She married Alexander Standish, son of Myles Standish, about 1660 and had eight children.\nRuth was born about 1636 and died in Braintree, Massachusetts on October 12, 1674. She married John Bass in Braintree on February 3, 1658, and had seven children. Among her children was Hannah Bass, paternal grandmother of future United States President John Adams.\nMary was born about 1638. She was alive and unmarried in 1688.\nRebecca was born about 1640. She married Thomas Delano in 1677 and had nine children. She died between June 12, 1696 and October 5, 1722. She is buried in Old Burying Ground in Duxbury.\nDavid was born about 1642 and died in Duxbury between July 2, 1718, and April 1, 1719. He married Mary Southworth by 1674 and had six children.\n\n\nFinal days and legacy\n\nJohn Alden was the last survivor of the signers of the Mayflower Compact. He died in Duxbury on September 12, 1687. Both he and his wife Priscilla were buried in the Old Burying Ground in South Duxbury. The precise location of their graves is not known as markers either were not placed or have crumbled away. In 1930, the Alden Kindred of America placed commemorative slate stones at the estimated location of their graves near the headstone of their son, Capt. Jonathan Alden.\nSeveral artifacts attributed to John Alden are exhibited at major museums. These include the halberd blade discovered in the 1960 archaeological dig at the Alden first house site in Duxbury, the Alden family bible, and a mortar and pestle attributed to John and Priscilla Alden, all of which are displayed at Pilgrim Hall Museum. A wheel-lock carbine attributed to John Alden is housed at the National Firearms Museum. Of early-17th-century Italian make, the carbine was found in the Alden House during a 1924 restoration.\nThe Alden Kindred of America, initially a society composed strictly of Alden descendants, was established in 1906. It is now an incorporated non-profit organization welcoming both Alden descendants and non-descendants to its membership. The organization manages the Alden House Historic Site in Duxbury, Massachusetts.\nAccording to the Alden Kindred of America, John Alden had more than one million living descendants as of 2008. One of them being the most famous whistleblower in history, Edward Snowden, according to his autobiographical book Permanent Record.\n\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\nJohn Alden at MayflowerHistory.com page with vital facts and references.\nAlden House Historic Site & Alden Kindred of America",

The book inspired widespread depictions of John and Priscilla Alden in art and literature during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nAlden was one of Plymouth Colony's most active public servants and played a prominent role in colonial affairs. He was annually elected to the Governor's Council nearly every year from 1640 to 1686. He served as Treasurer of Plymouth Colony, Deputy to the General Court of Plymouth, a member of the colony's Council of War, and a member of the colony's Committee on Kennebec Trade, among other posts.\nHe was the last surviving signer of the Mayflower Compact upon his death in 1687. The approximate location of his grave in the Myles Standish Burial Ground was marked with a memorial stone in 1930. The site of his first house in Duxbury is preserved and marked with interpretative signs. The Alden Kindred of America began as a society of John and Priscilla's descendants, and it maintains the Alden House Historic Site in Duxbury, Massachusetts—likely built by Alden's son, Capt. Jonathan Alden.",

    "text": "Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford (3 March 1737 – 19 January 1793) was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1761 until 1784 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Camelford. He was an art connoisseur.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nPitt was born and baptised at Boconnoc in Cornwall on 3 March 1737, the son of Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc (died 1761), elder brother of William Pitt the Elder. His mother was Christian, eldest daughter of Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet, of Hagley. He was admitted fellow-commoner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 7 January 1754, and resided there until 1758. In 1759 Pitt obtained the degree of Master of Arts (MA) per literas regias.\nThomas Pitt accompanied Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull, British ambassador to the court of Portugal, on his journey to Lisbon in January 1760. Thomas Gray and his friends contrived that John Bowes, 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a college companion, should go with him; and Philip Francis, a lifelong friend, also joined the expedition. They entered the Tagus on 7 March 1760, and left Lisbon on 21 May 1760. Passing through Spain to Barcelona, they crossed to Genoa, and passed some time in Italy. Pitt corresponded with Gray, and wrote a manuscript journal of his travels; Cole notes that the description of the bullfight in the manuscript is identical with that in Edward Clarke's Letters on the Spanish Nation. Horace Walpole introduced Pitt to Sir Horace Mann at Florence, and praised his conduct in cutting off the entail to pay his father's debts and to provide for his sisters. Pitt was staying at Florence with his uncle, Richard Lyttelton, when news arrived of the death of his father, on 17 July 1761.\n\n\nIn politics\nThomas Pitt now became owner of the controlling interest in the rotten borough of Old Sarum and a considerable share in that of Okehampton in Devon. At intervals, Pitt now played an active part in politics. He was a Member of Parliament of the House of Commons for Old Sarum from December 1761 until 1768, for Okehampton from 1768 until 1774, and again for Old Sarum from 1774 until he was raised to the peerage in 1784. He followed in politics his near relative, George Grenville, who made him a lord of the admiralty in his ministry of 1763. He was invited, in compliment to his uncle, Chatham, to continue in office with the Rockingham ministry; but he was politically at variance with Chatham, and followed Grenville into opposition.\nPitt was one of the seventy-two whig members who met at the Thatched House Tavern, London, on 9 May 1769, to celebrate the rights of electors in the struggle for the representation of Middlesex; he seconded Sir William Meredith in his attempt to relax the subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles, and he spoke against the Royal Marriage Bill. Through his influence, supported by Lady Chatham, the reconciliation of his uncle and Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple was effected in 1774. Horace Walpole, who quarrelled with him on political topics, calls him a 'flimsy' speaker, but Wraxall remarked that, although he rarely spoke, his family position guaranteed him an audience when he did. He made a speech in 1780 on John Dunning's motion to limit the influence of the Crown. He was one of the strongest opponents of Lord North's ministry, and a warm antagonist of the coalition. In November 1781, he protested against voting supplies until grievances were redressed. In February 1783, he moved the address for the Shelburne ministry, protesting that he had always been opposed to the use of force against the American colonies, and he attacked Charles James Fox's East India Bill.\nHe spoke carefully in 1782 against parliamentary reform. Next year, when the same question was brought forward, he was ridiculed for a change of opinion, and his offer to sacrifice his rotten borough for the public good. He was satirised by the authors of the Rolliad (1795), and was chaffed in the House of Commons by Fox (13 March 1784) and Edmund Burke (28 February 1785). In March 1783, when the king was endeavouring to form an administration in opposition to North and Fox, the leadership of the House of Commons and the seals of a secretary of state were offered to him, despite opposition from Lord Ashburton. On 5 January 1784 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Camelford of Boconnoc, a promotion attributed to the influence of his cousin William Pitt the Younger.\n\n\nDilettante\nFrom March 1762, Pitt lived at Twickenham, playfully calling his house the 'Palazzo Pitti', a punning reference to the Pitti Palace in Florence. He was then the neighbour of Horace Walpole of Strawberry Hill House, who recognised his skill in Gothic architecture, and went so far as to call him 'my present architect.' On the death in 1779 of William Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Harrington, he bought the lease of Petersham Lodge (beneath Richmond Park, but now demolished and the grounds included in the park boundaries), and he purchased the fee-simple in 1784 from the crown, an act of parliament being passed for that purpose. In 1790 it was sold by him to the Duke of Clarence.\nThomas Pitt also built Camelford House, fronting Oxford Street, at the top of Park Lane, London; and as a member of the Dilettanti Society, to which he had been elected on 1 May 1763, he proposed in February 1785 that the shells of two adjoining houses constructed by him in Hereford Street should be completed by the society for a public museum, but financial considerations put a stop to the project. Although an amateur, Pitt was involved in architecture at the highest level, particularly at Stowe House in Buckinghamshire during the period 1770–1779. Earl Temple having first obtained a design from Jacques-François Blondel for the new south front of the house, which did not meet with the Earl's approval, in 1771 Robert Adam produced a new design for the south front; this design was adapted and made more uniform by Thomas Pitt assisted by Giovanni Battista Borra and was finished in 1779. The interiors of the new state apartments were not completed until 1788, much of the interior work being by an Italian, Vincenzo Valdrè (1740–1814).\nPitt interested himself in the porcelain manufactory of Plymouth porcelain, where they used the white saponaceous china stone found on his land in Cornwall. Angelica Kauffman wrote to him on the free importation into England by artists of their own studies and designs. Pitt was a friend of Mary Delany, to whom he gave for her lifetime portraits of Sir Bevil Grenville, his wife, and his father, and he proposed to John Maurice, Count of Brühl that they should jointly assist Thomas Mudge in his plans for the improvement of nautical chronometers. The wainscoting of the stalls in Carlisle Cathedral, where his uncle Charles Lyttelton was bishop, was designed by him.\n\n\nLater years\n\nFrom 1789 to 1792 he was in Italy, and, although he landed at Deal in June 1792, he left for continental Europe again in September. Peter Beckford says in his 'Familiar Letters' (1805 edit. i. 159), that Lord Camelford 'left Florence for Pisa with the gout upon him, and died immediately on his arrival;’ but it is generally said that he died at Florence on 19 January 1793. He was buried on 2 March at Boconnoc, where he had added to the old mansion, from his own designs, a second wing and gallery. In 1771, he had erected, on the hill above the house, an obelisk, 123 feet high, to the memory of his uncle, Sir Richard Lyttelton.\n\n\nAttributed works\nSome tracts have been attributed to Camelford. Sir John Sinclair credits him with a reply to his own 'Lucubrations during a Short Recess,’ 1782 . A few days after his elevation to the peerage a pamphlet, in which 'the constitutional right of the House of Commons to advise the sovereign' was upheld, was attributed to Camelford, and referred to in parliament by Burke, who also ridiculed him as the alleged author of a tract relating to parliamentary reform. In the autumn of 1789 Camelford found it necessary to deny that he had published a treatise on French affairs. He is included in Park's edition of Walpole's 'Royal and Noble Authors,’ iv. 348–50, as 'the reputed author of a tract concerning the American war.'\n\n\nFamily\n\nIn July 1771, Pitt married Anne Wilkinson, the younger daughter and coheiress of Pinckney Wilkinson, a rich merchant of Hanover Square, London, and Burnham Westgate, Norfolk. She died at Camelford House, Oxford Street, London, on 5 May 1803, aged 65, pining from grief at the career of her son, and was buried in the vault in Boconnoc churchyard on 19 May. Anne's sister Mary made an unhappy marriage, in 1760, with Captain John Smith, by whom she was mother of Admiral Sir Sidney Smith – Thomas Pitt treated his sister-in-law and her children with much kindness and in 1785 printed a 'Narrative and Proofs' of Smith's bad conduct.\nThomas and Anne had two children:\n\nThomas Pitt, later 2nd Baron Camelford\nAnne Pitt (September 1772 – 1864)\nHester Thrale described Pitt as 'a finical, lady-like man' and Sir J. Eardley-Wilmot dubbed him in 1765 'the prince of all the male beauties,’ and 'very well bred, polite, and sensible'. In his biography of Horace Walpole, Timothy Mowl took these comments to claim Pitt was a homosexual.\n\n\nSee also\n\nConway's Bridge\n\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: \"Pitt, Thomas (1737-1793)\".

She was the daughter of wealthy hacienda owners, Miguel Cortinas and Laura Ventura Peláez. She was one of five children, which also included her brother, noted musician Cesár Cortinas. Another brother was politician Ismael Cortinas. In 1905, when she was 23 or 24, her father Miguel was elected as deputy for the city of San José de Mayo, thus she, along with the rest of her family, moved to Montevideo, to be near her dad, whose responsibilities now placed him as a politician in Uruguay's largest city.\nSoon, after her brother Cesár contracted tuberculosis, she and her family moved to Paris, France, hoping to find a cure for her brother, but after World War I broke out, they relocated to Mendoza, Argentina, where her brother died.\n\n\nCareer\nAfter her brother Cesár died in 1918 (some say 1919 instead), Laura decided to dedicate part of her life to memorializing her brother's musical career.\nAround that time, Cortinas became a politician and she began working at the legislative palace of Uruguay, becoming their library director. She and her brother Ismael were involved in some fights to overturn some of the Uruguayan laws of the time.\nIn addition to her feminist activism, Cortinas became a prolific book writer; some of her works were presented on Argentine theater with the help of playwright Gregorio Martinez Sierra. In addition, she presented her literary work, \"El Buen Amor\" (\"Good Love\") at Teatro Solis in Montevideo, beginning on August 31, 1929. Among other books she wrote are 1953's \"El Ultimo Velo\" (\"The Last Veil\") and 1954's \"La Niña de las Trenzas Negras\" (\"The Black Braided Girl\").\nLater in life, she joined some Uruguayan feminist political groups.\n\n\nDeath\nShe died on May 5, 1969.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Uruguayans\n\n\nReferences",

Heath joined the Australian Board of Missions as a teenager and, ultimately, deciding to become a deaconess. She trained at Deaconess House and was ordained in 1938. Before coming to the Northern Territory, where Heath spent most of her career, she worked at the Moore River Native Settlement between 1935 and 1944. She was disgusted by conditions there where many Aboriginal people were forced to live and 'half-caste' children, and often their mothers, were forced to live in overcrowded and insufficient conditions. In 1935 the settlement was \"at crisis point\" and, despite the compound being designed for 200 people, had 300 people living there (mostly children) and the area surrounding it was surrounded by people living in tin, bag and brush humpies: The Great Depression was hitting hard.\nAfter 9 years working at the settlement she was fired for, very publicly, criticising the way that it was run and the poor conditions.\n\n\nLife in the Northern Territory\nHeath moved the Alice Springs to Work at St. Mary's Hostel, where she was the first superintendent, in 1946 alongside her friend Lillian Schroder who would serve as the housekeeper and seamstress. They welcomed their first residents on 2 March 1946, four children (two girls and two boys) from Newcastle Waters Station and from there the numbers continued to grow. Eight months later there were 18 children and this number continued to grow to a peak of 71 in 1955.\nIt is said that Heath took a very active interest in the children and that they lived a relaxed and carefree existence; playing sport, climbing trees and riding donkeys. Heath also encouraged the children to be involved in community events including the Children's Fancy Dress Ball and Guy Fawkes Night. Heath left the hostel in 1955, after 10 years of service, when she started working for the Welfare Branch in Alice Springs where she was employed as a field welfare officer.  From 1970 -1975 she returned to St. Mary's, which became  St Mary's Children's Village in 1972, as a social worker. Throughout her time in the Northern Territory she was also an active member if the local Girl Guides Association and helped establish a number of packs.\n\n\nLater life\nHeath retired to live in Western Australia in 1992 and died on 22 October 2011; at age 105.\nHeath Road (registered 17 July 1981), on the southern boundary of St. Mary's Hostel in named for Heath.\n\n\nHonours\nReceived a MBE for community service in 1968.\nReceived an Order of Merit from the Girl Guides Association in 1970.\nWas made an honorary Lady Canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Darwin, in 1982.\nWas named 'Centralian of the Year; with co-recipient Sue Ride in 1992.\n\n\nReferences",

After obtaining her degree, she worked as a postdoctoral researcher working with Allan Jacobson at Exxon Research and Engineering Company, before joining the University of Waterloo in the late 1980s, when she became interested in electrochemistry and Inorganic chemistry.\n\n\nResearch and career\nNazar works in materials chemistry at the University of Waterloo, where she designs energy storage devices and electrochemical systems. Her research group create new materials and nanostructures for lithium–sulfur batteries, including interwoven composites. She develops structural probes to understand how the morphology of materials that are capable of charge/ ionic redox processes impact their functions. These techniques include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrochemistry, AC Impedance Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. Nazar was a founding member of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology. Nazar is recognised as being a \"leading authority in advanced materials\". She was awarded a Canada Research Chair in 2004, which was renewed in 2008 and 2012. In 2009 Nazar joined the California Institute of Technology as a More Distinguished Scholar. In 2013 she was awarded a $1.8 million fellowship from the National Research Council to investigate energy storage materials for automotive applications.\nNazar is particularly interested in storage materials that go beyond lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, zinc ion batteries and magnesium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are the battery of choice in hybrid electric vehicles, but concerns have arisen about the global supply of lithium. Her early work developed porous carbon architectures as frameworks for cathodes, enhancing their conductivity and discharge capacity. She demonstrated that interwoven carbon composites could be used to improve the energy density of lithium–sulphur batteries. She showed it was possible to create mesoporous carbon frameworks that constrain the grown of sulphur nanofillers, which improved energy storage and reversibility.\nNazar calculated the low-cost lithium–sulphur batteries could take electric cars twice as far as current lithium-ion technologies. Sulphur is an abundant material that can be used to replace cobalt oxide in lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, sulphur can dissolve into the electrolyte solution, and be reduced by electrons to form polysulphides. They are also susceptible to high internal resistance and capacity fading on cycling. These challenges can be overcome by creating nanostructures in the electrodes. Interwoven composites can also be made from manganese dioxide, which stabilise polysuplphides in lithium–sulphur batteries. Manganese dioxide reduces sulphides via a surface-bound polythiosulphanates, and can withstand 2,000 discharge cycles without the loss of capacitance. She has also developed lithium oxygen batteries, which are lightweight with high energy density. In lithium oxygen batteries, superoxide and peroxide can act to degrade the cells; limiting their lifetime. If the electrolyte is replaced with a molten salt and the porous cathode with a bifunctional metal oxide, the peroxide does not form. Nazar has worked on supercapacitors and polyanion materials.\nShe was made a Professor at the University of Waterloo in 2016 and holds a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Solid State Energy Materials. Since 2014 Nazar has served on the board of directors of the International Meeting on Li-Batteries. She serves on the editorial boards of the journals Angewandte Chemie, Energy & Environmental Science and the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.\n\n\nAwards and honours\nHer awards and honours include;\n\n1978 Royal Society of Chemistry Undergraduate Award\n2010 Canadian Society for Chemistry Rio Tinto Alcan Award for Electrochemistry\n2011 International Battery Association Award\n2011 Royal Society of Canada Fellowship\n2012 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Distinguished Women in Chemistry\n2013 Society of German Chemists August-Wilhelm-von-Hofmann Lectureship\n2014 Web of Science Most Highly Cited Researchers\n2014 Thomson Reuters World's Most Influential Scientific Minds\n2015 Officer of the Order of Canada\n2017 University of Waterloo Outstanding Performance Award\n2018 Thomson Reuters Most Highly Cited Researchers\n2019 Chemical Institute of Canada Medal\n2020 Elected Fellow of the Royal Society\n2022 E.W.R.

    "text": "An Amerasian may refer to a person born in East or Southeast Asia to an East Asian or Southeast Asian mother and a U.S. military father. Other terms used include War babies or G.I. Babies. \nSeveral countries in East and Southeast Asia have significant populations of Amerasians, reflecting a history of US military presence within those two respective regions. These include Okinawa (Japan), South Korea, Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines. The latter once had the largest US air and naval bases outside the US mainland.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe term was coined by novelist Pearl S. Buck and was formalized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Many people were born to East or Southeast Asian women and U.S. servicemen during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The official definition of Amerasian came about as a result of Public Law 97-359, enacted by the 97th Congress of the United States on October 22, 1982.\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), an Amerasian is: \"[A]n alien who was born in Korea, Kampuchea, Laos, Thailand or Vietnam after December 31, 1950 and before October 22, 1982 and was fathered by a U.S. citizen.\" The Amerasian Foundation (AF) and Amerasian Family Finder (AFF) define an Amerasian as \"Any person who was fathered by a citizen of the United States (an American serviceman, American expatriate or U.S. Government Employee (Regular or Contract)) and whose mother is or was, an Asian National.\"\nThe term is commonly applied to half Japanese children fathered by a U.S. serviceman based in Japan, as well as half Korean children fathered by veterans of the Korean War or stationary soldiers in South Korea. The term is also applied to children of Filipinos and American rulers during the U.S. colonial period of the Philippines (still used until today) and children of Thais and U.S. soldiers during World War II and the Vietnam War. The U.S. had bases in Thailand during the Vietnam War.\nAmerasian should not be interpreted as a fixed racial term relating to a specific category of multiracial groups (such as Mestizo, Mulatto, Eurasian or Afro-Asians). The racial strain of the American parent of one Amerasian may be different from that of another Amerasian; it may be White, Black, Hispanic or even Asians in general. In the latter case, it is conceivable that the Amerasian could be fathered by a person who shares the same racial stock, but not necessarily the same nationality.\nIn certain cases, the term could also apply to the progency of American females, who engaged in professions such as military nursing for East and Southeast Asian males. Mixed-race children, whatever the occupational background or prestige of their parents, have suffered social stigma. With genetic relation to U.S. soldiers, Amerasians have faced additional exclusion by perceived association to being military enemies of East and Southeast Asian countries. This stigma extended to the mothers of Amerasians, majority of whom were Asian, causing many of the Asian mothers to abandon their Amerasian children. The abandonment of both parents led to a large proportion of orphaned Amerasians.\n\n\nCambodia\nThe Amerasian Immigration Act included Amerasians whose fathers were U.S. citizens and whose mothers were nationals of Kampuchea (Cambodia). As many as 10,000 Cambodians of mixed Amerasian ancestry may have been fathered by US servicemen.\n\n\nJapan\n\nAccording to one estimate, around 5,000 to 10,000 Amerasian babies had been born in Japan from 1945 to 1952. Data from the Japanese Welfare Ministry from July 1952, on the other hand, revealed that only 5,013 Japanese Amerasian children were born in all of Japan. Masami Takada from the Welfare Ministry put an exaggerated estimate of 150,000 – 200,000. Another investigation by the Welfare Ministry was conducted again in August 1953, this time them revising the number to reveal that only 3,490 half-castes of American fathers and Japanese mothers had been born during the 7 years of American occupation of Japan, which lasted from 1945 – 1952. Some of the children were abandoned and raised in orphanages such as the Elizabeth Saunders Home in Oiso, Japan.\nThe actual number of Japanese Amerasians is unknown. Officially, the number of 10,000 Amerasians in Japan would be an upper limit. Some contemporary writers had however reported rumors of 200,000 while actual numbers had been found to be 5,000, possibly 10,000, no more than 20,000 allowing for underestimates. Of those fathered by American soldiers. Their presumed \"colors\" were 86.1% \"white,\" 11.5% \"black\" and 2.5% \"unknown.\"\n\n\nHāfu\n\nToday, many Japanese Amerasians go by the term Hāfu, which is used to refer to a person who is half Japanese and half non-Japanese ancestry.\n\n\nAmerasian School of Okinawa\nIn Okinawa, The Amerasian School of Okinawa was formed to educate children of two different cultures. The school population includes Japanese Amerasians.\n\n\nLaos\nThe Amerasian Immigration Act included Amerasians whose fathers were U.S. citizens and whose mothers were nationals of Laos. The number of Laotian Amerasians is currently unknown.\n\n\nPhilippines\n\n\nThe Forgotten Amerasians\nSince 1898, when the United States annexed the Philippines from Spain, there were as many as 21 U.S. bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there. The bases closed in 1992 leaving behind thousands of Amerasian children. There are an estimated 52,000 Amerasians in the Philippines. According to an academic research paper presented in the U.S. (in 2012) by a Philippines Amerasian college research study unit, the number could be a lot more, possibly reaching 250,000, this is due the fact almost all generations of Amerasians intermarried with other Amerasians and Filipino natives. The newer Amerasians from the United States would add to the already older settlement of peoples from other countries in the Americas that happened when the Philippines was under Spanish rule. The  Philippines once received immigrants from Spanish-colonized Panama, Peru, and Mexico; which are all countries in the Americas.\nUnlike their counterparts in other countries, American-Asians or Amerasians in the Philippines remain impoverished and neglected. A study by the University of the Philippines' Center for Women Studies found that many Amerasians have experienced some form of abuse and/or domestic violence. The findings cited cases of racial, gender and class discrimination that Amerasian children and youth suffer from strangers, peers, classmates and teachers. The study also said black Amerasians seem to suffer more from racial and class discrimination than their white-descended counterparts.\nTwo-thirds of Amerasian children are raised by single mothers, others by relatives and non-relatives. 6% live on their own or in institutions, and 90% were born out of wedlock. It was reported in 1993 that prostitutes are increasingly Amerasian (especially black amerasian females), and frequently children of prostitutes who are caught in a cycle that transcends generations.\n\n\nLegal action\nIn 1982, the U.S. passed the Amerasian Immigration Act, giving preferential immigration status to Amerasian children born during the Vietnam Conflict. The act did not apply to Amerasians born in the Philippines. They can become United States citizens only if claimed by their fathers; most fathers fail to do so. To become citizens of the United States, Filipino Amerasians must be able to show proof of parentage by a U.S. citizen before they turn eighteen years old; most are unable to do so before that cut off age.\nA class-action suit was filed in 1993 on their behalf in the International Court of Complaints in Washington, DC, to establish Filipino American children's rights to assistance. The court denied the claim, ruling that the children were born to unmarried women who provided sexual services to U.S. service personnel in the Philippines and who were therefore engaged in illicit acts of prostitution. Such illegal activity could not be the basis for any legal claim.\nIn 2012, the number of Amerasians descended from American servicemen in the Philippines or “G.I. babies” was estimated to be around 250,000.\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSince the Korean War, there has been a significant population of Amerasians in South Korea. Many Amerasians were born into \"Camptowns\" which were established by the South Korean government. The women in these Camptowns were affected by the post-war poverty and turned to prostitution with American soldiers. This perpetuated the stereotype that children born in Camptowns were mothered by prostitutes. The South Korean government never viewed Korean Amerasians as Korean citizens but encouraged the foreign adoption of mixed South Korean babies. In 1953 the United States Congress passed the Refugee Relief Act, which allowed 4000 Amerasians to emigrate to the US for adoption. This group became commonly known as Korean Adoptees. They were part of the International adoption of South Korean children that made up roughly 160,000 adoptees.\n\n\nAmerasian Christian Academy\nThe Amerasian Christian Academy still educates Amerasian children today in Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea.\n\n\nTaiwan\nUS soldiers fathered children in Taiwan at the end of World War II. Today there are an estimated 1,000 Taiwanese Amerasians. Over 200,000 American soldiers in Korea and Vietnam visited Taiwan for rest and relaxation between 1950 and 1975.\n\n\nThailand\n\nIn Thailand, Amerasian children are dubbed as Luk khrueng or half children in the Thai language. These Amerasians were fathered by US soldiers who took part in the Vietnam War. At the height of the Vietnam War, 50,000 GIs were based in Thailand. The Pearl S. Buck Foundation estimated around 5,000-8,000 Thai Amerasians. Some migrated to the United States under the 1982 Amerasian Immigration Act. An unknown number were left behind. \"I had trouble at school. I was teased and bullied a lot because of my skin color,\" says entertainer Morris Kple Roberts, who had an African American father and a Thai mother.\n\n\nSearches\nUS veteran, Gene Ponce, helps American fathers find their Thai Amerasian children. He has recently used popular DNA services, such as Ancestry.com to help match Amerasians with their relatives in the US.\n\n\nVietnam\n\n \nThe exact number of Amerasians in Vietnam is not known. The U.S. soldiers stationed in Vietnam had relationships with local women, many of whom had origins in nightclubs, brothels and pubs. The American Embassy once reported there were fewer than 1,000 Amerasians. A report by the South Vietnamese Senate Subcommittee suggested there are 15,000 to 20,000 children of mixed European American and Vietnamese ancestry, but this figure was considered low. Congress estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Amerasians by 1975 lived in Vietnam. According to Amerasians Without Borders, they estimated about 25,000 to 30,000 Vietnamese Amerasians were born from American first participation in Vietnam in 1962 and lasted until 1975. Although during the Operation Babylift it was estimated at 23,000. In April 1975, Operation Babylift was initiated in South Vietnam to relocate Vietnamese children, many orphans and those of mixed American-Vietnamese parentage (mostly Vietnamese mothers and American serviceman fathers), to the United States and find American families who would take them in. The crash of the first flight of Operation Babylift led to the death of 138 people, 78 of which were children. During the operation, they estimated over 3,000 Amerasians were evacuated from South Vietnam; however, more than 20,000 Amerasians remained.\nIn July 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) created the Orderly Departure Program in order to mitigate safer travel conditions for Vietnamese refugees to various nations after the Vietnam War. However, since its inception to mid 1982, only 23 Amerasians successfully emigrated under the Orderly Departure Program. By October 1982, there was more hope for Amerasian emigration as the largest group of 11 Amerasian children, aged seven to fifteen, departed from Vietnam to immigrate to the U.S.\nIn 1982, the U.S. Congress passed the Amerasian Immigration Act in an attempt to grant Amerasian immigration to the U.S. However, the Amerasian Immigration Act provided great emigration difficulty for many Vietnamese Amerasians, due to a lack of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vietnamese government. This was due to a clause in the Amerasian Immigration Act that required documentation of the fathers in the U.S. in order for the Vietnamese Amerasians to acquire a visa. However, around 500 Amerasians were still able to safely immigrate to the U.S. between 1982 and 1983 due to Hanoi's cooperating with the U.S. In 1988, U.S. Congress passed the American Homecoming Act, aiming to grant citizenship to Vietnamese Amerasians born between 1962 and 1975. By 1994, more than 75,000 Amerasians and their family from Vietnam immigrated to the U.S. The American Homecoming act eventually led to 23,000 Amerasians and 67,000 of their relatives immigrating to the U.S. For the Vietnamese Amerasians, this meant that their migration to the U.S. occurred as teenagers, leading to struggles in the resettlement process. A study in 1994 found that 22% of Amerasian men and 18% of Amerasian women residing in the U.S. reported physical or sexual abuse. By 2018, at least 400 Amerasians still currently reside Vietnam through DNA testing of 500 people by the nonprofit organization Amerasians Without Borders.\n\n\nVietnamese Amerasian Search Organizations\nUp to the 2000s, many Vietnamese Amerasians were still not reunited with their fathers. Some Amerasians still resided in Vietnam unable to obtain the necessary documents to emigrate to the US. Organizations such as the Amerasian Child Find Network, run by Clint Haines and AAHope Foundation, run by Jonathan Tinquist, helped American fathers reunite with their Amerasian children. Both are Vietnam Vets.\nOther organizations that helped with Amerasian, Adoptee and family searches included the Adopted Vietnamese International (AVI) (Indigo Willing) and Operation Reunite (Trista Goldberg). The only current active US organization seeking to reunite Amerasians is Amerasian Without Borders (AWB) run by Jimmy Miller, a Vietnamese Amerasian based in the US.\n\n\nNotable Vietnamese Amerasians\nJohnathon Franklin Freeman was a film producer, actor and production manager born in Saigon, Vietnam to a Vietnamese mother and an American serviceman. His mother sent Johnathan and his sister to an orphanage where they were eventually sent to the US as part of Operation Babylift. He was married to Kim Fields from 1995 to 2001. In February 2007, the Amerasian Family Finder cooperating with the Amerasian Foundation found his mother in Saigon who he reunited in May 2007. He died on August 21, 2020.\nPhi Nhung - Phạm Phi Nhung was born on 10 April 1970 in Pleiku, Vietnam to a Vietnamese mother and an American serviceman father. She was a singer who specialized in Dan Ca and Tru Tinh music. On 26 August 2021 she was hospitalized to Cho Ray Hospital after contracting COVID-19. About a month later, her health took a turn for the worse. Phi Nhung died on 28 September 2021 due to COVID-19 complications.\nThanh Hà - Trương Minh Hà was born in Đà Nẵng, Vietnam to a Vietnamese mother and an American serviceman father of German origin. She is a Vietnamese American singer known under the stage name as Thanh Hà.\n\n\nInternational Amerasian Day\nMarch 4 has been designated as Amerasian Day in the Philippines. The Amerasian Foundation has designated it as International Amerasian Day.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 1957 film Sayonara features a Japanese woman who falls in love with a white serviceman and they talk about having mixed children together.\nIn the anime and manga franchise Great Mazinger (\"Guretto Majinga\" in Japanese), the character of Jun Honoo is the daughter of a Japanese woman and a U.S. African American serviceman. As such, she had to endure stigma and racism during her youth due to her status as \"hafu\" and her darker skin compared to Amerasians born from white parents.\nIn the 1972 TV series M*A*S*H, episode 15 of season 8, \"Yessir, That's Our Baby\", Hawkeye and BJ attempt to send an Amerasian baby to the United States, facing difficulty at every step of the way. With no other viable solution, they act on Father Mulcahy's advice and take the baby to a monastery in the dead of night to provide her with safety and care.\n\"Straight to Hell\", a song by rock music group the Clash, considers the plight of Vietnam War Amerasians.\nThe 1977 movie Green Eyes starred Paul Winfield as a Vietnam War veteran who returns to Vietnam in search of the son he fathered with a Vietnamese woman.\nThe Chuck Norris film Braddock: Missing in Action III (1988) depicted Amerasian children trapped in Vietnam; Norris plays the father of an Amerasian child who believes that his Vietnamese wife died during the Fall of Saigon.\nIn the 1984 TV series Highway to Heaven, episode 11 of season 1, titled \"Dust Child,\" the two lead characters Jonathan, played by Michael Landon and Mark, played by Victor French, help an Amerasian girl facing racial prejudice when she goes to live with her father's family in the United States.\nIn the 1988 TV series In the Heat of the Night, episode 9 of season 3, titled \"My Name is Hank,\" an Amerasian teenager named Hank believes that he was fathered by a deceased police officer once employed by the Sparta, Mississippi police department.\nThe Oscar-nominated 1995 film Dust of Life tells the story of Son, a boy with a Vietnamese mother and African American father, who is interned in a Re-education camp.\nIn the 1997 animated television sitcom King of the Hill, Hank discovers that he has an Amerasian brother living in Japan.\nIn the 1999 American Vietnamese language film Three Seasons, James Hager, played by Harvey Keitel, searches for his Vietnamese Amerasian daughter in hopes of \"coming to peace with this place\".\nThe 2001 novel The Unwanted by Kien Nguyen is a memoir about the author's experience growing up as an Amerasian in Vietnam until he emigrates to the United States at age eighteen.\nDaughter from Đà Nẵng is a 2002 award-winning documentary film about an Amerasian woman who returns to visit her biological family in Đà Nẵng, Vietnam after 22 years of separation and living in the United States.\nThe musical Miss Saigon focuses on a young Vietnamese woman who falls in love with an American GI and later has his child after the Fall of Saigon.\nThe 2004 film The Beautiful Country is about an Amerasian boy (played by Damien Nguyen) who leaves his native Vietnam to find his father.\nIn 2007 at TED, Photographer Rick Smolan's The Story of a Girl tells the unforgettable story of a young Amerasian girl, a fateful photograph and an adoption saga with a twist.\nThe 2010 documentary Left by the Ship which aired on PBS Independent Lens in May 2012, follows the lives of four modern Filipino Amerasians for two years, showing the struggle to overcome the stigma related to their birth.\nThe 2014 movie Noble, tells the true life story of Christina Noble, who overcomes the harsh difficulties of her childhood in Ireland to find her calling by helping the Bụi Dời (Vietnamese Amerasians) on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.\nIn the 2017 book, The Rebirth of Hope: My Journey from Vietnam War Child to American Citizen, by Sau Le Hudecek, the author recalls the trials she endured growing up in post-war Vietnam as a daughter of an American GI.\nIn 2018, Dateline NBC aired Father's Day, where a Vietnamese Amerasian woman takes a DNA test hoping to learn more about her family tree.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nListed in chronological order:\n\nSturdevant, Saundra Pollack, and Brenda Stoltzfus, Let the Good Times Roll: Prostitution and the U.S. Military in Asia, New Pr, January 1, 1993.

    "text": "Vladimir \"Geza\" Šenauer (also spelled Schönauer; 29 November 1930 – 5 January 2013) was a Croatian and Yugoslav professional footballer.\n\n\nEarly life and family\nŠenauer was born in Split, Littoral Banovina, to Geza Schönauer, Jewish leather merchant from Daruvar, and Zorka (née Rakelić), Split born Catholic. He was raised Jewish by his family. His father owned the boutique and newsstand in Split. During World War II, officer of the Italian army protected the Schönauer family from persecutions. In 1943, he advised them to leave Split before the arrival of Nazis and Ustaše. In September 1943, the Independent State of Croatia took over the Split from the Italian fascists, so Šenauer and his family escaped to hide on the island of Vis. Soon after they escaped to Bari, Italy. Šenauer's paternal grandmother, most of his closer and wider family were killed during the Holocaust. Šenauer returned to Split in 1947, few days before his father.\n\n\nFootball career\nHe spend most of his career playing for his hometown club HNK Hajduk Split winning with them 3 national championships. He also won one national cup in the period in between while he was playing with OFK Belgrade, curiously winning in the final against his former club, Hajduk. Before ending his career he also had a spell abroad with SK Austria Klagenfurt, before returning to finish his career playing with RNK Split. He was known for his speed and excellent execution of free kicks. After retiring he was an active member in the direction board of Hajduk, and between 1979 and 1990 he was the director of the Hajduk stadium, Poljud.\nHe made two appearances for the Yugoslav B national team, both in 1951, first in Tunis, on 14 October, against Tunisia (7–3 win with Šenauer scoring the lat goal), and second in Sfax, on 16 October, against South Tunisia (5–0 win).\n\n\nDeath\nŠenauer died on 5 January 2013 in Split, and was buried at the Lovrinac Cemetery.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCareer story at Nogometni Leksikon.",

    "text": "Hasegawa Shigure (長谷川 時雨; 1879–1941) was a Japanese playwright and editor of a literary journal. Hasegawa was the only woman to be featured in three volumes of the Meiji bungaku zenshū (\"Collected works of Meiji literature\"), a collection published by Chikuma Shobō, and she had the title joryū bundan no ōgosho (\"great writer of the woman’s literary community’\"); Barbara Hartley, author of \"The space of childhood memories: Hasegawa Shigure and Old Nihonbashi,\" cited these facts when describing Hasegawa as \"a major literary figure\" of the era prior to World War II.\nHartley wrote that \"Shigure’s work has been largely overlooked in English-language scholarship\" and that this may have been due to a perception that she supported militaristic elements that existed in Japan before World War II.\nHer family members; second husband, Mikami Otokichi (三上 於菟吉); and good friends, including Onoe Kikugorō VI (六代目 尾上 菊五郎); all called her O-Yatchan.\n\n\nEarly life\nShe was born as Hasegawa Yasu (長谷川 ヤス) in Tōriabura-chō in Nihonbashi; Tōriabura-chō is currently a part of Ōdenma-chō. Her parents were merchants; her mother came from a hatamoto family, while her father practiced law and was one of the first to do so in a modern manner in Japan. She was the oldest child and had two brothers and four sisters, including Haruko Hasegawa. Her work Old Tale Nihonbashi documents her childhood. She received exposure to literature through a live-in apprentice even though her mother opposed education for girls.\nFor a period Hasegawa worked in the service of a nobleperson. Her father forced her to marry at age 19. Hartley wrote that the forcing of the marriage was a \"bitter\" and that it \"further heightened Shigure’s sense of the social injustices visited upon women.\" Her first husband was the second son of a businessman who owned a mining company.\nShe began writing around the time of her first marriage. Hartley stated that Hasegawa became the era's first \"acknowledged\" female kabuki playwright in 1905. In 1914 she began caring for the son of one of her brothers, Toratarō; the boy's name was Hitoshi. In 1915 Hasegawa began providing financial support for her family after the failure of her mother's businesses and the decline of her father's reputation due to having an involvement in a business scandal described by Hartley as \"peripheral\". In 1916 she met Mikami Otokichi (三上 於菟吉), who became her second husband. He wrote serial fiction. Hasegawa's father died in 1918. In 1919 she and Mikami began living together as part of a common law marriage.\nIn 1923 Hasegawa and Okada Yachiyo (岡田 八千代) began efforts to establish a literary magazine which was launched in 1928. The journal was named Nyonin geijutsu (\"Women and the Arts\"). The funds came from Mikami's royalties; he had suggested buying Hasegawa a diamond ring but she asked instead to give her 20,000 yen so she could establish the magazine. Hartley wrote that Hasegawa was the \"principal moving force\" behind this journal.\n\n\nWriting style\nHasegawa's plays were written for kabuki stages. Rebecca L. Copeland, editor of Woman Critiqued: Translated Essays on Japanese Women's Writing, stated that these plays \"resisted clichéd tragic endings and featured heroines who strove for self-fulfillment and independence.\"\nM. Cody Poulton, the author of A Beggar's Art: Scripting Modernity in Japanese Drama, 1900-1930, wrote that Tamotsu Watanabe (渡辺 保 Watanabe Tamotsu), a critic of kabuki works, had \"expressed his shock at how dark Shigure's modern plays were\".\n\n\nWorks\nPlays:\n\nChōji midare (\"Wavering traces\", 1911) - Translated into English in 1996\nOne Afternoon (1912) \nThe Dog (1923) \nTegona (1941) - It is a lyrical one act play. In the play, based on a legend, a woman encounters two men who wish to marry her, but she chooses to kill herself. According to Poulton, it \"is more typical of Shigure's kabuki plays.\" Mori Ōgai's The Ikuta River (生田川 Ikutagawa) is derived from the same legend that this play is derived from.\nRain of Ice - the story of the final hours of a dying woman.\nOther works:\n\nOld Tale Nihonbashi\nHasegawa Shigure wrote a fictionalized biography of Tazawa Inabune as part of Shuntaiki - Meiji Taishō josei shō (\"A springtime account - Portraits of women of Meiji and Taishō\"), a seven-part series that was serialized in Tokyo Asahi. Melek Ortabasi, author of \"Tazawa Inabune (1874-1896)\", wrote that compared to the Yomiuri Shimbun series about Inabune, this was \"more sympathetic\".\nCollections:\n\nHasegawa, Shigure.

    "text": "Jonkheer Aarnout Alexander Loudon (10 December 1936 – 9 September 2021) was a Dutch corporate executive and politician of the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).\nBorn in The Hague, he spent several years of his childhood in Japanese internment camps in the Dutch East Indies during World War II. He studied Dutch law at Utrecht University, and he began his career at Mees & Hope bank after his military service. In 1969, Loudon started working for the chemical conglomerate Akzo. He was its chief executive officer (CEO) from 1982 until 1994, when the company merged with Nobel. He served one term in the Senate between 1995 and 1999, and he sat on several supervisory boards, including those of AkzoNobel, ABN AMRO, and Royal Dutch Shell.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nLoudon was born in 1936 in The Hague into a prominent family of diplomats and entrepreneurs. He bore the predicate \"jonkheer\", as his family had been ennobled because of his great-grandfather James Loudon's tenure as Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Loudon's parents were Hugo Loudon and Henriëtte Snouck Hurgronje, and he had a younger brother called Francis.\nLoudon grew up in the Dutch East Indies, where his father worked as a civil servant in the governor-general's office in Batavia. The colony was occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and his family was sent to an internment camp around Batavia in 1942. His father was split from the family later in 1942, and his mother tasked Loudon with carrying a bronze horse belonging to his father when they switched camps. His father died in September 1944 when the hell ship Jun'yō Maru was accidentally sunk by a British torpedo. Loudon has credited his mother with reducing trauma from that period, and he held on to his father's bronze horse after the war.\nHe attended elementary school in The Hague, and he received secondary education at the Vrijzinnig-Christelijk Lyceum starting in 1949, graduating with a gymnasium diploma. Loudon went on to study Dutch law at Utrecht University until December 1961, and he was a member of the Utrechtsch Studenten Corps. He was subsequently conscripted into the army, and he remained a reserve first lieutenant of the horse artillery until 1964.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nAkzo\nLoudon started his career in 1964 at Mees & Hope bank. He wanted to switch to a larger bank after a while, but he told that banks would not hire each other's personnel at the time. In February 1969, he switched to the finance department of Royal Salt-Organon (KZO), which merged into the chemical conglomerate Akzo that same year. He later served as finance director for Astral, Akzo's coatings business in France, and he became president of Akzo Brazil in 1975. Loudon was vice chair of Akzo's board of directors starting in May 1978.\n\nHe became chairman in May 1982, when the company had 80,000 employees and was among the largest industrial companies of the Netherlands. During his tenure, Akzo grew into a major player in the international chemical sector, and its profit reached ƒ954 million in 1989, up from ƒ165 million when the took over. The company spent several billion guilders on acquisitions, and it sold off other parts including its consumer products. Its fibres business unit faced persistent issues, generating little profit despite significant investments. Loudon called the unit one of Akzo's crown jewels, and he refused to divest. He stayed on as CEO until April 1994, shortly after the company merged with the Swedish company Nobel. He hoped that the merger would unify the organisation, describing Akzo's fragmented structure—shaped by mergers and acquisitions—as its greatest weakness. His earlier attempts to create a shared company culture led to him being called \"Mister Akzo\", and they were sometimes discarded as \"centralist\". Under his leadership, a new company logo depicting a man with his arms spread was introduced in 1988.\nWhile serving as CEO, Loudon sat on the executive board of the Confederation of Netherlands Industry, the board of directors of IBM Europe, the supervisory boards of De Nederlandsche Bank and the Royal Netherlands Blast Furnaces and Steelworks (1992–2002), and the international councils of J.P. Morgan & Co. and Allianz. Following his tenure, he stayed on as chair of AkzoNobel's supervisory board until 2005. Along with his successor as CEO, Kees van Lede, he publicly criticised the company's leadership in 2021, saying that it should bolster the finances of its pension fund.\n\n\nPolitics and supervisory committees\nLoudon had become a member of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in July 1977. When asked in 1994 by Frits Bolkestein to join the first Kok cabinet as Minister of Finance, he declined. He was elected to the Senate in May 1995, and he was sworn in on 13 June. He was his party's spokesperson for economic affairs and the environment, and his term ended on 7 June 1999. In a 2007 interview, Loudon called Henk Kamp his favourite VVD politician, and he rejected the more populist discourse of party members Rita Verdonk and Geert Wilders.\nFollowing his retirement from AkzoNobel, he received the nickname \"emperor of supervisors\" for his membership of the supervisory boards of ABN AMRO (chair; 1994–2006), Royal Dutch Shell (1997–2007), Hollandsche Beton Groep (chair; 1995–2002), Heidemij (1994–1999), and NYSE Euronext. He was also on the advisory boards of Cinven and Lehman Brothers. Loudon served as the inaugural chair of the organisation committee of Veterans' Day from 2004 until 2007, and he served on the supervisory board of the Royal Concertgebouw and as vice chair of Vereniging Rembrandt.\nWhile he led the supervisory board of Hollandsche Beton Group, the body favoured a merger with Ballast Nedam. A group of activist shareholders preferred a merger with Boskalis, and the Enterprise Chamber subsequently concluded that the supervisory board had mistreated the shareholders. The verdict was reversed by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. In 2003, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code was released, strengthening the position of shareholders. Loudon criticised the document, arguing that the required transparency regarding management compensation led to an upward spiral in CEO salaries, and he stepped down from several boards in the years following. Loudon gave up his last position in 2008 at the Royal Concertgebouw. Following his tenure at ABN AMRO, the bank was split in 2007 and nationalised during the 2008 financial crisis. He was blamed for not doing enough to mediate conflicts within the board of directors. Loudon later said he was disappointed in the Dutch government and the bank's leadership for letting a proposed merger with ING Group fall through, as he believed it could have prevented both events.\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nHe married Thalita Boon on 7 September 1962 in Wassenaar, and they had two sons, Hendrik and Hugo. Loudon lived in Velp around 1997, and he was a Reformed Christian. Loudon collected art, and he rode horses, participating in cross-country, concours hippique, and dressage competitions. He headed the organising committee of the 1994 FEI World Equestrian Games in The Hague, which had a budget of ƒ23 million and was the largest sporting event in the Netherlands since the 1928 Summer Olympics. He also enjoyed drag hunting, being chair and honorary member of the Royal Dutch Hunters' Association.\nHe died in The Hague, his place of residence, on 9 September 2021 at the age of 84 after a short illness. In obituaries in de Volkskrant and Het Financieele Dagblad, Loudon was referred to as a captain of industry and \"amongst the most influential directors of the Dutch business community in the past decades.\"\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\nHonours\n\n Brazil: Commander of the Order of the Southern Cross (1983)\n Netherlands: Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (1985)\n Portugal: Grand Officer of the Order of Merit (1991)\n Netherlands: Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau (1994)\n Netherlands: Gold Decoration of Merit (2007)\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Aarnout Loudon at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "Video Encoded Invisible Light (VEIL) is a technology for encoding low-bandwidth digital data bitstream in video signal, developed by VEIL Interactive Technologies. VEIL is compatible with multiple formats of video signals, including PAL, SECAM, and NTSC. The technology is based on a steganographically encoded data stream in the luminance of the videosignal.\nA recent application of VEIL, the VEIL Rights Assertion Mark (VRAM or V-RAM) is a copy-restriction signal that can be used to ask devices to apply DRM technology. This has been seen as analogous to the broadcast flag. It is also known as \"CGMS-A plus VEIL\" and \"broadcast flag on steroids.\"\nThere are two versions of VEIL on the market:\n\nVEIL-I, or VEIL 1, has raw speed of 120 bits per second. It is used for unidirectional communication (TV→devices) with simple devices or toys, and to deliver coupons with TV advertising. It manipulates the luminance of the video signal in ways difficult to perceive to human eye.\nVEIL-II, or VEIL 2, has speed of 7200-bit/s and is one of the technologies of choice for interactive television, as it allows communication with VEIL servers through devices equipped with backchannels. VEIL-II-capable set-top boxes can communicate with other devices via WiFi, Bluetooth, or other short-range wireless technologies. VEIL 2 manipulates the average luminance of the alternate lines of the signal, where one is slightly raised and the other one is slightly lowered (or vice versa), encoding a bit in every pair of lines.\nThe symbols (groups of 4 data bits) transmitted by VEIL-II system are encoded as \"PN sequences\", sequences of 16 \"chips\". Groups of 4 chips are encoded in pairs of lines. Each line pair is split to 4 parts, where the luminance is raised or lowered (correspondingly vice versa in the other line). In NTSC, 4-bit symbols are encoded in groups of 8 scan lines. With 224 lines per field this equals 112 bits per field, or 7200 bits per second of broadcast. VEIL-II uses scan lines 34 to 258. The PN stands for \"pseudo noise\" and signifies the 0.5/0.5 relative frequencies of ones and zeroes. In practice, 20 chips per line are preferred, increasing redundancy and allowing for better error detection. The PN encoding is a form of spread spectrum modulation.\nStripping the VEIL signal from the video is supposed to be more difficult than tampering with the VBI, therefore VEIL-I is proposed as a DRM tool. The signal can survive recording to video, and various sorts of digital compression. The detection devices are low-cost and can be used in a range of devices, from toys to cellphones.\n\n\nUse in toys\nThe technology was developed for The Batman TV series, for transmitting data from the video on-screen to a line of Batman toys based on the series, supplying them with information about the series and unlocking their hidden capabilities.\nFor example:\n\nThe Batwave Communicator Handheld Device, when within 10 feet in the line of sight from the TV, will show engine graphics, diagnostics, weapon systems, and enables various games stored in the device.\nBatwave Batman Action Figure will pop wings from its back and light up the emblem on its chest when subjected to the videosignal from the TV.\nBatwave Batmobile with Handheld Device will turn on various LEDs acting as its lights, play sounds, and \"capture\" various weapons from the show.\nThis technology is also used in other toys, for example Toby Terrier.\nVEIL was used in various ad campaigns for Foster's Lager. The campaign incorporated the use of VEIL decoders inside little figures of the famous cricket players Boon and Shane Warne. The toys would make comments during the cricket matches while in front of the television.\n\n\nOther uses\nAs of December 2005, VEIL was proposed as a DRM tool to counter the analog hole, as a technological measure legally enforced by the US Digital Content Security Act. In this regard, it is a more fine-grained successor to Macrovision.\nVEIL acts together with CGMS-A signal in the vertical blanking interval, where it is used to encode the Rights Assertion Mark (RAM) signal. The CGMS-A can be stripped too easily from the analog signal, therefore the presence of RAM but absence of CGMS-A will tell the copy protection system to deny the copy.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nVEIL Interactive Technologies\nU.S. patent 6,094,228 Method for transmitting data on viewable portion of a video signal, July 25, 2000\nUnited States Patent 6,229,572 Method for transmitting data on viewable portion of a video signal, May 8, 2001\nUnited States Patent 6,661,905 Method for transmitting data on a viewable portion of a video signal, December 9, 2003\nUnited States Patent 6,992,726 Method and system for enhanced modulation of video signals, January 31, 2006\nUnited States Patent Application Method and system for embedding device positional data in video signals, March 10, 2005",

He played for Leyton Orient in the English Football League. In 2009, Stephens refused to play for Newport County again after opposition striker, Stuart Douglas, received racist abuse from Newport fans in the stadium.\nHe has since embarked on a career as an internet personality, under the name \"Stevo the Madman\". After gaining attention for his comedy videos on Snapchat, he has since made appearances on various television shows.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nLeyton Orient\nStephens started his footballing career at Football League Third Division side Leyton Orient as a trainee in 2001. He made his first of four league appearances for the club, all of them away from home, in a 3–2 defeat away to York City on 9 November 2002, a game in which he received a booking. His second appearance was on 18 March 2003 in a 3–1 defeat at A.F.C. Bournemouth, in which he was substituted in the 89th minute for Gabriel Zakuani. His final appearance in the 2002–03 season was in a 1–0 defeat at Southend United on 22 March 2003, coming on as a substitute in the 65th minute for Simon Downer.\nHis final league appearance for the club would be in the 2003–04 season when he came on as an 82nd minute substitute for Matt Joseph in a 1–1 draw at Mansfield Town on 16 August 2003. Stephens was then loaned out for one month to Billericay Town in the Isthmian League Premier Division, after impressing in a pre-season friendly between Orient and Billericay.\nHe went on to play for Redbridge, Enfield Town, Chelmsford City, and Boreham Wood.\n\n\nNewport County\nStephens was one of three defenders manager Dean Holdsworth brought with him from Isthmian League Division One North club Redbridge to Conference South side Newport County at the start of the 2008-09 season, along with left-back David Collins and centre-back Nick Skelton. In his first two months at the club, he was regarded as their most consistent and impressive outfield player. However, just three months after signing, all three former Redbridge players were released by Newport County. Holdsworth wanted to keep Stephens, but the board decided that paying his travel expenses from his home in London would not be feasible.\nStephens was re-signed by the club later in the same season . He left the club in March 2009 after vowing to never play for them again after hearing racist chants from his own fans directed at Bath City striker Stuart Douglas in Newport's 4–0 loss at home to Bath.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nMedia career\nWhile working as a recovery driver, Stephens constantly filmed his day-to-day life as a 'van man' which saw the inception of 'StevoTheMadMan'. Stephens has been featured on numerous TV shows. Between 2016 and 2020, he was a regular host of a YouTube series for JD Sports called Take a Bow. The show saw its hosts discuss the latest football news, matches and gossip on a weekly basis.\nIn January 2019, Stephens, coupled with music artist Big Narstie finished 3rd in the fourth series of Celebrity Coach Trip.\nDuring December 2019, Stephens also starred in the Come Dine with Me Christmas special in a bid to win £1,000 for charity over a week of competitive cooking and hosting.  Also in December 2019, Stephens appeared on comedy, music and talk show The Big Narstie Show with friend Big Narstie and comedian Mo Gilligan where they discussed his content and upcoming projects.\nHe covered the 2020 Super Bowl for BBC Sport on the opening night - interviewing the players, teams and coaches ahead of the game.\nIn June 2021, Stephens was a featured artist on the song Come On England by Plain Old Kev. The music video for the song has cameos from former England international footballers Rio Ferdinand, Peter Crouch and Sol Campbell, as well as music artists Example, Olly Murs, Joel Corry and Danny Howard. The song peaked at #78 on the British iTunes Chart.\nIn February 2022, it was announced that Stephens would be part of the cast of E4 cooking show Celebrity Cooking School.\n\n\nOther ventures\nIn the early 2000s, Stephens was a record producer under the stage name Stevo and was affiliated with the grime production crew The Beatcamp, whose other members included P Jam, \"Pow! (Forward)\" producer Dexplicit, and Skilz. He was signed non-exclusively to Dice Recordings, who are best known for their work with Big Narstie as well as the release of Skepta's instrumental EP DTI and Jme and D Double E's collaboration \"Serious Thugs\".\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nKevin Stephens at Soccerbase \nStevoTheMadMan on Instagram\nStevo the Madman at IMDb",

    "text": ".eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for any person, company or organization based in the European Union. This was extended to the European Economic Area in 2014, after the regulation was incorporated into the EEA Agreement, and hence is also available for any person, company or organization based in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEstablishment\nThe .eu ccTLD was approved by ICANN on 22 March 2005 and put in the Internet root zone on 2 May 2005. Even though the EU is not a country (it is a sui generis intergovernmental and supranational organisation), it has an exceptional reservation in ISO 3166. The Commission and ICANN had extended negotiations lasting more than five years to secure its acceptance.\n.eu.int was the subdomain most used by the European Commission and the European Parliament, based on the .int generic top-level domain (gTLD) for international bodies, until 9 May 2006. The .eu domain (ccTLD) was launched in December 2005, and because of this most .eu.int domain names changed to .europa.eu on Europe day, 9 May 2006.\n\n\nSunrise period\nThe sunrise period was broken into two phases. The first phase, which began on 7 December 2005 was to facilitate applications by registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names. The second phase began on 7 February 2006 and covered company, trade and personal names. In the case of all Sunrise applications, the application needed to be accompanied by documents proving the claim to ownership of a certain right. The decision was then made by PricewaterhouseCoopers Belgium, which had been chosen as the validation agent by EURid.\nOn 7 February 2006, the registry was opened for company, trade and personal names. In the first 15 minutes, there were 27,949 total applications, and after one hour, 71,235.\n\n\nLandrush\nOn 7 April 2006 at 11 am CET registration became possible for non-trademark holders. Most people requesting domains had asked their registrars to put their requested domains in a queue, ensuring the best chance to register a domain. This way more than 700,000 domains were registered during the first 4 hours of operation. Some large registrars like GoDaddy and small registrars like Dotster suffered from long queues and unresponsiveness, allowing people to 'beat the queue' by registering through a registrar that had already processed its queue. By August 2006, 2 Million .eu domains had been registered. It was then fourth-largest ccTLD in Europe, after .de, .uk and .nl, and is one of the largest internationally.\nThe number of .eu domain registrations during the year after the landrush 7 April 2006 to 6 April 2007 seems to have peaked at approximately 2.6 million .eu domains. The market adjustment that follows a landrush in any domain name extension ensures that the number of registered domains will fall as many speculative domain registrations that failed to be resold will not be renewed. This is sometimes referred to as the Junk Dump. On the morning of 7 April 2007, the number of active .eu domains stood at 2,590,160 with approximately 15,000 domains having been deleted since 5 April 2007.\n\n\nStabilisation\nApproximately 1.5 million .eu domains were up for renewal in April 2007. The EURid registry software is based on the DNS.be software and domains are physically renewed at the end of the month of their anniversary of registration. This process differs from more sophisticated registries like that of .com TLD and other ccTLDs that operate on a daily basis. As with any post-landrush phase, an extension shrinks as the Junk Dump takes effect.\nOver one year after the launch of .eu (5 July 2007), the number of .de domains registered was 11,079,557 according to the German .de registry's statistics page, while number of German owned .eu domains according to EURid's statistics page was 796,561. The number of .uk domains registered was 6,038,732 according to .uk registry Nominet's statistics page. The number of apparently UK owned .eu domains was 344,584.\nThe extent of the shrinkage of .eu ccTLD is difficult to estimate because EURid does not publish detailed statistics on the number of new domains registered each day. Instead it provides only a single figure for the number of active domains. The number of new registrations are combined with numbers of domains registered. Approximately 250,000 .eu domains were either deleted or moved into quarantine by 30 April 2007. In the intervening years the renewal rate has stabilised to approximately 80%, which is above the industry average.\n\n\nBrexit\nOn 29 March 2018, as a consequence of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, it was announced that \"as of the withdrawal date, undertakings and organisations that are established in the United Kingdom but not in the EU, and natural persons who reside in the United Kingdom will no longer be eligible to register .eu domain names or, if they are .eu registrants, to renew .eu domain names registered before the withdrawal date\". The commission announced on 27 April 2018 that it would like to open registration to all EU and EEA citizens, including those living outside the EU. The Parliament, the council, and the Commission reached an agreement on this in December 2018, and the corresponding regulation passed the Parliament on 31 January 2019.\nThe 317,000 British .eu domain names were subject to Brexit negotiations because the .eu domain is reserved for European Union use. The .eu Brexit would have occurred on 30 March 2020, in case of no deal, but had since been postponed to January 2021. The UK-EU free trade deal does not cover .eu domains.\nThe United Kingdom Government released guidance for British citizens regarding .eu domains in October 2020, and .eu holders with a British address attached have been contacted twice by the domain registry regarding their domains – once in October 2020, once in December 2020.\nBritish citizens had their .eu domains suspended on 1 January 2021 for six months, and then withdrawn on 1 July 2021 after a grace period to allow EU/EEA citizens to update the registration information to show their non-UK address. From 1 January 2022, they were revoked and made available for registration by other entities. This is the first case of its kind where an institution managing an internet top-level domain has withdrawn domains en masse for an entire country.\n\n\nUse by the European Union institutions\n\nThe second-level domain .europa.eu has been reserved for EU institution sites, with institutions and agencies making the switch from .eu.int to .europa.eu domains on the Europe day of 9 May 2006.\n\n\nActual use\n\nThe main users of .eu domains are websites with pan-European or cross-border intentions and audiences. It is often used to emphasise the 'European identity' of a website, as opposed to the website having a strictly national ccTLD or global \"dotcom\" nature. Alternative (opportunistic) uses include Basque webpages (as the initial letters of Euskadi or the language Euskara) and Romanian, Portuguese, or Galician personal sites, as eu is the equivalent of the English pronoun 'I' in those languages.\nIn most countries of the EU, the national ccTLDs have the major share of the market with the remainder spread over .com/.net/.org/.info/.biz. As a result of this, .eu has had an uphill battle to gain a significant share of these national markets. The dominant players tend to be the national ccTLD and .com. The other TLDs such as .net, .org and to a lesser extent .info and .biz have progressively smaller shares of these national markets.\nSome .eu domain names have had some popularity, such as torrentz2.eu. As of November 2019, according to the Tranco rank, the top 100 thousand most popular domains in the world included over 200 .eu domains.\n\n\nParking and redirects\n\nAs of around 2010, some statistics indicated a large number of .eu domains being used to direct to other domains.\n\nSome domain registrants use their .eu website as a web portal containing a list of their national websites with national ccTLDs.\nOther registrants have registered a .eu domain name to protect the brand name of their main website or domain, and redirect visitors to their pre-existing national ccTLD or .com website. (example: www.champagne.eu)\n12.8% of .eu websites are parking pages with pay per click (PPC) advertisements. ISPs and web hosters will often point unused domains to a domain parking webpage with PPC advertising. This percentage does not include .eu domains that are pointed to holding pages or not set up in DNS.\n26% of .eu domain names are redirects for existing national ccTLD or .com websites.\nAccording to page 20 of EURid's Annual Report for 2006, the breakdown of .eu domain ownership figures on 31 December 2006 was:\n\nRegistrants with more than 10,000 domains: 6\nRegistrants with 5,000–9,999 domains: 18\nRegistrants with 1,000–4,999 domains: 64\nRegistrants with 100-999 domains: 1,257\nRegistrants with 10–99 domains: 20,886\nRegistrants with 6–9 domains: 22,933\nRegistrants with 5 domains: 13,200 – (66,000 domains)\nRegistrants with 4 domains: 23,007 – (92,028 domains)\nRegistrants with 3 domains: 42,887 – (128,661 domains)\nRegistrants with 2 domains: 115,543 – (231,086 domains)\nRegistrants with 1 domain: 610,679\nThe number of registrants with five domains or fewer registered in .eu ccTLD was, according to these statistics, 805,316. These registrants accounted for 1,128,454 domains out of 2,444,947 .eu domains registered as of 31 December 2006. These registrations, typically those of individuals and companies protecting their brand, only represent 46% of the number of registered .eu domains.\n\n\nCyrillic domain\n.ею, a top-level domain using Cyrillic letters was put into operation on 1 June 2016. A Cyrillic domain was needed because Bulgaria, a member of the EU, uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Keyboards and smartphones used in Bulgaria have special key combinations to change script, but in order to avoid that, all-Cyrillic addresses are used. The EU is called ЕС (Европейски Съюз) in Bulgarian Cyrillic, but .ес (in Cyrillic letters) is much too similar to .ec (in Latin letters), the existing top-level domain of Ecuador, so .ею was chosen.(While some Latin and Cyrillic letters may look identical, they have different character encodings and are distinct for data processing purposes. Consequently, there is an opportunity for misrepresentation unless steps are taken to prevent abusive registration).\nEURid has a rule that the second-level domain name must be in the same script as the top-level domain, so Cyrillic second-level domains must go under .ею instead of .eu, and all domain names under .ею must be spelt using Cyrillic. Older Cyrillic domains under .eu were cloned into .ею at its launch.\nAs of March 2024, there are 1,486 registered domains under .ею.\n\n\nGreek domain\nAn application for a top-level domain using Greek letters, .ευ was submitted in 2016.\nThe application was originally turned down because it was too visually similar to .eu.\nThe Greek name of the EU is Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση (ΕΕ), but .εε would be too visually similar to .ee, the top-level domain of Estonia.\nIn 2019 steps were taken towards approving .ευ as a domain. The proposal was to have one and the same registry manager of .eu, .ею and .ευ, which shall make sure second-level domains are not visually similar and in the long-term assign all Cyrillic domains under .eu to .ею and all Greek letters domains to .ευ. .ευ domain names were officially launched in November 2019.\nAs of March 2024, there are 2,595 registered domains under .ευ.\n\n\nAllegations of abuse\nDomain name speculation, domain name warehousing and cybersquatting are always features of the launch of any new TLD; however, this was more widespread in the case of the .eu launch.\nBob Parsons, CEO and co-founder of GoDaddy, criticized the landrush process designed by EURid. Particularly, he condemned the use of shell companies by some registrars. In his blog, he stated \"These companies, instead of only registering their real active registrars, created hundreds of new \"phantom\" registrars.\" Parsons cited a group of about 400 companies, all with similar address and contact information based in New York, each registered as an LLC; in his opinion, these were phantom registrars \"created to hijack the .EU landrush.\"\nThese \"phantom\" registrars effectively had hundreds of opportunities of registering a domain whereas a genuine registrar effectively only had one opportunity to register the same domain. Thus some registrants were crowded out of the .eu landrush process and many generic .eu domain names are now owned by the companies using these \"phantom\" registrars.\nPatrik Lindén, spokesman for EURid at the time, denied the allegations by Parsons, stating that \"[EURid] verified that each registrar was an individual legal entity. Each had to sign an agreement with us, and prepay €10,000.\" Parsons did not dispute that each registrar was a separate legal entity, but noted that creating such entities was trivial: \"Mr. Linden seemed proud that the EURid registry verified that each applicant was a legal entity before it was accredited. Take a moment and think about what that means. You can form a \"legal entity\" for $50 – an LLC – and you are good to go. Is that what we want a registry to do? Don't we want them instead to make sure that the organization it allows to provide end-users with its domain names – especially Europe's very own domain name – are actually in the domain name registration business?\"\nOthers claimed that .eu domain had been actively targeted during the sunrise period by speculators using fast-track Benelux trademarks to create prior rights on various high-value generic terms and during the landrush by speculators using EU front companies in the UK and Cyprus to register large numbers of domains. While speculative activity occurred with the launch of other domains, it was the scale of the activity that called into question the competence of EURid in protecting the integrity of eu ccTLD.\nThe EURid organisation investigated some allegations of abuse, and in July 2006 announced the suspension of over 74,000 domain names and that they were suing 400 registrars for breach of contract. The status of the domains was changed from active to on-hold. This meant that the domains could not be moved or have their ownership changed. The registrars also lost their access to the EURid registration database meaning that they could no longer register .eu domain names. The legal action relates to the practice of domain name warehousing, whereby large numbers of domain names are registered, often by registrars, with the intention of subsequently selling them on to third parties.  EURid rules state that applications for domains can only be made after a legitimate application has been made to a registrar.  The 74,000 applications were made in the name of only three Cyprus registered companies – Ovidio Ltd., Fausto Ltd. and Gabino Ltd.\nThe affected registrars, joined in the action by the affected registrants, obtained a provisional order from the Court of First Instance in Brussels, Belgium on 27 September 2006. The court ordered EURid to release the blocked domain names or else pay a fine of €25,000 per hour for each affected domain name. EURid complied with the court order and changed the status of the domains from on-hold to active and restored EURid registration database access to the affected registrars.\n\n\nSee also\nInternet in Europe\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nEURid – Registry for .eu\nIANA .eu whois information\nDomain registration regulations, policies, and terms, and other related documents\nEURid registration status report, including breakdown of registrations by country\nPWC Belgium's validation service for Eurid Archived 27 November 2005 at the Wayback Machine\nEU to launch its own web domain (BBC)\nNo .eu domain for the Swiss (and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (The Register)\n\"The .eu Top Level Domain\".

    "text": "Moses Asch (December 2, 1905 – October 19, 1986) was an American recording engineer and record executive. He founded Asch Records, which then changed its name to Folkways Records when the label transitioned from 78 RPM recordings to LP records. Asch ran the Folkways label from 1948 until his death in 1986. Folkways was very influential in bringing folk music into the American cultural mainstream. Some of America's greatest folk songs were originally recorded for Asch, including \"This Land Is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie and \"Goodnight Irene\" by Lead Belly. Asch sold many commercial recordings to Verve Records; after his death, Asch's archive of ethnic  recordings was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution, and released as Smithsonian Folkways Records.\n\n\nLife and work\nMoses Asch was born in Warsaw, Poland,  the son of Yiddish language novelist and dramatist Sholem Asch, and the younger brother of novelist Nathan Asch.\nIn 1912, the Asch family left Poland, on account of antisemitism, and settled in a suburb of Paris. In 1915, as war engulfed France, the family emigrated to New York. After the war, Asch studied electronics at a technical Hochschule in Koblenz, Germany. He returned to New York to commence work as an audio engineer.\nIn 1938, his father's employer, The Jewish Daily Forward, commissioned the firm where Asch worked to build a transmitter for its Yiddish-language radio station, WEVD. Asch thereafter explored the market for recorded Yiddish music, both sacred and secular. In 1940, Asch established Asch Recordings, and concentrated on publishing and selling phonograph records. Asch overextended his operations and went bankrupt in 1948.\nAsch was able to resurrect his recording career in 1948 by having his secretary, Marian Distler, initiate a new record company, Folkways Records, in her name. Harold Courlander worked for Asch as editor at the time and is credited with coming up with the name \"Folkways\" for the label. Although in theory a \"consultant\" to Folkways in its early years, Asch ran the company from its formation until his death. He recorded and published LP records by such famous folk and blues singers as Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Cisco Houston,  and Ella Jenkins. Asch published American, African, Asian and European folk music, such as the LPs Religious Folk Music of India, Sounds and Dances of Haiti, Folk Music of Ethiopia, The Old Folksongs of Vermont, and The Folk Music of France. Asch also issued Negro slave spirituals, such as the Negro Folk Music of Alabama, originally collected in 1952 by Harold Courlander who was an associate of Asch, and Negro Folk Songs redone by the Folk Masters, an African American band in 1952, as well Mormon Folk Songs and Yiddish, Ladino, and Hebrew-Aramaic, Cantorial synagogue music from the 1940s, including a rare pre-Holocaust liturgy from Moshe Koussevitzky.\nIn 1952, filmmaker and ethnomusicologist Harry Smith compiled for Asch  the Anthology of American Folk Music, a collection of indigenous southern and mid-western US folk songs, which was the first record to conscientiously not differentiate between black and white folk singers upon Smith's request. Smith said of Asch in an interview on the WBAI radio's \"The Sing Out! Radio Show\", and repeated the story in an interview with John Cohen in Sing Out! magazine, that he had shipped the most precious records in his collection from San Francisco to Asch in New York. Asch initially refused to pay the COD charges for the package. Only after days of cajoling, did Asch pay the COD charges. As it turned out, the Anthology became \"the most important collection of its type\", according to Asch.\nAsch had a significant recording relationship with James P. Johnson, described as the Father of Stride Piano. Johnson made a significant series of recordings for several labels controlled by Asch, including Asch, Stinson, Disc, and Folkways. On the Stinson album, New York Jazz, Johnson recorded five numbers which he stated could be heard in New York in the 1910s, in addition to the first recorded piano solo of Scott Joplin's, Euphonic Sounds. This established the link between the stride piano of Johnson, and the ragtime of Joplin, from which stride is descended.\nOne principle behind Asch's direction of the Folkways label was that he never deleted a single title from the Folkways catalogue. Asch said, \"Just because the letter J is less popular than the letter S, you don't take it out of the dictionary.\" After his death, the Folkways recordings were acquired by the Smithsonian Institution, and Asch stipulated in his will that no titles were to be deleted, and that unreleased master tapes in the Folkways archive should be explored. The Smithsonian acquisition of the Folkways archive was, in part, funded by the release of the album A Vision Shared: A Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly, which featured contributions by Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, U2 and other artists.\nFolk Singer Dave Van Ronk said: \"Moe Asch could be an exasperating man, and he would never pay you ten cents if he could get away with five, but he really loved the music.\" Neil Alan Marks wrote in The New York Times in 1980: \"Folkways Records was for folklorists and musicians the talmudic source for much primary material. Its founder, Moses Asch, may have more to do with the preservation of folk music than any single person in this country.\"\nAnthropologist Michael Asch is his son.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAmerican National Biography, vol. 1, pp. 661–662.\nCarlin, Richard.

He founded Asch Records, which then changed its name to Folkways Records when the label transitioned from 78 RPM recordings to LP records. Asch ran the Folkways label from 1948 until his death in 1986. Folkways was very influential in bringing folk music into the American cultural mainstream. Some of America's greatest folk songs were originally recorded for Asch, including \"This Land Is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie and \"Goodnight Irene\" by Lead Belly. Asch sold many commercial recordings to Verve Records; after his death, Asch's archive of ethnic  recordings was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution, and released as Smithsonian Folkways Records.",

    "text": "Woodbridge is a historic neighborhood of primarily Victorian homes located in Detroit, Michigan. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, with later boundary increases in 1997 and 2008. In addition to its historic value, Woodbridge is also notable for being an intact neighborhood of turn-of-the-century homes within walking or biking distance of Detroit's Downtown, Midtown, New Center, and Corktown neighborhoods.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe district as recognized by the National Register of Historic Places was originally bounded by Trumbull Street, Calumet Street, Gibson Street, Grand River Avenue, Rosa Parks Boulevard, West Warren Avenue, Wabash Street, Railroad Tracks, and the Edsel Ford Freeway. The boundaries of the District were increased twice: in 1997, 4304-14 Trumbull Street (private residences) and 3800 Grand River Avenue were added to the district, and in 2008 the southeast corner of Trumbull Street and Warren Avenue (Saint Dominic Roman Catholic Church) was added.\nMost structures in the district are located on north–south streets. The irregularly-shaped district includes structure at 3800 Grand River Avenue (between Avery Street and Commonwealth Street), and structures within the following boundaries:\n\non the east side of Wabash street, on both sides of Vermont Street, and on both sides of Rosa Parks Boulevard from the Edsel Ford Freeway to Warren Avenue;\non the west side of Rosa Parks Boulevard from Warren Avenue to Grand River Avenue;\non both sides of Hecla Street, Avery Street, and Commonwealth Street from the Edsel Ford Freeway to Grand River Avenue;\non the west side of Trumbull Street from the Edsel Ford Freeway to Canfield Street;\non the east side of Trumbull Street at the south corner of Warren Avenue;\non both sides of Trumbull Street from Canfield Street to Grand River Avenue; and\non both sides of Lincoln Street and the west side of Gibson Street from Calumet Street to Grand River Avenue.\n\n\nHistory\nWoodbridge is an intact neighborhood of architecturally significant buildings and has had an important effect on the history of Detroit. The neighborhood, dating to the Victorian era, has largely escaped the redevelopment efforts that have obliterated many of Detroit's other historic areas. It is named for William Woodbridge, governor of Michigan in 1840–1841, who owned a large farm on which much of the neighborhood was subsequently built.\nMost of the structures within the neighborhood were built after 1870, beginning with modest cottages. Larger structures were built later, including the James Scripps house (now demolished and turned into a city park), built in 1879. The Eighth Precinct Police Station, built in 1901, was architecturally designed to blend in with the lavish upper-class homes in the neighborhood. As the automotive industry boomed, there was an increased demand for housing in the city of Detroit, and new buildings and apartment houses were constructed behind and between the existing homes in the neighborhood. During World War II, owners rented rooms and divided homes into apartments to house defense industry workers.\nAfter the war, residents began leaving the Woodbridge neighborhood for the suburbs. New residents to Woodbridge were less affluent. In the 1960s, the city cleared areas adjacent to the neighborhood to support revitalization. The residents of Woodbridge organized a Citizen's District Council to preserve the neighborhood, and successfully managed to stabilize and preserve many of the remaining homes. Recent activity has shifted perception of Woodbridge from that of an up-and-coming neighborhood to a hotbed of urban revitalization, with the few properties that come up for sale typically subject to bidding wars.\n\n\nNotable structures\n\nNotable structures within the Woodbridge neighborhood include:\n\nThe Eighth Precinct Police Station is located at 4150 Grand River Avenue, and was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1973 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 2013, the building was converted to lofts, as part of the ongoing revitalization of Woodbridge.\n\nThe Northwood–Hunter House (also known as the William Northwood House) is located at 3985 Trumbull Avenue. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974.\n\nPresently known as Spirit of Hope church, the Trinity Episcopal Church is located at 1519 Martin Luther King Boulevard. The church was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nThe Trumbullplex is a renowned housing collective and showspace that has become an institution and hotbed of creative anarchism, which was created in 1993 when members of the collective established a nonprofit corporation and purchased the property, two Victorian houses on either side of a single-story art space.\nThe Trumbull Avenue Presbyterian Church is located at 1435 Brainard at the intersection of Brainard and Trumbull near Scripps Park. It was listed on the State of Michigan Registry of Historic Sites on June 6, 1977.\nThe Detroit Area Council—later becoming the Great Lakes Council for the Boy Scouts of America that serves the Detroit metropolitan area and covers all of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties—chose to build its headquarters in Woodbridge. The facility holds both council and district staff, as well as the National Toyota Scout Shop. Dedicated in September 2003, the service center was largely paid for by the donations of the Dauches; Council Treasurer Irving Rose and his wife, Audrey; and Council Vice President Richard Marsh. The building cost nearly $6 million, including new furnishings, landscaping, and demolition of the old building\n\n\nEducation\nDetroit Public Schools operates public schools.\nFrederick Douglass Academy for Young Men is located in Woodbridge.\n\n\nNotable people\nKenneth Cockrel Jr., former Detroit City Council member and president, as well as former mayor of Detroit\nTony Hawk, professional skateboarder, video game subject, and real estate entrepreneur who maintains a second home in the neighborhood\nRose Mary Robinson, Michigan State Representative, former member of the Detroit Charter Revision Commission (in 2009) and former Wayne County Commissioner (one of the first women ever elected, in 1970)\nSixto Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\"), folk musician and subject of Academy Award-winning movie Searching for Sugar Man\nGary Schwartz, Academy Award–nominated filmmaker, animator, artist and educator\nPrevious residents included:\n\nGeorge Gough Booth, publisher of the privately held Evening News Association, co-founder of Booth Newspapers, co-founder of the Cranbrook Educational Community, major benefactor of The Detroit Institute of Arts, and son-in-law of James E.

He represented Great Britain at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.\n\n\nBiography\nMoorhouse was born, Scott Paul William Durst, in Ipswich in 1989. At the age of six weeks a severe burn resulted in the amputation of his left leg through the knee. In 2008, while working in telecommunications, Moorhouse's manager heard a radio promotion from Paralympic GB who were running a talent day in London. He gave Moorhouse the day off to attend, and Moorhouse showed promise in several different disciplines at the meet. He decided to follow athletics and began training in 2009 with Windsor, Hounslow and Eton Athletics Club, showing promise in both the sprint and throwing events.\nIn June 2010 he threw 41.25 to come fourth in a senior meet in Cardiff, and followed this with a second place in the World Junior Championship in the Czech Republic. In 2011 he was part of the Great Britain squad that travelled to Christchurch in New Zealand to take part in the IPC Athletic Championships, he finished 4th in the F42 javelin, throwing 38.31. In April he attended his second Junior World Championship, this time finishing third. Despite having to miss training to concentrate on his academic studies beforehand, his results in an IWAS Series meet in Stadskanaal in the Netherlands saw Moorhouse beat his personal best with three of his throws. His best of the three, 45.75m, was enough to give him first place. Then, two weeks later in Cardiff, he threw a 47.33 which pushed him up the global rankings.\nIn 2012, and now running with a Cheeteh Flex-Foot, Moorhouse was selected as part of the Great Britain team to compete in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the F42 javelin.

After progressing through the academy, Roberts won the 2014–15 Professional U21 Development League 2 title in his debut professional season and was rewarded with a new two-year contract.\nRoberts signed a new three-year contract with Swansea City in September 2016. Upon returning from Bristol Rovers, Roberts linked up with Swansea City Under-23s and went on to win the 2016–17 Professional U23 Development League 2 title and 2016–17 Premier League Cup.\n\n\nLoan moves\nOn 8 August 2015, Roberts joined League Two club Yeovil Town on a one-month loan deal, and made his debut later that day in a 3–2 defeat against Exeter City. Roberts quickly established himself at Huish Park, and the Glovers extended Roberts' loan contract to the end of the 2015–16 season. Roberts made 54 appearances for Yeovil over the course of the season, missing just one match due to a call-up to the Wales under-21 national team. Roberts received three Player of the Year Awards and was also voted Young Player of the Year.\nIn August 2016, Roberts joined League One club Bristol Rovers on a six-month loan deal. Roberts made his debut in a 3–2 victory over Northampton Town on 1 October 2016, and made a further four appearances for the Pirates before returning to Swansea.\nOn 14 July 2017, it was announced that Roberts would be joining Championship club Middlesbrough on a season-long loan deal. After making one league appearance his loan spell was terminated in January and he returned to Swansea City.\n\n\nSwansea City\nRoberts made his debut for Swansea City on 6 January 2018 in the FA Cup third round against Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 29 September, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 win over Queens Park Rangers.

On 23 April 2023 Roberts was named in the EFL Championship Team of the Season.\nOn 1 February 2024, Roberts joined EFL Championship side Leeds United on loan until the end of the 2023–24 season.\nHe scored his first goal for Leeds United against Leicester City on 23 February 2024, the equaliser in a 3–1 home win. On 21 May 2024, Burnley said he would return to the club once the loan ended.\n\n\nInternational career\n\nRoberts has been capped at Wales under-19 level. In March 2016, Roberts received his first call-up to the Wales under-21 side for their 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification matches, and made his debut as a second-half substitute in their 2–1 defeat against Romania, on 29 March 2016.\nHe was called into the Wales senior national team for the first time on 15 March 2018. He made his senior international debut in the China Cup final against Uruguay in March 2018 when he came on as a 59th minute substitute for Declan John. Roberts scored his first goal for the senior team in a 4–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland on 6 September 2018, finishing a half-volley set up by Gareth Bale. In May 2021, he was selected for the Wales squad for the delayed UEFA Euro 2020 tournament. On 16 June, Roberts scored the second goal in a 2–0 win against Turkey, once again assisted by Bale. On 26 June, Roberts' participation in the tournament ended due to a groin injury sustained in the first half, and Wales went on to lose 4–0 to Denmark.\nIn November 2022 he was named in the Wales squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\nAs of match played 3 May 2025\n\n\nInternational\nAs of match played 9 June 2025\n\nAs of match played 13 November 2021.

The mountain often sees violent snowfalls during the night, but given that day and night temperatures vary greatly, the snow is almost completely melted in a few hours (during the hottest period of the year), for the temperature may be over 5 degrees Celsius by midday. In winter snow falls normally, since the majority of Ethiopia's yearly rainfall is in the summer, but if it does it usually lasts for weeks or months.\nThe first recorded ascent by a European was in 1841, by French officers Ferret and Galinier. There is no verifiable evidence of earlier ascents by locals, but the summit climate and conditions are relatively hospitable, and there are nearby high-altitude pastoral settlements.

Set in 1972, the story deals with one of the many \"legends\" involving Elvis Presley (Keith) about his fictional kidnapping, and his subsequent redemption from decadence.\nThe film was shot on location in Austin, Texas, at Green Pastures, the former residence of John Henry Faulk.\n\n\nPlot\nSet in 1972, Heartbreak Hotel follows Marie Wolfe (played by Tuesday Weld), a single mother who runs a boarding house with her teenage son Johnny (played by Charlie Schlatter) and young daughter Pam (played by Angela Goethals). When Marie is seriously injured in a car accident, Johnny hatches an outlandish plan to cheer her up for her birthday: he decides to kidnap her musical idol, Elvis Presley (played by David Keith).\nJohnny and his high school band drive Marie’s pink Cadillac to Cleveland, Ohio, where Elvis is performing. With the help of a local pizzeria owner—who bears a strong resemblance to Elvis’s late mother, Gladys—Johnny stages a fake ghostly visitation to distract Elvis. He then renders the singer unconscious using chloroform and brings him back to the Wolfe boarding house.\nElvis awakens confused and furious, finding himself held captive by a group of teenagers. Initially, he clashes with Johnny, who accuses him of betraying his roots and selling out to the glitz of Las Vegas. However, over time, the two form an unlikely friendship, and Elvis begins to reconnect with the simple joys and authenticity he'd lost in his celebrity life.\nThe film concludes with Elvis joining Johnny’s band for a performance of \"Heartbreak Hotel\" at the local high school talent show—a moment that symbolizes healing, rebellion, and the redemptive power of rock and roll.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nReception\nThe film received mixed-to-negative reviews. It currently holds a 38% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews.\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times stated that \"Mr. Columbus, who previously directed Adventures in Baby-Sitting and whose writing credits include Gremlins and The Goonies, sets up this idea well but has no idea where to stop. He pushes the film's slender premise much too far, trying to work miraculous feats of self-improvement upon Johnny, his mother, Marie, and even Elvis himself.\" \nThe Washington Post's Rita Kempley wrote, \"With such fruity writing, what do overacting and miscasting (Jay Leno would have been perfect) matter? Playing Elvis is like playing a Kennedy, nearly impossible. And Keith, as we know, had mighty big pants to fill. Face it. The King has left the building, gone to that Caesars Palace in the sky. Columbus, say goodbye.\"\nA one-star review came from Roger Ebert who wrote, \"Here it is, the goofiest movie of the year, a movie so bad in so many different and endearing ways that I’m damned if I don’t feel genuine affection for it. We all know it’s bad manners to talk during a movie, but every once in a while a film comes along that positively requires the audience to shout helpful suggestions and lewd one-liners at the screen. 'Heartbreak Hotel' is such a movie. All it needs to be perfect is a parallel soundtrack.\" Ebert's onscreen review partner Gene Siskel also agreed and the pair included the film in their Worst of 1988 show.\nIt was also a box office failure, opening with a disappointing $2,063,546 from 1,338 screens, finishing in second place behind Gorillas in the Mist, despite opening on more than double the number of screens. It went on to gross $5.5 million in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nMusic\nMost of the songs contained in the film are actual Elvis Presley recordings despite the film being fictional, with David Keith and Charlie Schlatter performing the title track in the style of the 1968 television special recording.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nHeartbreak Hotel at IMDb\nHeartbreak Hotel at Box Office Mojo",

    "text": "Sculpture is a feature of many of the shells of mollusks. It is three-dimensional ornamentation on the outer surface of the shell, as distinct from either the basic shape of the shell itself or the pattern of colouration, if any. Sculpture is a feature found in the shells of gastropods, bivalves, and scaphopods. The word \"sculpture\" is also applied to surface features of the aptychus of ammonites, and to the outer surface of some calcareous opercula of marine gastropods such as some species in the family Trochidae.\nSculpture can be concave or convex, incised into the surface or raised from it. Sometimes the sculpture has microscopic detailing. The term \"sculpture\" refers only to the calcareous outer layer of shell, and does not include the proteinaceous periostracum, which is in some cases textured even when the underlying shell surface is smooth. \nIn many taxa, there is no sculpture on the shell surface at all, apart from the presence of fine growth lines.\nThe sculpture has a protective function because it increases the diameter of the shell, distributing mechanical stress (such as the force of a predator's jaws) across a larger surface area.\n\n\nList of terms\nAxial sculpture - Sculpture running parallel to the axis of coiling, an imaginary line through the apex of a shell about which the whorls are coiled. These are markings which extend from the summit of the whorls toward the umbilicus. The axial sculpture may be: \nVertical, when the markings are in general parallelism with the axis of the shell.\nProtractive, when the markings slant forward from the preceding suture\nRetractive, when the markings slant backward from the suture\nBead - A small hemispherical protuberance resembling a bead, similar to but smaller than a nodule.\nBeaded - resembling rows or strings of beads.\nCyrtoconoid spire  - approaching a cone in shape, but with convex sides.\nGrowth line - A fine transverse line marking the growth of the shell.\nLira, lirate - ornamented with fine thread-like lines or grooves.\nLongitudinal sculpture - Sculpture following the direction of the axis of the shell.\nNodule -  A rounded protuberance on the shell sculpture; larger than a bead.\nNodose, Nodulose, Nodular - Bearing small rounded protuberances or tubercules.\nOrnament - Can refer to surface sculpture standing out in relief on shell surface; or simply to sculpture as a whole.\nPlait - Folds on the columella.\nProsocline - with the growth lines leaning forward (adapically) with respect to the direction of the cone.\nPustule - A very fine knob-like protrusion, smaller than a tubercle.\nReticulate - Sculpture consisting of a criss-crossing network of riblets, threads, or grooves.\nRib - A strong ridge on the surface of the shell.\nRiblet - Smaller than a rib, but coarser than a thread.\nSpiral sculpture - Sculpture following the spiral growth of the shell.\nStria (plural striae) - A shallow incised groove.\nStriate - Ornamented with striae.\nThread - A very fine riblet.\nTransverse sculpture - Sculpture parallel to the edge of the outer lip of the aperture.\nTubercle - Elevated knob-like projections or protrusions; larger than a pustule.\nVaricose - Bearing one or more varices.\n\n\nSee also\nSculpturing — arthropod equivalent\n\n\nReferences",

Schoenfield famously responded, \"You tripped and fell you fat pig!\" He then yelled, \"Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!\" The incident was played repeatedly on ESPN and has become part of NHL lore.\nSchonefeld was suspended by NHL president John Ziegler for Game 4, but the Devils received an injunction from a New Jersey court, allowing Schoenfeld to coach the fourth game. In protest, the officials scheduled to work that game in the Meadlowands refused to take the ice, forcing the NHL to scramble for amateur officials to call the contest.

    "text": "Frohberg Castle (German: Ruine Frohberg, Tschäpperli or Tschöpperli) is a medieval castle ruin in the Swiss municipality of Aesch in the canton of canton of Basel-Land.\n\n\nLocation\n\nThe ruin is on a rocky ridge at the upper end of the Klus valley on the way to the old Platten pass road. It lies near the ruins of Schalberg Castle, the ruins of Engenstein Castle and the ruins of Münchberg Castle. It is the rearmost castle in the Aesch controlled Klus valley and is one of the castles built on the ridge above Aesch.\n\n\nHistory\nThe stronghold at Frohberg was first mentioned in 1292 when Conrad I Schaler \"de Vroberg\" was mentioned. It is likely that the castle was built by the Schaler family in the second half of the 13th century. Although the castle dominated the way across the Platten pass (between Birseck and Laufental), the location of other castles in the immediate vicinity, suggests that the motivation for the castle was not the collection of tolls, but power games between the families of the Schaler and Münch.\nWerner Meyer noted that the castle was perhaps never quite finished while Carl Roth believed that the castle was damaged during the Basel earthquake of 1356 and was not repaired. In any case, in the 14th century, the remains were given as a bishop's fief to the counts of Thierstein-Pfeffingen. This fief was not so much about the ruins, which needed costly repairs, but the assets related to the castle including tax collection and court rights. The Thierstein-Pfeffingens integrated the Frohberg lands into the Herrschaft of Pfeffingen, which was managed from the nearby Pfeffingen Castle ruins. \nThe original name, Vroberg has changed over time in the vernacular into Tschäpperli or Tschöpperli.\n\n\nCastle site\nThe ruins are widely scattered and consists of an extended main castle, surrounded by different approach obstacles. So far, the ruins have not yet been investigated archaeologically and so only rough interpretations are possible.\nOn the west and north side is a deep, natural ditch, on the east side there is an artificial moat, while on the south there are walls and ditches. The latter are heavily disturbed by agricultural plowing on the south and west.\nThe main castle was formed by a housing tract and a curtain wall. The wall follows the irregularly extending ledge. The massive living area consists of two parts and a smaller west building with irregular floor plan as a residential tower. The thick walls were up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) thick and built from rough cut stone. To the east, adjoining the living area, is an elongated building that served as an administrative and residential building. On the northwest and northeast sides the remains of outlying estates are visible.\nThe entrance to the castle was on the north-west side of the fortress, either through a ramp over the ditch or over a bridge supported by a natural rocks. It is possible that another entrance might have been on the east side.\n\n\nReferences\nWerner Meyer: Burgen von A bis Z, Burgenlexikon der Regio, Jubiläumsausgabe zum 50-jährigen Bestehen der Burgenfreunde beider Basel, Basel 1981.

    "title": "Bad Religion",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=168409",
    "text": "Bad Religion is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple lineup changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major-label Atlantic in 1993. The band pioneered the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s, establishing a formula for California-based punk bands such as Green Day and Epitaph-signed acts the Offspring, NOFX and Rancid. They are also cited as an inspiration or influence on the 1990s and 2000s pop punk, skate punk, post-hardcore, screamo and emo scenes.\nAtlantic reissued the previously released-on-Epitaph album, Recipe for Hate (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up Stranger than Fiction. Stranger than Fiction included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including \"Infected\", \"Stranger than Fiction\", and the re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" (the latter of which its original version appeared four years earlier on Against the Grain); the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with \"Sorrow\", \"Los Angeles Is Burning\", and \"The Devil in Stitches\" becoming Top 40 hits on the US charts while their sixteenth studio album, True North (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart where it peaked at number 19. The band's seventeenth studio album, Age of Unreason, was released on May 3, 2019.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nFormation and early recordings (1980–1983)\n\nBad Religion was formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1980 by high school students Greg Graffin, Jay Bentley, Jay Ziskrout, and Brett Gurewitz. Their first public performance was playing six or eight songs at a Fullerton, California, or Santa Ana, California, warehouse opening for Social Distortion. Graffin has said that the name \"Bad Religion\" came about when the then-adolescent members of the band wanted to \"piss people off\".\nIn 1981, the band released their initial eponymous six-song EP as a 7\" record on the newly formed label, Epitaph Records, which was and continues to be managed and owned by Gurewitz. Also in 1981, the band began recording their first full-length album, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? During the recording of this album, drummer Jay Ziskrout quit the band and was replaced by Pete Finestone. Released in 1982, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? was also distributed by the band under the Epitaph label and sold roughly 12,000 copies.\n\n\nInto the Unknown, Back to the Known and hiatus (1983–1985)\nIn 1983, the band released Into the Unknown, a keyboard-driven progressive hard rock album with a slightly slower pace. Almost all of the albums the band produced were sold out of the warehouse they were housed in without the band's knowledge, after which this album went out of print. This incident, as well as band members' increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band's temporary dissolution shortly after the album's release.\nSoon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with Circle Jerks guitarist Greg Hetson replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, rock and roll version of their original sound with the Back to the Known EP. Eventually the band split toward the middle of 1985.\n\n\nReunion, Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain and Generator (1986–1992)\nBad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the Back to the Known line-up when Graffin called Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band's third album, Suffer, which was released in 1988. The album received positive reviews in the independent music press and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as Trust, Maximum Rocknroll and Flipside.\nDuring the Suffer tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing new material. In early 1989, while the band was on break from touring, they commenced work on their next album, and entered the Westbeach Recorders studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, No Control, was released in November 1989, and was Bad Religion's best-selling album at the time, eventually selling more than 80,000 copies.\nBad Religion's hardcore punk style continued with their next album, Against the Grain, which was released in 1990. While the album still did not break the band into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing. \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", one of the tracks off the album, is generally regarded as the band's most well-known song, and has been played at almost every live show.\nDrummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion again in April 1991 to focus on his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, Generator, which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio, because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was \"time to change\" and the band \"did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different.\" To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video \"Atomic Garden\", which was also their first song to be released as a single.\nTo coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, 80–85, in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, their two EPs, Bad Religion and Back to the Known and the band's three track contributions to the Public Service EP. This compilation did not include Into the Unknown. 80–85 is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of How Could Hell Be Any Worse? with the same track listings.\n\n\nMainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993–1995)\nWith alternative rock and grunge breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion signed to Atlantic Records in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album Recipe for Hate on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No. 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, with \"American Jesus\" and \"Struck a Nerve\" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time. During their Recipe for Hate Tour, the band would support several opening acts, including then Lookout Records-signed punk band Green Day.\nRecipe for Hate was followed up by Bad Religion's eighth studio album Stranger Than Fiction. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as \"Stranger Than Fiction\", \"Infected\", and a re-recording of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", which was originally released on Against the Grain. The band also recorded the song \"Leaders and Followers\" (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of Stranger Than Fiction) for the soundtrack for the Kevin Smith film, Clerks. The album was Bad Religion's first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded gold certification on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies. With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s commercial punk rock explosion, alongside Green Day and fellow Epitaph bands such as the Offspring, Rancid, and NOFX.\nGurewitz left the band right before the release of Stranger Than Fiction. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as the Offspring (who had just released Smash to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of selling out for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success. As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts, such as, \"I want to know where Brett gets his crack\" or \"I want to know why Gurewitz cracked\", on the song \"Stranger Than Fiction\". These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin, and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's Suffer Tour documentary, Along the Way, and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band, the Daredevils, titled \"Hate You\".\nGurewitz was replaced as guitarist by Brian Baker, a former member of the bands Minor Threat, Dag Nasty, and Junkyard; Baker declined a spot with R.E.M. to join Bad Religion. With Gurewitz gone, Graffin became Bad Religion's primary songwriter (songwriting duties were originally split between the two).\n\n\nPost-Gurewitz period, departure of Bobby Schayer (1996–2000)\nBad Religion continued touring and recording without Brett Gurewitz, releasing three more albums for Atlantic, starting with The Gray Race (1996), produced by former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. Despite never garnering the amount of attention that Stranger Than Fiction received, it scored Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song, \"A Walk\", as well as the European release of \"Punk Rock Song\".\n\nIn 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, No Substance, produced by Alex Perialas, Ronnie Kimball, and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by music critics and fans alike as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with Stranger Than Fiction and The Gray Race, it was given mixed reviews by both critics and fans. Following the release of No Substance, the band embarked on a year-long tour.\nIn 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together called, \"Believe It\", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For this new album, Todd Rundgren, an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. \"Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself.\" In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Interest in recording the record waned due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, \"I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol, and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything.\" However, Graffin later writes in his book, \"Anarchy Evolution\", that, although Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin remain friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).\n\n\nReturn to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001–2004)\nIn 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph, and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released The Process of Belief (2002). Graffin stated, \"There was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again.\"\nTheir next album, The Empire Strikes First, was released in June 2004. Like The Process of Belief, it was widely regarded by fans as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic.\nIn April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except Into the Unknown). The How Could Hell Be Any Worse? reissue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued 80–85 compilation, including their first EP, the Public Service EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the \"Back to the Known\" EP. To coincide with the reissues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS, Along the Way, on DVD for the first time. Recipe for Hate, though, could not be re-issued, even though it was originally released on Epitaph, due to the fact that it had already been re-issued through Atlantic, and so problems with rights ownership made a reissue unlikely.\n\n\nNew Maps of Hell (2005–2008)\n\nOn March 7, 2006, a live DVD, Live at the Palladium, was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist Brett Gurewitz said the band's next album would be a double-length release, but this turned out to not be the case.\nGreg Graffin released his second solo album, Cold as the Clay, on July 11, 2006.\nBad Religion's fourteenth studio album, New Maps of Hell, was released on July 10, 2007. On June 29 of that year (Greg Hetson's 46th birthday), Epitaph Records started selling New Maps of Hell at the Warped Tour in Pomona, California. The album was a commercial success and spawned three hit singles: \"Honest Goodbye\", \"Heroes and Martyrs\", and \"New Dark Ages\". As a result, New Maps of Hell reached number 35 on the Billboard 200, marking Bad Religion's highest-ever chart position. The band joined the 2007 Warped Tour to support the album.\nHetson formed a supergroup band called Black President, consisting of Charlie Paulson (from Goldfinger), Jason Christopher, Wade Youman (both from Unwritten Law), and Christian Martucci (from Dee Dee Ramone).\nIn early March 2008, Bad Religion played several night residences at House of Blues venues in Southern California as well as Las Vegas. They performed four European festival appearances in May and June.\nOn July 8, 2008, Bad Religion released their first-ever deluxe edition CD, a reissue of the then-current album, New Maps of Hell. The deluxe version included the original 16-song CD along with seven new acoustic tracks recorded by Graffin (vocals/guitars) and Gurewitz (guitars/back vocals). Three of the acoustic songs were new, written specifically for this release, while the other four tracks were acoustic versions of existing Bad Religion songs. The release also included a DVD with an hour-long live performance, music videos, and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n\n30 Years Live and The Dissent of Man (2009–2010)\nIn June 2008, Jay Bentley said in an interview at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, that Gurewitz had already begun writing new material for the next Bad Religion album. He stated that the band was planning to return to the studio to start work on the follow-up to New Maps of Hell, planned for a June 2009 release, after Graffin teaches UCLA. However, according to a December 2008 report on the fan site, \"The Bad Religion Page\", Bentley revealed that due to Bad Religion's upcoming touring commitments for 2009, the band would not have a chance to record their new album until around the end of the year, for an expected 2010 release date.\nIn August 2009, guitarist Brett Gurewitz sent an email to a fan site mentioning he was writing new material for the next Bad Religion album.\nIn December 2009, Bentley revealed to the fan site that the band was expected to go into the studio on April 26, 2010, to start recording their new album. He stated that a few songs for the album had been written and, \"It feels like the songwriting is picking up momentum. Baker said he was going to drive up to Graffin's, and Brooks and I are going to do some demos with Brett, so we have a pretty good jump.\" According to Brett's Twitter, Bad Religion is aiming for a fall release of the new album. In January 2010, Bentley revealed that Bad Religion would record their new album at a studio in Pasadena, California, with Joe Barresi, who engineered 2004's The Empire Strikes First and produced its 2007 follow-up, New Maps of Hell. Despite the statement made by Bentley about entering the studio in April, he noted that the recording date was now May 1.\nIn March and April 2010, to commemorate their 30th anniversary, Bad Religion toured Southern California's and Nevada's House of Blues locations, playing 30 Shows in 30 Nights with a 30-song set each night. At the House of Blues concert in Anaheim, California, on March 17, 2010, the band debuted a new song called \"Resist-Stance\" from their upcoming album. To coincide with the tour, Bad Religion announced a live album, entitled 30 Years Live, which was released as a free download for those who had signed up to the mailing list at Bad Religion's website. It consists of songs recorded during their House of Blues tour. It also included some new songs from their 15th studio album, before the new album was released. 30 Years Live was mixed by Mike Fraser and was released on May 18, 2010.\nOn May 1, 2010, Brett posted an update on his Twitter saying, \"Threw me a going away [to the studio] party and all my friends hung with me tonight – thx everybody, I love you guys.\" This adds fuel to the possibility of the band's new album being recorded the first week of May. On May 12, 2010 (which happened to be Brett's 48th birthday), bassist Jay Bentley posted an update on their Facebook page regarding the recording process of the album: \"First week of recording at Joe's house of compression and Brooks gets the medal for superasskicking. Brian has finished 14 basics ... a couple more to go. I started getting some good bass sounds late, late last night, the liver wins the shootout again. Brett is playing late night tracks on his birthday, some way to celebrate! happy birthday bg! quote of the day; BG \"what percentage of the sound is coming from the snakeskin?\". haha ... working of album titles and ideas today. It's all coming together. Joe says the corn flavored kit kats are gross, but the wasabi ones are quite delicious ... get back to work. Work work work. Will send photo's soon.\"\nIn June 2010, the fan site reported that the new album would be released on September 28, 2010. Jay (who goes by jabberwock on the Bad Religion Page) mentioned on the site's message board that Bad Religion had finished recording their new album and was mixing it. In an interview at the Azkena Rock Festival on June 26, 2010, the band members announced that the new album would be called The Dissent of Man. The Dissent of Man was released on September 28, 2010. The album debuted at No. 35 on the Billboard 200 chart and at No. 6 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. On August 30, 2010, the album version of the song, \"The Resist Stance\", was released on Bad Religion's MySpace page. The song was also made available for streaming on the page a week before the album's release. The band had been touring throughout 2011 to support the album.\nOn October 18, 2010, Bad Religion released a vinyl box set of all their albums that is limited to 3000 copies, including their 1983 album, Into the Unknown, which had been out of print for over 25 years.\n\n\nTrue North (2011–2013)\n\nIn an April 2011 interview with The Washington Examiner, guitarist Brian Baker was asked if Bad Religion was going to make another album after The Dissent of Man. His response was, \"It's all very punk [attitude] just like it's always been. We will record when we have enough songs. For us, it just kind of happens.\" During the Boston show on April 29, 2011, frontman Greg Graffin said, \"After this year you probably won't be seeing much more of us. We're going to try one more album and then all join the navy, do honest work\", hinting at a possible split or hiatus. Bassist Jay Bentley mentioned an early 2012 timeframe for going back into the studio in an interview at Live 105's BFD festival, which took place the day after the Weenie Roast. In February 2012, it was reported that Brett had written two songs for the album.\nOn June 25, 2011, Bad Religion performed a live set for \"Guitar Center Sessions\" on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt.\nAccording to a May 2012 interview with Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge, Brett is writing a \"fast\" Bad Religion album. He also said that Pennywise's then-new album, All or Nothing, inspired Brett to write a sequel to the band's 1989 album, No Control.\nOn June 4, 2012, Jay Bentley told the Bad Religion fan site, \"The Bad Religion Page\", that they were expected to begin recording their new album in July and August. He also stated that Brett and Joe Barresi are going to produce it. On July 23, the band uploaded a picture to Bad Religion's Facebook page of all the members (except Greg Hetson, who was taking the picture) in the studio with the caption, \"here we go again\", indicating that work on their sixteenth studio album had begun. On August 22, Brett Gurewitz tweeted that they were mixing the album, and, a month later, he tweeted that the band was finishing it. Greg Graffin later stated that the album was supposed to be out by Christmas. \"Fuck You\" was the album's lead single and released on iTunes on November 6, which happened to be Greg Graffin's 48th birthday.\nOn November 5, 2012 (Bad Religion Day), it was announced that Bad Religion's sixteenth studio album, True North, would be released on January 22, 2013. On that same day, they premiered the new single \"Fuck You\". True North has received mostly positive reviews and managed to reach number 18 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, marking Bad Religion's first ever top-20 album and highest ever peak on that chart in their entire 34-year career.\n\n\nDepartures of Hetson and Wackerman, and Christmas Songs (2013–2017)\nBad Religion played a few shows as a four-piece (without Greg Hetson and Brett Gurewitz) in mid April - May 2013—starting with their appearance at \"That Damn Show\" in Mesa, AZ, on April 20, including some high profile shows such as Groezrock in Belgium—leading fans to speculate over Greg Hetson's continued involvement in the band.\nOn May 7, 2013, Jay Bentley issued a statement to the fan site, which read, \"Greg Hetson is dealing with some personal issues, if he wishes to make a statement we will support that, if he chooses not to we will support that. Mike Dimkich is indeed helping us out right now, and we are genuinely appreciative. Right now we are just looking forward and getting ready to play our shows.\" The reason Hetson had not been touring with Bad Religion was likely due to the divorce of his second wife Alia. On January 11, 2014, Bentley confirmed on \"thebrpage.net\" that Dimkich is a permanent member of the band. A few days later, Download Festival's official website uploaded a photograph of the new lineup (without Brett Gurewitz).\nLater, in 2022, Hetson appeared on the podcast Fat Mike's Fat Mic stating he was let go due to his admitted addiction to painkillers and the behavior he exhibited due to this addiction.\nOn September 10, 2013, it was announced that Bad Religion would be releasing their first Christmas album, titled Christmas Songs, on October 29, 2013. It was their first album to not feature Greg Hetson since 1983's Into the Unknown.\nIn a November 2013 interview, guitarist Brett Gurewitz stated that Bad Religion would start writing their seventeenth studio album in 2014, and guitarist Brian Baker said that he hoped Bad Religion would start recording the album in the fall of 2015. However, in a September 2015 interview, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's Cold as the Clay, and that the band would begin writing their new album after the release of his third solo album, Millport, so a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Baker said, however, that the new album would not be released until 2017. Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to True North, Graffin said, \"It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work. That's hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. Why has it taken us four years to release an album after True North? Well, True North was such a great album — and we owe it to our fans to take it seriously as a great album — that to do another one is going to take a lot more work.\" Millport was eventually released on March 10, 2017.\nFrom July to September 2014, Bad Religion embarked on the Summer Nationals Tour with Pennywise; their former labelmates the Offspring, the Vandals, Stiff Little Fingers, and Naked Raygun supported them on selected dates.\nOn October 27, 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman officially left the band in order to pursue other projects, joining Avenged Sevenfold a week later. He was replaced by Jamie Miller (...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Souls at Zero and Snot).\n\n\nAge of Unreason and follow-up album (2018–present)\n\nOn February 14, 2018, vocalist Greg Graffin posted on Twitter a picture of himself with guitarist Brett Gurewitz in the studio, tweeting, \"New songs in the pipeline,\" indicating that they were working on Bad Religion's seventeenth studio album. Speculations about the album resurfaced in April of that year when Gurewitz and guitarist Brian Baker posted pictures from the studio on their respective Instagram accounts. On June 20, 2018, the band released the song, \"The Kids Are Alt-Right\", their first single in five years.\nDespite earlier reports that they had been in the studio since February, up to mid 2018, and the fact that they had already released a new song, Gurewitz told Los Angeles Times in July 2018 that, \"We're writing for a new album, recording this fall or late summer. No release date announced yet, but we should have an album's worth of 'Fuck Trump' songs pretty soon. It's exactly what we need.\" On February 26, 2019, Bad Religion announced Age of Unreason as the title of their seventeenth studio album, which was released on May 3, and the album's lead single, \"Chaos from Within\", was premiered.\nOn August 18, 2020, Do What You Want: The Story of Bad Religion, an autobiography covering the band's 40-year career, was released by Hachette Books.\nAbout four months after the release of Age of Unreason, guitarist Brian Baker was asked if Bad Religion was already working on a follow-up album. His response was: \"No, I'm not really thinking about a new album right now because this one is still developing and there is a lot of world yet to play. 2020 is going to be a busy year for us, it's our 40th Anniversary year. We have a book coming out at the end of the year – it'll be our first authorized, somewhat participatory, biography of Bad Religion. So there is a lot more to do with this record. The good thing about Bad Religion is that you don't really have to have a new product out to go work. The catalogue we have is so extensive and we are so fortunate to have the fan base that we have. So we don't really worry about a new album cycle, those thing just sort of come when they come. The next one might take four or five years, it might take two, I don't know. It's just about whether songs have come together in a way that is respectful of the Bad Religion standard. But in the meantime, we have Brazil to rock.\" When asked in August 2019 about the future of the band, Bentley stated, \"Everything I know about everything came from being in this band and came from some conversations driving in the van for hours on end. We're just these guys who don't want to stop asking why. We are what we are as Bad Religion. We're the thinking man's punk band, and that's kept us out of the mainstream. We're writing smart songs, and that makes us dumb.\" In an August 2020 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Graffin said, \"We've been working on some music, just as we're socially distant from each other; each of us has home recording studios. I always write music acoustically.\" In November 2022, Baker confirmed that Gurewitz was \"starting to dust off his writing boots\" and expressed hope that the band's next album will be recorded in 2023.\nOn April 29, 2020, Bad Religion announced on their social media accounts that they had to cancel all of their tour dates for that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a co-headlining US tour with Alkaline Trio, therefore marking 2020 as the first year the band did not perform at least one show since their inception in 1980. They subsequently also rescheduled their South American and European tour dates with Suicidal Tendencies, Millencolin, and Pulley to 2022 (originally scheduled for May and June 2021), once again due to the COVID pandemic. They also rescheduled their North American tour with Alkaline Trio, which was slated to take place in the fall of 2021.\nIn October 2020, Bad Religion released a new song, \"What Are We Standing For\", on streaming platforms, which was an outtake from the Age of Unreason sessions.\nOn January 20, 2021, Bad Religion released a previously unreleased song called \"Emancipation of the Mind\", which was recorded during the Age of Unreason sessions. The release of the song coincided with the inauguration of Joe Biden, and it had more hopeful themes compared to other songs that they've written while also being a rejection of Trumpism.\nAs of February, 2025, Bad Religion is in the studio to record a follow up album to Age of Unreason.\n\n\nStyle and influences\nBad Religion has been described as melodic hardcore, punk rock, skate punk, and hardcore punk. The band's major influences stemmed from late 1970s punk acts like the Ramones, the Germs, the Sex Pistols, and the Clash, along with early 1980s American hardcore bands such as Black Flag, Minor Threat, and the Circle Jerks. Unlike many other hardcore bands of the era, they also acknowledged proto-punk bands like the New York Dolls, MC5, and the Stooges. Even more unusual for a band of the scene that spawned them, they were also informed by such new wavers as Elvis Costello, the Jam, and Nick Lowe, as well as authors like Jack Kerouac. The Beatles were also a huge influence on Bad Religion. The band had said that the Beatles were about the only band everyone in Bad Religion really liked.\nReviewers have repeatedly cited an upbeat and positive tone to both the band's melody and lyrics, even when dealing with dark topics.\nGreg Graffin called his influences, \"Pop-sounding rock tunes that were not necessarily commercial.\" Brett Gurewitz acknowledges attempting to emulate Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion's lyrical style. \"He wrote some intelligent stuff and didn't shy away from the vocabulary, which I thought was cool.\" In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents in the way they used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley said, \"Seeing the Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it too, because look, they're doing it.\"\n\n\nLegacy\nVarious bands have cited Bad Religion as an influence, including Rise Against, AFI, Parkway Drive, NOFX, I Am the Avalanche, and Miss Vincent. Funeral for a Friend vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye has also mentioned Bad Religion as an influence, particularly with their Against the Grain album.\n\n\nBeliefs\n\n\nPolitics\nMany of Bad Religion's songs are about different social ills, although they try not to ascribe the causes of these ills to any single person or group. Greg Graffin believes that the current political situation in the United States can make it difficult to voice these concerns as he does not want to feed the polarization of viewpoints.\nThe band contributed a song to the Rock Against Bush series organized by Fat Mike's Punkvoter, a political activist group and website whose supporters are primarily left-liberal members of the punk subculture.\nBrett Gurewitz attributed his anger towards former U.S. president George W. Bush as the major inspiration for The Empire Strikes First. \"Our whole album is dedicated to getting Bush out of office. I'm not a presidential scholar, but I don't think you'll find a worse president in the history of the United States. He's probably one of the worst leaders in the history of world leaders. I just hate the guy.\" In a similar fashion, the album Age of Unreason was inspired by the band's disdain for Donald Trump.\nBad Religion performed at L7's abortion-rights benefit Rock for Choice at the Hollywood Palladium on April 30, 1993, with acts such as Stone Temple Pilots, White Zombie, Bikini Kill, King Missile, and Free Kitten with Kim Gordon. Hetson often wore a Rock for Choice T-shirt when performing, as he did when the band performed \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 1994. Bentley has also worn Rock for Choice T-shirts, such as when they performed the Phoenix Festival in the United Kingdom in 1993. The band's song, \"Operation Rescue\", on Against the Grain is a pro-choice song (named after anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue).\n\n\nReligion\nFaith in your partner, your fellow men, your friends, is very important, because without it there's no mutual component to your relationship, and relationships are important. So, faith plays an important role, but faith in people you don't know, faith in religious or political leaders or even people on stages, people who are popular in the public eye, you shouldn't have faith in those people. You should listen to what they have to say and use it.\nDespite the name of the band, or the band's logo, the members do not consider themselves antitheist. Singer Greg Graffin states that, more often than not, the band prefers to use religion as a metaphor for anything that does not allow for an individual's freedom to think or express themselves as they choose. In this way, their songs are more about anti-conformity than anti-religion. Contrary to popular belief, Graffin identifies himself as a naturalist rather than an atheist.\n\nWired Magazine came out with a big exposé of \"the new atheists.\" I was interviewed for it—and yet I think I was included as a sidebar but not as a main feature, and I think the main reason they did that was because they noticed that I wasn't that happy billing myself as an atheist. To me it just doesn't say that much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a naturalist is someone who ... first of all—they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message—I think—to send to the world, which is ... we can agree on what the truth is ... and it has to be through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So ... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the structure of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework—it can reconstruct the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say you're an atheist, it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say you're a naturalist, I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a fundamental way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition. And so, I prefer naturalist.\nDespite this, he did co-author the book Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant?, which is based on a series of lengthy debates about science and religion between Graffin and historian Preston Jones. In 2010, Graffin released Anarchy Evolution, in which he promotes his naturalist worldview.\nThe band's bassist Jay Bentley has stated that he has spiritual beliefs. Brett Gurewitz is a \"provisional deist\".\nOn March 24, 2012, Bad Religion headlined the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., sharing the stage with Eddie Izzard, Richard Dawkins, Tim Minchin and James Randi.\n\n\nLogo\n\nBad Religion's logo, a black Latin cross with a red prohibition sign over it, has been referred to by fans as the \"Crossbuster\". It was created by guitarist Brett Gurewitz, who drew it on a piece of paper and showed it to the rest of the band.\nIn the live documentary, Along the Way, Greg Hetson, Greg Graffin, and Jay Bentley were all asked the question, \"What's the meaning of the Bad Religion symbol?\"\nHetson's answer: \"The meaning of the symbol? It's—to me it's just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say, 'You either believe it or not, this is the way it is,' and that's not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be anti-establishment.\"\nGraffin's answer: \"Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids, and we thought, 'Yeah, this is a great idea. It'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years old, the first thing you think about is, 'How can I piss people off?' you know? And it's very good to ... it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, especially it's easy to piss off your parents and adults in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a no parking sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [sic] showing ... it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life, and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought, and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion. It's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad ... It's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will ... it's something mankind will ... I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans.\"\nBentley's answer: \"Brett made that when we were fifteen years old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said, 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said, 'That's really funny,' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [sic] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So, that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just ... it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said, 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide.\"\nBrian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, summed it up as follows:\n\"The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ... These are not people who thought that 21 years later they would be on the telephone doing interviews.\"\nThe crossbuster logo features prominently in the band's merchandising and album art.\n\n\nConcert tours\nEarly shows (1980–1987)\nSuffer Tour (1988–1989)\nNo Control Tour (1990)\nAgainst the Grain Tour (1991)\nGenerator Tour (1992–1993)\nRecipe for Hate Tour (1993–1994)\nStranger than Fiction Tour (1994–1995)\nThe Gray Race Tour (1996–1997)\nTested Tour (1997)\nVans Warped Tour (1997, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009)\nNo Substance Tour (1998–1999)\nThe New America Tour (2000–2001)\nThe Process of Belief Tour (2002–2003)\nThe Empire Strikes First Tour (2004–2006)\nNew Maps of Hell Tour (2007–2009)\n30 Years Live Tour (2010)\nThe Dissent of Man Tour (2010–2011)\nRise Against and Four Year Strong Tour (2011)\nAustralian Soundwave Tour (2012)\nTrue North Tour (2013–2014)\nSummer Nationals Tour with the Offspring and Pennywise (2014)\nNorth American and European Tours (2015)\nSouth American and European Tours (2016)\nThe Vox Populi Tour with Against Me! and Dave Hause (2016)\nEuropean Tour (2017)\nPunk in Drublic Tour (2017)\nPunk in Drublic Tour Germany (2019)\nAge of Unreason Tour North America (2019)\nUnited States Tour with Alkaline Trio and War on Women (2021)\nSummer Of Discontent Tour with Dropkick Murphys and The Mainliners (2025)\n\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent members\n\nGreg Graffin – lead vocals (1980–present), keyboards (1980–1983)\nBrett Gurewitz – guitar, backing vocals (1980–1983, 1988–1994, 2001–present; not touring since 2001)\nJay Bentley – bass, backing vocals (1980–1982, 1986–present)\nBrian Baker – guitar, backing vocals (1994–present)\nMike Dimkich – guitar (2013–present)\nJamie Miller – drums (2016–present)\n\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nHow Could Hell Be Any Worse?

    "summary": "Bad Religion is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple lineup changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major-label Atlantic in 1993. The band pioneered the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s, establishing a formula for California-based punk bands such as Green Day and Epitaph-signed acts the Offspring, NOFX and Rancid. They are also cited as an inspiration or influence on the 1990s and 2000s pop punk, skate punk, post-hardcore, screamo and emo scenes.\nAtlantic reissued the previously released-on-Epitaph album, Recipe for Hate (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up Stranger than Fiction. Stranger than Fiction included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including \"Infected\", \"Stranger than Fiction\", and the re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" (the latter of which its original version appeared four years earlier on Against the Grain); the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with \"Sorrow\", \"Los Angeles Is Burning\", and \"The Devil in Stitches\" becoming Top 40 hits on the US charts while their sixteenth studio album, True North (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart where it peaked at number 19. The band's seventeenth studio album, Age of Unreason, was released on May 3, 2019.",

    "text": "Lorenzo Dow Gasser (May 3, 1876 – October 29, 1955) was a career officer in the United States Army. A veteran of the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, United States Military Government in Cuba, Pancho Villa Expedition, World War I, and World War II, he attained the rank of  major general and was a recipient of three awards of the  Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the French Legion of Honor (Chevalier). Gasser was best known for his command of the 31st Infantry Regiment as part of the 1932 U.S. response to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, his service as Deputy Chief of Staff of the United States Army (following George C. Marshall), and his Second World War presidency of the War Department Manpower Board.\nA native of Lykens, Ohio, Gasser was raised and educated in Tiffin, Ohio, where he worked as a glassworker and store clerk and served in the Ohio National Guard. He enlisted as a private in 1893, was promoted to sergeant, and received his commission as a captain in 1898. Gasser commanded Company E, 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish–American War, then served as a first lieutenant with the 43rd U.S. Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the Philippines during the  Philippine–American War. He then obtained a commission in the regular army, and served primarily with the 28th Infantry at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. From 1906 to 1909, he served with the 28th Infantry as part of the United States Military Government in Cuba. In early 1916, he took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition on the staff of the army's Southern Department headquarters in El Paso, Texas. During World War I, he served as assistant chief of staff of the  30th Division, assistant chief of staff of III Corps, and assistant chief of staff for transportation (G-4) at the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters. After the war, he served as deputy assistant chief of staff (G-4) in charge of disposing of enemy war materiel during the post-war occupation. Gasser's wartime service was recognized with award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal and French Legion of Honor (Chevalier).\nAfter the war, Gasser served on the War Department General Staff, as executive officer of the 10th Infantry Regiment, and on the staff of the army's Chief of Infantry. In 1931 he was assigned to command the  31st Infantry Regiment and the Post of Manila. In 1932, his regiment took part in the U.S. response to the  Japanese invasion of Manchuria. In June 1936, Gasser was promoted to brigadier general and in September he was assigned to command the 16th Infantry Brigade. From July 1939 to May 1940, Gasser served as  Deputy Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and he retired after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64. His service as Deputy Chief of Staff was recognized with a second award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal.\nIn 1941, Gasser was recalled to active duty for World War II and served as the War Department representative at the Office of Civilian Defense. In 1942, he was assigned as OCD's assistant director in charge of civilian protection and promoted to major general. In March 1943, he was appointed president of the War Department Manpower Board, and he served in this position until retiring again in December 1945. His wartime service was recognized with a third award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal and award of the Legion of Merit. In retirement, Gasser resided in Washington, D.C.. He died in Washington on October 29, 1955, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\nEarly life\nGasser was born in Lykens, Ohio, on May 3, 1876, a son of Frederick Gasser and Lucinda (Rhoads) Gasser. His father, a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, died in 1882, and Gasser and his siblings were raised by guardians in Tiffin, Ohio. Gasser attended the public schools of Tiffin and was employed as a glassworker and a clerk in a grocery store. In July 1893, Gasser enlisted in the Ohio Army National Guard's Company E, 2nd Infantry Regiment, and he advanced through the ranks to become a sergeant. In April 1898 he became company commander with the rank of captain.\n\n\nStart of career\nAt the start of the Spanish–American War, most of Gasser's National Guard company volunteered for federal service, and they were organized as Company E, 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He led his company during mobilization and training at Camp Asa S. Bushnell near Columbus, Ohio, Camp George H. Thomas near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Camp John S. Poland near Knoxville, Tennessee. The war ended in December 1898, and Gasser's company was discharged at Camp Sylvester B. Price near Macon, Georgia, in February 1899.\nGasser returned to Tiffin, but in August 1899 he resumed active military service when he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 43rd Infantry Regiment, a temporary unit raised for the Philippine–American War. Before he departed Tiffin, the mayor and other civic leaders presented Gasser with a ceremonial sword and uniform rank insignia, hat and gloves at a well-attended October 5 public gathering. He joined his regiment at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, then served in the Philippines as commander of the 43rd Infantry's Company A. He was promoted to captain in April 1901, and discharged in July 1901.\nAfter his discharge from the volunteers, Gasser was appointed a second lieutenant in the regular army with an effective date of February 1901, and assigned to the 21st Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to first lieutenant in January 1902, and served with his regiment in the Philippines from January 1902 to January 1904.\nFollowing his return from the Philippines, Gasser commanded Company I, 28th Infantry at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, after which he remained at Fort Snelling as a member of the regimental staff.  In September 1904, Gasser married Molly Gregory Sugrue of Tiffin. Because they had carried out their courtship in secret, Sugrue left Tiffin after telling friends and family that she was going to visit the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. They were first notified of the wedding by Sugrue's telegram informing them that she had traveled to San Francisco, where Gasser and she were married at the home of Archbishop Patrick William Riordan. They had no children and remained married until her death in 1951.\nFrom 1906 to 1909, Gasser served with the 28th Infantry as part of the United States Military Government in Cuba. He was promoted to captain in July 1911, and in September 1911 he was transferred to the 10th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. In November, he rejoined the 28th Infantry at Fort Snelling.\n\n\nContinued career\nIn February 1913, Gasser was assigned to temporary Quartermaster duty with U.S. forces in Galveston, Texas. In early 1916, he took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition when he was assigned to temporary staff duty with the army's Southern Department in El Paso, Texas. At the start of World War I in 1917, Gasser was assigned to duty with the Army General Staff in Washington, D.C. In October 1917, he was assigned as assistant chief of staff for the 30th Division during its organization and training at Camp Sevier, South Carolina. In January, Gasser returned to the War Department staff and was assigned as recorder of the Department of War's War Council, a body of senior officials responsible for directing planning and policy during the war.\nIn March 1918, he was promoted to temporary major and temporary lieutenant colonel, both to date from August 5, 1917. In June 1918, he arrived in France, where he served as assistant chief of staff for III Corps, then attended the General Staff College course in Langres. In September, he was assigned as assistant chief of staff for transportation (G-4) at the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters. Gasser remained in Europe after the end of the war in November 1918, and served as deputy assistant chief of staff (G-4) in charge of disposing of enemy war materiel during the post-war occupation. He returned to the United States in February 1919, and his wartime service was recognized with award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal. and French Legion of Honor (Chevalier).\nAfter returning to the United States, Gasser served on the War Department General Staff until July 1920, when he was assigned as a student at the Army War College. After graduating in June 1921, he was assigned as secretary of the War Department General Staff. In 1925, he was assigned to the 10th Infantry at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. In 1927, he was assigned to staff duty in the office of the Chief of Infantry. He was promoted to colonel in May 1928.\n\n\nLater career\n\nIn June 1931, Gasser was assigned to command the 31st Infantry Regiment and the Post of Manila in the Philippines. In February 1932, Gasser led the 31st Infantry to China, where it took part in the protection of U.S. government and business interests during the American response to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. In July, the 31st Infantry resumed duty in Manila. In February 1934, Gasser returned to the United States and was assigned as chief of staff of the Fourth Corps Area at Fort McPherson, Georgia.\nGasser was promoted to brigadier general in June 1936 and in September he was assigned to command the 16th Infantry Brigade, a unit of the 8th Infantry Division, at Fort Meade, Maryland. In August 1937, he was assigned as the army's assistant chief of staff for personnel (G-1). In July 1939, George C. Marshall, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the United States Army, was promoted to Chief of Staff of the United States Army. When Marshall requested that Gasser serve as his deputy, Gasser protested that he was too old and would retire in less than a year. Marshall countered that Gasser's experience and institutional knowledge would be invaluable to Marshall as Marshall began his new duties, so Gasser consented. Because his retirement was imminent, Gasser was ineligible for promotion to major general, so he served as Marshall's acting deputy until May 1940, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 and was succeeded by William Bryden. At his retirement, he received a second award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal, which was presented by Secretary of War Harry Woodring.\nIn retirement, Gasser advocated military preparedness in speeches to civilian and military audiences and volunteered to inspect camps and review troops as the army expanded in anticipation of entry into World War II. In May 1941, Gasser was recalled to active duty and assigned as the War Department representative at the Office of Civilian Defense, a wartime agency created to coordinate federal activities including nighttime blackouts and air raid warnings intended to protect civilians and wartime industries in the event of an invasion or emergency.\nIn early 1942, Gasser was promoted to major general and assigned as OCD’s assistant director in charge of civilian protection. In July 1942, Gasser was one of the members of the military commission that tried and convicted the participants of Operation Pastorius. Pastorius was a German effort to land covert operatives in the United States for the purpose of sabotaging the American war effort. The eight agents were apprehended almost immediately after they arrived in June, and six of them were executed in August. In February 1943, theater commander Dwight Eisenhower requested that Marshall assign a general officer to serve as Eisenhower's personal representative at the front during the Tunisian campaign. Gasser was among those Eisenhower suggested, but when Marshall replied that Omar Bradley, another officer on Eisenhower's list, who had served under Gasser when Gasser was the Army's G-1, was immediately available, Eisenhower concurred.\nIn March 1943, the army created the War Department Manpower Board, a five-member panel headed by Gasser that reviewed civilian and military staffing requirements at army facilities throughout the United States to identify areas where the War Department could implement economies and efficiencies as it attempted to balance the army’s need for uniformed soldiers with the need for civilian employees in wartime industries. In May 1943,  Gasser received the honorary degree of Doctor of Military Science (DScMil) from Pennsylvania Military College. In late 1944 and early 1945, Gasser traveled to Europe to conduct manpower reviews of U.S. Army bases, and he returned to the U.S. in March. In September 1945, Gasser received the Legion of Merit to recognize his work with the Office of Civilian Defense and a third award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal to commend his service with the manpower board, both of which were presented by Marshall. He retired for the second time in December 1945.\n\n\nDeath and burial\n\nIn retirement, Gasser was a resident of the Kennedy–Warren Apartment Building in Washington, D.C. An avid golfer, Gasser belonged to the Army and Navy Club, Chevy Chase Club and Burning Tree Club, and he frequently played with Eisenhower and other senior army leaders. In August 1948, he donated his papers and collection of military memorabilia to the Seneca County Museum in Tiffin. In October 1946, 1948, and 1952 Gasser was one of the speakers at reunions of the company he commanded during the Spanish–American War.\nGasser died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington on October 29, 1955.

The abandoned station was restored in 1999 and is one of two surviving U&D branch stations. It is now the headquarters of the Mountain Top Historical Society. It is also the start of the Kaaterskill Rail Trail, a scenic hiking trail along the former railway.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nKaaterskill Railroad\nThe station was owned by the narrow-gauge Kaaterskill Railroad, MP 6.6, and was one of the busiest stations on the line. It was called Haines Corners Station, as the town's original name was\nHaines Corners. It was very busy and was across from a boarding house. It was near a six-span bridge, called the Girder Deck Bridge, which was the largest structure on the railroad. It was right across from another station that was owned by another narrow-gauge railroad. The KRR station soon became a station that belonged to a standard-gauge railroad called the Ulster and Delaware, which turned the Kaaterskill Railroad into a branch, and combined it with a portion of another narrow-gauge railroad, called the Stony Clove and Catskill Mountain Railway.\n\n\nUlster and Delaware Railroad\nThe station, located at branch MP 18.4, wasn't changed during the period that pre-fabricated stations being erected in between the years of 1900 and 1901. However, the station was causing problems; as passenger trains grew the early 1910s, the State of New York was sending complaints that the station was too small for the town it was serving. In 1913, U&D finally gave in and tore the old station down, making way for a new one, a few hundred feet away.\nThis new station, branch MP 18.5, looked like the Tannersville station, but it didn't have the portico sticking out of the back. It was a full season passenger station until the New York Central purchased the U&D in 1932. This was when it became a summer-only station, with it being a flagstop in the other seasons. If a passenger were to get picked up at the station in another season, the business and income would be handled by the station agent at Tannersville.\nBut when the NYC was granted permission by the ICC to abandon the branches in 1939, and to scrap it in 1940, the station was abandoned. It is, at present, the headquarters of the Mountain Top Historical Society, and one of only two surviving U&D branch stations.\nIn 2012, the Ulster & Delaware Railroad Historical Society donated 132 feet of 105lb rail to the Mountain Top Historical Society so that a display track could be built on the former railroad right-of-way besides the station.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as the Ulster and Delaware Railroad Station.\n\n\nKaaterskill Rail Trail\nIn 2013, a hiking track called the Kaaterskill Rail Trail was completed. The first phase was a 1.5 mile section between the Mountain Top Historical Society property and DEC land at the end of Laurel House Road. In 2016, further improvements were completed allowing visitors to travel from Haines Falls Station to the North/ South Lake Campground via the Rail Trail and the Escarpment Trail, with multiple views of Kaaterskill Falls accessible to the public. These upgrades also sought to improve safety at the falls, as a number of falling deaths have occurred in recent years.\n\n\nBibliography\nInterstate Commerce Commission (1940).

Willson was a vaudeville performer in New York City whom Hearst admired, and they married in 1903.  The couple had five sons, but began to drift apart in the mid-1920s, when Millicent became tired of her husband's longtime affair with actress Marion Davies.\n\n\nLife and career\nMillicent was the daughter of vaudevillian George Willson and Hannah Murray Willson. Following in their father's footsteps, Millicent and her older sister Anita performed at the Herald Square Theater on Broadway in 1897 as \"bicycle girls\" in Edward Rice's The Girl from Paris. Fourteen-year-old Millicent caught the eye of the 34-year-old W.R. Hearst, and their first dates were chaperoned by her sister Anita. After a six-year courtship, the publisher and aspiring politician Hearst married 20-year-old Millicent Willson on April 28, 1903.\n\nMillicent Hearst gave birth to five sons: George Randolph Hearst, born on April 23, 1904; William Randolph Hearst Jr., born January 27, 1908; John Randolph Hearst, born September 26, 1909; and twins Randolph Apperson Hearst and David Whitmire (né Elbert Willson) Hearst, born December 2, 1915. W.R.'s mother Phoebe Apperson Hearst, at first dismayed by Millicent’s humble origins, warmed to her daughter-in-law with the birth of the grandchildren.\nMillicent was a member of the New York State Commission for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition held in San Francisco in 1915 and acted as chief official hostess at the New York Pavilion during the exposition.\nNew York City Mayor John Hylan appointed her chairman of the Mayor’s Committee of Women on National Defense during World War I. The committee sponsored entertainments for servicemen, operated a canteen, encouraged enlistments, sponsored patriotic rallies, and provided staples such as coal, milk, and ice to the needy. Hearst also served on wartime committees to raise funds for the rebuilding of France and the relief of French orphans.\nIn 1921, she founded the Free Milk Fund for Babies, which provided free milk to the poor of New York City for decades. She also hosted charitable fundraisers for a variety of causes, including crippled children, unemployed girls, the New York Women’s Trade League, the Democratic National Committee, the Evening Journal - New York Journal Christmas Fund, and the Village Welfare of Port Washington, New York. Eleanor Roosevelt joined Millicent Hearst at many of these charitable events during the Great Depression.\nThe Hearsts were married until W.R. Hearst's death in 1951. They never divorced, in part due to her Catholicism, but were estranged starting in 1926 when his liaison with Marion Davies became public. Millicent Hearst  sought a divorce from W.R. Hearst in 1937, but the divorce fell through when she insisted on Cosmopolitan magazine as part of her property settlement, to which W.R. Hearst would not agree. \nMillicent Hearst established a separate life and residence in New York City as a socialite and philanthropist, rarely visiting her husband at their estate in San Simeon, California, known as Hearst Castle. She remained close to her five sons throughout her life.\nMillicent Willson Hearst died on December 5, 1974, more than two decades after the death of her husband, and was buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nFinding Aid to the Millicent Willson Hearst Papers, 1914-1947 (bulk 1926-1935) at The Bancroft Library",

    "text": "Major Lee Applewhite (born July 26, 1978) is an American college football coach and former player. He is the head football coach for the University of South Alabama, a position he has held since 2024. Prior to that he was the head coach at the University of Houston from 2017 to 2018, where he previously served as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He started his coaching career in 2003 and in addition to South Alabama and Houston he has held various positions at Texas, Syracuse, Rice and Alabama.  \nAs a player he played college football for the Texas Longhorns where he shared quarterback duties with Chris Simms from 1998 to 2001 earning All-Big 12 honors, was named the Big 12 Co-Offensive Player of the Year and Offensive Freshman of the year and set eight school records. Many of these still stand, including the longest pass play (97 yards), and most yards passing in a game (473). He previously held the record for career yards (8,353) and consecutive passes without an interception (156).\n\n\nPlaying career\nApplewhite was a quarterback for the Texas Longhorns from 1998 to 2001. Recruited from Catholic High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by then Texas coach John Mackovic, he was later coached by Mack Brown. While at Texas, the undersized Applewhite's tenure was noted both for his often gritty heroics as well as his battle for playing time with the heralded blue chip recruit Chris Simms, son of New York Giants legend Phil Simms. Applewhite led Texas to two Big 12 Championship games, to victory in 2 Bowl games, and set 48 school records along the way.\nAfter redshirting the 1997 season, an injury to starting quarterback Richard Walton catapulted Applewhite into the starting job two games into his redshirt freshman season in 1998. Applewhite went 8–2 as a starter, including upsets of #7 Nebraska 20–16, which broke the Cornhuskers' 47-home game winning streak, and #6 Texas A&M. In a blowout victory over Oklahoma, Applewhite threw a 97-yard touchdown pass to Wane McGarity, the longest pass in Texas history. He capped the season by leading the Longhorns to a 38–11 victory over the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the Cotton Bowl Classic. It was Texas' first Cotton Bowl victory since 1982.\nIn 1999, Applewhite started almost every game, leading Texas to a 9–4 record, a Big 12 South Championship and the Cotton Bowl. Going into the Texas A&M game (often referred to as the Bonfire Game, as it followed the death of 12 students during construction of A&M's annual bonfire).  Texas was ranked #5, but after Applewhite and backup quarterback Chris Simms was unable to produce Texas fell behind. It was during the last six minutes when Applewhite fumbled on their last possession losing the game for the Longhorns. That was followed by losses to Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game and to Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. Applewhite suffered a knee injury in the 4th quarter of the Cotton Bowl and was replaced by Simms.\nThe next season Applewhite was again the starter, but after a loss to Stanford in the second game, Simms was given the start the following game against Houston. Simms struggled early and Applewhite got the majority of the snaps in what turned out to be a rout, thus regaining the starting job. He lost it again following a season-ending knee injury in the Texas Tech game. At that point Texas was 7–2 and ranked #19. Texas went 2–1 with Simms as quarterback, and Mack Brown was impressed enough to name Simms the starter before spring practice began.\nApplewhite was the backup for Simms for the entirety of the 2001 regular season and Simms led Texas to a #3 ranking and a trip to the Big 12 Championship against #10 Colorado. But in that game Applewhite got the opportunity to go out as a starter and a hero. Because of an upset loss by Florida earlier in the day, Texas went into that game knowing that a win would put them in the BCS Championship Game. But Simms had a disastrous game and was responsible for four turnovers (three interceptions and a fumble) in the first half of play. Meanwhile, Major was seen attempting to rally the offense before they took to the field, even as the restless Texas fans booed Simms. Two plays later, Simms injured his finger and Applewhite entered the game with Texas down 29–10. His second pass was completed for a 79-yard touchdown and he baited the University of Colorado bench in an attempt to rally the Texas fans. He led Texas back to within two points, but eventually Texas would come up short losing 39–37 after an onside kick attempt failed.\nHis near miracle comeback, combined with Simms' injury, earned him the starting position for his final game at Texas, the 2001 Holiday Bowl and he didn't disappoint. In perhaps his finest game, he led Texas from behind three times throwing for a school record 473 yards and four touchdowns. In a fourth quarter aerial assault, Texas scored 23 points in a little over 10 minutes to take the lead, but Washington came back to take the lead once more. With 1:49 left in the game, Applewhite engineered a 7-play, 80-yard touchdown drive with passes of 25 and 37 yards to win the game. Applewhite was named the Holiday Bowl MVP as a result. He finished with a record as a starter of 22–8.\nApplewhite played in the 2001 Hula Bowl.\nAfter graduation, Applewhite was signed by the New England Patriots days after the 2002 NFL draft, but quit prior to the start of camp to finish his degree and to pursue a career in coaching.\n\n\nCoaching career\nReturning to Texas as a graduate assistant, Applewhite served in that position until early 2005 when he was offered the position of quarterbacks coach at Syracuse University by new head coach Greg Robinson, Texas' former defensive coordinator. Applewhite's first coaching job was a disaster, with the Orange going 1–10, their worst record in school history (after 6-6 the year before) and scoring their fewest points in more than 20 years (from 22.8 points in 2004 to 13.8 points in 2005). On January 8, 2006, after one year at Syracuse, Rice University named Applewhite offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under new head coach Todd Graham. Graham said of Applewhite's expected contribution to the new staff, \"We want to spread the field and throw the football, and every quarterback and receiver in this state will be interested in Rice with Major as our offensive coordinator.\" At Rice, Applewhite moved the team away from the wishbone offense and moved them to a more modern, one-running-back formation similar to that used by Texas. During his one season at Rice, the team posted a 7–6 record and attended its first bowl game in over forty years.\nAfter former Texas defensive coordinator Gene Chizik was hired as head coach at Iowa State University in December 2006, Applewhite was rumored to be joining his coaching staff. Applewhite, however, officially announced on December 4, 2006, that he would not leave Rice for Iowa State. He did however leave Rice only a month later, not for Iowa State but for Alabama, as he accepted an offer by newly hired Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban to serve as the offensive coordinator. Given his ties to the Lone Star State, Applewhite targeted a couple of Texas high school prospects, including Lennon Creer. Alabama eventually received commitments by quarterback Nick Fanuzzi and defensive back Tarence Farmer.\nIn his first season at Alabama, Applewhite improved the Crimson Tide offense, which had averaged 22.3 points and 340.9 total yards per game under Dave Rader in 2006, to an average of 26.8 points and 372.6 total yards per game in 2007. Following a 41–17 blowout win over SEC rival Tennessee on October 20, Applewhite was named \"Offensive Coordinator of the Week.\" Alabama, however, then lost the last four games of the season, including a shocking 21–14 loss to Louisiana-Monroe.\nDuring the 2007 season, Applewhite was mentioned as a possible replacement for Art Briles as head coach at the University of Houston. Briles had left Houston for Baylor University. Applewhite, however, withdrew his name from the candidates list.\nOn January 16, 2008, Applewhite accepted an offer to become running backs coach at the University of Texas and he also served as assistant head coach to Mack Brown. Applewhite was announced as the co-offensive coordinator on January 6, 2011. The next day, Mack Brown announced that the primary play caller and other co-offensive coordinator would be Bryan Harsin from Boise State. Harsin was named head coach at Arkansas State University on December 12, 2012, and Applewhite assumed play calling duties at Texas and coached quarterbacks. He was co-offensive coordinator with wide receivers coach Darrell Wyatt.\nAt the start of 2014, following the hiring of new Texas head coach Charlie Strong, Applewhite accepted a one-year severance package and resigned as offensive coordinator with Texas.\n\n\nHouston\nOn January 8, 2015, Applewhite was hired by the University of Houston to be the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under new head coach Tom Herman for the Houston Cougars football program.\nOn December 9, 2016, Applewhite was promoted to head coach, becoming the 14th to hold the job for the program.  After going 0–3 in bowl games and losing 70–14 against Army, he was fired on December 30, 2018.\n\n\nPost–Houston\nAfter his termination, Applewhite returned to Alabama as an analyst.\nOn December 21, 2020, Applewhite was hired as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the South Alabama Jaguars. He had initially been hired for the same positions at Arkansas State, but elected to join South Alabama.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn early 2013, Applewhite admitted he was disciplined by the University of Texas for \"having an inappropriate relationship with a student at the 2009 Fiesta Bowl.\" The student was employed by the football team as an athletic trainer.  Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds reprimanded Applewhite by freezing his salary and requiring him to undergo counseling.  In a public statement Applewhite commented on the affair: \"Several years ago, I made a regretful decision resulting in behavior that was totally inappropriate. It was a one-time occurrence and was a personal matter. ... Through counsel I have worked with my wife and the incident is behind us. I am regretful for my mistake and humbled by this experience. I am deeply sorry for the embarrassment it has caused my friends, family, and the University.\"  The revelation occurred in the wake of investigation into Texas track coach Beverly Kearney's relationship with a student athlete.\n\n\nHead coaching record\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nSouth Alabama profile",

    "text": "Magdalena Spínola (1896–1991) was a Guatemalan teacher, poet and journalist. Orphaned at a young age, she found encouragement from her childhood neighbor Miguel Ángel Asturias for her literary dreams. After graduating from the country's Teacher's College, she taught school at a private academy and began to publish poems.\nThough her husband was part of dictator Jorge Ubico Castañeda's cabinet, they became enemies and Efraín Aguilar Fuentes, her husband, was arrested and shot. She was briefly arrested as well and ostracized by many. She was an ardent feminist and became outspoken about political issues after the fall of Ubico's government.\nShe was the biographer of Gabriela Mistral and one of the first female erotic poets of Central America.\n\n\nBiography\nMagdalena Spínola Stecker was born on 26 December 1896 in Guatemala to Rafael Spínola Orellana and Florencia Strecker Frías Her mother died when she was four years old and a year later her father died. She and her sister, Stella were then split up as well, with Stella going to live with her maternal grandparents and Magdalena sent to live with her paternal grandparents. Spínola's neighbor was Miguel Ángel Asturias, who became her childhood friend and with whom she discussed an awakening love of literature. Asturias would later dedicate his first book to her.\nSpínola began her schooling at the Dolores y Jesús Muños Kindergarten and then attended the Colegio \"Central de Señoritas\" under the tutelage of Concepción Saravia de Zirión. She was surprised to discover that her textbook prologue had been written by her father. After a time, she changed schools and began attending Colegio de Señoritas San Rosa. Completing her secondary education, Spínola enrolled in teacher's college at the Instituto Normal Central para Señoritas Belén graduating with her teaching credentials. She got a job at a private school Colegio \"Josefina González\" for the 1914–1915 term.\n\n\nEarly writing efforts\nIn 1915, Spínola wrote her first story, entitled Nubia and sent it to Revista Guatemala Informativa, where it was reviewed and accepted by Carlos Wyld Ospina, Virgilio Rodríguez Beteta and Máximo Soto Hall. Buoyed, by her success, she submitted pieces to La República, Revista La Esfera and the prestigious newspaper Quetzaltenango, but soon writing took a back seat as she and Efraín Aguilar Fuentes married and began their family. She quickly had five children, but lost a pair of twins and a baby, leaving her with her daughter, Lilian Eugenia, the oldest, and a son, Rafael, named after her father.\nUnder the presidency of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, Aguilar's family was persecuted and pushed into exile, first to El Salvador, then Honduras, and finally to Nicaragua. He settled in the city of León, Nicaragua and enrolled in the university there. Spínola, who did not accompany him in exile, revived her literary efforts and other tasks to stay busy. In 1925, inspired by successes in suffrage by women in England, France, and United States Spínola joined with Romelia Alarcón, Laura Bendfeldt, María Albertina Gálvez, Clemencia de Herrarte, Gloria Menéndez Mina,  Adriana de Palarea, and Graciela Quan to form the Comité Pro-Ciudadanía to fight for Guatemalan women's suffrage.\nThen in 1927, she began writing poetry again beginning with a poem entitled \"Amanecida\". She published works regularly in the newspapers El Día and Diario de Guatemala and the magazines Eco and Mercurio. Two years later in 1929 she competed in the poetry competition Juegos Florales organized by the Asociación de Periodistas y Escritores de Nicaragua. She won the prize but was stripped of it because they claimed it could not be given to foreign writers. She was disappointed, but entered another contest in December 1929 and won the prize and a monetary award, allowing her to spend Christmas in León with her husband. Her submission was a patriotic piece, Amad a la Patria (Love for the homeland). Three months later, on 27 March 1930, Aguilar graduated with his doctorate in law and returned to Guatemala, joining the cabinet of the newly elected president, Jorge Ubico Castañeda. Spínola had become a collaborator with the newspaper La Noticia and the magazine El Gráfico de Guatemala and life fell into a productive pattern with her writing several hours every day.\n\n\nTreason, murder and redemption\nThe calm didn't last. President Ubico announced that he was running for re-election. Aguilar spoke out against it, as it was against the constitution and the two became enemies.  Because of an alleged or actual plot, he and others were arrested and shot, Spínola was imprisoned briefly as well and even after her release was shunned by friends and family. She found solace from writing and returned to teaching, working at the Colegio San Sebastián, founded by Monseñor Mariano Rosell y Arellano in 1936 and 1937.\nIn 1937, she wrote El preámbulo de la maestra and published several poems in the leading woman's magazine of the era, Nosotras. Spínola participated in a 1938 anthology called Colección lila with  Angelina Acuña, Olga Violeta Luna de Marroquín, and María del Pilar de Garcia, which was Central America's first women's poetry collection, both written and published by women. The pieces Spínola included in the volume were laments of love lost, physical longing and have hints that she may have been criticizing the government in the only way possible in the highly censored climate. In 1942, Spínola won a literary prize from the weekly journal Verbum for her \"Sonetos del amor eucarístico\".\nWith the student revolts, overturn of the Ubico dictatorship and elections of 1944, Spínola's writing took on a more confrontational tone and she openly began to criticize the government and speak of feminism. Her husband was vindicated and elevated to the status as a hero by the leaders of the 1944 revolution. Increasingly she took on political roles and in 1944 alone, she accepted the presidency of the Association of Intellectual Women of Guatemala; became the secretary for the Guatemalan chapter of the Union of American Women (Unión de Mujeres Americanas); and became a board member for both the Alliance for Citizenship of Guatemalan Women and the Social Democratic Party. She also released a poem \"Elegía del que cayó\" publicly rebuking Ubico's execution of her husband.\nIn 1946, the government authorized a printing of 1,500 copies of a poetry collection called \"Alondra\", but though she needed the money, Spínola did not follow through as she was unsatisfied with the quality of the poems. Throughout the 1940s she remained political, joining several organizations promoting peace, women's rights, and in favor of a Palestinian state.\n\n\nLater career\nIn the early 1950s, Spínola's son Rafael became a diplomat and had several posts throughout South America. Spínola took advantage of the opportunity to travel, visiting Chile in 1954 and Peru between 1955 and 1956. During these travels she published pieces in various newspapers in Guatemala, especially travel commentaries like \"Desde Santiago de Chile\" and \"Desde la Ciudad de los Reyes\" which were published in El Imparcial. For many years, she had kept up a correspondence with the writer Carlos Wyld Ospina, which began in the 1940s. They became engaged in the 1950s and planned to marry, but Wyld  died in 1956, before they formalized their relationship.\nIn 1956, Spínola was honored by a group of Honduran poets and she traveled to Tegucigalpa to lecture about Gabriela Mistral for the group \"Ideas\". In 1958 she received a certificate of merit from her alma mater, Belén and in 1959 a similar acknowledgment from the Association of Guatemalan Journalists. In 1960, she won the first prize at the Day of the Americas celebration with the work Gabriela Mistral o la madre-maestra cantora. The 1960s were a busy time as she lectured, wrote newspaper articles and critiques of Guatemalan literature, and traveled. She performed her poetry as well, sometimes in recitals and regularly read them on the radio. In 1967, Spínola was diagnosed with a uterine tumor which proved to be malignant. She had surgery and traveled to Chile to rest and recuperate. She was able to realize a dream in 1968, when her first book Gabriela Mistral: huésped de honor de su patria was published in Chile, with a preface by her childhood friend Miguel Ángel Asturias.\nShe returned from Chile in 1971 for a reunion in the United States with her sister, Stella. But that event was marred when she learned that her daughter Lilian was seriously ill. In April, Lilian died from leukemia and those who knew her said it was the first time grief seemed to defeat Spínola who had lost her parents, husband, three other children, her lover and now her daughter. That same year she received the Gold Medal Francisco Méndez for her contributions to national literature, but she was too grief-stricken to stay in Guatemala and fled back to Chile and her son, Rafael.\nIn 1977, she published her first collection of poems, Tránsito lírico: poemas. In 1981, Horacio Figueroa Marroquín, published a book called Las nueve musas del parnaso guatemalense, in which he named Spínola one of the nine muses of Guatemala. A few months later, she was awarded the Order of Dolores Bedoya de Molina with the degree of Silver Star by President Lucas García. In 1984, Clara Luz Meneses A. de Soto published Spínola's biography.\nHer last years were spent in the company of her grandchildren who had formed the rock band Alux Nahual. In 1990, Spínola's son Rafael died and a few months later, her sister Stella died.\nMagdalena Spínola Stecker de Aguilar outlived them all, dying on 7 January 1991.\n\n\nSelected works\n\n\nBooks\nSpínola, Magdalena; Acuña, Angelina; del Pilar, Marí; Luna, Olga Violeta.

He received a parole in 1979, allowing Anderson to resume an intermittent music career, but the death of his son in 1991 and another prison sentence in 1994 temporarily derailed him. Anderson refused parole to give him time to reinvent himself and—reinvigorated by his desire to follow in his father's footsteps—devoted himself to a full-time career in music when Anderson was released in 1996.\nAnderson focused more on acoustic guitar, although he was still highly regarded as an amplified guitarist, often performing his father's repertoire at festivals with harmonica player Freddie Vanderford. The pair documented this phase of Anderson's career with a privately distributed cassette tape. He released two further albums, Carolina Bluesman (where he was joined on playing the guitar by Cool John Ferguson) in 2005, and Sittin' Here Singing the Blues, originally issued in 2006 on Music Maker.",

He was the son of Webb Vine Taylor and Grace Rogers. He received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago. He graduated in 1914 from Wayland Academy at Beaver Dam and from what was then Oshkosh Normal School in 1916. He earned his way through college by waiting on tables, mowing lawns and tending furnaces. After his graduation from Oshkosh Normal School, he served a year as principal of a small elementary school at Waukesha and then enlisted for two years in the U.S. Navy during World War I. He taught for two years at Wayland Academy and then received his bachelor's degree 1921 and his doctorate in 1929, both from the University of Chicago.\nHe was a member of the faculty at Amherst College from 1924 to 1965 where he helped to develop the college's American Studies Program. From 1948 to 1968,  he was the general editor of the program's book series called “Problems in American Civilization.\" The books were used nationally in colleges and secondary schools for many years. Taylor was the special editor of the series volumes on these subjects: the Turner thesis describing the role of the frontier in American history; “Jackson vs Biddle” the struggle over the Second Bank of the United States; “Hamilton and the National Debt\"; and “The Great Tariff Debate 1820 to 1830.”  His 1951 book The Transportation Revolution, 1815–1860 remains a key text in the analysis of the development of capitalism in the early republic..\nTaylor also served as the editor of the Journal of Economic History from 1955 to 1960. He was president of the American Studies Association from 1956 to 1958,  chairman of the Council on Research in Economic History from 1958 to 1962, and president of the Economic History Association from 1962 to 1964. During World War I Taylor served in the US Navy's aviation operations. He conducted research for the International Committee on Pride History in 1920 and 1931 and he was a senior agricultural economist for the US Department of Agriculture in 1938. He later held several positions in the Office of Price Administration and he served on the War Production Board from 1941 to 1946.\nThe George Rogers Taylor Prize is awarded annually \"to the (Amherst) student who, in the opinion of the American Studies Department, shows the most promise for creative and scholarly work in American studies.\"\n\n\nSelected works\nGeorge Rogers Taylor, Agrarian discontent in the Mississippi valley preceding the war of 1812 (1931)\nLouis M.

    "text": "Extreme tribology refers to tribological situations under extreme operating conditions which can be related to high loads and/or temperatures, or severe environments. Also, they may be related to high transitory contact conditions, or to situations with near-impossible monitoring and maintenance opportunities. In general, extreme conditions can typically be categorized as involving abnormally high or excessive exposure to e.g. cold, heat, pressure, vacuum, voltage, corrosive chemicals, vibration, or dust. The extreme conditions should include any device or system requiring a lubricant operating under any of the following conditions:\n\nBeyond the original machinery design specifications.\nBeyond the original machinery ambient parameters.\nApplication in an environmentally sensitive location.\nBeyond the original lubricant design specification.\nOperation in such extreme conditions is a great challenge for tribologists to develop tribosystems that could meet these extreme requirements. Often, only multifunctional materials fulfill such requirements.\n\n\nChallenges in tribology\nThe progression of the humanity suggested new technologies, devices, materials and surface treatments which required novel lubricants and lubrication systems. Likewise, the development of high-speed trains, aircraft, space stations, computer hard discs, artificial implants, and bio-medical and many other engineering systems have only been possible through the advances in tribology. Challenges in tribology including sustainability, climate change and gradual degradation of the environment require new solutions and innovative approaches.\n\n\nTribology at extreme temperatures\nIn many tribological applications, the system components are exposed to extreme temperatures (very high or ultra-low temperatures). Examples of such applications can be found in the aerospace, mining, power generation, metalworking industries, and steel plants. \nIn tribology, an application can be considered to operate at elevated temperatures when the use of conventional lubricants, i.e. oils and greases is no longer effective due to their rapid decomposition at around 300 °C. Smart lubricating materials and multifunctional lubricating materials are developed as new class materials with increased safety, long-term durability and as less amount of repairing costs as possible. Such materials are designed to be self-diagnostic, self-repairing, and self-adjusting. These materials include structural/lubricating integrated material, anti-radiation lubricating material, conductive or insulation lubricating material, etc.\nAt low temperatures and in cryogenic environments, liquid lubricants can solidify or become highly viscous and not be effective. On the other end, solid lubricants have usually been found to be better than liquid lubricants or greases. The most common solid lubricants for cryogenic temperature are polytetrafluoroethylene, polycarbonate, tungsten disulphide (WS2), and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). In addition, ice could be a possible lubricant for deformation in cryogenic environments which provides a method of self-lubrication in the sense that no active mechanism is needed to supply a lubricant.\n\n\nTribology at micro/nano-scale\nThe fundamental difference that distinguishes micro/nano tribology from classical macro tribology is that micro/nano tribology considers the friction and wear of two objects in relative sliding whose dimensions range from micro-scales down to molecular and atomic scales. MEMS refer to micro-electromechanical systems that have a characteristic length of 100 nm to 1 mm, while NEMS are the nano-electromechanical systems that have a characteristic length of less than 100 nm. There are great challenges in the development of a fundamental understanding of tribology, surface contamination and environment in MEMS/NEMS. One of these challenges in such extreme tribological situations is the adhesion force which can be up to a million times greater than the force of gravity. This is due to the fact that the adhesion force decreases linearly with size, whereas the gravitational force decreases with the size cubed. Low surface energy, hydrophobic coatings applied to oxide surfaces are promising for minimizing adhesion and static-charge accumulation.\n\n\nTribology under vacuum conditions\nUnder vacuum environment, it is a problem to achieve acceptable endurance of tribological components due to the fact that the lubricant may either freeze, evaporate or decompose and hence become ineffective. Tribological properties of materials exhibit different characteristics at the space vacuum as compared to the atmospheric pressure. Adhesive and fatigue wear are the two important types of wear encountered in a vacuum environment. Vacuum not only radically affects the wear behavior of metals and alloys in contact, but also has a pronounced influence on nonmetals as well. Different new kinds of materials are developed for potentially operating in vacuum environments. For instance, CuZn39Pb3 and Ni3(Si,Ti) alloys have excellent anti-wear properties in all the vacuum conditions. Types of solid lubricants used in space applications:\n\nSoft metal films: gold, silver, lead, indium, and barium.\nLamellar solids: molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, cadmium iodide, lead iodide, molybdenum diselenide, intercalated graphite, fluorinated graphite, and phthalocyanines.\nPolymers: polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimides, fluorinated ethylene-propylene, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene UHMWPE, polyether ether ketone, polyacetal, and epoxy resins.\nOther low shear strength materials: fluorides of calcium, lithium, barium, and rare earths; sulfides of bismuth and cadmium; and oxides of lead, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc.\nThe most common way to utilize a solid lubricant is to apply it to a metal surface as a film or surface coating of a thin layer of soft film, typically molybdenum disulphide, artificially deposited on the surfaces. Coatings of solid lubricant are built up atom by atom yielding a mechanically strong surface layer with a long service life and the minimum quantity of solid lubricant.\n\n\nGeotribology\nThe term \"geotribology\" was first stated by Harmen Blok with no significant discussion. Later, geotribology framework was employed to analyze the flow mechanics of granular sand. Even though tribological concepts can be utilized to many geosciences phenomena, the two research communities are separated. In earth science, many tribological concepts were applied successively, particularly in rock friction analyses. The asperity-asperity contact mechanism was applied to rock friction experiments that led to the rate-state friction law that prevails in earthquake analyses.\n\n\nTribology in high dust and dirty areas\nHigh dust areas and dirt environments can weigh profoundly on a lubricant due to the high risk of particle contamination. These contaminants readily form a grinding paste, causing failure of tribosystems and subsequently damaging of equipment. This type of contamination most frequently takes place when airborne or stagnant particles gain access to the lubrication system through open ports and hatches, especially in systems with negative pressure. Half of a bearing loss of usefulness can be attributed to wear. This wear, which occurs through surface abrasion, fatigue and adhesion, is often the result of particle contamination.\n\n\nTribology in radiation environments\nIn radiation environments, liquid lubricants can decompose. Suitable solid lubricants can extend the operation of systems beyond 106 rads while maintaining relatively low coefficients of friction.\n\n\nTribology for limited weight applications\nIn weight-limited spacecraft and rovers, solid lubrication has the advantage of weighing substantially less than liquid lubrication. The elimination (or limited use) of liquid lubricants and their replacement by solid lubricants would reduce spacecraft weight and, therefore, have a dramatic impact on mission extent and craft maneuverability.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20000057374.pdf\nhttps://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-0-387-92897-5",

    "text": "Lonnie Smith (July 3, 1942 – September 28, 2021), styled Dr. Lonnie Smith, was an American jazz Hammond B3 organist who was a member of the George Benson quartet in the 1960s. He recorded albums with saxophonist Lou Donaldson for Blue Note before being signed as a solo act. He owned the label Pilgrimage, and was named the year's best organist by the Jazz Journalists Association nine times.\n\n\nEarly life\nSmith was born in Lackawanna, New York, on July 3, 1942.  He was raised by his mother and stepfather, and the family had a vocal group and radio program.  He stated that his mother was a major influence on him musically, as she introduced him to gospel, classical, and jazz music.\n\n\nCareer\nSmith was part of several vocal ensembles in the 1950s, including the Teen Kings which included Grover Washington Jr., on sax and his brother Daryl on drums. Art Kubera, the owner of a local music store, gave Smith his first organ, a Hammond B3.\n\n\nGeorge Benson Quartet\nSmith's affinity for R&B mixed with his own personal style as he became active in the local music scene. He moved to New York City in 1965, where he met George Benson, the guitarist for Jack McDuff's band.  Benson and Smith connected on a personal level, and the two formed the George Benson Quartet, featuring Lonnie Smith, in 1966.\n\n\nSolo career; Finger Lickin' Good\nAfter two albums under Benson's leadership, It's Uptown and Cookbook, Smith recorded his first solo album (Finger Lickin' Good Soul Organ) in 1967, with George Benson (and guest Melvin Sparks) on guitar, Ronnie Cuber on baritone sax, and Marion Booker on drums. This combination remained stable for the next five years.\nAfter recording several albums with Benson, Smith became a solo recording artist and subsequently recorded over 30 albums under his own name. Numerous prominent jazz artists joined Smith on his albums and in his live performances, including Lee Morgan, David \"Fathead\" Newman, King Curtis, Terry Bradds, Blue Mitchell, Joey DeFrancesco and Joe Lovano.\n\n\nBlue Note Records\nIn 1967, Smith met Lou Donaldson, who put him in contact with Blue Note Records. Donaldson asked Smith and Benson to record with him on his Blue Note album, Alligator Bogaloo, which was recorded in April 1967, and included Melvin Lastie Sr., and Leo Morris (AKA Idris Muhammad). Blue Note signed Smith in 1968, and he released five albums on the label, including Think! (with Lee Morgan, David Newman, Melvin Sparks, and Marion Booker) and Turning Point (with Lee Morgan, Bennie Maupin, Melvin Sparks, and Idris Muhammad).\nSmith's next album Move Your Hand was recorded at the Club Harlem in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in August 1969. The album's reception allowed his reputation to grow beyond the Northeast.  He recorded another studio album, Drives, and a live album (unreleased at the time), Live at Club Mozambique (recorded in Detroit on May 21, 1970), before leaving Blue Note.\nSmith recorded one album in 1971 for Creed Taylor's CTI subsidiary label, Kudu, CTI having already signed George Benson.  After a break from recording, he then spent most of the mid-1970s with producer Sonny Lester and his Groove Merchant label, then with Lester's new group of LRC labels.  It resulted in four albums, with the music output veering between jazz, soul, funk, fusion and even the odd disco-styled track.\nSmith rejoined the Blue Note label in March 2015.  He released his first Blue Note album in 45 years titled Evolution which was released January 29, 2016, featuring special guests: Robert Glasper and Joe Lovano.  His second Blue Note album All in My Mind was recorded live at \"The Jazz Standard\" in NYC (celebrating his 75th birthday with his longtime musical associates: guitarist Jonathan Kreisberg and drummer Johnathan Blake), and released January 12, 2018. His third Blue Note album, Breathe was also recorded live and released March 26, 2021. It features Iggy Pop on two studio vocal tracks, \"Why Can't We Live Together\" and \"Sunshine Superman\".\n\n\nTours and performances\n\nSmith toured the northeastern United States heavily during the 1970s. He concentrated largely on smaller neighborhood venues during this period. His sidemen included Donald Hahn on trumpet, Ronnie Cuber, Dave Hubbard, Bill Easley and George Adams on saxes, George Benson, Perry Hughes, Marc Silver, Billy Rogers and Larry McGee on guitars, and Joe Dukes, Sylvester Goshay, Phillip Terrell, Marion Booker, Jimmy Lovelace, Charles Crosby, Art Gore, Norman Connors, and Bobby Durham on drums.\nSmith performed at several prominent jazz festivals with artists including Grover Washington Jr., Ron Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, Lou Donaldson, Ron Holloway, and Santana. He also played with musicians outside of jazz, such as Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight, and Etta James.\n\n\nPersonal life\nSmith had five children: Lani, Chandra, Charisse, Lonnie, and Vonnie.\nSmith died of pulmonary fibrosis on September 28, 2021, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at the age of 79.\n\n\nPublic image\nStarting in the 1970s, Smith added the \"Dr.\" title to his name. The origin of the moniker is unclear and was not an academic title. One theory is that fellow musicians called Smith this due to his ability to \"doctor up\" their music. Another is that he adopted the title in an attempt to differentiate himself from other musicians. Smith himself gave the following explanation:But I’m a doctor of music. I’ve been playing long enough to operate on it, and I do have a degree, and I will operate on you. I’m a neurosurgeon. If you need something done to you, I can do it. But when I go up on that stand, the only thing I’m thinking of is music. I’m thinking to touch you with that music. I don’t think about the turban, I don’t think about the doctor — I just think about how I’m going to touch you.Smith was well known for wearing a turban.  He stated that the turban had no religious significance and was something he had worn since he was young. Matt Collar of AllMusic suggested the turban was a theatrical gesture to his spiritual views on music, but Smith himself said he did not know why he started wearing a turban and referenced the iconic headwear of Sun Ra and Sonny Rollins' mohawk.\n\n\nAwards and honors\nOrgan Keyboardist of the Year,  Jazz Journalist Association, 2003–2005, 2008–2011, 2013, 2014\nNEA Jazz Master, 2017\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nAs leader\nFinger Lickin' Good Soul Organ (Columbia, 1967)\nThink!

    "text": "The Speculum Virginum (Latin for \"Mirror of Virgins\"; German: Jungfrauenspiegel) is a 12th-century  didactic treatise on female monastic life.\nThe original text dates to the mid-12th century.  The author's identity is uncertain.  One theory holds it was written by the Benedictine monk Conrad of Hirsau.  Another possibility is that it was composed at the Augustinian Abbey of Andernach, founded by Richard, abbot of Springiersbach, for his sister in 1128. Richard appointed a priest, one Conrad, as spiritual advisor to his sister, and some scholars have suggested this Conrad as the text's author.\nThe work provides one of the earliest comprehensive theologies of cloistered religious life. It mainly consists of a hypothetical dialogue between Peregrinus, a male religious teacher, and Theodora, a female disciple. The dialogue seeks to strengthen the determination and resolve of Theodora (and hence by example, other readers) to live life as a virgin dedicated to God.\nThe growth of the various manuscripts of the Speculum Virginum in the Middle Ages had a particular resonance for women who sought a dedicated religious life. While impacting the development of female monastic life, it also influenced the proliferation of male monastic orders, and even Protestant theology via the writings of Nikolaus Selnecker and Conrad Porta.\nThe text was widely read from the 12th century until the Reformation, and it survives in 26 vernacular (Middle Low German) and in 30 Latin recensions.

    "summary": "The Speculum Virginum (Latin for \"Mirror of Virgins\"; German: Jungfrauenspiegel) is a 12th-century  didactic treatise on female monastic life.\nThe original text dates to the mid-12th century.  The author's identity is uncertain.  One theory holds it was written by the Benedictine monk Conrad of Hirsau.  Another possibility is that it was composed at the Augustinian Abbey of Andernach, founded by Richard, abbot of Springiersbach, for his sister in 1128. Richard appointed a priest, one Conrad, as spiritual advisor to his sister, and some scholars have suggested this Conrad as the text's author.\nThe work provides one of the earliest comprehensive theologies of cloistered religious life. It mainly consists of a hypothetical dialogue between Peregrinus, a male religious teacher, and Theodora, a female disciple. The dialogue seeks to strengthen the determination and resolve of Theodora (and hence by example, other readers) to live life as a virgin dedicated to God.\nThe growth of the various manuscripts of the Speculum Virginum in the Middle Ages had a particular resonance for women who sought a dedicated religious life. While impacting the development of female monastic life, it also influenced the proliferation of male monastic orders, and even Protestant theology via the writings of Nikolaus Selnecker and Conrad Porta.\nThe text was widely read from the 12th century until the Reformation, and it survives in 26 vernacular (Middle Low German) and in 30 Latin recensions. The Latin text was edited with a German translation by Seyfarth (1990). Most surviving manuscripts date to the 15th century. An early version of the Latin text is preserved in Cologne W276a (ca. 1140), possibly originating from Andernach, and in BL Arundel MS 44.",

    "text": "The Baysunghur Shahnameh (Persian: شاهنامه بایسنقری) is an illustrated manuscript of the Shahnameh, the national epic of Greater Iran. The work on this manuscript was started in 1426 at the order of Baysunghur Mirza, the Timurid prince, and was completed on 5 Jumada 833, (January 31, 1430). It is now in the museum of The Golestan Palace, in Tehran, Iran, and regarded as a key masterpiece of the Persian miniature.\nAccording to the preface, apparently written by Baysunghur himself for this volume, and usually copied in later manuscripts, it was not a copy of a previous manuscript, but instead it was prepared by comparing several older manuscripts. The purpose of this comparison was not to achieve greater fidelity to Ferdowsi's original Shahnameh, it was to modernize the language of the text and to add verses to it. Because of this, the Baysunghur Shahnameh is one of the most voluminous manuscripts of Shahnameh, consisting of some 58,000 verses (today's version of Shahnameh consists of about 50,000 verses). The value of this manuscript is not because of its text, but in its artistry. Written in Nastaʿlīq script by Jafar Tabrizi, it has 31 lines per page, 346 folios, and 21 manuscript paintings in the Herat School style and is one of the most important works to be identified with this school. The script is set in 6 columns, which is a nod to tradition. The script of contemporaneous Shahnamehs in the \"modern\" style were set in 4 columns. Earlier Shahnamehs have had cramped spreads with less pages and more illustrations. The Baysunghur atelier also produced a Shahnameh without any illustrations before this one. With the production of this earlier Shahnameh and the Baysunghur Shahnameh, new horizons were being explored in book design within the Timurid period. Beside the so-called Demotte Shahnameh and the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp, the Baysunghur Shahnameh is one of the most important and famous manuscripts of the Shahnameh. It was shown in London in 1931, and at the exhibition Masterpieces of Persian Painting at the Museum of Tehran in 2005.\nIt is included in UNESCO's Memory of the World international register of globally-important cultural heritage.\n\n\nMiniatures\n\nThe manuscript paintings commonly known as \"miniatures\" found in the Baysunghur Shahnameh were well executed with bright colors and crisp lines that were revolutionary for the time. There are 20 illustrations plus one double image for the frontispiece, unlike other versions which could have over 100 images. The illustration is supposed to correspond to the accompanying text. However, since there are so few illustrations, their inclusion gives the impression that their respective corresponding passages are of relatively more importance. It is likely that Baysunghur chose the 21 subjects for the miniatures himself. Several of these are unusual choices for illustrations, and several have to do with the subject of a prince impatient to inherit (who never does). The frontispiece shows a prince which is probably a portrait of Baysunghur. There are other possible portraits of the prince throughout the miniatures, but all show events that occurred before his rule and birth. The illustrations follow the tradition of the Shahnameh in most senses. There are 6 enthronement scenes, and 9 battle or killing scenes. All Shahnamehs have these motifs and without them it would not truly qualify as a book of kings. Some of the miniatures show new ideas that had not been shown in earlier Shahnameh versions. These include Luhrasp enthroned, combat between Rustam and Barzu, Rustam and Isfandiyar shaking hands, Gulnar falling in love with Ardashir, and Yazdagird giving Bahram Gur to Mundhir the Arab. Although these scenes are new, their iconography and style are not since they pull from traditional motifs. At about 38 x 26 cm, the page size was unusually large for the period, and several miniatures fill the whole page, with the frontispiece across two pages. In both of these design aspects, this manuscript shows the direction later royal commissions would take.\n\n\nSee also\nMemory of the World Register – Asia and the Pacific\nList of Memory of the World Register in Iran\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBlair, Sheila, and Bloom, Jonathan M., The Art and Architecture of Islam, 1250-1800, 1995, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, ISBN 0300064659\nCanby, Sheila R., Persian Painting, 1993, British Museum Press, ISBN 9780714114590\nPiotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M.

    "title": "History of the United States (1849–1865)",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752072",
    "text": "The history of the United States from 1849 to 1865 was dominated by the tensions that led to the American Civil War between North and South, and the bloody fighting in 1861–1865 that produced Northern victory in the war and ended slavery. At the same time industrialization and the transportation revolution changed the economics of the Northern United States and the Western United States. Heavy immigration from Western Europe shifted the center of population further to the North.\nIndustrialization went forward in the Northeast, from Pennsylvania to New England. A rail network and a telegraph network linked the nation economically, opening up new markets. Immigration brought millions of European workers and farmers to the Northern United States. In the Southern United States, planters shifted operations (and slaves) from the poor soils of the Southeastern United States to the rich cotton lands of the Southwestern United States.\nIssues of slavery in the new territories acquired in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) were temporarily resolved by the Compromise of 1850. One provision, the Fugitive Slave Law, sparked intense controversy, as revealed in the enormous interest in the plight of the escaped slave in Uncle Tom's Cabin, an 1852 anti-slavery novel and play.\nIn 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act reversed long-standing compromises by providing that each new state of the Union would decide its posture on slavery (popular sovereignty). The newly formed Republican Party stood against the expansion of slavery and won control of most Northern states (with enough electoral votes to win the presidency in 1860). The invasion of Kansas by sponsored pro- and anti-slavery factions intent on voting slavery up or down, with resulting bloodshed (Bleeding Kansas), angered both North and South. The Supreme Court tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue of slavery in the territories with a pro-slavery ruling, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, that angered the North.\nAfter the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, seven Southern states declared their secession from the United States between late 1860 and 1861, establishing a rebel government, the Confederate States of America on February 9, 1861. The Civil War began when Confederate General Pierre Beauregard opened fire upon Union troops at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Four more states seceded as Lincoln called for troops to fight an insurrection.\nThe next four years were the darkest in American history as the nation tore at itself using the latest military technology and highly motivated soldiers. The urban, industrialized Northern states (the Union) eventually defeated the mainly rural, agricultural Southern states (the Confederacy), but between 600,000 and 700,000 American soldiers (on both sides combined) were killed, and much of the infrastructure of the South was devastated. About 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. In the end, slavery was abolished, and the Union was restored, richer and more powerful than ever, while the South was embittered and impoverished.\n\n\nEconomic and cultural changes\n\n\nDeveloping a market economy\n\nBy the 1840s, the Industrial Revolution was transforming the Northeast, with a dense network of railroads, canals, textile mills, small industrial cities, and growing commercial centers, with hubs in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. Although manufacturing interests, especially in Pennsylvania, sought a high tariff, the actual tariff in effect was low, and was reduced several times, with the 1857 tariff the lowest in decades. The Midwest region, based on farming and increasingly on animal production, was growing rapidly, using the railroads and river systems to ship food to slave plantations in the south, industrial cities in the East, and industrial cities in Britain and Europe.\nIn the south, the cotton plantations were flourishing, thanks to the very high price of cotton on the world market. Cotton production wears out the land, and so the center of gravity was continually moving west. The annexation of Texas in 1845 opened up the last great cotton lands. Meanwhile, other commodities, such as tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina, were in the doldrums. Slavery was dying out in the upper South, and survived because of sales of slaves to the growing cotton plantations in the Southwest. While the Northeast was rapidly urbanizing, and urban centers such as Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Chicago were rapidly growing in the Midwest, the South remained overwhelmingly rural. The great wealth generated by slavery was used to buy new lands, and more slaves. At all times the great majority of Southern whites owned no slaves, and operated farms on a subsistence basis, serving small local markets.\nA transportation revolution was underway thanks to heavy infusions of capital from London, Paris, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Hundreds of local short haul lines were being consolidated to form a railroad system, that could handle long-distance shipment of farm and industrial products, as well as passengers. In the South, there were few systems, and most railroad lines were short haul project designed to move cotton to the nearest river or ocean port. Meanwhile, steamboats provided a good transportation system on the inland rivers.\nWith the use of interchangeable parts popularized by Eli Whitney, the factory system began in which workers assembled at one location to produce goods. The early textile factories such as the Lowell mills employed mainly women, but generally factories were a male domain.\nBy 1860, 16% of Americans lived in cities with 2500 or more people; a third of the nation's income came from manufacturing. Urbanized industry was limited primarily to the Northeast; cotton cloth production was the leading industry, with the manufacture of shoes, woolen clothing, and machinery also expanding. Energy was provided in most cases by water power from the rivers, but steam engines were being introduced to factories as well. By 1860, the railroads had made a transition from use of local wood supplies to coal for their locomotives. Pennsylvania became the center of the coal industry. Many, if not most, of the factory workers and miners were recent immigrants from Europe, or their children. Throughout the North, and in southern cities, entrepreneurs were setting up factories, mines, mills, banks, stores, and other business operations. In the great majority of cases, these were relatively small, locally owned, and locally operated enterprises.\n\n\nImmigration and labor\nTo fill the new factory jobs, immigrants poured into the United States in the first mass wave of immigration in the 1840s and 1850s. Known as the period of old immigration, this time saw 4.2 million immigrants come into the United States raising the overall population to over 20 million people. Historians often describe this as a time of \"push-pull\" immigration. People who were \"pushed\" to the United States immigrated because of poor conditions back home that made survival dubious while immigrants who were \"pulled\" came from stable environments to find greater economic success. One group who was \"pushed\" to the United States was the Irish, who were attempting to escape the Great Famine in their nation. Settling around the coastal cities of Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, the Irish were not initially welcomed because of their poverty and Roman Catholic beliefs. They lived in crowded, filthy neighborhoods and performed low-paying and physically demanding jobs. The Catholic Church was widely distrusted by many Americans as a symbol of European autocracy. German immigration, on the other hand, was \"pulled\" to America to avoid a looming financial disaster in their nation. Unlike the Irish, the German immigrants often sold their possessions and arrived in America with money in hand. German immigrants were both Protestant and Catholic, although the latter did not face the discrimination that the Irish did. Many Germans settled in communities in the Midwest rather than on the coast. Major cities such as Cincinnati, Ohio and St. Louis, Missouri developed large German populations. Unlike the Irish, most German immigrants were educated, middle-class people who mainly came to America for political rather than economic reasons. In the big cities such as New York, immigrants often lived in ethnic enclaves called \"ghettos\" that were often impoverished and crime-ridden. The most infamous of these immigrant neighborhoods was the Five Points in New York City. With increasing labor agitation for higher wages and better working conditions, such as by the Lowell mill girls in Massachusetts, many factory owners began to replace female workers with immigrants who would work cheaper and were less demanding about factory conditions.\n\n\nPolitical upheaval\n\n\nWilmot Proviso\n\nIn 1848 the acquisition of new territory from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo renewed the sectional debate over slavery. The question of whether the new territory would allow slavery was the main question, with Northern Congressmen hoping to limit slavery and Southern Congressmen hoping to expand the territory in which it was legal. Soon after the Mexican–American War began, Democratic Congressman David Wilmot proposed that territory won from Mexico should be free from the institution of slavery. Called the Wilmot Proviso, the measure failed to pass Congress and thus never became law. This served to unify the majority of Southerners, who saw the Proviso as an attack on their society and their constitutional rights.\n\n\nPopular sovereignty debate\nWith the failure of the Wilmot Proviso, Senator Lewis Cass introduced the idea of popular sovereignty in Congress. In an attempt to hold the Congress together as it continued to divide along sectional rather than party lines, Cass proposed that Congress did not have the power to determine whether territories could allow slavery, since this was not an enumerated power listed in the Constitution. Instead, Cass proposed that the people living in the territories themselves should decide the slavery issue. For the Democrats, the solution was not as clear as it appeared. Northern Democrats called for \"squatter sovereignty\", in which the people living in the territory could decide the issue when a territorial legislature was convened. Southern Democrats disputed this idea, arguing that the issue of slavery must be decided at the time of adoption of a state constitution, when the request was made to Congress for admission as a state. Cass and other Democratic leaders failed to clarify the issue so that neither section of the country felt slighted as the election approached. After Cass' defeat in 1848, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas assumed a leading role in the party and became closely associated with popular sovereignty with his proposal of the Kansas–Nebraska Act.\n\n\nCalifornia gold rush\n\nThe election of 1848 produced a new president from the Whig Party, Zachary Taylor. James K. Polk did not seek reelection because he achieved all his objectives in his first term and because his health was declining. From the election emerged the Free Soil Party, a group of anti-slavery Democrats who supported Wilmot's Proviso. The creation of the Free Soil Party foreshadowed the collapse of the Second Party System; the existing parties could not contain the debate over slavery for much longer.\nThe question of slavery became all the more urgent with the discovery of gold in California in 1848. The next year, there was a massive influx of prospectors and miners looking to strike it rich. Most migrants to California (so-called 'Forty-Niners') abandoned their jobs, homes, and families looking for gold. This huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast led to confrontations with Native populations, including the ethnic cleansing of thousands of Native inhabitants. Some historians (and a state governor) have referred to this period lasting into the early 1870s as the California genocide.\nIt also attracted some of the first Chinese Americans to the West Coast of the United States. Most Forty-Niners never found gold but instead settled in the urban center of San Francisco or in the new municipality of Sacramento.\n\n\nCompromise of 1850\n\nThe influx of population led to California's application for statehood in 1850. This created a renewal of sectional tension because California's admission into the Union threatened to upset the balance of power in Congress. The imminent admission of Oregon, New Mexico, and Utah also threatened to upset the balance. Many Southerners also realized that the climate of those territories did not lend themselves to the extension of slavery (it was not yet foreseen that the Central Valley in California would someday become a center of cotton farming). Debate raged in Congress until a resolution was found in 1850.\nPresident Taylor threatened to personally command an army against any Southern state that would secede from the Union, and he also threatened force against Texas, which laid claim to the eastern half of New Mexico. However, Taylor died of an intestinal ailment in July 1850, and his successor, Vice President Millard Fillmore, was a lawyer by training and far less war-like.\nThe Compromise of 1850 was proposed by \"The Great Compromiser\", Henry Clay and was passed by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Through the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, Texas was financially compensated for the loss of its Western territories, the slave trade (not slavery) was abolished in the District of Columbia, the Fugitive Slave Law was passed as a concession to the South, and, most importantly, the New Mexico Territory (including modern day Arizona and the Utah Territory) would determine its status (either free or slave) by popular vote. A group of Southern extremists, still not satisfied with the compromise, held two conventions in Nashville, Tennessee calling for secession, one during the summer of 1850 and the other late in the year, but by that point the Compromise had already passed through Congress and been accepted by the Southern states.\nThe Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the divisive issue, but the peace was not to last long.\n\n\nPresidential election of 1852\n\nHaving lost two presidential elections to Whig war heroes, the Democratic Party tried their own by nominating Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, who had served without great distinction in the Mexican War. Endorsed by Southern Democrats, Pierce openly supported the Compromise and the Fugitive Slave Act. The Whigs rejected the idea of running incumbent President Fillmore, and so instead turned to another war hero in General Winfield Scott. Although a capable man, Scott's haughty personality alienated many voters and Pierce won an easy victory at the ballot box.\n\n\nForeign affairs\nThe acquisition of the Southwest had made the United States a Pacific power. Diplomatic and commercial ties with China had been first established in 1844, and American merchants and shippers began urging an opening of ties with Japan, a country that had virtually isolated itself from the outside world for the past 300 years. In 1853, a fleet commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry arrived in Japan and forced the shogunate to sign a treaty with US, although Japanese fears of Russian encroachment also moved matters along.\nCloser to home, Cuba was long coveted by Southerners as the choicest slave territory available. If annexed by the US and split into 3–4 states, it would restore the slave versus free state balance in Congress. President Polk had in 1845 offered the island's owner, Spain, $100 million for the island, but it was refused and Madrid made it clear that they would not part with the island under any circumstance. Southerners were not about to give up their designs on Cuba, and several filibustering expeditions were mounted. They were easily repulsed by the Spanish authorities, and the last attempt ended in fifty Americans being captured and executed for piracy, including many men from the leading families of the South. A group of enraged Southerners responded by ransacking the Spanish consulate in New Orleans.\nIn 1854, the Spanish authorities captured the steamer Black Warrior on a technicality. War appeared to threaten, and Southerners in Congress were aggressively pushing President Pierce for it. Since the European powers were distracted with the Crimean War, there was also nobody that could come to Madrid's assistance. Meanwhile, the US ambassadors to Spain, Britain, and France met in secret in Ostend, Belgium where they proposed a \"battle plan\" that involved offering Spain up to $120 million for Cuba. If Madrid still refused, then US was justified in taking the island by force. However, the Ostend Manifesto soon leaked out, and an outcry from free soil Northerners forced the Pierce Administration to give up its ambitions on Cuba. Coincidentally, just as Southerners had their eye on territories in the Caribbean, Northerners in the 1850s also developed renewed designs on Canada. In the end, both sides stalemated each other and got nothing as a result.\n\n\nAntislavery and abolitionism\n\nThe debate over slavery in the pre-Civil War United States has several sides. Abolitionists grew directly out of the Second Great Awakening and the European Enlightenment and saw slavery as an affront to God and/or reason. Abolitionism had roots similar to the temperance movement. The publishing of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, in 1852, galvanized the abolitionist movement.\nMost debates over slavery, however, had to do with the constitutionality of the extension of slavery rather than its morality. The debates took the form of arguments over the powers of Congress rather than the merits of slavery. The result was the so-called \"Free Soil Movement\". Free-soilers believed that slavery was dangerous because of what it did to whites. The \"peculiar institution\" ensured that elites controlled most of the land, property, and capital in the South. The Southern United States was, by this definition, undemocratic. To fight the \"slave power conspiracy\", the nation's democratic ideals had to be spread to the new territories and the South.\nIn the South, however, slavery was justified in many ways. The Nat Turner Uprising of 1831 had terrified Southern whites. Moreover, the expansion of \"King Cotton\" into the Deep South further entrenched the institution into Southern society. John Calhoun's treatise, The Pro-Slavery Argument, stated that slavery was not simply a necessary evil but a positive good. Slavery was a blessing to so-called African savages. It civilized them and provided them with the lifelong security that they needed. Under this argument, the pro-slavery proponents believed that the African Americans were unable to take care of themselves because they were biologically inferior. Furthermore, white Southerners looked upon the North and Britain as soulless industrial societies with little culture. Whereas the North was dirty, dangerous, industrial, fast-paced, and greedy, pro-slavery proponents believed that the South was civilized, stable, orderly, and moved at a 'human pace.'\nAccording to the 1860 U.S. census, fewer than 385,000 individuals (i.e. 1.4% of whites in the country, or 4.8% of southern whites) owned one or more slaves. 95% of blacks lived in the South, comprising one-third of the population there as opposed to 1% of the population of the North.\n\n\nKansas–Nebraska Act\n\nWith the admission of California as a state in 1850, the Pacific Coast had finally been reached. Manifest Destiny had brought Americans to the end of the continent. President Millard Fillmore hoped to continue Manifest Destiny, and with this aim he sent Commodore Matthew Perry to Japan in the hopes of arranging trade agreements in 1853.\nA railroad to the Pacific was planned, and Senator Stephen A. Douglas wanted the transcontinental railway to pass through Chicago. Southerners protested, insisting that it run through Texas, Southern California and end in New Orleans. Douglas decided to compromise and introduced the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. In exchange for having the railway run through Chicago, he proposed 'organizing' (open for white settlement) the territories of Kansas and Nebraska.\nDouglas anticipated Southern opposition to the act and added in a provision that stated that the status of the new territories would be subject to popular sovereignty. In theory, the new states could become slave states under this condition. Under Southern pressure, Douglas added a clause which explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise. President Franklin Pierce supported the bill as did the South and a fraction of northern Democrats.\nThe act split the Whigs. Northern Whigs generally opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act while Southern Whigs supported it. Most Northern Whigs joined the new Republican Party. Some joined the Know-Nothing Party which refused to take a stance on slavery. The southern Whigs tried different political moves, but could not reverse the regional dominance of the Democratic Party.\n\n\nBleeding Kansas\n\nWith the opening of Kansas, both pro- and anti-slavery supporters rushed to settle in the new territory. Violent clashes soon erupted between them. Abolitionists from New England settled in Topeka, Lawrence, and Manhattan. Pro-slavery advocates, mainly from Missouri, settled in Leavenworth and Lecompton.\nIn 1855, elections were held for the territorial legislature. While there were only 1,500 legal voters, migrants from Missouri swelled the population to over 6,000. The result was that a pro-slavery majority was elected to the legislature. Free-soilers were so outraged that they set up their own delegates in Topeka. A group of pro-slavery Missourians sacked Lawrence on May 21, 1856. Violence continued for two more years until the promulgation of the Lecompton Constitution.\nThe violence, known as \"Bleeding Kansas\", scandalized the Democratic administration and began a more heated sectional conflict. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts gave a speech in the Senate entitled \"The Crime Against Kansas\". The speech was a scathing criticism of the South and the \"peculiar institution\". As an example of rising sectional tensions, days after delivering the speech, South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks approached Sumner during a recess of the Senate and caned him.\n\n\nThe new Republican Party\nThe new Republican party emerged in 1854–1856 in the North; it had minimal support in the South. Most members were former Whigs or Free Soil Democrats. The Party was ideological, with a focus on stopping the spread of slavery, and modernizing the economy through tariffs, banks, railroads and free homestead land for farmers.\nWithout using the term \"containment\", the new Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery, once it gained control of the national government. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy:\n\nThe federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.\n\n\nPresidential election of 1856\n\nPresident Pierce was too closely associated with the horrors of \"Bleeding Kansas\" and was not renominated. Instead, the Democrats nominated former Secretary of State and current ambassador to Great Britain James Buchanan, The Know Nothing Party nominated former President Millard Fillmore, who campaigned on a platform that mainly opposed immigration and urban corruption of the sort associated with Irish Catholics. The Republicans nominated famed soldier-explorer John Frémont under the slogan of \"Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Frémont and victory!\" Frémont won most of the North and nearly won the election. A slight shift of votes in Pennsylvania and Illinois would have resulted in a Republican victory. It had a strong base with majority support in most Northern states. It dominated in New England, New York and the northern Midwest, and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–60 as a divisive force that threatened civil war.\nThe election campaign was a bitter one with a high degree of personal attacks levied at all three candidates—Buchanan, aged 65, was mocked as being too old to be president and for not being married. Fremont was ridiculed for being born out of wedlock to a teenage mother. More damaging to the latter was the accusation by Know-Nothings that he was a secret Roman Catholic.  Some Southern leaders threatened secession if a \"free soiler\" Northern candidate were elected. The two-year-old Republican Party nonetheless had a strong showing in its first presidential contest, and might have won except for Fillmore.\nAn uninspiring figure, Buchanan won the election with 174 electoral votes to Fremont's 114.  Immediately following Buchanan's inauguration in March 1857, there was a sudden depression, known as the Panic of 1857, which weakened the credibility of the Democratic Party further. He feuded incessantly with Stephen Douglas for control of the Democratic Party, while the Republicans remained united and the Fillmore's third party collapsed.\n\n\nDred Scott decision\n\nOn March 6, 1857, a mere two days after Buchanan's inauguration, the Supreme Court handed down the infamous Dred Scott v. Sandford decision. Dred Scott, a slave, had lived with his master for a few years in Illinois and Wisconsin, and with the support of abolitionist groups, was now suing for his freedom on the grounds that he resided in a free state. The Supreme Court quickly ruled on the very obvious—that slaves were not US citizens and thus had no right to sue in a Federal court. It also ruled that since slaves were private property, their master was fully within his rights to reclaim runaways, even if they were in a state where slavery did not exist, on the grounds that the Fifth Amendment forbade Congress to deprive a citizen of his property without due process of law. Furthermore, the Supreme Court decided that the Missouri Compromise, which had been replaced a few years earlier by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, had always been unconstitutional and Congress had no authority to restrict slavery within a territory, regardless of its citizens' wishes.\nThe decision outraged Northern opponents of slavery such as Abraham Lincoln and lent substance to the Republican charge that a Slave Power controlled the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court had sanctioned the hardline Southern view. This emboldened Southerners to demand even more rights for slavery, just as Northern opposition hardened. Anti-slavery speakers protested that the Supreme Court could merely interpret law, not make it, and thus the Dred Scott Decision could not legally open a territory to slavery.\n\n\nLincoln-Douglas debates\n\nThe seven famous Lincoln-Douglas debates were held for the Senatorial election in Illinois between incumbent Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, whose political experience was limited to a single term in Congress that had been mainly notable for his opposition to the Mexican War. The debates are remembered for their relevance and eloquence.\nLincoln was opposed to the extension of slavery into any new territories. Douglas, however, believed that the people should decide the future of slavery in their own territories. This was known as popular sovereignty. Lincoln, however, argued that popular sovereignty was pro-slavery since it was inconsistent with the Dred Scott Decision. Lincoln said that Chief Justice Roger Taney was the first person who said that the Declaration of Independence did not apply to blacks and that Douglas was the second. In response, Douglas came up with what is known as the Freeport Doctrine. Douglas stated that while slavery may have been legally possible, the people of the state could refuse to pass laws favourable to slavery.\nIn his famous \"House Divided Speech\" in Springfield, Illinois, Lincoln stated:\n\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect that it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest further the spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states, old as well as new, North as well as South.\nDuring the debates, Lincoln argued that his speech was not abolitionist, writing at the Charleston debate that:\n\nI am not in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office.\nThe debates attracted thousands of spectators and featured parades and demonstrations. Lincoln ultimately lost the election but vowed:\n\nThe fight must go on. The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one or even 100 defeats.\n\n\nJohn Brown's raid\nThe debate took a new, violent turn with the actions of an abolitionist from Connecticut. John Brown was a militant abolitionist who advocated guerrilla warfare to combat pro-slavery advocates. Receiving arms and financial aid from a group of prominent Massachusetts business and social leaders known collectively as the Secret Six, Brown participated in the violence of Bleeding Kansas and directed the Pottawatomie massacre on May 24, 1856, in response to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas. In 1859, Brown went to Virginia to liberate slaves. On October 17, Brown seized the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. His plan was to arm slaves in the surrounding area, creating a slave army to sweep through the South, attacking slaveowners and liberating slaves. Local slaves did not rise up to support Brown. He killed five civilians and took hostages. He also stole a sword that Frederick the Great had given George Washington. He was captured by an armed military force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee. He was tried for treason to the Commonwealth of Virginia and hanged on December 2, 1859. On his way to the gallows, Brown handed a jailkeeper a note, chilling in its prophecy, predicting that the \"sin\" of slavery would never be cleansed from the United States without bloodshed.\nThe raid on Harper's Ferry horrified Southerners who saw Brown as a criminal, and they became increasingly distrustful of Northern abolitionists who celebrated Brown as a hero and a martyr.\n\n\nPresidential election of 1860\n\nThe Democratic National Convention for the Election of 1860 was held in Charleston, South Carolina, despite it usually being held in the North. When the convention endorsed the doctrine of popular sovereignty, 50 Southern delegates walked out. The inability to come to a decision on who should be nominated led to a second meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. At Baltimore, 110 Southern delegates, led by the so-called \"fire eaters\", walked out of the convention when it would not adopt a platform that endorsed the extension of slavery into the new territories. The remaining Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas for the presidency. The Southern Democrats held a convention in Richmond, Virginia, and nominated John Breckinridge. Both claimed to be the true voice of the Democratic Party.\nFormer Know Nothings and some Whigs formed the Constitutional Union Party which ran on a platform based around supporting only the Constitution and the laws of the land.\nAbraham Lincoln won the support of the Republican National Convention after it became apparent that William Seward had alienated certain branches of the Republican Party. Moreover, Lincoln had been made famous in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates and was well known for his eloquence and his moderate position on slavery.\nLincoln won a majority of votes in the electoral college, but only won two-fifths of the popular vote. The Democratic vote was split three ways and Lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the United States.\n\n\nSecession\nLincoln's election in November led to a declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, six other states had declared their secession from the Union: Mississippi (January 9, 1861), Florida (January 10), Alabama (January 11), Georgia (January 19), Louisiana (January 26), and Texas (February 1).\nMen from both North and South met in Virginia to try to hold together the Union, but the proposals for amending the Constitution were unsuccessful. In February 1861, the seven states met in Montgomery, Alabama, and formed a new government: the Confederate States of America. The first Confederate Congress was held on February 4, 1861, and adopted a provisional constitution. On February 8, 1861, Jefferson Davis was nominated President of the Confederate States.\n\n\nCivil War\n\nOn April 12, 1861, after President Lincoln refused to give up Fort Sumter, the federal base in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, the new Confederate government under President Jefferson Davis ordered General P.G.T. Beauregard to open fire on the fort. It fell two days later, without casualty, spreading the flames of war across America. Immediately, rallies were held in every town and city, north and south, demanding war. Lincoln called for troops to retake lost federal property, which meant an invasion of the South. In response, four more states seceded: Virginia (April 17, 1861), Arkansas (May 6, 1861), Tennessee (May 7, 1861), and North Carolina (May 20, 1861). The four remaining slave states, Maryland, Delaware, Missouri, and Kentucky, under heavy pressure from the Federal government did not secede; Kentucky tried, and failed, to remain neutral.\nEach side had its relative strengths and weaknesses. The North had a larger population and a far larger industrial base and transportation system. It would be a defensive war for the South and an offensive one for the North, and the South could count on its huge geography, and an unhealthy climate, to prevent an invasion. In order for the North to emerge victorious, it would have to conquer and occupy the Confederate States of America. The South, on the other hand, only had to keep the North at bay until the Northern public lost the will to fight. The Confederacy adopted a military strategy designed to hold their territory together, gain worldwide recognition, and inflict so much punishment on invaders that the North would grow weary of the war and negotiate a peace treaty that would recognize the independence of the CSA. The only point of seizing Washington, or invading the North (besides plunder) was to shock Yankees into realizing they could not win. The Confederacy moved its capital from a safe location in Montgomery, Alabama, to the more cosmopolitan city of Richmond, Virginia, only 100 miles from the enemy capital in Washington. Richmond was heavily exposed, and at the end of a long supply line; much of the Confederacy's manpower was dedicated to its defense. The North had far greater potential advantages, but it would take a year or two to mobilize them for warfare. Meanwhile, everyone expected a short war.\n\n\nWar in the East\n\nThe Union assembled an army of 35,000 men (the largest ever seen in North America up to that point) under the command of General Irvin McDowell. With great fanfare, these untrained soldiers set out from Washington DC with the idea that they would capture Richmond in six weeks and put a quick end to the conflict. At the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, however, disaster ensued as McDowell's army was completely routed and fled back to the nation's capitol. Major General George McClellan of the Union was put in command of the Army of the Potomac following the battle on July 26, 1861. He began to reconstruct the shattered army and turn it into a real fighting force, as it became clear that there would be no quick, six-week resolution of the conflict. Despite pressure from the White House, McClellan did not move until March 1862, when the Peninsular Campaign began with the purpose of capturing the capitol of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia. It was initially successful, but in the final days of the campaign, McClellan faced strong opposition from Robert E. Lee, the new commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. From June 25 to July 1, in a series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles, Lee forced the Army of the Potomac to retreat. McClellan was recalled to Washington and a new army assembled under the command of John Pope.\nIn August, Lee fought the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas) and defeated John Pope's Army of Virginia. Pope was dismissed from command and his army merged with McClellan's. The Confederates then invaded Maryland, hoping to obtain European recognition and an end to the war. The two armies met at Antietam on September 17. This was the single bloodiest day in American history. The Union victory allowed Abraham Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in states still in rebellion as of January 1, 1863 were freed. This did not actually end slavery, but it served to give a meaningful cause to the war and prevented any possibility of European intervention.\nMilitarily, the Union could not follow up its victory at Antietam. McClellan failed to pursue the Confederate army, and President Lincoln finally became tired of his excuses and unwillingness to fight. He was dismissed from command in October and replaced by Ambrose Burnside, despite his pleas that he was not ready for the job. He attempted to invade Richmond from the north (McClellan had tried from the east), but the campaign ended in disaster at Fredericksburg when Burnside ordered waves of futile attacks against an entrenched Confederate position. The next year also proved difficult for the Union initially. Burnside was replaced by General Joseph \"Fighting Joe\" Hooker in January 1863, but he proved unable to stop Lee and \"Stonewall\" Jackson at Chancellorsville in May. Lee's second invasion of the North, however, proved disastrous. Hooker was replaced by George Meade, and four days later the Battle of Gettysburg took place. Lee's army lost scores of irreplaceable men and would never be the same again. Abraham Lincoln was angered by George Meade's failure to pursue Lee after Gettysburg, but decided to let him stay in command, a decision endorsed by Ulysses S. Grant who was appointed General-in-Chief of all the Union armies early in 1864.\n\n\nWar in the West\n\nWhile the Confederacy fought the Union to a bloody stalemate in the East, the Union army was much more successful in the West. Confederate insurrections in Missouri were put down by the federal government by 1863, despite the initial Confederate victory at Wilson's Creek near Springfield, Missouri. After the Battle of Perryville, the Confederates were also driven from Kentucky, resulting in a major Union victory. Lincoln once wrote of Kentucky, \"I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.\" The fall of Vicksburg gave the Union control of the Mississippi River and cut the Confederacy in two. Sherman's successes in Chattanooga and then Atlanta left few Confederate forces to resist his destruction of Georgia and the Carolinas. The Dakota War broke out in Minnesota in 1862.\n\n\nEnd of the Confederacy\nIn 1864, General Grant assigned himself as direct commander of Meade and the Army of the Potomac, and placed General William Sherman in command of the Western Theatre. Grant began to wage a total war against the Confederacy. He knew that the Union's strength lay in its resources and manpower and thus began to wage a war of attrition against Lee while Sherman devastated the West. Grant's Wilderness Campaign forced Lee into Petersburg, Virginia. There he waged—and with Lee, pioneered—trench warfare at the Siege of Petersburg. In the meantime, General Sherman seized Atlanta, securing President Lincoln's reelection. He then began his famous March to the Sea which devastated Georgia and South Carolina. Lee attempted to escape from Petersburg in March–April 1865, but was trapped by Grant's superior number of forces. Lee surrendered at the Appomattox Court House. Four years of bloody warfare had come to a conclusion.\n\n\nHome fronts\n\n\nUnited States\n\nThe Union began the war with overwhelming long-term advantages in manpower, industry, and financing. It took a couple years for the potential to be realized, but with the victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, the Confederacy was doomed.\nLincoln, an ungainly giant, did not look the part of a president, but historians have overwhelmingly praised the \"political genius\" of his performance in the role. His first priority was military victory, and that required that he master entirely new skills as a master strategist and diplomat. He supervised not only the supplies and finances, but as well the manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians he rallied public opinion and (at Gettysburg) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than Richmond. His wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With William Seward at State, Salmon P. Chase at the Treasury, and (from 1862) Edwin Stanton at the War Department, Lincoln had a powerful cabinet of determined men; except for monitoring major appointments, Lincoln gave them full rein to destroy the Confederacy. Malaise led to sharp Democratic gains in the 1862 off-year elections, but the Republicans kept control of Congress and the key states. Despite grumbling by Radical Republicans, who disliked Lincoln's leniency toward the South, Lincoln kept control of politics. The Republicans expanded with the addition of War Democrats and ran as the Union Party in 1864, blasting the Democrats as Copperheads and sympathizers with disunion. With the Democrats in disarray, Lincoln's ticket won in a landslide.\nDuring the Civil War the key policy-maker in Congress was Thaddeus Stevens, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Republican floor leader, and spokesman for the Radical Republicans. Although he thought Lincoln was too moderate regarding slavery, he worked well with the president and Treasury Secretary in handling major legislation that funded the war effort and permanently transformed the nation's economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.\n\n\nConfederate States\n\nThe Confederacy was beset by growing problems as its territory steadily shrank, its people grew impoverished, and hopes of victory changed from reliance on Confederate military prowess to dreams of foreign intervention, to finally a desperate hope that the Yankees would grow so weary of war they would sue for peace. The South lost its lucrative export market as the Union blockade shut down all commercial traffic, with only very expensive blockade runners getting in and out. In 1861 the South lost most of its border regions, with Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri gained for the enemy, and western Virginia broken off. The Southern transportation system depended on a river system that the Union gunboats soon dominated, as control of the Mississippi, Missouri, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers fell to the Union in 1862–63. That meant all the river towns fell to the Union as well, and so did New Orleans in 1862. The rickety railroad system was not designed for long-distance traffic (it was meant to haul cotton to the nearest port), and it steadily deteriorated until by the end practically no trains were running. Civilian morale and recruiting held up reasonably well, as did the morale of the army, until the last year or so. The Confederacy had democratic elections (for all white men), but no political parties. One result was that governors became centers of opposition to Jefferson Davis and his increasingly unpopular central administration in Richmond. Financially the South was in bad shape as it lost its export market, and internal markets failed one after the other. By 1864 women in the national capital were rioting because of soaring food prices they could not afford. With so few imports available, it was necessary to make do, use ersatz (such as local beans for coffee), use up, and do without. The large slave population never rose up in armed revolt, but black men typically took the first opportunity to escape to Union lines, where over 150,000 enrolled in the Union army. When the end came the South had a shattered economy, 300,000 dead, hundreds of thousands wounded, and millions impoverished, but three million former slaves were now free.\n\n\nAssassination of Abraham Lincoln\n\nOn April 14, 1865, four days after the news of Lee's surrender reached Washington, an air of celebration pervaded the capital. That evening, President Lincoln attended a performance of Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre. During the third act, a Confederate sympathizer named John Wilkes Booth shot and killed Abraham Lincoln. As he fled the scene, he yelled \"Sic semper tyrannis\", the Virginia state motto. John Wilkes Booth was tracked, twelve days later, to a farm near Bowling Green, Virginia, on April 26. He was shot and killed by Union Army Sergeant Boston Corbett. His co-conspirators were tried before a military commission and were hanged on July 7.\n\n\nSee also\nTimeline of the history of the United States (1820–1859)\nTimeline of the history of the United States (1860–1899)\nAmerican Civil War\nConfederate States of America\nOrigins of the American Civil War\nTimeline of events leading to the American Civil War\nTimeline of the American Old West\nUnion (American Civil War)\nPresidency of Zachary Taylor\nPresidency of James Buchanan\nPresidency of Abraham Lincoln\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\nBeringer, Richard E.; Jones, Archer; Still, William N.; Hattaway, Herman (1988).

    "summary": "The history of the United States from 1849 to 1865 was dominated by the tensions that led to the American Civil War between North and South, and the bloody fighting in 1861–1865 that produced Northern victory in the war and ended slavery. At the same time industrialization and the transportation revolution changed the economics of the Northern United States and the Western United States. Heavy immigration from Western Europe shifted the center of population further to the North.\nIndustrialization went forward in the Northeast, from Pennsylvania to New England. A rail network and a telegraph network linked the nation economically, opening up new markets. Immigration brought millions of European workers and farmers to the Northern United States. In the Southern United States, planters shifted operations (and slaves) from the poor soils of the Southeastern United States to the rich cotton lands of the Southwestern United States.\nIssues of slavery in the new territories acquired in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) were temporarily resolved by the Compromise of 1850. One provision, the Fugitive Slave Law, sparked intense controversy, as revealed in the enormous interest in the plight of the escaped slave in Uncle Tom's Cabin, an 1852 anti-slavery novel and play.\nIn 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act reversed long-standing compromises by providing that each new state of the Union would decide its posture on slavery (popular sovereignty). The newly formed Republican Party stood against the expansion of slavery and won control of most Northern states (with enough electoral votes to win the presidency in 1860). The invasion of Kansas by sponsored pro- and anti-slavery factions intent on voting slavery up or down, with resulting bloodshed (Bleeding Kansas), angered both North and South. The Supreme Court tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue of slavery in the territories with a pro-slavery ruling, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, that angered the North.\nAfter the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, seven Southern states declared their secession from the United States between late 1860 and 1861, establishing a rebel government, the Confederate States of America on February 9, 1861. The Civil War began when Confederate General Pierre Beauregard opened fire upon Union troops at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Four more states seceded as Lincoln called for troops to fight an insurrection.\nThe next four years were the darkest in American history as the nation tore at itself using the latest military technology and highly motivated soldiers. The urban, industrialized Northern states (the Union) eventually defeated the mainly rural, agricultural Southern states (the Confederacy), but between 600,000 and 700,000 American soldiers (on both sides combined) were killed, and much of the infrastructure of the South was devastated. About 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. In the end, slavery was abolished, and the Union was restored, richer and more powerful than ever, while the South was embittered and impoverished.",

It was also a stopover for other major acts like Iggy Pop, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Pogues, The Psychedelic Furs, the Ramones and Psychic TV and has hosted reunion shows for bands including Lestat, among others.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Phantasy Entertainment Complex, consisting of the Phantasy Nite Club, The Chamber, Symposium, and Phantasy Theater, first opened in 1918 when it was known as the Homestead Theater. The theater played movies until 1979 and at one point was referred to as the Detroit Theater. Between the years 1976-1977 it was called The Last Picture Show. In the eighties, the theater was renamed the Phantasy, with a focus on alternative, goth and industrial rock groups.\nJohn De Frasia purchased the complex in 1965 when he opened a restaurant inside called Piccadilly Square. After seeing the 1962 film Mutiny on the Bounty, De Frasia built a pirate ship inside the restaurant, which was converted to a music club in 1973. One side of the ship is used as a DJ booth, while the second half is a sound stage. The walls of the complex contains early new wave posters and stickers from most bands that have appeared at the complex since its opening.\nMichael J. Fox and Joan Jett performed at the Phantasy Theater in 1987 a day before their film premiere of Light of Day.\nWithin the same complex The Chamber dance club began in 1996 under the joint management of DJ Cable and Michele De Frasia and had since been the local haven for Alternative, Goth and Industrial subcultures. Notable artists that frequented The Chamber and are from the area included Andy Kubiszewski, Marilyn Manson, Kevin McMahon, Lorin Morgan-Richards, Larry Szyms and Textbeak.\nIn 2009, the complex was investigated by paranormal researchers who claimed to have captured audio of spirits.\nIn 2010, a fire swept through the complex.\nIn 2015, the De Frasia family announced that the Phantasy Nite Club complex was for sale. A deal to sell the venue fell through at the last minute in 2018. As of June 2020, plans for the Phantasy to become an LGBTQ community hub and entertainment complex were nearing completion.

    "text": "The Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, widely known as the Cannonball Baker or Cannonball Run, was an unofficial, unsanctioned automobile race run five times in the 1970s from New York City and Darien, Connecticut, on the East Coast of the United States to the Portofino Inn in the Los Angeles suburb of Redondo Beach, California. The Cannonball Run races have additionally inspired numerous contemporary efforts by independent teams to set the record time for the route, known as the Cannonball Run Challenge. The races were named after Erwin Baker.\nConceived by car magazine writer and auto racer Brock Yates and fellow Car and Driver editor Steve Smith, the first run was not a competitive race as only one team was running. The run was intended both as a celebration of the United States Interstate Highway System and as a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. Another motivation was the fun involved, which showed in the tongue-in-cheek reports in Car and Driver and other auto publications worldwide. The initial cross-country run was made by Yates; his son, Brock Yates Jr.; Steve Smith; and friend Jim Williams beginning on May 3, 1971, in a 1971 Dodge Custom Sportsman van called the \"Moon Trash II\".\nThe race was run four more times: November 15, 1971; November 13, 1972; April 23, 1975; and April 1, 1979.\nCar and Driver magazine detailed the November 1971 running in its March 1972 issue. That article was reprinted to represent the 1970s on the magazine's 50th anniversary in 2005. A remarkable effort was made by American racing legend Dan Gurney, winner of the 1967 24 hours of Le Mans. He won the second Cannonball in a Sunoco blue Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. Gurney said, \"At no time did we exceed 175 mph [280 km/h].\" He and Brock Yates as co-driver took 35 hours 54 minutes to travel 2,863 miles (4,608 km) at an average of approximately 80 mph (130 km/h) while collecting one fine. Snow in the Rocky Mountains slowed them down considerably.\nIn 1972 the team of Steve \"Yogi\" Behr, Bill Canfield, and Fred Olds won in a Cadillac Coupe de Ville, the first American car to win a Cannonball.\nOn April 23–25, 1975, Jack May and Rick Cline drove a Dino 246 GTS from the Red Ball Garage in New York City\nin a record time of 35 hours 53 minutes, averaging 83 mph (134 km/h).\nThe record for official Cannonballs is 32 hours 51 minutes (about 87 mph or 140 km/h), set in the final run from Darien, Connecticut, to Los Angeles by Dave Heinz and Dave Yarborough in a Jaguar XJ-S in April 1979.\nAfter the original Cannonball races, Car and Driver sponsored legitimate closed-course tours, the One Lap of America. Outlaw successors in the United States, Europe, and Australia continue to use the Cannonball name without Yates' approval.\n\n\nThe race\nThe object of the Cannonball was to leave the Red Ball Garage on East 31st Street in Manhattan, New York City (1979: Darien, Connecticut, at the now-defunct Lock, Stock, and Barrel restaurant, Goodwives Shopping Center), typically after midnight, and drive to the Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach, California, in the shortest time possible. Those were the only rules.\nNothing was specified as to the route, type of vehicle, number of drivers or crew, or maximum speed permitted. There was a gentlemen's agreement that the vehicle entered would be driven the entire distance (not transported on another vehicle, not abandoned for an identical second vehicle hidden near the finish, etc.) Speeding citations received along the way were the driver's responsibility and did not disqualify the vehicle, although stopping to receive a ticket increased the vehicle's overall time.\nThe Cannonball Run was technically a race in that the team with the fastest time was declared the \"winner\" and the results were announced in order of time. However, times were not taken very seriously, and sheer speed did not guarantee a first-place finish.\n\n\nInspiration\nThe Cannonball Run gained notoriety after the 1972 run, but the Time story on the 1975 Jack May-Rick Cline race solidified its place in the public consciousness. To the surprise of many, the hilarious reports in Car and Driver were warmly received by press and public alike rather than condemned for the race's recklessness.\nIn his Cannonball! memoir, Yates reports that in 1972 an all-female team of Peggy Niemcek, Judy Stropus, and SCCA racer Donna Mae Mims (\"The Pink Lady\") suffered a crash near El Paso, Texas, resulting in a DNF (did not finish). Mims explains that their Cadillac stretch limousine veered off the road and rolled over after the driver fell asleep at the wheel. Although the car was destroyed and she suffered a broken arm, no other vehicles were involved in the crash. This was the only serious accident in the official Cannonball races.\nYates began working on a screenplay to be entitled Coast to Coast but was scooped by two \"unofficial\" films in 1976, Cannonball and The Gumball Rally. Eventually, an \"official\" Cannonball Run film was made, The Cannonball Run starring Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore and Dom DeLuise with Yates in a cameo appearance. Two sequels, Cannonball Run II and Speed Zone, also known as Cannonball Fever, followed. A later USA Network television program, Cannonball Run 2001, was given official approval to use the name.\n\n\nU.S. Express\n\nAfter the last Cannonball, Rick Doherty, a veteran of the 1975 and 1979 races, organized a successor, the U.S. Express (1980–1983). The 1980 U.S. Express ran from Brooklyn, New York, to the beach in Santa Monica. Doherty won the first U.S. Express with co-driver and famous game designer Will Wright at the wheel of a Mazda RX-7. Their time was 33 hours 9 minutes.\nIn 1981 the U.S. Express ran from Long Island, New York, to Emeryville, California, which borders Oakland at the east end of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge). Interstate 80 was largely the route of choice. The winning team in 1981 was the first-time Express team of David Morse and Steve Clausman driving Morse's gray Porsche 928. One unique road hazard in the 1981 run was an early snowfall that closed the Donner Pass for several hours to vehicles without chains just as the U.S. Express cars approached. The Porsche 928, which carried special plastic chains, was able to proceed.  Others had to wait for the pass to open. The Morse-Clausman team competed again the next two years. In 1982 (also to Emeryville), they endured several memorable police stops. In the final U.S. Express in 1983 to Newport Beach, California, they placed second.\nAlthough longer than the Cannonball, the fastest time recorded for the U.S. Express was 32 hours 7 minutes in the 1983 race, 44 minutes faster than the fastest Cannonball, and the \"official\" cross-country record until it was broken in 2006 by Alex Roy and David Maher in 31 hours 4 minutes.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nDecades after the last official Cannonball in 1979, issues raised and revival possibilities interested some motorists. Yates recalled declining offers to revive the concept because it was unworkable. His reasons included: increased police activity, increased legal liabilities for any organizer, increased year-round traffic, and expanding urban areas. He also warned of the obvious dangers of a race on public roads.\nThe Gumball 3000 gained publicity in the early 2000s as a similar event, sometimes held on coast-to-coast U.S. routes, but paced over a route several times as long and with no time-based winner.\nThe unofficial transcontinental record, known as the Cannonball Run Challenge, has been broken numerous times since the last official Cannonball Trophy Dash.\n\n\nPost–US-Express Events\n\n\nC2C Express Event\nThe C2C Express was an organized event that was created by Ben Wilson of New Zealand and Eric Propst of Michigan. The event was intended to be limited to pre 1980 automobiles that cost under $3000. This was intended to keep the cost affordable and In the spirit of the original runs of the 1970s. The event spanned from 2015 to 2019. The run Ran from the traditional Cannonball Route of Redball Garage in Manhattan to The Portofino Inn at Redondo beach California. The original event only had 3 competitors in which Wilson won in his Cadillac with a time of just under 40 hours. Over the next 3 years the event grew to the point that the final coast to coast run planned ballooned to over 40 entrants. The size of the event gave Wilson and Propst the idea to run their final coast to coast event from Darien, Connecticut to Portofino Inn located in Los Angeles. Darien to Portofino was the same route run as the 1979 Cannonball and became a 40-year anniversary tribute to the event. Over 40 teams registered for the event, 33 competed and 24 finished. Amongst the final event was a team of police officers in a 49 Pontiac, an ambulance driven by John Ficarra, a Lexus driven by record holder Ed Bolian, a vintage Monte Carlo piloted by current record holders Doug Tabbut & Arne Toman. Wilson and Propst both competed as well, Wilson drove a Ford Van and Propst a Crown Victoria. The winning time was 31:47.\nOn September 15, 2019, the Cannonball route event record of 32:05 set by Ed Bolian in 2015, was broken during the 2019 running of the C2C Express. Fred Ashmore Jr of Hancock, Maine, and Travis Hilton of College Station, Texas with Arthur Ashmore of Lamoine, Maine, set a new Cannonball Route event record of 31:47. Using the longer 1979 Cannonball Route, (from Darien to the Portofino Marina) the team was able to cover the 2872 miles in their period-accurate, minimally equipped 1979 Mustang. This made them the second team to ever eclipse the 32:07 benchmark on the Cannonball route in an event over 36 years.\n\n\nMichael A. Preston Memorial Four Ball Rally 1982–1984\nThe Four Ball Rally was an outlaw street race from Boston to San Diego. It was run from 1982 to 1984, and stands as the last of the true competitive cross-continent road races held in the twentieth century. The rally's official name was the Michael A. Preston Memorial Four Ball Rally (FBR) in commemoration of its founder, who died prior to the first event. The FBR was conceived to be the longest practical distance race between two major cities in the continental United States.  The rally had multiple route options determined by the driving teams and generally exceed 3,100 miles. On average the race was 250 to 300 miles longer than the Original Sea to Shining sea rallies of the 1970s. Up to 50 entries, including international teams, were selected to participate. The event was \"invitation only\", and generally was restricted to professional drivers and others with documented driving experience. The race started at the Oster Chevrolet garage on Gardner Street in Boston Massachusetts and finished at the Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel in San Diego California.\n1982 Four Ball Rally:\nThe inaugural Four Ball Rally kicked off in Boston on Friday, June 11, 1982, just as summer vacation traffic was getting underway. Twenty-seven cars would start the race. Twenty-one would finish. Michael Begley, a real estate developer from Manhattan Beach, California, and Steve Cook, a driving instructor at the Bondurant School of High Performance Driving at Sears Point Raceway in Novato, California, won the race in 37 hours and 18 minutes. Their route was 3,031 miles long. The team managed an average speed of 80.23 mph despite being in one of the slowest top-end cars in the rally—a 1983 Mercedes Benz 380SEL The vehicle had a top speed of 116 mph. The Mercedes, a rental, was outfitted with a fuel cell, CB radio, police scanner, front and rear radar detectors and kill switches for the rear lights. Begley and Cook's goal was to stop as few times as possible to keep their average speed up. Between the main gas tank and the fuel cell their car had a 95-gallon capacity. A quick-fill cap on the fuel cell helped shave re-fueling time. In all they stopped just twice for gas and never broke down. The team got just one speeding ticket, in Arizona.\nThe team's driving experience: Michael Begley raced a 1964 Shelby Cobra in the vintage racing circuit throughout the United States. Steve Cook competed in endurance races including Daytona and Sebring, as well as the Formula Ford series.\nThe second-place finishers were Mike DiGonis from Jamaica, New York, and Bernie Gans from Brooklyn, New York, in a 1975 DiTomaso Pantera with an elapsed time of 38 hours and 2 minutes, average speed of 80.57 mph while traveling 3,062 miles. In third-place was the team of Bob Weaver and Perry Meek both from Indiana in a 1981 Porsche 911 SC Turbo, made a 2,60-mile run in 38 hours and 52 minutes with an average speed of 76.15 mph.\nCoverage of the race: a CBS News Charles Kuralt report on June 13, 1982, and articles in the Manhattan Beach News on July 7, 1982, and the Beach Reporter on July 1, 1982.\n1983 Four Ball Rally:\nThe 1983 Four Ball Rally got underway Friday, June 10. Fifty teams departed Boston, but only 38 crossed the San Diego finish line. Summer vacation traffic and the state police would challenge drivers for the second year in a row. Dirk Salz from West Germany and Farwell Perry From New York came in first with a record-breaking time of 36 hours and 10 minutes in a 1978 Porsche 911SC. Their elapsed time was 36 hours and 10 minutes and their average speed was 85.8 mph. They managed to get across the country with just one speeding ticket in Missouri.\nThe second-place team, Scott Thomas and Steve White both from Oklahoma, drove a 1984 Corvette. Their elapsed time was 36 hours and 53 minutes at an average speed of 81.6 mph.\nMichael Begley and Bill Cooper came in third in a highly modified 1979 Mercedes 6.9 with 106-gallon fuel capacity. Begley was on the 1982 winning team. He and his new teammate brought plenty of driving experience. Cooper raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Daytona and Sebring endurance races as well as the Formula Atlantic and Formula Ford Series. Despite some significant setbacks the duo managed a finishing time of 37 hours and 4 minutes. Evading nearly two dozen Indiana State Police ate up considerable time. They finally managed to shake the troopers by hiding in a corn field, then continued taking secondary roads to elude the state police. Mechanical problems with the fuel system in New Mexico cost them plenty, too—2 hours and 18 minutes to be exact. Interestingly, an Arizona state trooper cut them a break. Clocked by instant-on radar, the trooper asked Begley \"Do you know how fast he was going?\" Begley says the officer seemed surprised when he answered, \"about 170 mph\". The trooper clarified saying, \"It was actually 172 mph\". For his honesty the officer cited Begley for 72 mph in a 55 mph zone.\nCoverage of the rally: NBC News reporter Roger Mudd's \"Road Warriors\" segment aired June 12, 1983, on the Nightly News. The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote an extensive magazine article on September 18, 1983. The Argonaut of Manhattan Beach, California featured a cover story on June 23, 1983. The Indianapolis News article entitled \"Cops Put Brakes On Road Racers\" ran June 11, 1983. The Indianapolis Star also covered the race on June 11, 1983, with an article entitled \"Sports Cars Cross State In Coast-to-Coast Race.\"\n1984 Four Ball Rally:\nOn Saturday June 3, 1984, the team of Edward M. Rahill, of Barrington Ill. and Timothy Montgomery, of Fremont, Ohio, driving a performance and range enhanced Pontiac Trans Am, won the race in a record time of 35:46, despite several hours of delays due to two arrests and mechanical issues during the race. This time still stands today as the fastest documented time for a race crossing the continental United States between Boston and San Diego. A significant point reference was that Rahill and Montgomery were believed to be out of the race after their two arrests and mechanical breakdown in Illinois. Race records indicated the team were able to reach an average speed between St. Louis and San Diego, including stops, exceeding 104 miles an hour.\nAn interesting development coming out of the race was the near celebrity status of Ohio State Trooper Sargent Roger Teague who apprehended four participants including Rahill and Montgomery, the eventual winners of the event. Sargent Teague was awarded the 1984 Super Trooper Award by the FBR races sponsors and attended the winner's banquet with his wife to receive his recognition.\nThe 1984 Four Ball Rally received coverage from National and International News sources like the AP, UPI, New York Times, Chicago Sun Times, Paul Harvey's June 5, 1984 broadcast and 73 other newspaper organizations on June 4 and 5. The level of police enforcement was so intense, of the twenty seven cars that had planned to leave Boston that day, only eleven were to finish.  The New York State Police alone arrested seven participants. The level of coordinated national police effort to stop the race was unprecedented in American history and led to its discontinuation as the increase in national publicity and added attention from law enforcement made running the event untenable.\n\n\nBob Burns C2C2C memorial trophy dash\nThe Bob Burns or C2C2C is a new spin on the cannonball run. The event uses the original starting points of the Red ball garage or Goodwives shopping center and uses the Portofino Inn as a halfway point. Drivers can use any route they like so long as these criteria are met. When Chris Clemens saw a sign being put up at the Pennsylvania border that said \"sorry, we're closed\" on RT80 the thought occurred to him to not only do another cannonball run, but to do it twice on a timed run. Chris decided to make a maiden trip for time to see what was realistic and named the event after his recently passed uncle. The car used was a 1999 Mercedes SL 500 previously owned by Bob Burns that Chris had been given by his Aunt Patty. The first run began on May 2, 2020, when Chris Clemens and Mark Spence set out experiencing many hardships on their run including traffic, street racers in Las Vegas and hours on George Washington bridge and set a time of 74 hours and 5 minutes. Road and track article At the time of writing, the event was attempted 23 times with two teams besting the initial time set by Chris Clemens and Mark Spence. One other completed the event but did not beat 74:05.\n\n\nAustralian \"Cannonball Runs\"\nVarious versions of the cannonball run have been run in Australia. Like the original cannonball run, these were coast to coast races, though in this case, they started on the east coast of Australia and finished on the West coast, in Perth. They were mostly run in the 1980s, as one off or two off events. The Cannonball Sea to Shining Sea Paradise to Perth Trophy Dash was run on October 22, 1984, and went from Surfers Paradise in Queensland to Perth in Western Australia. Only three teams competed and the winning car completing the trip in 31 hours was a Pontiac, driven by a team of 3. The event ran a second and final time in 1986.\nAnother race, Australian Cannonball Cup, ran on November 2, 1984, from the outskirts of Melbourne to Fremantle in Western Australia. This event however, had some co-operation with the police. It was a legal race, and the contestants were supposed to be following the speed limit. 33 teams competed and there was some controversy after the race when the first-placed team were disqualified after it was discovered that they had been caught by police for speeding. The second-paced team, with a time of 33 hours and 4 minutes, were then awarded first prize.\nIn 1994 the first and only Cannonball Run in Australia ran from Darwin to Yularu and back again. Based on similar events in the United States, this event ended in tragedy when an out of control Ferrari F40  crashed into a checkpoint south of Alice Springs, resulting in the death of the two event officials manning the checkpoint as well as the two competitors. The remainder of the race had a 180 km/h (112 mph) speed limit imposed to prevent further accidents.\n\n\nSee also\nAPEX: The Secret Race Across America (Documentary)\nCannonball Run Challenge about the speed record for driving across the United States\nNeed for Speed: The Run\nStreet racing about the practice of illegally using public roadways for automobile races\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Gurney/Yates Cop First Cannonball\", Brad Niemcek on the 1971 race\nJack May, 1975 Cannonball champion with Rick Cline.\nCharles Graeber (October 16, 2007). \"The Pedal-to-the-Metal, Totally Illegal, Cross-Country Sprint for Glory\".

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1241575",
    "text": "The upland goose or Magellan goose (Chloephaga picta) is a sheldgoose of the shelduck-sheldgoose subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. Sheldgeese resemble true geese and display similar habits, yet they are more closely related to shelducks and ducks. The two recognized subspecies of upland goose are the continental picta subspecies and the insular (island) leucoptera subspecies.\nThis species nests and breeds close to water (rivers, ponds, oceans) either on the ground or near it among vegetation, usually in grasslands or coastal meadows in the Falkland Islands or in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego at the beginning of the austral summer. Population estimates suggest the insular subpopulations are stable, but continental populations show a recent decline in abundance. Upland geese are herbivores, specializing in plant leaves, stems and seeds.\n\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe upland goose was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus Anas and coined the binomial name Anas picta. Gmelin based his description on the \"Painted goose\" that had been included by the English ornithologist John Latham in his A General Synopsis of Birds. The species had been observed in 1775 on the Isla de los Estados (Staten Island) during Captain James Cook's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the goose by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook. It is the holotype for the species and is held by the Natural History Museum in London. The upland goose is now placed with four other species in the genus Chloephaga that was introduced in 1838 by the English naturalist Thomas Campbell Eyton. The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek khloē meaning \"grass\" and -phagos meaning \"-eating\". The specific epithet picta is from Latin pictus meaning \"painted.\nThere are strong morphological and genetic similarities between the bird fauna of the Falkland Islands and southern South America, and most native bird species are usually present in both insular  and continental populations. The biogeography of the region suggests that these similarities exist because in the geological past, birds from the continent might have reached the Falkland Islands either across a former land connection, during periods of lowered sea levels, or through long-distance dispersal. Genetic analyses place the Magellan goose as a sister taxa to the kelp goose.\n\n\nSubspecies\nTwo subspecies of upland goose are recognised. The smaller mainland form, picta, also known as the lesser Magellan goose, is found from central Chile and south-central Argentina south to Tierra del Fuego. The larger insular form, leucoptera or greater Magellan goose, is indigenous to the Falkland Islands, located to the east of the southern part of South America.\n\n\nDescription\nUpland geese males are similar to other sheldgeese, notably the kelp goose (Chloephaga hybrida) due to their predominantly white plumage, while females resemble the ruddy-headed goose (C. rubidiceps) due to their similarly barred breast plumage. This species is 60–72.5 centimetres (23.6–28.5 in) long.\nGreater Magellan geese (leucoptera subspecies) are the largest birds of the Chloephaga genus. Males typically weigh 3.5–4.5 kg (7.7–9.9 lbs) and females range from 2.9 to 3.5 kg (6.4–7.7 lbs). Lesser Magellan geese (picta subspecies) males weigh 2.7–3.6 kg (6.0–7.9 lbs) on average and females 2.9–3.5 kg (6.4–6.8 lbs).\nUpland geese display strong sexual dimorphism in their plumage. Males have white heads and breast plumage with black legs, whereas females have reddish-brown heads and breast plumage with yellow-orange legs. However, two interbreeding morphs exist for males. One morph causes black-barred breast plumage while the other causes white breast plumage. A greenish-bronze speculum is also located on the inner secondary flight feathers of the adult male. Males make a whistling \"wheep\" sound, while females make a low, rattling \"a-rrr\" sound.\nUpland geese molt both their primary and secondary feathers in ponds or sheltered sea inlets, usually between late November and early January. Molting frequency depends on breeding success to some degree, since most adults that molt have either not yet mated or failed to breed. Some greater Magellan geese skip this molt, retaining their ability to fly during the austral summer. While unusual, skipping this important process might have energetic advantages, since molting season can be very nutritionally taxing.\nIn Chapter VI of On the Origin of Species, author Charles Darwin noted that the upland goose has webbing between its toes that appeared to be \"rudimentary in function, though not in structure\", and concluded that this was a vestigial anatomical feature in this bird.\n\n\nHabitat and distribution\n\n\nHabitat\nUpland geese usually live in small, scattered groups on most pasture types (temperate grasslands, arid lowland scrubs), favouring areas with short green grasses. However, recent land use changes towards crop fields and managed pastures have forced them to adapt to and colonize such modern landscapes.\n\n\nDistribution\n\nUpland geese occupy the southern South American Continent (southern and central Chile and Argentina) and the Falkland Islands, with a continental distribution ranging from central Chile/southern Argentina to Tierra del Fuego, near Antarctica. Lesser Magellan geese usually reside in Patagonia or southern Chile and migrate north during the winter towards central Argentina, to their wintering grounds. Southernmost populations are more likely to migrate, with migrants reaching flight speeds of over 40 km/h (25 mph). In 2013, researchers identified a lesser Magellan goose in southern Brazil, redefining the northern edge of their wintering grounds. Greater Magellan geese, however, do not migrate and rarely leave the Falkland Islands. In general, population densities are highest around ponds and in green grasslands. Computer modelling of population ranges suggests that their distribution is favoured by the ample presence of green grasses to feed and breed in, and hindered by human presence, notably urbanization and oil extraction. There is also a sizeable introduced population on the sub-Antarctic South Georgia Island.\n\n\nBehaviour and ecology\n\n\nBreeding\n\nUpland goose breed in southern Patagonia or their native islands during the austral summer. They are monogamous, although divorce can occur, and generally return to breed in the same territory every year. After approximately two years from birth, females can start to lay eggs, and usually do so near their birthplace. Males begin breeding later and tend to settle farther away from where they were born. This sexual difference in dispersal distances causes the sex ratio of young to become biased towards the dispersing sex due to the inherent resource constraints of crowding. Therefore, upland geese tend to display a male-biased sex ratio. They breed non-colonially in densely vegetated areas, generally in September and October on the mainland, and in November on the Falkland Islands. A large population of this species breeds in the New Island Nature Reserve, which was created in collaboration with Falkland Conservation.\nMales attract females through a courtship display in which they whistle loudly, to which the female responds with softer cackles. As they are monogamous and territorial, a violent fight may break out if a male encroaches on another's territory. Males have been found injured or dead after these fights.\nThe simple nest is either on the ground or within 1.5 m (5 ft) of it, usually concealed by dense vegetation, and often located near water. A clutch consists of 5–8 eggs which are incubated for about 1 month. When the chicks hatch, they are covered in greyish-brown down. They don't remain in the nest for more than a day, quickly going to a nearby water source or feeding area, and are able to feed themselves from birth. They fledge in 9–10 weeks and reach maturity in 3 years.\n\n\nFood and feeding\nThe upland goose is primarily a herbivore, feeding mostly of seeds, leaves, stems, and other plant matter. They are very gregarious, and flocks of thousands of birds can be found grazing in one pasture alone. They are considered pests by farmers due to the fact that they eat on the pastures that are used for cattle and sheep, and because they claim that upland geese significantly decrease crop yield. However, a recent study claims that while sheldgeese do reduce wheat cover, they do not reduce overall wheat yield and they might even provide an ecosystem service through weed grazing.\n\n\nThreats and conservation\nIn the early 20th century, the Argentinian government declared the three Patagonian sheldgeese species (Ruddy-headed goose, Ashy-headed goose, and Upland goose) as pests due to claims of excessive grazing and negative effects on crop yields. Since then, wildlife agencies have encouraged hunting of upland geese across the entirety of their range and without restrictions on the number of birds killed. Consequently, population surveys started suggesting continental populations were declining. In 2008, all three species were classified as endangered by the Argentine government and hunting was banned, although some poaching still occurs, mostly on the mainland. Recently, fox predation has drastically reduced population numbers on the mainland, so national governments have established several protected areas throughout Patagonia in an attempt to conserve the species.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMale vocalizations on Birds of the World\nFemale vocalizations on Birds of the World\nNew Island Nature Reserve",

    "text": "The Epi-Olmec culture was a cultural area in the central region of the present-day Mexican state of Veracruz. Concentrated in the Papaloapan River basin, a culture that existed during the Late Formative period, from roughly 300 BCE to roughly 250 CE. Epi-Olmec was a successor culture to the Olmec, hence the prefix \"epi-\" or \"post-\". Although Epi-Olmec did not attain the far-reaching achievements of that earlier culture, it did realize, with its sophisticated calendrics and writing system, a level of cultural complexity unknown to the Olmecs.\nTres Zapotes and eventually Cerro de las Mesas were the largest Epi-Olmec centers though neither would reach the size and importance of the great Olmec cities before them nor El Tajín after them. Other Epi-Olmec sites of note include El Mesón, Lerdo de Tejada, La Mojarra, Bezuapan, and Chuniapan de Abajo.\n\n\nCultural context\n\nThe rise of the Epi-Olmec culture on the western edge of the Olmec heartland coincides with the depopulation of the eastern half of the Olmec heartland and the decline of the Olmec culture in general. The Epi-Olmec culture represented a gradual transformation of, rather than a sharp break with, the Olmec culture. Many Olmec motifs, for example, were employed by its successor culture. Tres Zapotes, one of the largest Olmec sites, continued as a regional center under the Epi-Olmec culture. And daily life for the non-elites continued much the same: subsistence farming with opportunistic hunting and fishing, wattle-and-daub houses, thatched roofs, and bell-shaped storage pits.\nOn the other hand, the Late Formative period saw a widespread decline in trade and other interregional interaction throughout Mesoamerica, along with a marked decline in the use of exotic prestige items, such as greenstone beads. It has been proposed these exotic trade goods were replaced as prestige items by locally created luxury goods, such as cotton cloth and towering headdresses.  The decline in interregional interaction and trade was not uniform however: in particular, interaction with cultures across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec increased, and an increase in the import of obsidian has also been detected.\nIn contrast to earlier Olmec art, Epi-Olmec art displays a general loss of detail and quality. Ceramic figurines were less realistically detailed, and the basalt monuments and stelae at Tres Zapotes lacked the artisanship, refinement, and detail of the earlier San Lorenzo and La Venta work.\nBased on the decentralized placement of mounds groups and monumental sculpture at Tres Zapotes, the Epi-Olmec hierarchy is assumed to have been less centralized than its Olmec predecessor, perhaps featuring a factionalized ruling assembly rather than a single ruler.\n(See also Tres Zapotes site layout and societal organization)\n\n\nEpi-Olmec sculpture\n\n\nScript and calendrics\nWhile the depiction of what appear to be historical events can be seen in La Venta Stela 3 (\"Uncle Sam\") and Monument 13 (\"The Ambassador\"), Olmec sculpture was more pre-occupied with the portraits of rulers, as is shown for example in the 17 colossal heads.  In contrast, Epi-Olmec monuments show a dramatic increasing concern with historicity, culminating in the eventual appearance of dated transcriptions.\nThese dated transcriptions were made possible by the Epi-Olmec culture's very early use of the Long Count calendar as well as a very early writing system, the Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script. The Isthmian script appears on several Epi-Olmec sculptures including La Mojarra Stela 1, the Tuxtla Statuette, and Tres Zapotes Stela C, each of which also contains a very early Long Count date.  These Epi-Olmec texts were the most detailed of this era in Mesoamerica.\nWhile neither the Isthmian script nor the Long Count calendar were confined to the Epi-Olmec culture, their use, particularly in combination, is one of its hallmarks.\n\n\nSubject matter\nWhereas contemporaneous Izapan monuments, some 330 miles (500 km) to the southeast, display mythic and religious subjects, Epi-Olmec monuments glorified rulers. La Mojarra Stela 1, for example, shows a ruler in an elaborate outfit and headdress. Justeson and Kaufman's translation of the accompanying Isthmian script gives the figure's name as Harvester Mountain Lord and the script tells of his rise to power, warfare, a solar eclipse, his own bloodletting, and a \"dripping sacrifice\", perhaps of his brother-in-law.\nSimilar Epi-Olmec monuments featuring finely dressed figures with towering, flowing headdresses include the Alvarado Stela and El Mesón Stela 1. Unlike the La Mojarra Stela 1, these two monuments also show a subordinate, and likely intimidated, smaller figure. Some badly eroded Isthmian script glyphs may appear on the Alvarado Stela. El Mesón Stela 1 has no text.\nThis \"exalted ruler\" monumental art later became common in the Maya lands to the east during the Classic era.\n\n\nFinal transformation\nBy 250 CE, Cerro de las Mesas, Remojadas, and other sites further north along the Veracruz coast had eclipsed Tres Zapotes. Although Tres Zapotes would continue into the Classic era, its heyday had passed and Epi-Olmec had given way to the Classic Veracruz culture.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nDiehl, Richard A.

On her maiden voyage, which was under the auspices of the EIC, she carried rice from Bengal for the British government to alleviate grain shortages in England. When she arrived in England she changed her registry to that of Great Britain. Between her second and third voyages for the EIC Berwick was a West Indiaman, sailing primarily to Barbados. In the 1820s, she sailed to Van Diemen's Land. She made her third voyage for the EIC in 1825. She was wrecked in 1827, on a return voyage from India.\n\n\n1st EIC voyage (1795–1796)\nCaptain John McTaggart sailed from Calcutta on  23 November 1795. Berwick was at Diamond Harbour on 20 January 1796. She reached St Helena on 25 April, Falmouth on 19 June, and Plymouth on 24 June. She arrived at Long Reach on 8 July. She carried rice on behalf of the British government which was importing grain to address high prices for wheat in Britain following a poor harvest.\n\nBerwick first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) with McTaggart master and owner, with her master changing to Wauchope, and trade London–India.\n\n\n2nd EIC voyage (1796–1797)\nCaptain William Wauchope acquired a letter of marque on 28 June 1796. Berwick was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain on 29 August. Captain Wauchope sailed from Portsmouth on 21 October 1796, bound for Madras. Berwick arrived at Madras on 2 February 1797. She was at Trincomalee on 13 April, and the Cape of Good Hope on 7 July. She reached St Helena on 3 August, and arrived at Gravesend on 28 October.\nOn her return from India, Berwick became a West Indiaman. Lloyd's Register for 1798, showed her master changing from Wauchope to William Welch, her owner from McTaggart to P.Daniel & Co., and her trade from London–India to London–Barbados.\nLloyd's List (LL) reported on 13 December 1805, that Berwick, Welsch, master, had sunk in Ramsgate harbour. A report about six weeks later stated that she had grounded, but had been gotten off and had returned to the Thames.\nLloyd's Register for 1810 showed Berwick's master changing from Wason to Griffith. Her owner was still Daniel & Co., and her trade London–Barbados. She had undergone a thorough repair in 1806.\nOn 21 March 1809, Lloyd's List reported that Berwick, Griffiths, master, had not been heard from since separating on 18 December, from the fleet from Barbados. A week later Lloyd's List reported that Berwick, Griffiths, master, had been captured and taken into Guadeloupe. Several weeks after that, Lloyd's List reported that she had arrived at Jamaica on 13 February 1809.\nOn 22 December 1810, Berwick put into Portsmouth. She had been bound for Barbados but had sprung a leak.\nLloyd's Register for 1820, showed her master changing from S. Compton to W. Tyler. She had undergone a repair in 1811. Her owner was still Daniel & Co., and her trade London–Barbados.\nOn 4 February 1821, Berwick, Tyler, master, was at 48°N 24°W having lost her rudder, boats, bulwarks and maintopmast. She was proceeding with a jury-rigged rudder. She was sailing from Demerara to London. She underwent repairs in 1821.\nLloyd's Register for 1825, showed Berwick with R. Jeffrey, master, W.C. Hurry and Co., owner, and trade London–Van Diemen's Land. She had been making the run between London and Van Diemen's Land for some time. She had left Gravesend on 6 December 1822, and had arrived in Hobart Town on 21 June 1823. She carried passengers, and delivered some Merino sheep.\nThe Oriental Herald and Colonial Review reported that Captain Jeffrey and Berwick had stopped at Tristan da Cunha on 25 March 1823, on her way to Van Diemen's Land. She had found it now had a population of 17, or 22 men and three women (accounts differ), and under the leadership of a former British artillery corporal. It was well supplied with domestic animals and grew its own produce and potatoes. Its leader traded with the Cape of Good Hope in a small schooner, delivering seal skins and elephant-seal oil.\nOn 7 July, after Berwick's arrival, several steerage passengers sued Jeffrey for inadequate accommodations, lack of access to the deck, and water shortages. The court found in their favor and required Jeffrey to pay damages ranging from £8 to £20, relative to a per person charge for the voyage of around £40.\n\n\nEIC voyage #3 (1825)\nLloyd's Register for 1826, showed Berwick with T. Eilbeck, master, J. Grieg, owner, and trade London–India.\nBerwick left the Downs on 7 June 1825. She arrived at the New Anchorage on 9 November, and at Calcutta on 17 November.\n\n\nLoss\nBerwick was wrecked on 30 June 1827, at Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, as she was sailing from Tellicherry and Bombay for London. Captain Eilbeck, the Second Officer, the carpenter, and twelve seamen drowned.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\nHackman, Rowan (2001). Ships of the East India Company.

She is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Kentucky.\nWorell served as President of the Society for the Psychology of Women, American Psychological Association (APA) Division 35, from 1997 to 1998 and as Editor of Psychology of Women Quarterly.\n\n\nAwards\nWorell received the APA Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Practice of Psychology in 2010. The award citation recognized her as \"one of the foremost feminist psychologists in the nation, she is among just a handful of individuals who have been instrumental in establishing and defining an entire field. Feminist psychology owes much of its shape and growth to Judith and her work in research about women and gender roles, in the unique treatment needs of women, and in education in the psychology of women.\"\nWorell received the APA Committee on Women in Psychology Leadership Award in 1990 for \"outstanding work and tireless commitment to enhancing the status of women, in society and as professionals, and a long-standing promotion, support and contributions to feminist scholarship.\"  She received the Carolyn Wood Sherif Award in 2001 and the Heritage Award in 2004, both from the Society for the Psychology of Women. Her other awards include the 1991 Distinguished Psychologist Award from the Kentucky Psychological Association.\n\n\nBiography\nWorell was born in 1928 and raised in Greenwich Village. She grew up in a Jewish family with strict gender roles. Her father's actions, specifically the gender rules in their house, are what taught her about sexism and about the division of labor, and it was not something she accepted easily. Later on in her career, Worell said, \"Women are the ones delving into advice books because they are 'the caretakers of the relationship'\". This idea came from the way she was raised and her mother's relationship with her father. As a child, Worell recalled going to the synagogue with her family, where the women had to sit separately from men because they were \"unclean\" or \"distracting to men\". This contrasted with her experience at the progressive elementary school she attended in Greenwich Village, where boys and girls were treated as equals. As a teenager, Worell became involved in the Encampment for Citizenship, a place that trained young adults to be community leaders.\nWorell earned her B.A degree in psychology at Queens College, CUNY in New York and graduated in 1950. After marrying Leonard Worell, a fellow student in psychology at Queens College, she and her husband moved to Ohio State University to attend graduate school. At Ohio State, Worell obtained her master's degree in 1952 and her PhD in psychology in 1954, working under the supervision of Julian Rotter. After graduating, Worell followed her husband as he secured faculty positions at different institutions while she was left to find alternative employment. In the late 1950s, Worell secured a position as a research associate at a psychiatric hospital in Iowa, and contributed to research examining whether meprobamate would reduce anxiety in patients.\nEventually Worell and her husband both landed faculty positions at the University of Kentucky.  In 1972, Worell joined the Commission on the Status of Women, organized by the Southeastern Psychological Association, where she met many women in psychology who had their Ph.Ds but were unable to get teaching positions due to sexism and patriarchy in academia. As Worell put it, feminism raised women's consciousness about the personal also being political. With women she met, Worell engaged in conversations about sexual violence that made her aware of how common rape was and that women needed a voice. To bring about change, she began her lifework in feminist therapy, integrating tenets of feminism with a cognitive social learning approach to create more effective methods of counseling and psychotherapy that emphasized and supported women's empowerment. Worell put together a feminist counseling and referral service at the Women's Center at the University of Kentucky and went on to establish the first sexual harassment code at the University of Kentucky.\n\n\nBooks\nJohnson, N.

    "text": "The morsing (also mukharshanku, mourching, morching or morchang; Sanskrit: दंत वाद्यन्तरात्मसत्रस्य, Telugu: మోర్సింగ్, Kannada: ಮೋರ್ಸಿಂಗ್, Rajasthani: मोरचंग, Tamil: நாமுழவு அல்லது முகச்சங்கு, Malayalam: മുഖർശംഖ്, English: \"jaw harp\") is an instrument similar to the Jew's harp, mainly used in Rajasthan, in the Carnatic music of South India, and in Sindh, Pakistan. It can be categorized under lamellophones, which is a sub-category of plucked idiophones. The instrument consists of a metal ring in the shape of a horseshoe with two parallel forks which form the frame, and a metal tongue in the middle, between the forks, fixed to the ring at one end and free to vibrate at the other. The metal tongue, also called the trigger, is bent at the free end in a plane perpendicular to the circular ring so that it can be struck and made to vibrate.\n\nThe morsing can be traced back over 1500 years. Its exact origin in the Indian subcontinent is not well documented, with most ancient accounts being derived from folk tales. It is found mainly in South India, Rajasthan and some parts of Assam. In Bengali and Assamese folk music it is sometimes played with a Rabindrasangeet, while in South India, it features in Carnatic concerts and percussion ensembles. In Rajasthan it is known as morchang and is used as a percussion instrument in lok geet (folk music). It was often used in Hindi cinema by music directors like R.D. Burman and S.D. Burman, and has resurfaced in the twentieth century, with street performers like Varun Zinje playing it in a renewed style. It is said to be the precursor to subsequent instruments such as the harmonica and the harmonium.\n\n\nPlaying technique\n\nThe morsing is placed on the front teeth, with slightly pouted lips and held firmly in the hand. It is struck using the index finger of the other hand to produce sound. Movement of the player's tongue while making nasal sounds is used to change the pitch. This can be achieved when the syllable 'Nga' or a variant thereof, is sounded through the nose while air is pushed out or pulled in through the mouth. This aids the meditation process and thus some players use it as a form of practising pranayama. Others speak into the instruments while playing, thus giving it the effect of a light haunting echo.\nThe morsing is firmly held in the hand, the frame or the ring between the palm and the fingers usually in the left hand. Care should be taken to see that the middle part or the metal tongue is not being touched when held idle. Then the upper of the two parallel forks is firmly pressed against the front upper teeth; the lower fork, against the front lower teeth with the lips helping to keep the contact, so that the metal tongue will not contact the teeth when it moves. The trigger is plucked with the tip of the index finger. Sound is produced due to the vibration of the metal tongue that is transferred through the teeth and sounds in mouth and nasal cavity. Movement of the player's tongue with constant plucking can produce very fast patterns of sound. By constricting the space in the mouth the nostrils can produce sounds in different phases, similar to phasers in electronic music.\nWhile traditionally made of iron, variants can be made from brass, wood, bone, and even plastic and credit cards.\n\n\nTuning\nThe basic pitch of the instrument can be varied very little. Significantly, the pitch of the instrument can only be reduced and not increased. To reduce the pitch a little, beeswax can be applied on the plucking end. To increase the pitch, it can be filed, although this may damage the instrument.\n\n\nAdvanced playing and the art of accompaniment\n\nIn Carnatic music, the morsing is usually played along with the mridangam or dhol, so it is necessary to know the syllables or aural interpretation of what is played on mridangam. It is important to know the aural representation of the ferns (pattern of syllables played on percussion instruments) played on mridangam as it is being silently recited while playing the morsing. This vocal art of reciting the syllables played on the mridangam is called konnakol. But while playing on morsing you don't actually make sound of reciting the syllable but just move your tongue that way so that the air passages gets blocked and cleared in a pattern so as to produce the sound of the ferns. It is essential to follow the mridangam and play the same ferns as far as possible, though it is difficult owing to the limitations of the instrument.\nGlimpses of uniqueness and versatility of the morsing can be shown when accompanying singly for the song or during neraval or swara prastara (stages of song rendition in Carnatic music). The morsing is played as a shadow of the mridangam throughout the concert and the instrument's capabilities should be exhibited when playing or accompanying alone or during Thani (percussion round in a concert) or talavadyas (percussion ensembles).\nThough working on completely different principles, the music of the Morchang sounds similar to that emanating from the Australian didgeridoo.\n\n\nVariants around the world\nThe Morchang exists, in nearly the same form and design all over the world, and is called by different names (estimated to be around 900) in different languages. For example: Morchang / morsing (India), Kou-Xian (China), Vargan (Russia), Munnharpe (Norway), Zanboorak (Iran), Maultrommel (Germany), Guimbarde (France), Marranzano (Italy), Doromb (Hungary), Dambrelis (Lithuania) and Drymba (Ukraine). It may have spread and been shared between countries through the ancient trade routes between Asia and Europe, including the Silk route. There is a theory according to which the popular name Jew's harp is a corruption of the name jaw harp. This theory is described by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) as \"baseless and inept\". The OED says that, \"More or less satisfactory reasons may be conjectured: e.g. that the instrument was actually made, sold, or imported to England by Jews, or purported to be so; or that it was attributed to them, as a good commercial name, suggesting the trumps and harps mentioned in the Bible.\"\n\n\nNotable players\nPlayers of the instrument are sometimes called Morsingists. Current day players include  Bhagyalakshmi M. Krishna, Sundar N, Minjur M Yagnaraman, Bejjanki V Ravi Kiran, Ortal Pelleg, Valentinas, Viaceslavas, the Barmer Boys, T S Nandakumar and a number of Rajasthani folk music players from the traditional entertainer tribe of Laggas. Morsingists from earlier eras include Abraham Lincoln, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great  and Mannargudi Natesa Pillai, Hariharasharma (father of Vikku Vinayagaram), Pudukkottai Mahadevan, and Kalaimamani A S Krishnan, Mysore M Gururaj, Bharadwaj R Sathavalli and the great late L.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=28019464",
    "text": "Hans-Joachim Bohlmann (20 September 1937  –  19 January 2009) was a German serial vandal who primarily targeted artworks at public exhibitions. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270 million Deutsche Marks (about 138 million euro) by such artists as Rubens, Rembrandt and Dürer.\n\n\nLife\nBohlmann was born in Breslau (modern Wrocław).\nSince his youth, Bohlmann suffered from a serious personality disorder. At the age of 16, he voluntarily went to the psychiatric clinic of the University of Kiel and underwent electric shock and insulin treatments. Around that time, he was a plumber apprentice, but could not focus on a single occupation and was doing various jobs. He had several therapy courses involving tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, behavior therapy and group therapy, but with very limited success.\nIn 1968, Bohlmann married and worked for six years at a warehouse. He then frequently took valium and haloperidol and regularly attended church masses. In 1974, he met the neurosurgeon Dieter Müller from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf who suggested a lobotomy treatment. Although Müller predicted a 75–80% chance of success, the operation brought no improvement. It was later criticized as obsolete and merely reduced Bohlmann's intelligence. On 11 March 1977, his wife fell from a window while cleaning and died from injuries soon after. According to Bohlmann, the death of his wife turned him to vandalism. Previously, he often visited museums with his wife and saw the importance of art in society. He then started to buy sulfuric acid at pharmacies and spray it on paintings.\nHis vandalism began on 16 March 1977 in a city park and followed on 29 March 1977 in Kunsthalle Hamburg, where he damaged the painting Golden Fish by Paul Klee. It was followed by other attacks in Hamburg, Lübeck, Lüneburg, Essen, Dortmund, Hannover, Bochum, Kassel, Düsseldorf and Hamelin. On 16 August 1977, he poured sulfuric acid on several artworks including portraits of Martin Luther and his wife Katharina von Bora by Lucas Cranach the Elder in the Lower Saxony State Museum of Hanover. On 24 August 1977, he damaged the painting Archduke Albrecht by Rubens in Düsseldorf and on 7 October 1977 four paintings in Schloss Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel, estimated at more than 25 million euros, among them Rembrandt's Jacob blessing Joseph's second son, 1656, a self-portrait by Rembrandt and Willem Drost's Noli me tangere. In his attacks, Bohlmann was primarily targeting the faces of the personages, trying to inflict maximum damage. Bohlmann's activity was not restricted to paintings and museums; he ignited an altar in Lübeck and sprayed hundreds of tombstones with swastikas at night in Hamburg. The resultant outrage in the press encouraged him. As he felt he was becoming a celebrity, he abandoned the antidepressant drugs he had been taking.\nBohlmann was arrested in October 1977 and in 1979 convicted by the Hamburg Regional Court to five years in prison for 17 cases of damage to public property, 3 cases of damage to private property and one case of cruelty to animals. He served the term in full until 6 October 1982. After release from prison, Bohlmann resumed vandalism. He was then banned from buying acid and instead committed arson at a construction site near Hamburg inflicting damage estimated at 65,000 euros. For this crime, the Hamburg Regional Court sentenced him to three years ending on 5 May 1986. A part of his pension was seized for the damage done to Ruben's Archduke Albrecht, and in the autumn of 1987 he went for treatment in the psychiatric department of the Hospital Hamburg-Eilbek.\nIn March 1988, Bohlmann bought two litres of sulfuric acid and hid them in a park. On 20 April 1988, he took a leave from the hospital and the next day splashed acid on three paintings by Albrecht Dürer in Munich's Alte Pinakothek, namely Lamentation for Christ, Paumgartner Altar and Mater Dolarosa inflicting damage estimated at 35 million euros. Immediately after the attacks, he was arrested and held in the psychiatric hospital of Haar, Bavaria. In 1989 he was convicted by the Munich District Court to a two-year imprisonment, concurrent with treatment as long as necessary in a psychiatric hospital, and in March 1990 transferred to the clinic in Hamburg-Ochsenzoll. Bohlmann escaped from the facility in January 1998 and after being at large for two days he was found at a subway station, possibly on the way back to the hospital. On 30 July 2001 he escaped again but returned to hospital the next morning.\nIn Ochsenzoll he attended art therapy and for nine years painted pictures, almost every day, with a total number of about 1,500. In January 2005, more than 16 years after his arrest in Munich, Bohlmann was released to public life. On 25 June 2006, in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, he splashed lighter fuel on the painting Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster (1648) by Bartholomeus van der Helst and set fire to it. Most damage was to the varnish layer. Bohlmann was sentenced to 3 years by the court in Amsterdam. After serving two-thirds of the sentence, on 24 June 2008 he was released from prison, returned to Hamburg and died there on 19 January 2009 of cancer.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nNicolaes Maes: Apostle Thomas in Kassel, after Bohlmann's attack of 7 October 1977",

    "text": "Curtis Roy Boettcher (January 7, 1944 – June 14, 1987), sometimes credited as Curt Boetcher or Curt Becher, was an American singer, songwriter, arranger, musician, and record producer from Wisconsin. He was a pivotal figure in what is now termed \"sunshine pop\", working with the Association, the Millennium, Sagittarius, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Tommy Roe, Bobby Jameson, Elton John, Gene Clark, Emitt Rhodes, Tandyn Almer, the Beach Boys, and others.\nThe New York Times wrote of Boettcher: \"If his life had gone just a bit differently, [he] might have been another Brian Wilson. ... As it stands, Boettcher — a pop-music producer whose heyday was the late '60s — now survives in rock history mostly as a liner-note credit. He could have been, but never was. Yet he enjoys a godlike status among a select group of music fans, for whom obscurity is more enticing than fame.\"\n\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to Peggie and Arland Boettcher. His father was a Navy pilot in World War II and later worked at the Pentagon.\n\n\nThe GoldeBriars\nBoettcher entered the University of Minnesota in fall 1962, where in 1963 he formed the folk quartet The GoldeBriars with the Holmberg sisters, Dotti and Sheri, and Ron Neilsson. They relocated to Los Angeles after being signed by Epic Records, for whom they recorded and released two albums in 1964, The GoldeBriars and Straight Ahead! (A third was reportedly recorded in 1965 but withheld from release.) Under the guidance of recording producer Bob Morgan, the vocals were mixed upfront and enriched by double-tracking to sound like six voices. Prior to recording their third album, the group added drummer Ron Edgar (later of The Music Machine; Edgar also worked with Boettcher in the bands The Ballroom and The Millennium). According to music historian Joseph Lanza, the GoldeBriars' material tended to follow the standard folk formula of songs such as \"Shenandoah\", but \"acoustically, their style blended the homespun and the sugarspun.\" Boettcher arranged most of the group's songs, but he also contributed as a songwriter. Morgan, quoted in Lanza's Vanilla Pop, said that Boettcher's childhood as a navy brat influenced songs like \"Haiku\" on the album Straight Ahead!. Bobb Goldsteinn, an accomplished songwriter (who wrote the 1963 folk-dixie hit \"Washington Square\" for the Village Stompers), became \"Boettcher's manager [and] confidant[e]\", as well as lyricist for some GoldeBriars songs. As manager, Goldsteinn inched the band in a more pop-flavored direction. The GoldeBriars performed live in the 1965 film Once Upon a Coffee House.\n\n\nThe Association, The Ballroom, and Tommy Roe\nFollowing the demise of The GoldeBriars, Boettcher moved into production and songwriting work for others, including Lee Mallory and The Association. In 1966, through his production partnership Our Productions, Boettcher produced the debut album by The Association, And Then... Along Comes the Association, released on Valiant Records. The album spawned two Top 10 hits, \"Along Comes Mary\" (which reached #7 in the U.S.) and \"Cherish\" (which reached #1). In 2012, original Association member Jim Yester said Valiant Records claimed \"Cherish\" sounded \"too old and archaic\", but the song's success \"just showed we can have archaic and eat it, too.\" The album included the song \"Message of Our Love\", co-written by Boettcher and Tandyn Almer (who also wrote \"Along Comes Mary\").\nBoettcher's wife Claudia said that Almer wrote \"Along Comes Mary\" as a slow song. Boettcher sped up the tempo and recorded a demo on which he sang the vocal. This demo was presented to The Association, who used it as a guide for their arrangement of the tune. It was the band's attempt to replicate and build on Boettcher's demo that became the group's first hit single (produced by Boettcher).  Boettcher and Almer had a dispute over writing credits for the song, Boettcher arguing that his extensive contributions to the arrangement, which formed the basis of the hit version of the song, warranted a co-writer credit. However, the song was ultimately credited solely to Almer.\nAfter the album achieved commercial success, according to a November 1966 story in Billboard, the band dropped their manager, Dean Fredericks, who in turn filed a breach of contract suit against the band, claiming they were bound by a seven-year agreement. After filing suit, Fredericks joined Our Productions. \"Consequently,\" Billboard revealed, \"[the] Association will no longer associate with Our Productions, and henceforth will be a&r'd [sic] by Jerry Yester, brother of Association member Jim Yester.\"  As a result of this dispute, despite his valuable contributions to the debut album's commercial breakthrough, Boettcher was prevented from continuing as the band's producer. (He produced several tracks for a later incarnation of the band in the early 1980s.)\nIn a 1974 interview with ZigZag Magazine, Boettcher said that during this period he was under contract to Our Productions and on salary. This arrangement accorded him no royalties, but a tremendous amount of artistic freedom. \"I wanted to keep on working, to be there. I think for a while I had more hours [of studio experience] for any producer my age. I used to practically live in the studio. And I used to work until I fell over. It was like an addiction.\nIn 1966 he formed the group The Ballroom with Sandy Salisbury, Michele O'Malley, and Jim Bell. The quartet recorded an album's worth of material, but other than two songs on a 1967 Warner Bros. 45 rpm single, the sessions remained unreleased until 2001.\nIn 1966, he produced two hit singles for Tommy Roe, \"Sweet Pea\" and \"Hooray for Hazel\". Production on both was credited to Boettcher's Our Productions partner, Steve Clark, but Boettcher subsequently claimed that he himself produced these recordings. The following year, Boettcher produced Roe's album It's Now Winter's Day (ABC Records).\n\n\nThe Millennium and Sagittarius\nBoettcher is said to have met both producer Gary Usher and Beach Boy songwriter Brian Wilson while producing and mixing the first single by Lee Mallory, \"That's the Way It's Gonna Be\", issued on Valiant Records in 1966. Usher in later years insisted that Boettcher influenced Brian Wilson during the development of the Beach Boys' perennial album Pet Sounds (1966), leading him to \"abandon surfing music.\"\nUsher bought Boettcher's contract and signed him as a staff producer for Columbia Records. In 1967 he enlisted Boettcher to collaborate on a personal project, a studio band called Sagittarius, under whose name he had produced a single, \"My World Fell Down\", which became a minor hit. (It was sung by Glen Campbell, who at the time was working as a session musician in Los Angeles, with Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys on backing vocals.) Because of the modest chart success of the single, Columbia requested a full album, only to discover there was no group. Usher and Boettcher became the studio group, and an album was completed and released in 1968 under the title Present Tense. (Usher and Boettcher are pictured on the cover.) Some of the songs were adapted from the unreleased Ballroom sessions, while others were re-recorded with new arrangements. The single version of \"My World Fell Down\" was edited differently on the album, omitting a bridge of musique concrète that was on the 45. A second single, \"Hotel Indiscreet\", recorded with Boettcher (and featuring a comedic non sequitur by the Firesign Theater), was released, but it failed to chart. The album was a commercial failure.\nUsher's celebrity, as well as Boettcher's successful productions for The Association and Tommy Roe, convinced Columbia to finance Boettcher's own studio project. In 1967 he assembled a group of musicians and songwriters with whom he had previously worked or personally knew (including Sandy Salisbury, Lee Mallory, Joey Stec, and Michael Fennelly), as well as some top Los Angeles session musicians, and started recording an album under the group moniker The Millennium. The album was co-produced by Keith Olsen, who had been a friend of Boettcher since his college days. Their debut—and only—album, Begin, was the most expensive album ever recorded for Columbia at that point. Despite the release of several singles, sales were dismal and the project was considered a commercial flop. This was partially attributable to Boettcher's reluctance to tour. The group staged a few live performances in Los Angeles, but the difficulty of replicating the album in concert posed a large enough challenge to dissuade Boettcher from sustaining the band. Although the single \"It's You\" became a hit in several regions, there was no group to support it.  \"5 AM\" also charted in the Philippines. The group recorded one final single, \"Just About The Same\" b/w \"Blight\", which was not issued at the time. Despite its commercial failure, the album is critically regarded as one of the finest pop albums from the late 1960s, and has been described at AllMusic as a \"bona fide lost classic\". In 2000 an album of demos by The Millennium called Again was issued.\nSoon after The Millennium broke up, Boettcher's friend Gary Usher, fired by Columbia Records, started a record label called Together Records. He brought in Boettcher and Olsen as staff producers, and Boettcher was involved in several projects for the label. These included his first attempt at a solo album, as well as producing recordings for a Sandy Salisbury solo album, contributing to the second Sagittarius album, and co-producing with Olsen The Moses Lake Recordings by The Bards, which was a mixture of garage rock with psychedelia and sunshine pop elements. Although the second Sagittarius album, The Blue Marble, did see release (and also notched a minor entry on the singles chart with a cover of The Beach Boys' \"In My Room\", sung by Boettcher), and several Sandy Salisbury singles were released, the label failed before any of Boettcher's other work could be completed. (Some Boettcher projects for Together were released in the early 2000s). Among other Boettcher productions remaining unreleased are sessions for Twice Nicely, guitarist Waddy Wachtel and singer Judy Pulver (co-writers of \"Malachi Star\", a song on Boettcher's 1973 solo album), a single for (My Three Sons actor) Don Grady of the band Yellow Balloon, and sessions produced with Gary Usher of a guitar duo called Tom and Dick. (Dick was songwriter David Batteau, who would later write songs with and for Boettcher in the band California.) Former Millennium bandmate Ron Edgar played drums on the Tom and Dick sessions. In 1970 Boettcher and Olsen served as mixdown engineers for Emitt Rhodes' first Dunhill album.\n\n\nSolo recording and The Beach Boys\nIn the early 1970s, Boettcher had little commercial success and few rewarding recording projects. In 1971, at the insistence of Elektra Records founder-president Jac Holzman, who was a huge fan of Begin, Boettcher signed a deal with Elektra. He warned Holzman that the album would take a long time to produce, and started working on a solo album. The project got a boost when Boettcher met a young multi-instrumentalist named Web Burrell; taking a cue from the early one-man albums by Rhodes, Boettcher decided to record the album in a similar fashion, using few musicians other than Burrell. (Boettcher and Burrell collaborated on at least three published songs.) After almost two years of work, There's An Innocent Face was released in 1973 under the name Curt Boetcher. It was a continuation of the direction that the Millennium had taken with their unreleased post-Begin recordings, being a collection of songs with country, sunshine pop, arena rock, and folk stylings. The album was a commercial failure. He attempted to record a follow-up album, tentatively titled Chicken Little Was Right, but it was never completed.\nIn the mid-1970s, Boettcher sang backing vocals on a number of Elton John recordings, including \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", a duet John recorded with Kiki Dee. He also contributed backing vocals to recordings by Tanya Tucker, Helen Reddy, Eric Carmen.\nThereafter, his output as a musician and producer was limited and sporadic. Beginning in 1975, he worked for several years as a disco DJ throughout southern California. His best-known work in the late 1970s was a 10-minute disco version of \"Here Comes the Night\" by The Beach Boys, which was a moderate hit in 1979 and was included on L.A. (Light Album); it was a remake of the original recording from their 1967 album Wild Honey. As Curt Becher he produced a version of \"Shortnin' Bread\" for The Beach Boys that emerged on some bootleg collections. He also produced Mike Love's solo album Looking Back With Love. Other productions were largely overlooked, such as the Geno Washington album That's Why Hollywood Loves Me and The Diamonds' Live And Well album. In 1980 he produced new recordings by a later incarnation of The Association, but these tracks were not released. He also produced their 1983 version of \"Walk Away Renee,\" which was included on a Radio Shack promotional album by Mike Love and Dean Torrence entitled Rock & Roll City.\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nLittle is known about Boettcher's personal life. He married Claudia Ford in the late 1960s, and they had a son, Varek, before they were divorced. A 2013 New York Times Magazine article asserted that Boettcher was gay, and that he tested positive for HIV in the 1980s.\nBoettcher died in June 1987 at Los Angeles County Hospital while being treated for a lung infection. His former wife claimed that a blood vessel was clipped in his lung during a biopsy, and the medical staff, fearful of his HIV-positive status, avoided Boettcher while he bled out. Shortly before his death, he set up the Valley Center Studios with musician Mark Antaky and engineer Dave Jenkins.\n\n\nCover versions\nThe Brady Bunch recorded Boettcher's composition \"I Just Want To Be Your Friend\" for their 1972 album, Meet the Brady Bunch (Paramount Records). Another Boettcher co-composition, \"There Is Nothing More to Say\", was sung as a solo by Maureen McCormick on Chris Knight & Maureen McCormick, a 1973 album by Brady cast members McCormick and Christopher Knight. The song was reissued as a bonus track on the CD release of The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album.\nThe Sunshine Company, a Los Angeles rock band, recorded two Boettcher compositions, \"I Just Want To Be Your Friend\" (on the 1967 album Happy Is the Sunshine Company, Imperial Records 12359), and \"If You Only Knew\" (on the 1968 album The Sunshine Company, Imperial Records 12368).\nThe Hep Stars, a 1960s Swedish rock group whose line-up included Benny Andersson before he went on to greater fame in ABBA, recorded four Boettcher compositions, \"Another Time\", \"Musty Dusty\" (co-written with Tandyn Almer), \"Would You Like To Go\" (co-written with Jules \"Gary\" Alexander of the Association), and \"Spinning Spinning Spinning\" (co-written with Ruthann Friedman).\nEternity's Children covered a Boettcher composition, \"You Know I've Found a Way\" on their 1968 album of the same name. A further cover of the song included Sagittarius, who included it on their album, Present Tense.\nIn April 2013, Beth Sorrentino (formerly of the American rock band Suddenly, Tammy!) released Would You Like To Go: A Curt Boettcher Songbook, produced by Sean Slade and issued in Europe on the Basta label. (It was released in North America on June 10, 2014.) The album includes covers of well-known and obscure Boettcher songs and co-writes, as well as an idiosyncratic recording of \"Along Comes Mary\" because of the song's strong association with Boettcher. Sorrentino's recording of \"You Know I've Found a Way\" (co-written by Boettcher and Lee Mallory) was used as the soundtrack for the trailer of Rik Cordero's film Starla.\n\n\nDiscography\nAs Artist:\n\nThe GoldeBriars - The GoldeBriars (1964, Epic)\nThe GoldeBriars - Straight Ahead!

    "title": "Henri Desmarets",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2725994",
    "text": "Henri Desmarets (French pronunciation: [ɑ̃ʁi demaʁɛ]; February 1661 – 7 September 1741) was a French composer of the Baroque period primarily known for his stage works, although he also composed sacred music as well as secular cantatas, songs and instrumental works.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nEarly years and first successes\n\nHenri Desmarets was born into a modest Paris household in February 1661. His mother, Madeleine née Frottier, came from a bourgeois Parisian family. His father, Hugues Desmarets was a huissier in the cavalry at the Grand Châtelet. Desmarets' childhood was marked by his father's death when he was eight years old, his mother's subsequent remarriage in 1670, and the death of his two siblings. In 1674, he entered into the service of King Louis XIV as a page and choir singer in the Chapelle Royale (Chapel Royal). According to Duron and Ferraton, he may have also previously sung as a choir boy in Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois which was the parish church of the kings of France. While in the service of the king, he received a general education as well as music training from Pierre Robert and Henry Du Mont. He is also thought to have received training from the court composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, who used the chapel pages as performers in his operas. By 1680 he had become an \"ordinaire de la musique du roi\" (court musician) and had composed  the first of his grand motets (Te Deum 1678). The idyll-ballet which he composed in August 1682 to celebrate the birth of the king's grandson, the Duke of Burgundy, found great favour at court and the following year he entered the competition to select four maîtres (masters) of the Chapelle Royale. He was only 22 at the time and according to some accounts, the King had vetoed his selection after he had passed the first round on account of his youth.\nAfter the competition, Desmarets petitioned the king to allow him to leave France for study with Italian composers, but Lully objected on the grounds that it would diminish his command of the French style. Desmarets remained at the court and made money by \"ghost-writing\" works for one of the composers who had won the competition, Nicolas Goupillet. Goupillet was dismissed from his post ten years later when the deception came to light. In the meantime, Desmarets continued to find favour with his own compositions, most notably his motet Beati quorum (1683); his divertissement, La Diane de Fontainebleau (1686) and his first full-length opera, Endymion (1686). The first performance of Endymion was in the king's private apartments at Versailles, performed in parts over six days. The Dauphine was so pleased with it that at her request it was performed again in its entirety at the court theatre ten days later. Desmarets was increasingly gravitating towards stage works, but the king had granted Lully a monopoly on performances at the Académie Royale de Musique in Paris, so that operas by other composers were not presented there until after Lully died in 1687.\n\n\nOperas on the Paris stage and scandal in Senlis\nDesmarets' Te Deum was performed in the oratory of the Louvre Palace in February 1687 to celebrate Louis XIV's recovery from illness, and later that year the king granted him a pension of 900 livres. Desmarets married Élisabeth Desprez, the daughter of a Parisian blade manufacturer, in 1689, and the following year their daughter, Élisabeth-Madeleine, was born. He became the Chapel Master of the Jesuit college Louis-le-Grand in 1693 and premiered his opera Didon in June of that year. It was the first of his stage works to be performed at the Académie Royale de Musique. Over the next two years three more of his operas premiered there: Circé (1694), Théagène et Cariclée (1695), and Les amours de Momus (1695).\nIn the summer of 1696, Élisabeth Desmarets died, leaving him with six-year-old Élisabeth-Madeleine to parent. Desmarets became a frequent visitor to the Saint-Gobert family in Senlis, who offered to help him take care of Élisabeth-Madeleine. Both families had been friends since 1689, and Desmarets had given singing lessons to Marie-Marguerite de Saint-Gobert when she was fifteen. During these visits, Desmarets and the now eighteen-year-old Marie-Marguerite fell in love and within six months of his wife's death, they asked her father, Jacques de Saint-Gobert, for permission to marry. He flatly refused and put his daughter in a convent when he discovered that she was pregnant. In the midst of all this, Desmarets was preparing his opera Vénus et Adonis for its 1697 premiere. The lovers eloped to Paris and Marie-Marguerite gave birth to a son in February 1698.\n\n\nExile\nAfter the elopement, nearly three years of complicated court cases ensued with Marie-Marguerite's father accusing her mother, Marie-Charlotte de Saint-Gobert, of complicity in the affair. She in turn accused her husband of attempting to poison her. Saint-Gobert disinherited his daughter and had Desmarets charged with seduction and kidnapping. Desmarets and Marie-Maguerite fled to Brussels before he could be arrested, leaving his opera Iphigénie en Tauride unfinished. He was eventually condemned to death in absentia in May 1700. With no possibility of returning to France, Desmarets took a position in Spain as the court composer to Philip V. There he and Marguerite were officially married. He left Spain in 1707 to become the master of music at the court of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine at the  Château de Lunéville. (At the time, Lorraine was not officially part of France.) While he was in exile, his friends Jean-Baptiste Matho and Anne Danican Philidor kept his artistic reputation alive in France by ensuring that his works continued to be performed and published there. André Campra completed Iphigénie en Tauride for him and it premiered in Paris in 1704.\n\n\nFinal years\nDesmarets was finally pardoned by the French Regent in 1720, and his second marriage was officially recognized. He applied to become the master of the Chapelle Royale at the court of Louis XV in 1726, but was unsuccessful and remained in Lorraine for the rest of his days. Desmarets died in Lunéville on 7 September 1741 in his 80th year and was buried there in the convent church of the Sisters of Saint Elisabeth. Marie-Marguerite had died fourteen years earlier. Only two of their many children survived them, Francois-Antoine (1711–1786), who became a high-ranking official in Senlis and Léopold (1708-1747), who became a cavalry officer and for many years was the lover of novelist and playwright Françoise de Graffigny. Élisabeth-Madeleine took care of him in his old age and died a few months after her father.\n\n\nWorks\nBoth the music and the text for some of the works listed here have been lost.

    "text": "Plurk ( ) is a free social networking and microblogging service that allows users to send updates (otherwise known as plurks) through short messages or links, which can be up to 360 text characters in length (as of 2016).\nUpdates are then shown on the user's home page using a timeline, which lists all the updates received in chronological order, and delivered to other users who have chosen to receive them. A unique feature of its timeline is horizontal scrolling which is unlike any other popular social networking or microblogging websites like Twitter or Facebook, where users can see more posts running horizontally across the screen, with previous plurks to the right. Each of the threads shows timestamps below the timeline frame, and a counter for the number of responses; a thread can have as many as 300 to a thousand responses. Users can respond to other users' updates from their timeline through the Plurk.com website, official mobile apps, by private or instant messaging, or by text messaging via compatible third party applications. Also unique to the site is the ability to post anonymous plurks using the \"whisper\" qualifier, affording users the ability to hide their username or identity.\n\n\nHistory\nAfter months of development, Plurk was launched on 12 May 2008.\nThe etymology of the name was explained by the developers as such:\n\nabbreviation of 'people' and 'lurk'\nportmanteau of 'play' and 'work'\nacronym of peace, love, unity, respect, and karma\nverb neologism, similar to how Google was eventually used as a verb\nWhile it is difficult to track down the names of the creators of Plurk, and the \"A-Team\" link listed under \"creator\" leads to a page that lacks any real information, it is known that the current CEO is Alvin Woon. In January 2013, it was announced that the company has been headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, while it has \"landed [an] undisclosed amount of funding.\"\n\n\nFeatures and technology\nPlurk's interface shows updates in horizontal form through a scrollable timeline written in JavaScript and updated through AJAX. Users can modify the interface using CSS and HTML scripts as well. Users can post new messages with optional 'qualifiers', which are one-word verbs used to represent a thought (e.g., 'feels', 'thinks', 'loves', etc.). There are also advanced features such as sending updates only to a subset of your friends, posting updates on events earlier in the day, and sharing images, videos, and other media. Followers are allowed, but only limited to accounts that are not set as private. Users can upload media files through YouTube, links and webcam or from their computer. Plurks can also be 'liked', as in other social sites. In addition, it has a birthday reminder feature that places a birthday cake sign on all the user's messages on his/her birthday. Every plurker has his/her own Karma value. It is recalculated based on your activities. Higher Karma gives access to more emoticons and features.\nPlurk also supports group conversations between friends and allows usage of emoticons together with the usual text micro-blogging. Plurk also supports the upload of users' own pictures as emoticons.\nThe Plurk.com developers allowed public access to the API on December 4, 2009.\nDue to messages being sent between users in near-realtime, many users use Plurk as an alternative to chat and interact with each other.\n\n\nAvailability in other languages\nTo help translate their base list of qualifiers/verbs, Plurk hosts its own translation website where users can submit translations of the Plurk user interface in other languages. As of July 2008, Plurk is translated into over twenty languages.\n\n\nReception\nPlurk was occasionally referred to as a rival to Twitter, an earlier micro-blogging service, during its first year.\nIn June 2008, Plurk received online attention when it was featured by Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their net@night show in the TWiT.tv podcast network.\n\n\nControversies\n\n\nMSN Juku controversy\n\nIn November 2009, MSN China launched an Internet application called MSN Juku in beta. Observers noted similarity between the MSN Juku user interface and that of  Plurk, which was blocked in China in April 2009. Microsoft later indefinitely suspended MSN Juku, admitting to accusations that MSN China plagiarised about 80% of Plurk's original code, as well as elements of their CSS and unique user interface features.\n\n\nPost calling for the assassination of President Ma Ying-jeou\nOn 20 March 2010, Taiwanese police investigated an Internet threat posted on plurk.com that called for the assassination of the President of the Republic of China, Ma Ying-jeou.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPlurk.com homepage",

She is best known for her leading role as Gail Stoney in Blackstone, for which she won the Gemini Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role in 2011, and her recurring roles as Sylvie LeBret in North of 60 and Deanna Martin in Arctic Air.\nThrush starred in the Palme d'Or and César award-nominated film Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian.\n\n\nEarly life\nThrush, who is Cree, was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, by parents who were chronic alcoholics. She recalls being called \"Squaw\" at Bowness High School and bullied because of her parents' illness. In grade nine she changed schools and attended Calgary's Plains Indian Cultural Survival School, where she felt accepted for the first time. Commenting on her experience at that school, she stated: \"There were other Native students there, and I learned so many wonderful things about myself, about my culture, about my language, about drumming and singing. They filled in a lot of the voids that my soul was just begging for.\"\nHer childhood hardships affected her profoundly. Though she acted in her first film at 17, it did not occur to her it could be a career. She planned to become a social worker and help children.  She met Gordon Tootoosis, a First Nations actor, who told her: \"If [acting] is what your heart wants, you need to follow it and be true.\" At this point her parents were sober. With no other ties to Calgary, at age 20 she moved to Vancouver and found an agent.\n\n\nCareer\nThrush has had a prolific career since its beginning in the 1980s.  She began her acting career in film while attending high school. She got her first theatre job when she moved to Vancouver at age 20. She had a small part in the play The Ecstasy of Rita Joe. She portrayed numerous recurring and guest roles in the television series Madison, Northern Exposure, North of 60, Highlander, Forever Knight, Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy, Moccasin Flats and Mixed Blessings.\nShe has starred in many notable films throughout her career, particularly in films that deal with issues about indigenous peoples of the Americas, ranging from Canadian Aboriginals to Native Americans/American Indians (U.S.). These include Isaac Littlefeathers, Unnatural & Accidental, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Skins, Dead Man, Dreamkeeper and Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian.\nIn 2011, Thrush wrote the one-woman play Find Your Own Inner Elder. She has performed the show, most often under the title Inner Elder, across Canada. It premiered at One Yellow Rabbit's High Performance Rodeo in Calgary in 2018 and has since been performed with Nightwood Theatre and Native Earth Performing Arts in Toronto (2019). Inner Elder is a structured monologue which recounts Thrush's personal life and experiences.\nHer daughter, Imajyn Cardinal, is also an actress.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMichelle Thrush at IMDb",

Once Marshal López was made aware of the Brazilian attack, he sent his personal escort of about 150 riders under the command of Colonel Felipe Toledo as reinforcements.\nThe reinforcements landed through a steamer and three small boats. The battle was quick.

    "text": "The Ministry of Justice of Cameroon is the Department responsible for administering the Cameroon justice system. As of May 2004, the Minister of State for Justice was Amadou Ali. The legal system in the Cameroon is complex with a constitution developed in 1972 and revised in 1996 as well as elements of the Code Napoleon, Common Law and customary law. In early 2005, the Ministry of Justice became responsible for administering the prison system due to unrest in the prisons. The Ministry of Justice also has a shared responsibility for administering human rights in the Cameroon. There have been serious allegations about use of torture by police and military officials in the Cameroon.\n\n\nAdministration of justice\nThe Constitution of Cameroon provides that the Supreme Court of Cameroon is the highest court existing in the country. In addition, the country has appeal courts, circuit courts and magistrates courts. The Supreme Court is located in Yaoundé as is the Cameroon High Court of Justice consisting of nine titular judges and six surrogate judges and The Constitutional Council of Cameroon, consisting of eleven Judges with three nominated by the President of Cameroon, three nominated by the President of the Senate, three others nominated by the Speaker of the National Assembly and two by the Higher Judicial Council. All of these nominations are forwarded to the President of the republic who appoints them by decree. Other courts are located throughout the country.\nThe constitution provides for a Constitutional Council responsible for ensuring the Constitutionality of laws. The Supreme Court carried out this duty before its creation in 2018. Cameroon claims that the judiciary is independent from the executive and the legislature. However, the US State Department claims that the judiciary is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and that the Supreme Court can only consider a constitutional matter when referred to it by the President of Cameroon, 1/3 of the Members of the Cameroonian National Assembly or 1/3 of the Members of the Senate of Cameroon. The Supreme Court is responsible for adjudicating disputes between the president and the National Assembly.\nThe President of the Cameroon in his capacity as President of the Higher Judicial Council of Cameroon is responsible for appointing judges and also has the power to dismiss them. The Higher Judicial Council of Cameroon advises him on the nomination of judges and magistrates and has responsibility for judicial discipline.\nThe Parliamentary Court of Justice is responsible for judging acts by the President in cases where he or she has been accused of high treason. This Court also has responsibility for judging acts by the Prime Minister of the Cameroon, other members of the Government and other senior officials in cases relevant to state security.\n\n\nLegal traditions\nPrior to independence, jurisdiction over Cameroon was shared between the United Kingdom and France under a League of Nations mandate issued in 1919. The northern part of the British area became part of Nigeria while the Christian southern part joined with the French area. As a consequence, the country inherited a dual legal system including parts of the Code Napoleon and the common law. However, on 12 July 2005 the National Assembly (Assemblé Nationale) approved a law to harmonize the country's criminal procedure code.\nIn addition, traditional courts still play a significant role in domestic, property and probate. The court system honours tribal laws and customs when these do not conflict with national laws.\n\n\nPrison system\nThe Ministry of Justice became responsible for administering the prison system at the beginning of 2005 taking over responsibility from the Ministry of Territorial Administration of Cameroon. This follows disturbances caused by overcrowding of prisons and long stays in detention without charges of prisons.\nThere were 15,903 people in the prison system as of 1997 representing 115 per 100,000 population. However, the population of the prisons has grown rapidly in recent years. The New Bell prison in Douala was meant to hold 800 inmates but holds 3,100. The International Centre for Prison Studies estimates that Cameroon has the second highest occupancy rate in the world after Barbados with approximately half awaiting trial.\nThe Government has built two new prisons but has not provided enough staff resulting in the establishment of \"anti-gangs\" of \ninmates to preserve order.\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe preamble of the constitution adopted in 1996 incorporates parts of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Ministry of Justice shares responsibility for administering human rights with the Ministry of Territorial Administration.\nA person who considers that their rights may have been violated may take their case either to the statutory courts or to the traditional courts. They may also petition the National Committee on Human Rights and Freedoms established in 1990. They may also seek compensation through the courts. If a person is acquitted, discharged or has been wrongfully held in custody, they are not entitled to compensation unless they can prove that the judge was wrong or the system did not function properly.\nThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights held hearings in 2003 into allegations of torture by the police and the military. The major area of concern was the prison network although it has been acknowledged that Cameroon had made some progress in improving its human rights performance.\n\n\nList of ministers\nCharles Okala (1959-1960)\nVictor Kanga (1960-1961)\nEmmanuel Egbe Tabi (1961-1968), co-minister\nMohaman Lamine (1961), co-minister\nArouna Njoya (1961-1965)\nSanda Oumarou (1965-1971)\nFélix Sabal Lecco (1971-1972)\nSimon Achidi Achu (1972-1975)\nJoseph Charles Doumba (1975-1979)\nGilbert Andze Tchoungui (1979-1983)\nAndré Ngongang Ouandji (1983-1985)\nBenjamin Itoe (1985-1989)\nAdolphe Moudiki (1989-1991)\nKuntz Douala Moutome (1991-1996)\nLaurent Esso (1996-2000)\nRobert Mbella Mbappe (2000-2001)\nAmadou Ali (2001-2011)\nLaurent Esso (2011–present)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nUS State Department Bureau of African Affairs January 2005\nIRIN News Report on behalf of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on recent prison riots in Cameroon\nReport of United Nations Committee against Torture\nUnited Nations Human Rights Instrument for Cameroon 2000",

    "text": "Robert Christopher Tytler (25 September 1818 – 10 September 1872) was a British soldier, naturalist and photographer. His second wife Harriet C. Tytler is well known for her work in photographing and documenting the monuments of Delhi and for her notes at the time of the 1857 revolt in India. Mount Harriet in the Andamans was named after her. A species of bird, Tytler's leaf warbler, is named after him.\n\n\nBiography\nHis father, Robert Tytler (18 Nov 1787 – 17 March 1838, Gwalior), served as a surgeon in the Bengal Native Infantry and his mother, Elizabeth Schneeburg (1782–1852) was the daughter of a German count. Tytler joined the Bengal army in 1834 after going to Leith High School in Edinburgh, and arrived in India in 1835 to join his father's regiment, the 34th Bengal Native Infantry.\nHe saw many years of active military service in India, and in 1842 he was promoted to baggage-master. He later became interpreter and quartermaster and took part in the actions of the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42).\nIn the first Anglo-Sikh War (1845–46), Tytler was put in charge of the campaign funds, and subsequently moved all over northern India with his regiment.\nIn May 1857, at the beginning of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Tytler was present when the sepoys of his own unit mutinied against their British officers at Delhi, where he later played a conspicuous part in the ensuing siege. He and his wife were among the important photographers present in the aftermath of Indian Mutiny of 1857, which included Felice Beato and Charles Shepard, during the time he took the notable last image of last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar II. He was eventually promoted to Colonel and appointed officiating Superintendent of the Convict Settlement at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands from April 1862 to February 1864. Tytler's short service here was due to the murder of an English sailor and the subsequent turn of events. Tytler's predecessor Colonel J.C. Haughton who replaced J.P. Walker had restored peace after the violent clashes with the Andamanese (including the so-called Battle of Aberdeen). To maintain the peace Tytler had continued a policy of sending small parties of sailors to the Andamanese habitations. On one such visit, a sailor named Pratt had attempted to rape an Andamanese woman and two natives killed him in an ensuing fight. Tytler heard a version from other sailors and sought to take revenge on the Andaman tribals and eventually the two suspects were caught. The Government of India was unhappy with Tytler's actions and noted that \"if when the unfortunate seaman was shot, two or three of the Natives had been instantly seized as hostages instead of indiscriminate fire being begun upon a party of savages among whom women were present, the interest of humanity and civilisation would have been better consulted.\" When the two suspects who were nicknamed Snowball and Jumbo were captured in February 1863, it became clear that the fault had been with Pratt. The two were eventually released and Jumbo's wife (nicknamed Topsy) visited the prisoners and helped convince the other Andamanese that the men had been kept unharmed. These results convinced Tytler and Rev Henry Fisher Corbyn to set up a Home for the Andamanese with the aim of \"civilising\" them. While posted in the Andamans in 1858, he introduced 25 red avadavats into the wild in Port Blair, but the birds died out.\nHis first wife, Isabella née Neilson, whom he married in 1843 died aged 21 in 1847. In the following year on Tytler married Harriet Christina Earle (3 October 1828 – 24 November 1907), daughter of an officer in the 3rd Bengal Native Infantry. She had an interest in photography, which she learnt from Dr John Murray and Felice Beato. Shortly after the 1857 rebellion, Harriet who made a narrow escape had a son who was named Stanley Delhi-Force. Today Tytler and his wife are remembered mostly for their photographic work. Together they produced about 300 photographs, some of which formed large panoramas.\nHarriet wrote several memoirs when she was between 75 and 77 years old (1903-6). These include \"An Englishwoman in India; the memoirs of Harriet Tytler 1828-1858\" first published in Chambers Journal in 1931 and a more detailed version published in 1986 by Oxford University Press.\nTytler was a keen naturalist, and took an interest particularly in the birds (many of his notes were communicated to Allan Octavian Hume) but also collected amphibians and reptiles. In one communication to Hume he wrote to claim priority on the discovery of the rufous-rumped grassbird:\n\nI shot these birds at Dacca in 1852, and sent a description and a drawing of them to Mr. Blyth. They were named after my esteemed friend Jules Verreaux, of Paris. They are not uncommon at Dacca in grass-jungle. I think the bird Dr. Jerdon gives in his Birds of India as Graminicola bengalensis, No. 542, p. 177, vol. ii., is meant for this species. The genus Graminicola, under which he places this bird, appears to be a genus of Dr. Jerdon's own, for it is not in Gray's 'Genera and Subgenera of Birds in the British Museum,' printed in 1855. If it is the same bird as Dr. Jerdon's, then my name, which I communicated in 1851-52 not only to Mr. Blyth but also to Prince Bonaparte and M. Jules Verreaux, and which was published in my Fauna of Dacca, has, it seems to me, the priority.\nTytler lived for a while in Shimla at Bonnie Moon on Jakko Hill. Here he established a museum with collections of birds, shells, geological specimens, manuscripts and other exhibits from around India. Lord Mayo placed him in the Home department so as to run this public museum which was closed when he died in 1872. He had suffered for almost eight years and showed symptoms of arsenic poisoning. Harriet Tytler offered to gift the ornithological collections to Shimla but the collection which was packed into boxes eventually came into the possession of a Mr B. Bevan-Petman who passed it on to the Lahore Central Museum in 1917. The boxes were examined in 1918 by Hugh Whistler and only about 2500 specimens could be salvaged, the rest destroyed by moulds and beetles. Harriet also established North Stoneham house known as Mayo Industrial School in 1869 which was then bought in 1872 by a trust and made later into a school for girls. Tytler introduced several species of birds into the Andamans including common mynas, jungle mynas and peafowl.\nTytler's son, Major-General Sir Harry Tytler, followed his father into the Indian Army and was also a prominent naturalist.\n\n\nEponyms\nSpecies named for him include Tytler's mabuya, Eutropis tytleri, a skink; Rana tytleri and Hylarana tytleri, both frogs; Tytler's leaf warbler Phylloscopus tytleri; and an Asian subspecies of the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica tytleri.\nMount Harriet in the Andamans was named after his wife.

Diplomatic and consular relations between India and Republic of Macedonia were established on 9 February 1995. \nthe Republic of Macedonia appointed an Indian businessman in New Delhi to serve as Republic of Macedonia's Honorary Consul in 2006. The Embassy of Republic of Macedonia in New Delhi was opened on 7 October 2008. The Embassy was registered under the country's former constitutional name of Republic of Macedonia, rather than its United Nations reference, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. India had officially referred to the country as the Republic of Macedonia, despite objection from Greece, before the Prespa agreement. North Macedonia appointed an Honorary Consul in Kolkata in 2009, and subsequently appointed Honorary Consuls in Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore. India appointed an Honorary Consul in Republic of Macedonia in 2008. The Embassy of India in Sofia, Bulgaria is jointly accredited to Republic of Macedonia.\nForeign Minister of Republic of Macedonia Antonio Milososki visited India in January 2009, becoming the first government official of Republic of Macedonia to visit the country. Prime Minister of Republic of Macedonia Nikola Gruevski, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Zoran Stavreski and several other ministers, visited India in March 2012 becoming the first Prime Minister of Republic of Macedonia to visit the country. Stavreski, and several other ministers, visited the country again in October 2012. Gruevski, Stavreski and other ministers visited the country again in January 2015 to attend the Vibrant Gujarat and CII-Partnership Summits. National Assembly President Trajko Veljanoski led a parliamentary delegation on a visit to India in March 2013. Foreign Minister of North Macedonia Nikola Poposki visited New Delhi and Agra in December 2013. The two countries signed a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement and an MoU on Cooperation between the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia and the Foreign Service Institute during the visit on 17 December.\nFrom India, the highest level visits to North Macedonia have been at the level of minister of state. Minister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur, and a CII business delegation, visited North Macedonia on 10–11 July 2012 becoming the first Indian minister to visit the country. Kaur met with Foreign Minister Nikola Poposki, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Zoran Stavrevski, and Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Policy Antonio Milososki.\nCitizens of North Macedonia are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.

    "text": "Who We Are and How We Got Here is a 2018 book on the contribution of genome-wide ancient DNA research to human population genetics by the geneticist David Reich. He describes discoveries made by his group and others, based on analysis and comparison of ancient and modern DNA from human populations around the world. Central to these is the finding that almost all human populations are mixtures resulting from multiple population migrations and gene flow.\nSeveral reviewers have praised the book for clearly describing pioneering work in a cutting-edge field of study. It has been criticized by numerous scientists and scholars for its handling of race, though other commentators observe that nothing it says should give racists any comfort.\n\n\nContext\nDavid Reich is a geneticist who has studied ancient human genomes, comparing their patterns of mutations to discover which populations migrated and mixed throughout prehistory. He was mentored by the population geneticist Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who from 1960 pioneered the attempt to match the study of human prehistory by archaeology and linguistics, using the limited genetic data available at that time.\n\n\nPublication\nThe book was published by Oxford University Press in 2018. Although it is credited to David Reich alone, he explains in the acknowledgements that the book grew from a detailed collaboration with his wife Eugenie Reich.\nThe book is illustrated with monochrome maps, diagrams, and timelines. There are no photographs.\n\n\nSummary\nSince 2010, population geneticists have been able to sequence ancient human DNA, recovering complete genomes, in contrast to earlier approaches which relied on the far more abundant (and hence more easily recovered) mitochondrial DNA, which is present in many copies in each cell, and transmitted only via the maternal line. That early work gave what Reich calls the \"exciting\" result that all modern humans are related to \"Mitochondrial Eve\", a woman who lived in Africa only about 160,000 years ago.\nThe whole genome recovery technique, using the especially hard bone from the inner ear of ancient skeletons — along with the genomes of modern people from different parts of the world, including especially some isolated human populations — has made it possible to reconstruct prehistoric migrations and mixing of populations in the past 5,000 years, and to make reliable inferences about mixtures from much further back in time. Reich's laboratory at Harvard Medical School has led to an industrialisation of ancient genome recovery and this new knowledge from genomics has overthrown many old assumptions about human origins.\nThe book is in three parts, the first dealing with the background to what he calls the ancient DNA revolution as well as the interbreeding between archaic and modern humans, the second dealing with the role that this revolution has in illuminating the constituents of various current major populations and a final section looking at the implications of the new techniques.\n\n\nHuman Migrations\n\nThe second section of the book focusses on various large human migrations. Reich observes that migrations and population mixtures similar to the spread of Indo-European languages characterise human prehistory on all continents.\nMuch of the work has focused on Western Eurasia, where in 1786 Sir William Jones discovered that Sanskrit and ancient Greek were related languages. Linguists came to recognise the Indo-European family of languages, spanning Germanic, Celtic, Italic, Iranian and northern Indian languages, but without explaining how these came to be. Reich showed that modern populations in Europe and north India derive from mixing of native populations with Yamnaya people from the steppes north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea some 5,000 years ago, in separate migrations to the west and the east. Corded ware culture described by archaeology corresponds to a stage in the westward migration.  In the book, Reich disputed the idea that Indo-European languages originated in Anatolia due to a lack of genetic similarity with the steppe Yamnaya culture, instead suggesting the languages may have originated south of the Caucasus, in present-day Iran or Armenia and spit into two branches with one going to the steppe and one to Anatolia.\nReich shows that people in Japan and Korea share some 80% of their DNA, implying migration; Polynesians migrated relatively recently, in just the past few thousand years, from the region of Taiwan. The evidence can upset long-held beliefs: Native American skeletons from 10,000 years ago do not appear to be related to the tribes living in those regions today who have been asking for the ancient bones to be returned to them for burial.\nReich argues that genetic evidence showed that West Asian geneflow into modern populations in Ethiopia and Somalia, particularly speakers of Afroasiatic languages, could support a diffusion of these languages from the Middle East.\nThe anthropologist John Hawks, writing in the Wall Street Journal, observes that Reich was surprised that the \"concordance of near-mythological history with genetic fact\" in the migrations in India was \"a potential political bombshell\"; he notes that Reich avoided it by not talking about \"Indo-European invaders at all\", writing only that \"No group in India can claim genetic purity\".\n\n\nReception\nThe author and intellectual Jared Diamond, in the New York Times, notes that geneticists can now go far beyond studying the personal ancestries of participants in National Geographic's Genographic Project, which looked at small sections of their parents' DNA, namely their mother's mitochondrial DNA and their father's Y chromosome. By looking at DNA from ancient bones, Reich can recover whole genomes. Diamond warns readers not to expect an oversimplified story:\n\nPopulation genetics is a complicated, fast-moving field with many uncertainties of interpretation. To tell that story to the broad public, and not just to scientists reading specialty journals, is a big challenge. Reich explains these complications as well as any geneticist could; others rarely even try.\nClive Cookson, in the Financial Times, writes that one of the first and most surprising impacts of genomics is in human prehistory, and Reich is the first leading practitioner to write a popular book about this. Cookson calls the book\n\na marvelous synthesis of the field: the technology for purifying and decoding DNA from old bones; what the findings tell us about the origins and movements of people on every inhabited continent; and the ethical and political implications of the research.\n\nThe archaeologist and geneticist Turi King, in Nature, writes that Reich's laboratory \"has developed some of the most sophisticated statistical and bioinformatics techniques available. Using computers, they painstakingly reconstruct genomic information from fragments of DNA from ancient individuals. They then drill down in search of a new understanding of human history.\" King notes that Reich's group helped to show that \"Neanderthals interbred with the ancestors of all modern humans descended from Europeans, Asians and other non-Africans.\" Their work is showing the \"tremendous degree to which populations globally are blended, repeatedly, over generations.\"\n\nA review by Razib Khan, who is cited in the book, recommends the book to a wide audience, stating that it \"catches [one] up to the state-of-the-art knowledge that we have in terms of human history, deep and prehistoric.\" He includes experts in that audience: \"I’ve talked to plenty of people who work in evolutionary genomics who are not totally up-to-speed on the ancient DNA revolution. They too would benefit from reading Who We Are and How We Got Here front to back. I know people who work in the field of cultural evolution, who would also benefit from reading Who We Are and How We Got Here. I know behavior geneticists who would benefit from reading Who We Are and How We Got Here. And so forth.\" Khan concedes that the book \"is not rich with the same stylistic flourish and engagement as one might find in a popularization by Steven Pinker or Richard Dawkins\" but that it is a \"serious book that is earnest in focusing on the substance of the science first.\"\nThe paleogenomics researcher María C. Ávila Arcos, reviewing the book in Science magazine, writes that \"troubling traces of biocolonialism undermine an otherwise eloquent synthesis of ancient genome research.\" She calls Reich's account graceful, combining his personal opinions with \"hard science\" (Reich's phrase). She accepts that the book is \"scientifically solid and comprehensive\",  but argues that it \"raises some concerns\",  since in her view Reich overlooks the conflict of interest between the needs of researchers to gather ancient human DNA specimens and the rights of the often marginalised populations that descend from those ancestors.\nThe anthropologist John Hawks, writing in the Wall Street Journal, views Reich as \"a contradiction: Rising to the pinnacle of human genetics, he nonetheless exhibits incredible naiveté\" in affairs such as when German scientists withdrew from a paper that seemed to them \"uncomfortably close to pre-Nazi racial theories\", or when Native American specimen donors wished to limit the use of their DNA. Hawks argues that science needs to help people to see the humanity of the dead ancestors, and finds Reich's approach potentially dehumanizing.\nThe scholar of humanities Barry Wood writes that the book is \"densely-packed\", not sparing on explanations of advanced techniques, but allowing the determined reader to grasp the methods of genomic analysis. He comments that the \"tradeoff\" for this detail is \"a certain lack of continuity\". He notes that Reich argues that migration is what his analysis illuminates best, but comments that Reich's discrete studies of human migrations do not yet add up to \"a sequential narrative of the peopling of the earth\".\nThe archaeologist Daniela Hofmann describes the book as clear and accessible, but calls Reich \"not shy of controversy\"; she states that the book is \"very much an advertisement for Reich's research agenda\" and \"unashamedly partial\".\n\n\nHow Not To Talk About Race And Genetics\nAn open letter titled \"How Not To Talk About Race And Genetics\" by a group of 67 scientists and scholars criticizes Reich's use of the term \"race\" in this book. The group welcomes Reich's challenge to the \"misrepresentations about race and genetics\" made by the science writer Nicholas Wade and the molecular biologist James Watson, but warns that his skill with genomics \"should not be confused with a mastery of the cultural, political, and biological meanings of human groups.\" \nAccording to computational biologist Hussein Mohsen, Reich's examples \"conflated ancestry with race, relied on the quantitative reductionism of averages, and failed to address the everyday ramifications of pathologizing socially constructed (racial or ancestral) categories to which millions of human beings belong or were historically forced to.\" In contrast to Reich's analysis, Mohsen cites the open letter as an accurate representation of \"the complexity of the race concept and stark limitations of quantitative genetics to grasp its fluid histories.\"\nThe economist Tyler Cowen calls the book \"truly excellent, readable and informative\". Cowen insists it is \"a science book, not a 'race book'\", stating that although it has engendered \"some public controversy\", he is confident that no attentive reader could feel \"affirmed in racist beliefs\".\nPeter Forbes, in The Guardian, calls the book \"thrilling in its clarity and its scope.\" In Forbes's view, Reich handles racist abuses of human origin stories, such as Nazi ideology, \"commendably\". Forbes writes that Reich explains how ancient DNA teaches a single general lesson, that the human population of any particular place has repeatedly changed since the last ice age. Any supposed \"mystical, longstanding\" link between some people and a place based on some kind of racial purity (as reflected in the Nazi slogan of \"blood and soil\"), is in Reich's words \"flying in the face of hard science\".\nClive Cookson, in the Financial Times,  notes that Reich dismisses worries that DNA evidence of differences between populations is \"racism in genetic clothing\", and that on the contrary, the \"unsuspected degree of mixing\" in every part of human history makes old ideas of racial purity \"absurd\".\nThe archaeologist and geneticist Turi King, in Nature, notes that Reich reflects on the dangers of misinterpretation by racists, who \"pick and choose results\", or others who opt to \"sweep [genetic] differences under the carpet\". But, King argues, echoing Reich, we do need \"a non-loaded way to talk about genetic diversity and similarities in populations\", and Reich has begun to do that.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nReich, David (2018).

He describes discoveries made by his group and others, based on analysis and comparison of ancient and modern DNA from human populations around the world. Central to these is the finding that almost all human populations are mixtures resulting from multiple population migrations and gene flow.\nSeveral reviewers have praised the book for clearly describing pioneering work in a cutting-edge field of study. It has been criticized by numerous scientists and scholars for its handling of race, though other commentators observe that nothing it says should give racists any comfort.",

    "text": "In theoretical physics, compactification means changing a theory with respect to one of its space-time dimensions. Instead of having a theory with this dimension being infinite, one changes the theory so that this dimension has a finite length, and may also be periodic.\nCompactification plays an important part in thermal field theory where one compactifies time, in string theory where one compactifies the extra dimensions of the theory, and in two- or one-dimensional solid state physics, where one considers a system which is limited in one of the three usual spatial dimensions.\nAt the limit where the size of the compact dimension goes to zero, no fields depend on this extra dimension, and the theory is dimensionally reduced.\n\n\nIn string theory\nIn string theory, compactification is a generalization of Kaluza–Klein theory. It tries to reconcile the gap between the conception of our universe based on its four observable dimensions with the ten, eleven, or twenty-six dimensions which theoretical equations lead us to suppose the universe is made with.\nFor this purpose it is assumed the extra dimensions are \"wrapped\" up on themselves, or \"curled\" up on Calabi–Yau spaces, or on orbifolds. Models in which the compact directions support fluxes are known as flux compactifications. The coupling constant of string theory, which determines the probability of strings splitting and reconnecting, can be described by a field called a dilaton. This in turn can be described as the size of an extra (eleventh) dimension which is compact. In this way, the ten-dimensional type IIA string theory can be described as the compactification of M-theory in eleven dimensions. Furthermore, different versions of string theory are related by different compactifications in a procedure known as T-duality.\nThe formulation of more precise versions of the meaning of compactification in this context has been promoted by discoveries such as the mysterious duality.\n\n\nFlux compactification\nA flux compactification is a particular way to deal with additional dimensions required by string theory.\nIt assumes that the shape of the internal manifold is a Calabi–Yau manifold or  generalized Calabi–Yau manifold which is equipped with non-zero values of fluxes, i.e. differential forms, that generalize the concept of an electromagnetic field (see p-form electrodynamics).\nThe hypothetical concept of the anthropic landscape in string theory follows from a large number of possibilities in which the integers that characterize the fluxes can be chosen without violating rules of string theory. The flux compactifications can be described as F-theory vacua or type IIB string theory vacua with or without D-branes.\n\n\nSee also\nDimensional reduction\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nChapter 16 of Michael Green, John H.

    "title": "Bentley Colliery",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=58103824",
    "text": "Bentley Colliery was a coal mine in Bentley, near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England, that operated between 1906 and 1993. In common with many other mines, it suffered disasters and accidents. The worst Bentley disaster was in 1931, when 45 miners were killed after a gas explosion. The site of the mine has been converted into a woodland.\n\n\nHistory\nWith profits earned from their Nottinghamshire pits, the Barber, Walker & Company initiated some exploratory boreholes in the Bentley area in the late 19th century. Further investigations were carried out in 1902 and in 1903, when several sites had boreholes driven into them to test for coal reserves. Despite hitting quicksand and extremes of flooding, what would become the main mine shaft was sunk in 1906, although coaling did not become possible until 1908. However, due to the bad geological foundations that the pit head was built upon, between 1910–1911 a re-inforced concrete headstock and pit shaft were installed above Shaft No. 1 to a depth of 45 feet (14 m) below ground and 14 feet (4.3 m) above. The design was relatively new to Britain and the materials were rolled steel and ferro-concrete.\nThe initial workforce at Bentley were those already in the employ of Barber, Walker and Company, who had been tempted away from their pits at Watnall and High Park in Nottinghamshire. Additionally, the local area could not supply enough men to work in the mine, so many moved into the area from outside the region and the company built Bentley New Village (which still exists) to accommodate all the workers. The new village had a school, football club (Bentley Colliery FC) and a cricket club.\nBy 1910, employees at the mine numbered 1,000; this had risen considerably during the pre-nationalisation era when the average number of workers at the mine between 1933 and 1947 was just under 3,000. The mine recorded its best year of production in 1924, when over 1,200,000 tonnes (1,300,000 tons) of coal was brought to the surface.\nThe colliery (and the Barnsley Seam in general) always had problems with methane gas being released during the mining process. Despite having one of the best ventilation systems in the mining industry at the time, the mine was beset by accidents and faced closures because of safety reasons. Many of the miners who worked there were uneasy about the situation. In 1939, the mine was second only to nearby Rossington Colliery in using diesel-powered flameproof locomotives for the movement of men, materials, and coal underground. Hand getting of coal had stopped by 1945 and the process was fully mechanised by the late 1960s.\nThe miners from Bentley went on strike during the 1984–1985 Miners' Strike. They also had sporadic incidents of strikes in 1988 after management accused three developmental miners of not making sufficient progress. Within three days, twelve South Yorkshire pits had ceased work with 10,000 miners on strike. The colliery manager wrote to all the miners stating that the dispute could only be resolved once the pit was back at full production. The following day, seventeen pits in South Yorkshire and two in North Yorkshire were on strike. The miners were all persuaded to return to work, but another stoppage a week later occurred when ten miners were threatened with dismissal after video footage had been studied from the previous strike with those miners accused of flying pickets.\nIn 1993, the mine was selected for closure by British Coal. The mine closed in December 1993, with the loss of 450 jobs. All surface buildings, including the headstocks, were demolished by 1995.\nIn 1998, the site was remediated and handed over to the Land Trust. It was converted into a woodland in 2004 and is now open to the public as the Bentley Community Woodland.\n\n\nBentley Colliery Disaster\n\nAt 5:45 pm on 20 November 1931, firedamp was ignited in the North East Colliery Face of the mine which caused roof falls preventing the men from reaching the shaft and the pit-head. After the explosion there was another inrush of gas which starved oxygen from the air. As news of the disaster spread, a crowd of over 2,000 people gather at the pit head to wait for news. Four men went down the pit wearing breathing apparatus and had to carry the injured over 2 miles (3.2 km) to get them to safety. For their bravery, they were all awarded the Edward Medal with eight in total being presented in the aftermath of the disaster. An inquest was opened up at the colliery two days later. The mines department also held an inquiry between 29 December 1931 and 6 January 1932, which lists 43 dead, not 45. Modern accounts have decided that the final death toll was 45, though five of the bodies could not be recovered.\n\n\nOther accidents\nOn 12 February 1912, three men died and a further six were badly burned when there was an explosion underground.\nIn 1974, a fire occurred in the Barnsley Seam and that area was sealed off. Fortunately, it was possible to develop new faces in other seams.\nOn 21 November 1978, a paddy train conveying miners to and from the coal face derailed after it ran away on a downhill gradient and killed seven men with a further seventeen injured. A memorial service is conducted on the Sunday nearest to 20 November each year to commemorate those who died in the 1931 and 1978 disasters.\n\n\nFurther reading\nElliott, Brian (2009).

Older sister Heather (Hannah Lochner) is having trouble coming to terms with her mother's death, and Tess begins to wonder if it was Heather herself who killed her mother, and travels with her back to Canada to discover the truth.\nChild of Mine attracted 6.25 million viewers on its debut broadcast. Child of Mine was released on Region 1 DVD in the United States on 8 September 2006 via Koch Vision.\n\n\nPlot\nLondon couple Tess and Alfie Palmer cannot have their own children. They adopt two girls who are orphans from a Canadian, non-state-recognised placement agency. The mother of the children was murdered two years ago. Four-year-old Grace looks carefree, bright and fun-loving, whereas ten-year-old Heather is more depressed and serious. As time goes on, Heather proves stubborn and even violent. But adoptive mother Tess does not despair, as her training as a child psychologist leads her to believe that Heather appears to have a secret. Therapy talks with a colleague bring no progress, so she decides on a daring venture - a return to the scene of the crime in the hope of getting Heather to talk. She now considers it a possibility that Heather could have murdered her own mother.\nTess travels to Canada with Heather, and decides they should visit the empty house of Heather's mother, which proves very uncomfortable for Heather. Nevertheless, she begins to describe the scene with tears to Tess. During the subsequent short visit to the adoption agency, Heather recognises the culprit by means of a gesture. It is the owner of the agency, Alvin. Meanwhile, in an unattended moment, Tess rummages through a number of files. Astonishingly, each file consistently includes the note that the parent of the child being mediated is dead. Tess becomes suspicious. When the police sheriff arrives to interview him, Alvin shoots him dead. He also wants to eliminate Tess and Heather as witnesses. But Tess proves defensive, using the weapon used to kill the sheriff to injure Alvin and put him out of action, allowing her and Heather to escape.\n\n\nCast\nJoanne Whalley as Tess Palmer\nAdrian Dunbar as Alfie Palmer\nHannah Lochner as Heather McGill\nStevie Gillespie as Grace McGill\nStacey Zurburg as Jane McGill\nTravis McConnell as Stf.

    "text": "The New Hampshire Provincial Regiment was a  provincial military regiment made up of men from the New Hampshire Militia during the French and Indian War for service with the British Army in North America. It was first formed in 1754 with the start of hostilities with France.\n\n\n1755\nIn 1755 Col. Joseph Blanchard was given command, and the regiment sent a company under Robert Rogers to build Fort Wentworth on the upper reaches of the Connecticut River before joining Sir William Johnson's army at Fort Edward in New York. During the Battle of Lake George, Col. Blanchard was in command at Fort Edward. When he heard the battle commence and saw the smoke of burning ox-carts he sent a company under Nathaniel Folsom to reinforce Sir William Johnson's army 14 miles (23 km) away. Capt. Folsom's company was able to capture the French baggage train and the French commanding officer Jean Erdman, Baron Dieskau, as the French and Indian forces tried to disengage from Sir William Johnson's main force. After the battle a second battalion was raised under the command of Col. Peter Gilman and sent to reinforce the army at Lake George. Both battalions left Fort Edward in December to return home to New Hampshire except for Robert Rogers' ranger company that stayed behind as part of the winter garrison.\n\n\n1756\nIn the spring of 1756 two more battalions were raised, with Col. Nathaniel Meserve in command. The 1st battalion was sent to Nova Scotia and the 2nd to the newly built Fort William Henry.\n\n\n1757\nFor the 1757 campaign two more battalions were raised. The 1st would again go to Halifax and the 2nd battalion under the command of Lt. Col John Goffe to Fort William Henery. Of the 200 men from the New Hampshire Provincial Regiment at Fort William Henry 80 were killed in the siege and massacre that followed. With the 1st battalion in Nova Scotia and the 2nd battalion regrouping at Fort Edward a new 3rd battalion of infantry with two attached companies of Dragoons was quickly raised under the command of Maj. Thomas Tash and sent to Fort at Number 4 to protect the western frontier of the state.\n\n\n1758\nFor the 1758 campaign again two battalions were raised. The 1st under Col. John Hart would join General Jeffrey Amherst in the capture of Fortress Louisbourg and the 2nd under Lt Col. Goffe was sent to join Gen. James Abercrombie in the defeat at the Battle of Carillon. The regiment and the attached rangers stayed on the flanks during the main assault and covered the retreat of the British Army preventing a complete disaster.\n\n\n1759 & 1760\nIn 1759 the 1st Battalion went with Gen. James Wolfe to Quebec City and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham serving in a support role followed by the Battle of Sainte-Foy and the subsequent siege of Quebec. Meanwhile, the 2nd battalion was with Gen. Amherst at the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Fort St. Frédéric, driving the French from the Lake Champlain valley. In 1760, with the continuation of the 1759 Lake Champlain campaign, Col. Goffe commanded the New Hampshire troops who built the Crown Point Military Road from the Fort at Number 4 to the new English fort at Crown Point in forty days during the spring and at the Siege of Montreal and the fall of New France later that year.\nIn 1759 one-third of all able-bodied males of military age in New Hampshire were serving in the British military.\n\n\n1762\nVolunteers from the regiment were with the British Army that captured Havana, Cuba, from the Spanish on August 10, 1762.\nOther notable members of the regiment were John Stark, William Stark, James Reed, Timothy Bedel, Isaac Wyman, Enoch Hale, Hercules Mooney and Abraham Drake. All of these men would go on to serve as officers during the American Revolutionary War.\n\n\nSources\nMontcalm and Wolfe: The French and Indian War by Francis Parkman, DeCapo Press, New York, New York 1995\nA People's Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years War by Fred Anderson, Univ. of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC 1984\nRedcoats, Yankees and Allies: A History of the Uniforms, Clothing and Gear of the British Army in the Lake George-Lake Champlain Corridor 1755–1760 by Brenton C.

    "text": "The Samaritan Pentateuch, also called the Samaritan Torah (Samaritan Hebrew: ‮ࠕࠦ‎‎‬ࠅࠓࠡࠄ‎, Tūrā), is the sacred scripture of the Samaritans. Written in the Samaritan script, it dates back to one of the ancient versions of the Torah that existed during the Second Temple period. It constitutes the entire biblical canon in Samaritanism.\nSome 6,000 differences exist between the Samaritan and the Jewish Masoretic Text. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly 2,000 of these textual variations agree with the Koine Greek Septuagint, and some are shared with the Latin Vulgate. Throughout their history, Samaritans have used translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek, and Arabic, as well as liturgical and exegetical works based upon it.\nIt first became known to the Western world in 1631, proving the first example of the Samaritan alphabet and sparking an intense theological debate regarding its relative age versus the Masoretic Text. This first published copy, much later labelled as Codex B by August Gall, became the source of most Western critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch until the latter half of the 20th century; today the codex is held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Some Pentateuchal manuscripts discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls have been identified as bearing a \"pre-Samaritan\" text type.\n\n\nOrigin and canonical significance\n\n\nSamaritan traditions\n\nSamaritans believe that God authored their Pentateuch and gave Moses the first copy along with the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments. They believe that they preserve this divinely composed text uncorrupted to the present day. Samaritans commonly refer to their Pentateuch as ࠒࠅࠔࠈࠄ‎ (Qušṭā, 'Truth').\nSamaritans include only the Pentateuch in their biblical canon. They do not recognize divine authorship or inspiration in any other book in the Jewish Tanakh. A Samaritan Book of Joshua partly based upon the Tanakh's Book of Joshua exists, but Samaritans regard it as a non-canonical secular historical chronicle.\nAccording to a view based on the biblical Book of Ezra (Ezra 4:11), the Samaritans are the people of Samaria who parted ways with the people of Judah (the Judahites) in the Persian period. The Samaritans believe that it was not them, but the Jews, who separated from the authentic stream of the Israelite tradition and law, around the time of Eli, in the 11th century BCE.\n\n\nScholarly perspective\nModern scholarship connects the formation of the Samaritan community with events which followed the Babylonian captivity. One view is that the Samaritans are the people of the Kingdom of Israel who separated from the Kingdom of Judah. Another view is that the event happened somewhere around 432 BCE, when Manasseh, the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, founded a community in Samaria, as related in the Book of Nehemiah 13:28 and Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus. Josephus, however, dates this event and the building of the temple at Shechem to the time of Alexander the Great. Others believe that the real schism between the peoples did not take place until Hasmonean times, when the Temple on Mount Gerizim was destroyed in 128 BCE by John Hyrcanus.\nThe script of the Samaritan Pentateuch, its close connections at many points with the Septuagint, and its even closer agreements with the present Masoretic Text, all suggest a date about 122 BCE. Excavation work undertaken since 1982 by Yitzhak Magen has firmly dated the temple structures on Gerizim to the middle of the 5th century BCE, built by Sanballat the Horonite, a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah, who lived more than 100 years before the Sanballat mentioned by Josephus.\nThe adoption of the Pentateuch as the sacred text of the Samaritans before their final schism with the Judean Jewish community provides evidence that it was already widely accepted as a canonical authority in that region.\n\n\nComparison with other versions\n\n\nMasoretic Text\n\nManuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch are written in a different script than the one used in the Masoretic Pentateuch. The Samaritan text is written with the Samaritan alphabet, derived from the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet used by the Israelite community prior to the Babylonian captivity. During the exile in Babylon, Jews adopted the Ashuri script, based on the Babylonians' Aramaic alphabet, which was developed into the modern Hebrew alphabet. Originally, all manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consisted of unvocalized text written using only the letters of the Samaritan alphabet. Beginning in the 12th century, some manuscripts show a partial vocalization resembling the Jewish Tiberian vocalization used in Masoretic manuscripts. More recently, manuscripts have been produced with full vocalization. The Samaritan Pentateuchal text is divided into 904 paragraphs. Divisions between sections of text are marked with various combinations of lines, dots or an asterisk; a dot is used to indicate the separation between words.\nThe London Polyglot lists 6,000 instances where the Samaritan Pentateuch differs from the Masoretic text. As different printed editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch are based upon different sets of manuscripts, the precise number varies significantly from one edition to another. Only a minority of such differences are significant. Most are simply spelling differences, usually concerning Hebrew letters of similar appearance; the use of more matres lectionis (symbols indicating vowels) in the Samaritan Pentateuch, compared with the Masoretic; different placement of words in a sentence; and the replacement of some verbal constructions with equivalent ones. A comparison between both versions shows a preference in the Samaritan version for the Hebrew preposition al where the Masoretic text has el.\nThe most notable substantial differences between both texts are those related to Mount Gerizim, the Samaritans' place of worship. The Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments includes the command that an altar be built on Mount Gerizim on which all sacrifices should be offered. The Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following paragraph, which is absent from the Jewish version:\n\nAnd when it so happens that LORD God brings you to the land of Canaan, which you are coming to possess, you shall set up there for you great stones and plaster them with plaster and you write on the stones all words of this law. And it becomes for you that across the Jordan you shall raise these stones, which I command you today, in mountain Gerizim. And you build there the altar to the LORD God of you. Altar of stones. Not you shall wave on them iron. With whole stones you shall build the altar to LORD God of you. And you bring on it ascend offerings to LORD God of you, and you sacrifice peace offerings, and you eat there and you rejoice before the face of the LORD God of you. The mountain this is across the Jordan behind the way of the rising of the sun, in the land of Canaan who is dwelling in the desert before the Galgal, beside Alvin-Mara, before Sechem.\nAnother important difference is in Deuteronomy 27:4. According to the Jewish text, the Israelites were told to enter the Promised Land and build an altar on Mount Ebal, while the Samaritan text says that such altar, the first built by the Israelites in the Promised Land, should be built on Mount Gerizim. A few verses afterwards, both the Jewish and the Samaritan texts contain instructions for the Israelites to perform two ceremonies upon entering the Promised Land: one of blessings, to be held on Mount Gerizim, and one of cursings, to take place on Mount Ebal. In 1946, the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, which include the oldest known versions of the Torah. In Deuteronomy 27:4–7, the Dead Sea scroll fragments bring \"Gerizim\" instead of \"Ebal\", indicating that the Samaritan version was likely the original reading.\nOther differences between the Samaritan and the Masoretic (Jewish) texts include:\n\nIn Numbers 12:1, the Samaritan Pentateuch refers to Moses' wife as kaashet, which translates as 'the beautiful woman', while the Jewish version and the Jewish commentaries suggest that the word used was Kushi, meaning 'black woman' or 'Cushite woman'. For the Samaritans, therefore, Moses had only one wife, Zipporah, throughout his whole life, while Jewish sources generally understand that Moses had two wives, Zipporah and a second, unnamed Cushite woman.\nThe Samaritan Pentateuch uses less anthropomorphic language in descriptions of God, with intermediaries performing actions that the Jewish version attributes directly to God. Where the Jewish text describes Yahweh as a \"man of war\" (Exodus 15:3), the Samaritan has \"hero of war\", a phrase applied to spiritual beings.\nIn Numbers 23:4, the Samaritan text reads \"The Angel of God found Balaam\", in contrast with the Jewish text, which reads \"And God met Balaam.\"\nIn Genesis 50:23, the Jewish text says that Joseph's grandchildren were born \"upon the knees of Joseph\", while the Samaritan text says they were born \"in the days of Joseph\".\nIn about 34 instances, the Samaritan Pentateuch has repetitions in one section of text that was also found in other parts of the Pentateuch. Such repetitions are also implied or presupposed in the Jewish text, but not explicitly recorded in it. For example, the Samaritan text in the Book of Exodus on multiple occasions records Moses repeating to Pharaoh exactly what God had previously instructed Moses to tell him, which makes the text look repetitious, in comparison with the Jewish text. In other occasions, the Samaritan Pentateuch has subjects, prepositions, particles, appositives, including the repetition of words and phrases within a single passage, that are absent from the Jewish text.\n\n\nSeptuagint and Latin Vulgate\nThe Samaritan Torah contains frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. The Septuagint text agrees with the Samaritan version in approximately 1,900 of the 6,000 instances in which it differs from the Masoretic text. Many of these agreements reflect inconsequential grammatical details, but some are significant. For example, Exodus 12:40 in both the Samaritan and the Septuagint reads:\n\nNow the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.\nIn the Masoretic text, the passage reads:\n\nNow the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\nPassages in the Latin Vulgate also show agreements with the Samaritan version, in contrast with the Masoretic version. For instance, in Genesis 22:2, the Samaritan Pentateuch places the binding and near-sacrifice of Isaac in the \"land of Moreh\" (Hebrew: מוראה), while the Jewish Pentateuch has \"land of Moriah\" (Hebrew: מריה). The Samaritan \"Moreh\" describes the region around Shechem and modern-day Nablus, where Mount Gerizim is situated, while Jews claim the land is the same as Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. The Vulgate translates this phrase as in terram visionis ('in the land of vision') which implies that Jerome was familiar with the reading 'Moreh', a Hebrew word whose triliteral root suggests 'vision.'\n\n\nEvaluations of its relevance for textual criticism\n\nThe earliest recorded assessments of the Samaritan Pentateuch are found in rabbinic literature and the writings of the early Christian Church Fathers of the first millennium. The Talmud records Eleazar ben Simeon, a Rabbinic Jew, condemning the Samaritan scribes: \"You have falsified your Pentateuch... and you have not profited aught by it.\"\nSome early Christian writers found the Samaritan Pentateuch useful for textual criticism. Cyril of Alexandria, Procopius of Gaza, and others spoke of certain words missing from the Hebrew Text but present in the Samaritan Pentateuch. Eusebius writes the \"Greek translation [of the Bible] also differs from the Hebrew, though not so much from the Samaritan\" and notes that the Septuagint agrees with the Samaritan Pentateuch in the number of years elapsed from Noah's Flood to Abraham. Christian interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch fell into neglect during the Middle Ages.\nThe publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 17th-century Europe reawakened interest in the text and fueled a controversy between Protestants and Roman Catholics over which Old Testament textual traditions are authoritative. Roman Catholics showed a particular interest in the study of the Samaritan Pentateuch on account of the antiquity of the text and its frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. Some Catholics including Jean Morin argue that the Samaritan Pentateuch's correspondences with the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint indicate that it represents a more authentic Hebrew text than the Masoretic. Several Protestants replied with a defense of the Masoretic text's authority and argued that the Samaritan text is a late and unreliable derivation from the Masoretic.\n\nThe 18th-century Protestant scholar of Hebrew Benjamin Kennicott's analysis of the Samaritan Pentateuch stands as a notable exception to the general trend of early Protestant research on the text. He questioned the underlying assumption that the Masoretic text must be more authentic simply because it has been more widely accepted as the authoritative Hebrew version of the Pentateuch:We see then that as the evidence of one text destroys the evidence of the other and as there is in fact the authority of versions to oppose to the authority of versions no certain argument or rather no argument at all can be drawn from hence to fix the corruption on either side.Kennicott also states that the reading Gerizim may actually be the original reading, since that is the mountain for proclaiming blessings, and that it is very green and rich of vegetation (as opposed to Mount Ebal, which is barren and the mountain for proclaiming curses) amongst other arguments.\nGerman scholar Wilhelm Gesenius published a study of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1815 which biblical scholars widely embraced during the next century. He argued that the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch share a common source in a family of Hebrew manuscripts which he named the \"Alexandrino-Samaritanus\". In contrast to the proto-Masoretic \"Judean\" manuscripts carefully preserved and copied in Jerusalem, he regarded the Alexandrino-Samaritanus as having been carelessly handled by scribal copyists who popularized, simplified, and expanded the text. Gesenius concluded that the Samaritan text contained only four valid variants when compared to the Masoretic text.\nIn 1915, Paul Kahle published a paper which compared passages from the Samaritan text to Pentateuchal quotations in the New Testament and pseudepigraphal texts including the Book of Jubilees, the First Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses. He concluded that the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves \"many genuine old readings and an ancient form of the Pentateuch.\" \nSupport for Kahle's thesis was bolstered by the discovery of biblical manuscripts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which contain a text similar to the Samaritan Pentateuch. The Dead Sea Scroll texts have demonstrated that a Pentateuchal text type resembling the Samaritan Pentateuch goes back to the second century BCE and perhaps even earlier.\n\nThese discoveries have demonstrated that manuscripts bearing a \"pre-Samaritan\" text of at least some portions of the Pentateuch such as Exodus and Numbers circulated alongside other manuscripts with a \"pre-Masoretic\" text. One Dead Sea Scroll copy of the Book of Exodus, conventionally named 4QpaleoExodm, shows a particularly close relation to the Samaritan Pentateuch:The scroll shares all the major typological features with the SP, including all the major expansions of that tradition where it is extant (twelve), with the single exception of the new tenth commandment inserted in Exodus 20 from Deuteronomy 11 and 27 regarding the altar on Mount Gerizim.Frank Moore Cross has described the origin of the Samaritan Pentateuch within the context of his local texts hypothesis. He views the Samaritan Pentateuch as having emerged from a manuscript tradition local to the Land of Israel. The Hebrew texts that form the underlying basis for the Septuagint branched out from the Israelite tradition as Israelites emigrated to Egypt and took copies of the Pentateuch with them. Cross states that the Samaritan and the Septuagint share a nearer common ancestor than either does with the Masoretic, which he suggested developed from local texts used by the Babylonian Jewish community. His explanation accounts for the Samaritan and the Septuagint sharing variants not found in the Masoretic and their differences reflecting the period of their independent development as distinct local text traditions. On the basis of archaizing and pseudo-archaic forms, Cross dates the emergence of the Samaritan Pentateuch as a uniquely Samaritan textual tradition to the post-Maccabean age.\n\n\nDerivative works\n\n\nTranslations\nThe Samaritan Targum, composed in the Samaritan variety of Western Aramaic, is the earliest translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch. Its creation was motivated by the same need to translate the Pentateuch into the Aramaic language spoken by the community which led to the creation of Jewish Targums such as Targum Onkelos. Samaritans have traditionally ascribed the Targum to Nathanael, a Samaritan priest who died c. 20 BCE. The Samaritan Targum has a complex textual tradition represented by manuscripts belonging to one of three fundamental text types exhibiting substantial divergences from one another. Affinities that the oldest of these textual traditions share with the Dead Sea Scrolls and Onkelos suggest that the Targum may originate from the same school which finalized the Samaritan Pentateuch itself. Others have placed the origin of the Targum around the beginning of the third century or even later. Extant manuscripts of the Targum are \"extremely difficult to use\" on account of scribal errors caused by a faulty understanding of Hebrew on the part of the Targum's translators and a faulty understanding of Aramaic on the part of later copyists.\nScholia of Origen's Hexapla and the writings of some Church Fathers contain references to \"the Samareitikon\" (Ancient Greek: το Σαμαρειτικόν), a work that is no longer extant. Despite earlier suggestions that it was merely a series of Greek scholia translated from the Samaritan Pentateuch, scholars now concur that it was a complete Greek translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch either directly translated from it or via the Samaritan Targum. It may have been composed for the use of a Greek-speaking Samaritan community residing in Egypt.\nWith the displacement of Samaritan Aramaic by Arabic as the language of the Samaritan community in the centuries following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, they employed several Arabic translations of the Pentateuch. The oldest was an adaptation of Saadia Gaon's mid-900s Tafsir Rasag or Arabic targum of the Masoretic Text. Although the text was modified to suit the Samaritan community, it still retained many unaltered Jewish readings.\nBy the 11th or 12th century, a new Arabic translation directly based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch had appeared in Nablus. Manuscripts containing this translation are notable for their bilingual or trilingual character; the Arabic text is accompanied by the original Samaritan Hebrew in a parallel column and sometimes the Aramaic text of the Samaritan Targum in a third. Later Arabic translations also appeared; one featured a further Samaritan revision of Saadia Gaon's translation to bring it into greater conformity with the Samaritan Pentateuch and others were based upon Arabic Pentateuchal translations used by Christians.\nIn April 2013, a complete English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch comparing it to the Masoretic version was published.\n\n\nExegetical and liturgical texts\nSeveral biblical commentaries and other theological texts based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch have been composed by members of the Samaritan community from the fourth century CE onwards. Samaritans also employ liturgical texts containing catenae extracted from their Pentateuch.\n\n\nManuscripts and printed editions\n\n\nAbisha Scroll\nSamaritans attach special importance to the Abisha Scroll used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. It consists of a continuous length of parchment sewn together from the skins of rams that, according to a Samaritan tradition, were ritually sacrificed. The text is written in gold letters. Rollers tipped with ornamental knobs are attached to both ends of the parchment and the whole is kept in a cylindrical silver case when not in use.\nSamaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron according to 1 Chronicles 6:35, thirteen years after the entry into the Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun. Contemporary scholars describe it as a composite of several fragmentary scrolls, each penned between the 12th and 14th centuries.\nOther manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consist of vellum or cotton paper written upon with black ink. Numerous manuscripts of the text exist but none predate the Middle Ages.\nThe scroll contains a cryptogram, dubbed the tashqil by scholars, which Samaritans consider to be Abishua's ancient colophon:\n\nI am Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the Priest, unto them be accorded the grace of YHWH and His glory—I wrote this holy book at the entrance of the tabernacle on Mount Gerizim, in the year thirteen of the Israelites' possession of the Land of Canaan according to its boundaries [all] around; I praise YHWH.\n\n\nWestern scholarship\n\nInterest in the Samaritan Pentateuch was awakened in 1616 when the traveler Pietro della Valle purchased a copy of the text in Damascus. This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library. In 1631, an edited copy of Codex B was published in Le Jay's (Paris) Polyglot by Jean Morin. It was republished in Walton's Polyglot in 1657. Subsequently, Archbishop Ussher and others procured additional copies which were brought to Europe and later, America.\n\n\nModern publications\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch were largely based upon Codex B. The most notable of these is Der Hebräische Pentateuch der Samaritaner (The Hebrew Pentateuch of the Samaritans) compiled by August von Gall and published in 1918. An extensive critical apparatus is included listing variant readings found in previously published manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch. His work is still regarded as being generally accurate despite the presence of some errors, but it neglects important manuscripts including the Abisha Scroll which had not yet been published at the time. Textual variants found in the Abisha scroll were published in 1959 by Federico Pérez Castro and between 1961 and 1965 by A. and R. Sadaqa in Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch – With Particular Stress on the Differences Between Both Texts. In 1976 L.F. Giron-Blanc published Codex Add. 1846, a Samaritan Pentateuch codex dating to 1100 CE in the critical edition Pentateuco Hebreo-Samaritano: Génesis supplemented with variants found in fifteen previously unpublished manuscripts. Certain recently published critical editions of Pentateuchal books take Samaritan variants into account, including D.L. Phillips' edition of Exodus.\nThe Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch has been edited and published at the beginning of the 21st century.\nSeveral publications containing the text of the Samaritan Targum have appeared. In 1875, the German scholar Adolf Brüll published his Das samaritanische Targum zum Pentateuch (The Samaritan Targum to the Pentateuch). More recently a two volume set edited by Abraham Tal appeared featuring the first critical edition based upon all extant manuscripts containing the Targumic text.\n\n\nSee also\nSamaritan Hebrew\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\nAnderson, Robert T.; Giles, Terry (2012).

    "text": "Mats Valk (born 4 May 1996) is a Dutch Rubik's Cube speedsolver. He broke the Rubik's cube single solve world record twice with times of 5.55 seconds in 2013 and 4.74 seconds in 2016. He won the Rubik's Cube European Championship in 2018 and was runner-up for 3x3x3 at the Rubik's Cube World Championships in 2013 and 2015.\n\n\nBiography\nValk was born and raised in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, a suburb of the Dutch capital Amsterdam.\nValk is most famous for breaking the Rubik's cube world record twice and being the runner-up at both the Rubik's cube world championships of 2013 and 2015. He first broke the world record with a time of 5.55 seconds at the Zonhoven Open 2013 in Belgium on 3 March 2013. This record stood for over 2 years. He later broke the world record again with a time of 4.74 seconds at the Jawa Timur Open 2016 in Indonesia on 6 November 2016. In December 2016, Valk looked on as Feliks Zemdegs overtook his world record by just 0.01 seconds.\nValk has also set three 4x4x4 world records, two for single solve and one for an average of 5.  His second single world record, 26.77 seconds on 15 April 2012, was the first official 4x4x4 solve under 30 seconds. Altogether, Valk has broken 5 WCA world records, 17 European records, and 127 Dutch national records. Valk also currently holds the world record for solving the most Rubik's cubes in 1 hour, 374 cubes, set in Paris on 21 October 2015.\nValk is also known as a creator of the VLS (Valk Last Slot) 3x3x3 algorithm set, which correctly orients the last layer while inserting the last corner-edge pair of the first two layers. Valk used one of these algorithms to complete the cube in his 2016 3x3x3 world record.\n\n\nThe Valk\nValk collaborated with the Chinese brand QiYi MoFangGe to set up his own brand, The Valk, creating cubes according to his own specifications. The design of the mechanism and the performance of the cube has to be approved by Valk himself before the cube is mass-produced and sold. The first cube released under this brand was the Valk 3 on 15 August 2016. This cube has been used by many other world-class speedcubers, including Patrick Ponce's former world record single. The size of the cube (5.55 cm each side) is a reference to his first Rubik's cube world record. He set his 2016 3x3x3 world record using a special magnetized version of this cube put together by TheCubicle.us, known as the Cubicle Valk 3 M. In 2018, QiYi released another Valk 3x3, the Valk Power and Power M, short for Valk Power Magnetic, the first copper core speedcube. Lastly, Qiyi released the newest Valk 3x3 called the Valk 3 Elite M. It has a dual magnet setting that no cube previously has had. The Valk Collection also has 2x2s, 4x4s, and a 5x5.\n\n\nRecords\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\nMats Valk's Facebook page\nMats Valk's YouTube channel\nMats Valk's official results at World Cube Association\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Bathurst Basin is a small triangular basin adjoining the main harbour of the city of Bristol, England. The basin takes its name from Charles Bathurst, who was a Bristol MP in the early 19th century.\nThe basin was built on an area of an old mill pond, Trin Mills. The pond was supplied by the River Malago, from Bedminster to the South. It lost its water supply as the New Cut was created in 1809, running to the South of the enlarged Floating Harbour and catching the flow of the Malago. After this it formed a connecting basin, through two sets of locks, between the Floating Harbour and the tidal River Avon in the New Cut. The connection enabled smaller vessels to bypass the main entrance locks in Cumberland Basin. From 1865 a deep water dock with a stone quay front was built. The area used to be an industrial dock with warehouses and numerous shipyards at the adjoining Wapping Shipyard and Docks, including Hilhouse, William Scott & Sons and William Patterson. Now there is a small marina, with residential quayside properties.\nThe Bristol Harbour Railway connected to the main line system at Temple Meads, via a lifting bascule bridge over the northern entrance dock to the basin and a tunnel beneath St Mary Redcliffe. The tunnel still exists, but is now blocked, and the original railway bridge has been replaced with a swing footbridge. This bridge is manually swung by a hydraulic pump action.\nBristol General Hospital is located on the Eastern quay of the basin. When constructed in 1859, the hospital was built with basement warehouse space to defray its operating costs. The Southern quay has never had any substantial buildings on it and for many years was used by Holms Sand & Gravel Co. as a depot for building materials, brought in by boat and offloaded into road vehicles. A travelling crane on an overhead gantry was used to handle these.\n\n\n1888 fire\nOn 21 November 1888 the Basin was the scene of a serious explosion and fire. The ketch  United was laden with 310 barrels of naphtha, distilled from coal tar in Brislington, and ready for departure to London. The cargo had been loaded the previous day at Welsh Back and the Master, Henry Cartwright, was now waiting for strong winds to drop.  Knowing the risk of fire for this flammable cargo, all flames had been banned from around the vessel and it had been kept in the entrance lock, not the main basin, overnight. Just after 11am, a sudden explosion rocked the basin. 'A high wall of flame of appalling fierceness' followed by 'a cloud of smoke of the blackest description', typical of burning naphtha, hurled one of the crew across the harbour to land with a broken leg. The explosion broke windows around the basin, including all those in the lower floor of the Hospital. Although rescuers boarded the Union, they were unable to rescue the trapped crew owing to the heat of the fire and three of the four crew burned to death. Liquid, burning naphtha floated across the surface of the basin and set fire to the ships there, with flames reaching masthead height. After three hours the fire burned out, aided by the efforts of horse-drawn fire engines and the docks' fire float.\n\n\nDecline of the Basin\nThe lock to the New Cut was blocked at the beginning of World War II to ensure that in case of damage by bombing, the waters of the Floating Harbour could not drain into the river. It was shut permanently in 1952.\n\n\nDecline of the docks\n\n\nUse for leisure\nThe basin is the home for Cabot Cruising Club who own the lightvessel John Sebastian, which was commissioned in 1886. It was acquired by the club in 1954 and opened as its headquarters a few years later in 1959. \nFacilities at the basin include a toilet and shower block, a water tap and refuse and chemical toilet disposal points.\nAlso in the surroundings of the basin are the Ostrich and Louisiana (originally the Bathurst Hotel) pubs.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nLocation within Bristol harbour\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBristol Floating Harbour heritage trail",

    "text": "Gregory Mark Preston (born June 2, 1960) is an American photographer and writer, known for his portraiture of artists within their creative spaces.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nPreston was first exposed to comic books at age eight and was immediately drawn to the visuals. At age thirteen, Preston was reintroduced to comics by a friend and from that point on he was hooked.\nFor college, Preston enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for his first two years as a fine arts major, thinking he wanted to be an illustrator, but really his desire was to be comic book artist. An instructor's advice that Preston seek out a more serious art school with commercial sensibilities, led him to enroll in a community college for graphic design.\nPreston bought his first camera, an Olympus OM-1, during that third year of studies, to shoot reference photos for his illustrations, and found his passion.\nAfter graduating with a degree in graphic design, Preston then moved to Los Angeles to study photography at the Art Center College of Design. In school, Preston began shooting with Nikon and Hasselblad cameras; and his favorite photographer influences were Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Albert Watson, Mark Seliger, and Andrew Eccles.\nPreston met Sharon Sampsel at the Art Center, graduating in 1986, and the couple married the same year.\n\n\nCareer\nPreston would go on to find work as commercial advertising photographer, specializing in hotel, resort, hospitality, weddings, portrait, editorial, food, and architectural photography. Preston and his wife opened their Las Vegas-based photography studio, Sampsel Preston Photography, on April 1, 1988.\nPreston's love of the illustration and fantasy art – and a suggestion from cartoonist Scott Shaw – brought about the idea for Preston's project of portraits of artists within their studios. The fifteen-year-long project brought together 101 cartoonists, comic book artists, and animators into an award-winning book of black-and-white portraits whose subjects include Frank Miller, Al Hirschfeld, Joe Barbera, Jack Kirby, Joe Simon, Moebius, Walt and Louise Simonson. The Artist Within: Portraits of Cartoonists, Comic Book Artists, Animators and Others (ISBN 978-1593075613) was published by Dark Horse Books in 2007.\nAfter the success of his first book, Preston crowdfunded the companion book. Launched in March 2017, the Kickstarter campaign received funding of $30,624. \nThe Artist Within: Behind the Lines: Book 2 (ISBN 978-0692917565) was published in November 2017, and features both black-and-white and color portraits of more than one hundred artists, including Drew Struzan, Jack Kirby, Mark English, Keith Knight, Syd Mead, Steranko, Ron English, Glen Keane.\nPreston's portraits from The Artist Within project have been seen during the Academy Awards and the Eisner Awards. Preston's The Artist Within portrait of artist Marie Severin was used by publications including The Atlantic, The Washington Post, and Newsday to announce her death.\nIn past years, Preston has also been the official portrait photographer at events, including Spectrum Fantastic Art Live in Kansas City; and CTN Animation Expo in Burbank, California; setting up a pop-up studio to take portraits of the guest artists in attendance.\nPreston has been an invited speaker at various venues. In 2011, he was a guest speaker the Society of Wedding and Portrait Photographers convention in London, to speak about being a hotel and resort photographer.\nHe has also spoken about his The Artist Within project before audiences at the CTN Animation Expo, Loyola Marymount University, and at the Art Center College of Design.\n\n\nBibliography\n2007 The Artist Within: Portraits of Cartoonists, Comic Book Artists, Animators and Others ISBN 978-1593075613\n2017 The Artist Within: Behind the Lines: Book 2 ISBN 978-0692917565\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nsampselpreston.com, website for Sampsel Preston Photography",

    "text": "\"Vacation Time\" is a 33-page Disney comics story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks.  The story was first published in Four Color Comics as Vacation Parade #1 (July 1950). The story stars Donald Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie. The story has been reprinted many times.\n\n\nPlot\nTourist Donald's dream of a carefree woodland idyll is beset by difficulties and dangers. Despite his nephews' characteristic needling, an elusive (and difficult-to-photograph) buck deer, and an unskilled bully fishing near their camp, Donald doggedly perseveres in wringing enjoyment from the outdoors. But once the bully's carelessness causes a forest fire that traps the Duck family alone, Donald's woodcraft and quick thinking are needed to ensure their survival.\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn a 1975 interview, Barks said that his characters sometimes need to be in danger to make the story dramatic: \"I couldn't create suspense without having them in real danger, and real danger means the fear of death. So all of the times these ducks got in bad situations they did have that opportunity of dying, in case they got clobbered. It made it more true to life to have them up against these impossible situations in which they could lose their lives if they didn't win. And in the forest fire sequence, you bet they were in danger. It made the story memorable.\"\n\n\nAnalysis\nCritic Geoffrey Blum hails Barks' artwork in \"Vacation Time\" as \"justly famous\" from its opening page. Eight panels per page for visuals are standard practice in comics layout, but Barks varies the panel's sizes (they do not appear as mere uniformly-sized rectangles) and increases their number of angles to permit changes in flow, speed, and especially scope in his storytelling. This technique allows Barks to make larger compositions without the need for half-page splashes; the story's opening full-page splash panel stands out more distinctly in this way. A handful of seven-panel pages (and one of nine) serve admirably for detailed and evocative depictions of scenery, mood, and action.\nEchoing a marked theme among commentators on Barks' work, John Steel Gordon reflects that, \"although Walt Disney invented Donald Duck, it was Barks who gave him his modern appearance and attributes.\" Barks' stamp is especially notable in the Duck's personality, as is discussed at greater length at the article Donald Duck in comics. Donald evolved in Barks' hands from what Geofrey Moses describes as a \"jumble of neuroses and funny quacking noises\" into an \"exemplar of modernist doubt and anxiety,\" observing that \"Barks' comics were surely popular in large part because they allowed people to see their unconscious fears and insecurities laid bare and simultaneously to laugh at them, safe in the knowledge that, for all his problems, Donald would ultimately get through all right. In this sense, the character takes on heroic proportions.\" Vacation Time serves as an apex in this development of heroism, as Donald's efforts to save the lives of his nephews shows him shouldering responsibilities usually given to his supporting characters, casting him much against type as an audacious rescuer. The moment, like the forest fire, is appropriately brief, and encapsulated by comic impasses both before and after Donald's peak experience.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Disney comics by Carl Barks\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nVacation Time (1950) at Inducks",

It is on the corner of Manor Road and St Cross Road, next to St Cross Church, which has become the Balliol College Historic Collections Centre.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe manor was held by the rectors of the Church of St Peter-in-the-East in the 11th and 12th centuries. It passed to Merton College in 1294 and was rebuilt by the College in 1516. It was leased to Edward Napper by the College in 1531. When occupied by Napper's family, the house became a refuge for Roman Catholic priests. The building was enlarged during 1555–72 and Napper's family remained in residence until the 17th Century. The building was partially demolished in 1761 and divided into three parts in 1828.\nBalliol College has had a presence in the area since the purchase by Benjamin Jowett, the Master, in the 1870s of the open area which is the Balliol sports ground 'The Master's Field'. On the edges of this, along Mansfield Road and St Cross Road, have been built Fellows houses, notably 'The King's Mound' in 1894.\nThe oldest surviving part of the site is the 16th-century farmhouse which now houses the 'Praefectus', i.e., the resident supervising Fellow. It was acquired by Balliol College in 1929, prior to which it had been a convent of the Community of St John Baptist, Clewer and a home for unmarried mothers (though it was deserted by 1929). The purchase was planned by Kenneth Norman Bell in order to provide accommodation for undergraduates and was funded by donations to the Balliol Society which he had founded expressly for this purpose.\nThe extensive extensions to the original manor were designed by the architect George Kennedy, an alumnus of the College. These include the road facing façade, the entrance courtyard and the grand Queen Anne style wings surrounding the distinctive two rows of Ginkgo trees planted by C. S. Orwin.\nThe Manor opened in 1932 and remained a hostel for Balliol's undergraduates until the 1960s, except for during World War II, when it was lent to St Hugh's College. It then became a mixed graduate community shared with St Anne's College's female graduates. Finally in 1984, after Balliol College had begun accepting women it took its current form as a residence just for Balliol's graduates. A supplementary graduate students accommodation block, built on the opposite corner of the road to the Manor on the 'Master's Field', was opened in 1966 and is officially the 'Martin Building' after Leslie Martin, and known jocularly as 'Holywell Minor'. In 1986 another block next to this was opened as the 'Dellal Building', named after Balliol Foundation fellow Jack Dellal. Between 2000 and 2008 a group of undergraduate resident Staircases have been developed along Jowett Walk. In 2019 the Dellal and Martin buildings were demolished to make way for new Balliol accommodation buildings that extend along Jowett Walk and St Cross Road, opposite Holywell Manor.\nThe building was significantly extended in 1993 with the construction of the James Fairfax Yard block off the manor's north wing, designed by Architects Design Partnership (ADP). A review of college services led to the decision to close the kitchens and dining room, Manor residents were to use the new facilities at the College Hall, from 2008. This reversed a tendency towards the Manor being regarded as a separate college; Balliol is in fact the ninth largest graduate college in the University by post-graduate student members. This allowed for internal improvements and facilities, notably an additional common space known as the 'cockpit' or 'lounge', and a gym, which are available for use by all College members.\n\n\nArt\nKenneth Norman Bell began an association between Holywell and the arts which still continues. What is now one of the Manor's computer rooms is decorated with murals depicting the tradition of the founding of the College painted by Gilbert Spencer, the brother of Stanley Spencer. In addition, the garden contains a fountain by Peter Lyon, Icarus by Raymond Petit and a wind sculpture by George Rickey.\n\n\nNotable residents\nPauline Gregg\nEmpress Masako of Japan stayed in Holywell Manor.\nRussell Meiggs\nGeorge Napper\nDenis Noble\n\n\nFacilities\nHolywell Manor has the following facilities:\n\nThe \"Megaron\" Bar — This is unusual amongst college bars both for being student run and for operating on an honesty basis.\nThe MCR — The common room is furnished with seating, is stocked with newspapers and magazines, and has Wi-Fi access.\nThe laundry room\nTV Room\nGym\nMusic practice rooms — previously the \"Cockpit\" dining hall.\n\n\nSee also\nSt Cross Church, Oxford\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Holywell Manor Handbook, Balliol College",

    "text": "The 1978–79 season was Sport Lisboa e Benfica's 75th season in existence and the club's 45th consecutive season in the top flight of Portuguese football, covering the period from 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1979. Benfica competed domestically in the Primeira Divisão and the Taça de Portugal, and participated in the UEFA Cup after finishing second in the previous league.\nAfter narrowly missing out on the fourth consecutive title, Benfica signed João Alves, plus Reinaldo Gomes and Carlos Alhinho. They let go of Vítor Baptista and three others. In the league, a poor start with three losses in a month, severely hindered the title race. Nevertheless, despite dropping out of the UEFA Cup at the hands of Borussia Mönchengladbach, domestically, Benfica won all league matches for three months, reaching the first place in the league. A home draw with Porto stopped their winning run, but it was a loss to Marítimo that compromised their title race. That loss followed another with Braga for the Taça de Portugal. Despite dropping points again in March, Benfica kept an entertaining battle with Porto, which came to an end when they drew again in match-day 29. Two consecutive seasons without winning the Primeira Divisão was unprecedented since 1959.\n\n\nSeason summary\nBenfica came on in the new season after barely missing the \"Tetra\", the fourth league title in a row, when they match Porto's 51 points but had worse goal-average. This led the members to change a long time rule about only signing Portuguese players. On 1 July 1978, in a members meet, that rule was removed. According to the press, the first foreign approached was Paul Mariner, but it did not pan out. Benfica did made the biggest signing of the window, when they brought on João Alves from Spain. Other signings included Reinaldo Gomes and the return of Carlos Alhinho. Major departures included  Vítor Baptista, but also Celso Pita and Vítor Martins, both due to career-ending injuries. Benfica also replaced assistant manager Rui Silva for Peres Bandeira. The pre-season began on 31 July, and Benfica first competed in the inaugural Feyenoord Tournament with Feyenoord and Club Brugge, before making their presentation game with Nacional Montevideo on 16 August. They ended the pre-season with two friendlies with Salamanca and Molenbeek, due to obligations related to the transfers of João Alves and Carlos Alhinho.\nBenfica started their league campaign with win against Barreirense, before they faced Porto in the Clássico. On the Estádio das Antas, Benfica lost 1–0, but \nJohn Mortimore said the loss could prove to be a good thing. The loss put an end to a 56–game undefeated streak in the competition that dated back to 3 October 1976. However, Mortimore saw his team lose again on match-day 3, on a visit to Bonfim to play Vitória de Setúbal. They reacted with a win against Braga, only to lose again in their next away visit. In Estádio do Restelo, Benfica was defeated one-nil by Belenenses. It was their third loss in the first month of competition. In their first ever UEFA Cup participation, Benfica fared better and eliminated Nantes in the first round. In the following round, Borussia Mönchengladbach, beat them 2–0 in Germany and eliminate them. Still, October was a fruitful month for Benfica, as they started a winning run that extended three months. They reached top of the league with the same points as Porto, after a 5–0 win against Sporting. It was the largest win against them since the 7–2 in 1946. On the following match-day, an away win with Vitória de Guimarães propelled Benfica into isolated first place with 16 points, one more than Porto. Benfica winning run ended on 21 January with a 1–1 draw against Porto on match-day 17. Mortimore complained of a three-meter off-side in Porto's goal. It left Porto in a lead with a game more, because Benfica's match against Académico de Viseu on 30 December had to be postponed due to stormy weather. In February, Benfica was knocked-out of the Portuguese Cup with a 2–1 loss with Braga, a defeat that Mortimore rated as fair.\nA week later, another defeat, now for the Primeira Divisão. Benfica lost 2–1 in Barreiros to Máritimo and was now two points behind Porto, but still with one game less.\nAfter winning the game in hand, Benfica matched Porto again at the front, but let them slip again after dropping points in the following game. A visit to Varzim, where they drew 1–1. Benfica responded with several consecutive wins, including one in Estádio de Alvalade, with a goal from João Alves. As Benfica entered June, they were still neck and neck with Porto, but with a disadvantage in the head-to-head. In second-to-last match-day, Benfica dropped points in Aveiro in a 0–0 draw with Beira-Mar and practically handed the title to Porto, who gained a point with one match left. A week later, Benfica won, but so did Porto, who confirmed their back-to-back league title with 50 points, one more than Benfica. About the season, Mortimore said: \"What a beautiful championship, with an appealing fight between Benfica and Porto. They (Porto) ended up being Champions because in the matches against us, they racked-up three points. But that was not the reason why he lost it. It was the poor results with Belenenses, Setúbal and Marítimo.\".

(From Grass Valley Road, Muddy Road heads due east as a dirt road along the county line to end just short of the foothills the Sonoma Range and Power Line heads due west along the county line, also as a dirt road, to end at Herschell Road at the northeastern base of the East Range. Grass Valley Road continues south past the community of Grass Valley, through the Grass Valley, and on to the southern part of Pleasant Valley.) From its southern terminus, SR 294 heads north through the northern part of the Grass Valley, passing through agricultural and rural residences of the greater Winnemucca area. After about 4 miles (6.4 km) it comes to point about 1.75 miles (2.82 km) east-northeast of the Winnemucca Municipal Airport. There it has an intersection with Westmoreland Road (which heads due west to the airport). Near this intersection SR 294 turns easterly to run northeast and parallel to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.\nDevelopment gradually increases near the highway as it parallels the railroad as they head northeast into the Winnemucca city limits. At an intersection with Hanson Street (the eastern terminus of Nevada State Route 787 [SR 787]), the route reaches its current northern terminus. (Hanson Street [SR 787] heads northwest to connect with U.S. Route 95/Interstate 80 Business [I‑80 Bus.] at the western terminus of SR 787. Hanson Street also continues easterly as city street through the southern part of the town to end at an intersection with South Highland Drive and Water Canyon Road.) Beyond the northern terminus, West Haskell Street continues northeast (along what was formerly also part of SR 294) to end at intersection with East Winnemucca Boulevard (State Route 794/I‑80 Bus.).\n\n\nHistory\nSR 294 became a state highway on March 26, 1981.

In 1902 he was named to the King's Counsel.\nIn the November 6, 1889 Newfoundland general election, Morris ran for the Liberal Party in the two-member district of Harbour Main. Morris had defeated the incumbent Maurice Fenelon convincingly. Morris also won his second term in office in the 1893 election running in the same district of Harbour Main. In 1904 Morris was appointed as Speaker of the House, a position he held for the next four years even while his brother broke with the Bond government, resigned from the Cabinet and crossed the floor to sit with the opposition. Morris kept in political life until 1917 when he resigned from the House of Assembly to accept the appointment as Judge of the Central District Court.\nMorris was very influential in his many non political pursuits; he was a member of the Roman Catholic board of education for 28 years. During that time he was also a member of the board of governors for Saint Bonaventure's College. Morris was also an avid sports fan and was a member of the St. John's Regatta Committee for 38 years.

    "text": "Yorck Boyen Insterburg was a German association football club from the city of Insterburg, East Prussia (today Chernyakhovsk, Russia).\nThe team was founded in 1921 as Sport-Verein Yorck Insterburg. In 1934, it was merged with Militär Sport-Verein von Boyen Tilsit to form the army side Militär Sport-Verein Yorck von Boyen Insterburg. The Tilsit club had been formed in 1923 as Sport-Verein von Boyen Tilsit. The name of the association recognized the Prussian generals Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg and Hermann von Boyen.\nPrior to the merger, SV Yorck played a season in the Gauliga Ostpreußen, one of 16 top flight regional divisions created in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933. MSV Yorck-Boyen carried on in Gauliga play, winning its group within the division and then beating SV Prussia-Samland Königsberg (5:1, 1:2) in the division final to earn a place in the national playoffs where they went out in the opening round.\nMSV played the next three seasons in the Gauliga Gumbinnen – which was part of the Gauliga Ostpreußen – winning its group each year, but failing to capture the overall division title. They made a second appearance in the preliminary round of the national playoff in 1938, but again fared poorly. Insterburg also took part that year in the Tschammerspokal, predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup) and went out in the second round.

In 1934, it was merged with Militär Sport-Verein von Boyen Tilsit to form the army side Militär Sport-Verein Yorck von Boyen Insterburg. The Tilsit club had been formed in 1923 as Sport-Verein von Boyen Tilsit. The name of the association recognized the Prussian generals Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg and Hermann von Boyen.\nPrior to the merger, SV Yorck played a season in the Gauliga Ostpreußen, one of 16 top flight regional divisions created in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933. MSV Yorck-Boyen carried on in Gauliga play, winning its group within the division and then beating SV Prussia-Samland Königsberg (5:1, 1:2) in the division final to earn a place in the national playoffs where they went out in the opening round.\nMSV played the next three seasons in the Gauliga Gumbinnen – which was part of the Gauliga Ostpreußen – winning its group each year, but failing to capture the overall division title. They made a second appearance in the preliminary round of the national playoff in 1938, but again fared poorly. Insterburg also took part that year in the Tschammerspokal, predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup) and went out in the second round.

    "text": "Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the single-seat electoral districts of state legislative chambers must be roughly equal in population. Along with Baker v. Carr (1962) and Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of \"one person, one vote\" to U.S. legislative bodies.\nPrior to the case, numerous state legislative chambers had districts containing unequal populations; for example, in the Nevada Senate, the smallest district had 568 people, while the largest had approximately 127,000 people. Some states refused to engage in regular redistricting, while others enshrined county by county representation (like the U.S. constitution does with state by state representation) in their constitutions. The case of Reynolds v. Sims arose after voters in Birmingham, Alabama, challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature; although the Constitution of Alabama provided for both houses to be apportioned on the basis of population (a requirement that could not be changed by constitutional amendment), the Alabama Legislature failed to conduct the required periodic redistricting and even proposed a constitutional amendment which - in violation of the constitution's eternity clause - would provide for one state senator per county regardless of population differences.\nIn a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires states to establish state legislative electoral districts roughly equal in population. Warren held that \"legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.\" In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Tom Campbell Clark allowed one house to deviate from this standard only as long as the other house complies with it, while in his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II argued that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to apply to voting rights. The decision had a major impact on state legislatures, as many states had to change their system of representation.\n\n\nHistorical background\nBefore the industrialization and urbanization of the United States, a state senate in most states was understood to represent rural counties as a counterbalance to towns and cities. Of the forty-eight states then in the Union, only seven twice redistricted even one chamber of their legislature following both the 1930 and the 1940 Censuses. Illinois did not redistrict between 1910 and 1955, while Alabama and Tennessee had at the time of Reynolds not redistricted since 1901. In Connecticut, Vermont, Mississippi, and Delaware, apportionment was fixed by the states' constitutions, which, when written in the late eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, did not foresee the possibility of rural depopulation as was to occur during the first half of the century.  In New Hampshire the state constitutions, since January 1776, had always called for the state senate to be apportioned based on taxes paid, rather than on population.\nHaving already overturned its ruling that redistricting was a purely political question in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the Court ruled to correct what it considered egregious examples of malapportionment; these were serious enough to undermine the premises underlying republican government. Before Reynolds, urban counties nationwide often had total representations similar to rural counties, and in Florida, there was a limit to three representatives even for the most populous counties.\n\n\nThe case\n\nVoters from Jefferson County, Alabama, home to the state's largest city of Birmingham, challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature. The Alabama Constitution paradoxically provided that, although senatorial districts have to have as equal a population as possible, counties cannot be split across several senatorial districts. Ratio variances as great as 41 to 1 from one senatorial district to another existed in the Alabama Senate (i.e., the number of eligible voters voting for one senator was in one case 41 times the number of voters in another). The case was named for M. O. Sims, one of the voters who brought the suit, and B. A. Reynolds, a probate judge in Dallas County, one of the named defendants in the original suit. Reynolds was named (along with three other probate judges) as a symbolic representative of all probate judges in the state of Alabama.\nAmong the more extreme pre-Reynolds disparities claimed by Morris K. Udall:\n\nIn the Connecticut General Assembly, one House district had 191 people.\nIn the New Hampshire General Court, the Town of Ellsworth with a population of three people had a Representative in the lower house; this was the same representation given to Bedford, with a population of 3,636.\nIn the Utah State Legislature, the smallest district had 165 people, the largest 32,380.\nIn the Vermont General Assembly, the smallest district had 36 people, the largest 35,000.\nIn the Idaho Senate, the smallest district had 969 people; the largest, 93,400.\nIn the Nevada Senate, seventeen members represented as many as 127,000 or as few as 568 people.\n\n\nDecision\n\nThe eight justices who struck down state senate inequality based their decision on the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" In his majority decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren said \"Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.\" In addition, the majority simply denied the argument that states were permitted to base their apportionment structures upon the Constitution itself, which requires two senators from each state despite substantially unequal populations among the states.\nJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a concurring opinion. Justice Potter Stewart also issued a concurring opinion, in which he argued that while many of the schemes of representation before the court in the case were egregiously undemocratic and clearly violative of equal protection, it was not for the Court to provide any guideline beyond general reasonableness for apportionment of districts.\nIn dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that the majority had chosen to ignore the language, history, and original intent of the Equal Protection Clause, which did not extend to voting rights. The dissent strongly accused the Court of repeatedly amending the Constitution through its opinions, rather than waiting for the lawful amendment process: \"the Court's action now bringing them (state legislative apportionments) within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment amounts to nothing less than an exercise of the amending power by this Court.\" The Court had already extended \"one person, one vote\" to all U.S. congressional districts in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964) a month before, but not to the Senate.\n\n\nAftermath\nSince the ruling applied different representation rules to the states than was applicable to the federal government, Reynolds v. Sims set off a legislative firestorm across the country. Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois led a fight to pass a constitutional amendment allowing legislative districts similar to the United States Senate. He warned that:\n\n[T]he forces of our national life are not brought to bear on public questions solely in proportion to the weight of numbers. If they were, the 6 million citizens of the Chicago area would hold sway in the Illinois Legislature without consideration of the problems of their 4 million fellows who are scattered in 100 other counties. Under the Court's new decree, California could be dominated by Los Angeles and San Francisco; Michigan by Detroit.\nNumerous states had to change their system of representation in the state legislature. For instance, South Carolina had historically elected one state senator from each county. It devised a reapportionment plan and passed an amendment providing for home rule to counties. While allegations of state senates being redundant arose in the decision's aftermath, all states affected retained their state senates, with state senators being elected from single-member districts. This contrasted with the options of abolishing the upper houses, as had been done in Nebraska in 1936 (as well as the provinces of Canada), or electing state senators via proportional representation from either several large multi-member districts or from one statewide at-large district, as was done in Australia.\n\n\nReactions\nIn a 2015 Time Magazine survey of over 50 law professors, both Erwin Chemerinsky (Dean, UC Berkeley School of Law) and Richard Pildes (NYU School of Law) named Reynolds v. Sims the \"best Supreme Court decision since 1960\", with Chemerinsky noting that in his opinion, the decision made American government \"far more democratic and representative.\"\n\n\nSee also\nThe Shaff Plan\nAlabama Legislative Black Caucus v.

HSDA student activists across the country engage in political activity of the Democratic Party.\nFormerly part of the Young Democrats of America, HSDA represents high school students at all levels of the Democratic Party.\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough individual unaffiliated state chapters existed long beforehand, the High School Democrats of America itself was founded in December 2005, by Ahmed Kokon (NY) and Jonathan Padilla (CA), with Eddy Foster (PA) and Alicia Froio (PA) joining the board after the initial election. In June 2014, the High School Democrats of America formally ended its affiliation with the Young Democrats of America, and ceased functioning as the Young Democrats of America's High School Caucus. With the change, the position of National Parliamentarian became Development Director. The Development Director served as Parliamentarian and resolved disputes and presided over elections. The organization held its first national conference, the HSDA Strategic Summit, in Washington, D.C., during July 2015. At the 2019 summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco, California, the party's Charter and Bylaws was amended to grant HSDA two seats on the DNC.\n\n\nOrganization\nThe organization and rules governing HSDA are found in the organization's Official Bylaws.\nThe national organization presides over HSDA as a whole. It is led by the National Executive Board, which consists of the Chair, two Vice-Chairs of different genders, the Communications Director, the Programs Director, and the Development Director. The National E-Board is responsible for overseeing the organization, expanding HSDA, and working with states to promote Democratic causes. The National E-Board is elected every year by a ranked-choice election accessible to all members regardless of location. Leadership also includes a National Committee consisting of two representatives from individual states, territories, and the District of Columbia, in addition to Chairs and Vice Chairs from each Caucus. The Executive Board employs a group of volunteer staff, ranging from Financial Directors to Political Advisors. Other organizations at the national level include the Ethics Council, which resolves issues in an unbiased manner; the Caucuses, which represent marginalized communities of race, orientation, and disability; the Diversity Committee, which consists of the Chairs and Vice-Chairs of the Caucuses as well as the Diversity Director and promotes inclusivity; and the Adult Advisory Board, which assists the E-Board in legal and financial matters as well as long-term planning.\nEach state organization works with all the local chapters in their state, and is responsible for connecting chapters, expanding HSDA, working on legislation, and promoting Democratic causes at the state level. State chapters also have an extensive list of accolades, including hosting a “Unity Day” with the Teen Age Republicans to promote bipartisanship. Each state holds its own elections to determine who assumes state leadership.\nLocal chapters at high schools and in communities work at a grassroots level by rallying young people behind causes. Local HSDA chapters have organized marches, registered voters, and helped to elect Democrats in their own communities.\n\n\nCaucuses\nThe HSDA National Caucus System consists of the Asian/Pacific Islander Caucus, Black Caucus, Disabled Caucus, First Generation Caucus, Hindu Caucus, Jewish Caucus, Latino Caucus, LGBTQ+ Caucus, Muslim Caucus, and Women's Caucus. Caucuses were formed to represent groups that, because of their gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, religious beliefs, or ethnicity, face substantial discrimination in American society as a whole.\n\n\nActivities\nThe organization is involved in a number of projects, including a Huffington Post blogging project and a separate publishing opportunity through The Progressive Teen, which serves as the official magazine of the organization with a full editorial staff. Both projects are aimed at inspiring political discourse and offering members the opportunity to voice their opinions about important civic issues in a highly-visible setting. The organization has also proved instrumental and necessary in several campaigns across the country, including the election of Joe Donnelly and Elizabeth Warren to the US Senate, as well as the notable election of President Barack H. Obama in 2008.\nThe organization has taken stances on important issues throughout the political spectrum, but has been recently focused on student loan reform, immigration reform, and gun control. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, HSDA members began to advocate for stronger gun control.\nSince 2015, HSDA has hosted an annual summit in Washington, D.C., to train student activists and teach them to organize in their communities. HSDA has also garnered the attention of several notable politicians, including Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and President Joe Biden. In 2020, 2021, and 2022, the National Summit was virtual due to various reasons including the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 2024, the summit returned to an in-person format.\n\n\nSee also\nCollege Democrats\nCollege Democrats of America\nDemocratic Party (United States)\nLaw School Democrats of America\nYoung Democrats of America\nTeen Age Republicans\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nExternal links\nHigh School Democrats of America Website\nThe Progressive Teen",

He was the son of Captain Pehr Gustaf Malmborg (1777–1828), who had been decorated with the gold medal for bravery after the Battle of Svensksund in 1790, before he was teenager. Oscar Malmborg emigrated to the United States in 1846 and fought in the Mexican War.\n\n\nCareer\nFrom 1853 to 1861 he worked as an immigration agent for the Illinois Central Railroad. He returned to Europe to promote emigration to America.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln formally recognized Malmborg as the vice consul of Norway and Sweden at Chicago on November 22, 1861. The same year he returned to military service and was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the Union Army.\n\nDuring the Battle of Shiloh after  Colonel David Stuart was badly wounded, Malmborg assumed temporary command of the Second Brigade of the Fifth Division commanded by Brigadier General William T. Sherman. In the advance on Corinth, Mississippi, Malmborg correctly predicted what the Confederate forces were attempting. In an official report on April 10, 1862, Colonel Stuart wrote of Malmborg, \"He instantly perceived the aim of every movement made by the enemy; he could advise me quickly and prudently how to use my men. He was intent, careful, brave, and immensely valuable to me.\" General Ulysses S. Grant took notice and complimented him.\nAfter Stuart resigned on April 3, 1863, Malmborg became the permanent commander until being relieved. He resigned on September 20, 1864. On January 1, 1865, Malmborg was commissioned a colonel in the First Veteran Army Corps under General Winfield Scott Hancock and was ordered to oversee the recruiting in Illinois, with headquarters in Chicago once again. He resigned from this position on May 31, 1865.\n\n\nLater years\nEncouraged by Sherman, Malmborg published his memoirs of the Civil War. He chose the title Tjensteförteckning, and it was published in Chicago in 1871. Almost blind, Malmborg returned to Sweden in 1874 and settled in Visby on Gotland living on his pension. Some of his letters have been edited and published by A. A. Stomberg. He died in Visby on April 29, 1880, at the age of 60. \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nOther sources\nOlson, Ernst W.

His debut came in the 1949 film The Firemen of Viggiù and he made his first television debut in 1956. He also had an intense career onstage, as he often starred in plays directed by Eduardo De Filippo and Giorgio Strehler. Croccolo was best known for his collaboration with Antonio \"Totò\" De Curtis, mainly throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn the early 1950s, he replaced Alberto Sordi performing the Italian voice of Oliver Hardy in the redubs of Laurel and Hardy made between 1951 and 1953, in which he was paired with Fiorenzo Fiorentini (who provided the Italian voice of Stan Laurel); he came back to dubbing Hardy in the 1968-1970 redubs, this time paired with Franco Latini. Since 1957, Croccolo also served as a dubbing artist for Totò in some of his films, as his friend had gradually lost his sight and had thus become unable to post-syncronize his own lines: having previously dubbed Totò in French during his stay in Canada and due to his ability in imitating his speech, Croccolo was chosen by the artist himself to dub his voice in Italian when needed.\nIn 1989, Croccolo received the David di Donatello for best supporting actor in the film 'O Re. Croccolo’s international notoriety came in 1996 with the film In Love and War, directed by Richard Attenborough. \nCroccolo died in his home in Castel Volturno on 12 October 2019 at the age of 92.

Similar to Tanner Staging for pubic hair, it classifies axillary hair growth into four stages:\n\nWolfsdorf Stage 1 – No axillary hair\nWolfsdorf Stage 2 – Sparse, soft hair\nWolfsdorf Stage 3 – Coarser hair with increased volume\nWolfsdorf Stage 4 – Full adult-like axillary hair\nThe importance of human underarm hair is unclear. It may naturally wick sweat or other moisture away from the skin, aiding ventilation. Colonization by odor-producing bacteria is thereby transferred away from the skin (see skin flora).\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nReducing friction\nArmpit hair prevents skin-to-skin contact during activities that involve arm motion, such as running and walking.

Regina soon joined Drizella to offer help but turned her down, just in time to reveal Regina as Gothel in disguise and tempting her with an offer to join a group of women known as the Coven of Eight. As Drizella accepted the offer, Gothel only had two spots left while going through a recruiting process. Gothel says she's hidden two golden flowers somewhere in the forest and whoever brings her the flowers will prove themselves worthy of joining the Coven. Gothel tells Drizella that she has to do the task alone, but she instead partners up with another recruit named Gretel.\nAs the two women bond over having to deal with the loss of a sibling, with Gretel revealing how her brother Hansel had changed after the events of dealing with a witch but has never been the same since and has taken on a new identity. Both Drizella and Gretel comes across a fork in the road, the two agreed to separate then meet up. During this separation, Gothel appears to Drizella to reveal that the test was actually an elimination that determines eligibility into the sisterhood. Gothel wants Drizella to kill Gretel with a sai or tekpi-type weapon but Drizella decided against it because of Gothel's true intentions. When Gretel returns, Drizella suggest that they form their own sisterhood in order to get what they wanted, but soon that idea is scratched when Gretel reveals the same weapon that Drizella had. It turns out Gothel had set them both up with orders to kill one another. The women soon fight each other but as Gretel was about to kill her Drizella sends her weapon towards Gretel and she kills her instead. Gothel appears to Drizella, telling her that she has been accepted into the Coven of Eight, thus marking the events leading up to the Dark Curse.\n\n\nIn The Present Day\nAs Ivy continues her search for Anastasia, she is enticed by Gothel to once again join her Coven, but Ivy turns down Gothel's offers as she wants her sister's powers and she will not sacrifice herself in order to do so. Gothel then hands her a heart shaped box of chocolates which were outside in the lobby (implying that she is the next target), warning her of a serial killer that are after women who have ties to the Coven, but Ivy doesn't believe Gothel's story, that is, until later on that night when the masked Candy Killer goes after Ivy but she escaped his attempts. Ivy then approached Regina for help afterwards. Regina is still upset over what Ivy did to her and Henry but agreed to help. As Regina consulted Weaver on this situation, Ivy is approached by Samdi, who knows about what and why the Candy Killer is after her. Samdi tells Ivy the only way to save both her and Anastasia is using a magic bean that can create a portal, using reinforcement by Anastasia's powers.\nLater that evening, Ivy and Anastasia finally meet up, with Ivy ready to forgive Anastasia and promised to help each other get home to their realm with a magic bean. But instead of pulling the bean out of her pocket, she pulled out poppy dust, betraying Anastasia and putting her to sleep. When Ivy takes Anastasia back to Samdi, their attempt to exorcise her powers is interrupted by Gothel, who wakes her up and compels her to kill Ivy. However, Ivy pleads with Anastasia, saying that if she does kill her she would end up giving in to Gothel's control, but Anastasia refuses to kill her sister, much to the dismay of Gothel, who escapes angrily. When Regina and Weaver arrived to see the damage done in the place, they're relieved to see Ivy and Anastasia embraced each other as sisters again. Ivy also apologized to Regina for what she did to Henry and her, with Regina saying she understands. As Ivy and Anastasia say goodbye to Regina and Weaver, Anastasia uses her magic to create the portal, and they go back to their realm.\nBack at the bar, Regina confronted Samdi over what happened, but Samdi assures Regina that he was doing this to save Henry by extracting Anastasia's magic into a bottle so Henry will live once his curse is broken but at the same time warns Regina about Weaver's intentions. And as Samdi leaves the bar, Weaver is waiting for him, saying that he's keeping the dagger in his possession, despite Samdi's cautionary message about Weaver's desire to be with Belle.\nIn between the events, Lucy and Regina come up with a way to perk up Henry while at the same time must keep him and Jacinda from kissing each other, so Regina suggests that Henry get together with Rogers and Nick for a night out (since Hook and Jack were his best friends in the past life). Thanks to Regina texting Rogers and Nick, the guys are able to track Henry to Flynn's Barcade, a local bar that Henry frequents. The two suddenly decided to stick around and help Henry out with his romantic feelings towards Jacinda, giving Nick an idea by making a bet that Henry can move on from Jacinda, by asking out the first woman who walks into the bar, who, as fate would have it, was Jacinda herself. After the two talk for a while, Jacinda challenge Henry to a game in which he had a coin that if he tossed it into a glass then he would believe in the fairytales that Lucy had told him. When he threw the coin, a bartender takes up the glass and it misses. However, Jacinda doesn't stay long as she has to meet up with Sabine later; surprisingly enough when Jacinda threw a coin into a glass back at home, she succeeded. Hours later after the bar closes, Henry, Rogers, and Nick say their goodbyes, with Nick wishing Rogers good luck on the case. Unbeknownst to Henry and Rogers, after they left Nick alone to fix a flat tire, Nick opens up his car trunk which revealed the heart-shaped boxes, envelopes, objects, and the mask, revealing him to be the Candy Killer who has been targeting the coven witches.\n\n\nCasting notes\nMekia Cox is credited but doesn't appear in the episode.

    "text": "The Zungeni Mountain skirmish took place on 5 June 1879 between British and Zulu forces during the second invasion of Zululand, in what is now part of South Africa, during the later stages of the Anglo-Zulu War.  British irregular horse commanded by Colonel Redvers Buller discovered a force of 300 Zulus at the settlement of eZulaneni near Zungeni Mountain.  The horsemen charged and scattered the Zulus before burning the settlement.  Buller's men withdrew after coming under fire from the Zulus who had threatened to surround them.\nBuller's men were joined by more irregulars and a force of British regular cavalry, under the command of Major-General Frederick Marshall.  Two squadrons of the 17th (The Duke of Cambridge's Own) Lancers, led by Colonel Drury Drury-Lowe, approached the Zulus.  They were not able to close with the Zulus, who were in an area of long grass and bushes, and Zulu fire killed the Lancers' regimental adjutant, Lieutenant Frederick John Cokayne Frith.  Drury-Lowe ordered some of his men to dismount and return fire but again the Zulus threatened to outflank the British and Marshall ordered a withdrawal.  Aside from Frith the British casualties included two irregulars wounded; two months after the battle the remains of 25 Zulus were discovered on the battlefield.  The British paused to fortify their camp before proceeding further into Zululand. They then decisively defeated the Zulu in the 4 July Battle of Ulundi.\n\n\nBackground\nFollowing the discovery of diamonds in Southern Africa, it became British policy to expand and consolidate their influence in the region.   The High Commissioner for Southern Africa,  Sir Henry Bartle Frere, viewed the independent Zulu Kingdom, bordering the British colonies of Natal and Transvaal, as a possible threat and sought an excuse to declare war and annex it.  After failing to use a boundary dispute as a means of forcing the Zulu king Cetshwayo into war, Frere seized upon a July 1878 legal dispute. Two wives of the Zulu chief Sihayo kaXongo had fled to Natal, an armed band, led by his sons, entered the colony to retrieve them for execution.\nIn December 1878 Frere mobilised British troops on the borders of Zululand and presented Cetshwayo with an ultimatum, requiring him to turn over Sihayo's sons and the renegade Swazi prince Mbilini waMswati, who had raided into the Transvaal, and pay a fine of cattle.  He also demanded wholesale changes to the Zulu system of government; including limits on the use of the death penalty, the requirement for judicial trials, supervision of the state by a British official, admission of Christian missionaries and the abolition of the Zulu social/army system known as iButho.  The ultimatum was harsh, demanding radical change in the Zulu way of life, and it was intended by Frere that Cetshwayo would reject it. \nThe iButho system, established by Shaka, separated men into age-grouped regiments based in barracks spread across the country which served as focal points of royal authority and a pool of labour in peacetime.  When granted permission by the king to marry, around age 40, the men were released to the control of local chiefs, but remained liable for recall as a form of reserve.  In times of war they were called up to form the royal army, though some chiefs kept back men for their own use. \nAlthough he could not comply with the British terms, particularly the abolition of the iButho, Cetshwayo made some attempts at conciliation, sending representatives and cattle to the British.  When these were rejected Cetshwayo made preparations for a defensive war.  He ordered the regiments, set to assemble at the Zulu capital of Ulundi on 8 January for the umKhosi (First Fruits) ceremony, to come prepared for combat.  By this time the number of men liable for service in the army numbered around 42,000-44,000, out of a population of around 300,000.  Around 25,000 assembled at Ulundi for the ceremony.  Although there were around 20,000 firearms in Zulu possession by the start of the war, most were obsolete muzzle-loading muskets and the men were not trained in their use. Zulu practice was to use them as secondary weapons, in place of the traditional assegai throwing spear, and to be discarded in favour of closing with the enemy to allow use of the iklwa stabbing spear.\n\n\nBritish invasions of Zululand\nWhen the ultimatum expired, British forces under Lieutenant-General Lord Chelmsford invaded Zululand in three columns.  One of the first actions of the British Centre Column was to attack Sihayo's homestead near the Natal border on 12 January.  Sihayo and the main bulk of his men had already left to join the royal army, but a party of old men and boys offered a determined resistance to the British attack from the cover of rocky and vegetated terrain.  On 22 January the royal army attacked the British camp at Isandlwana, effectively wiping it out and ending the first invasion.  The British Right Column was afterwards besieged by the Zulu at Eshowe while the Left Column remained in the vicinity of Kambula where it engaged local Zulu forces.  Chelmsford requested that reinforcements be sent out from Britain, including a cavalry brigade formed by the 1st King's Dragoon Guards and the 17th (The Duke of Cambridge's Own) Lancers under the command of Major-General Frederick Marshall.\nChelmsford relieved the siege of Eshowe on 3 April and withdrew the Right Column back to the British Colony of Natal.  He reorganised his forces into two main thrusts. The reinforced Right Column was re-designated the 1st Division and was tasked with a steady advance along the east coast.  The survivors of the Centre Column were reinforced with the cavalry brigade and other fresh troops and became the 2nd Division that would advance on the Zulu capital, Ulundi.  The Left Column, which contained a high proportion of colonial irregular horse that fought as mounted infantry, was re-designated as a flying column under Colonel Evelyn Wood.   This column was to operate in conjunction with the 2nd Division, supporting its advance on Ulundi.\n\nBy the end of May, the 2nd Division, commanded by Major-General Edward Newdigate, had advanced from Dundee and was assembled on the banks of the Ncome River at Koppie Allein, ready to begin the invasion.  Chelmsford joined the division on 31 May and commenced the advance into Zululand, simultaneously with Wood further to the north.  On 1 June Napoléon, Prince Imperial of France, who had marched with the 2nd Division, was killed when the patrol he was with was overrun by the Zulu.  The 2nd Division and Wood's flying column made contact on 3 June but continued to camp separately; on 4 June Wood camped at a site near the Nondweni River while the 2nd Division remained a day's march to the west.\nAlso on 4 June, a patrol of Baker's Horse from the flying column encountered a force of several hundred Zulus at eZulaneni, a collection of four large homesteads between the Zungeni Mountain (which was known to the British as Ezunganyan Hill) and the Ntinini stream, south of Wood's camp.  They also identified, at one of the homesteads, three wagons and an ammunition cart which had been captured by the Zulu at Isandlwana. The Zulus formed a skirmish line among the dongas (dry watercourses), thorn trees and mimosa bushes and were engaged by a skirmish line of Baker's Horse.  The Zulus operated in their classic \"horns of the buffalo\" formation and their right \"horn\" crossed a steep-sided donga and came within 30 yards (27 m) of the rear of the British line.  A Zulu volley wounded two men before the men of Baker's Horse could withdraw to Wood's camp.\nWood passed word to Chelmsford that a significant force of Zulus were in the area, implying that this was the long-expected appearance of the Zulu royal army.  Chelmsford ordered the 2nd Division to laager its camp and erect earthworks in anticipation on an imminent attack.  The fear of an imminent action forced the postponement of the court-martial of Lieutenant Jahleel Brenton Carey.  The trial of Carey, in nominal command of the patrol in which the Prince Imperial had been killed, had been ordered by a 4 June court of inquiry headed by Marshall.\n\n\nSkirmish\n\n\nIrregular horse\n\nKeen to confirm if the Zulus encountered at eZulaneni were part of the royal army, a reconnaissance force was sent from the flying column at dawn on 5 June.  This force, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Redvers Buller, included a squadron of Baker's Horse, a squadron of the Frontier Light Horse and a troop of the Natal Light Horse, totalling around 300 men.  At 4:30 am the 2nd Division sent out a force under Marshall's command that included two squadrons of Lancers, a squadron of the King's Dragoon Guards, 130 men of Shepstone's Native Horse and 7 men from No. 3 Troop  (Bettington's Horse) of the Natal Horse, totalling around 500 men.  Marshall's force halted for breakfast at the camp of the flying column before following in Buller's wake.\nBuller's men approached eZulaneni via the eastern flanks of Mahutshane mountain, at the same time mapping a potential wagon route for future use.  It was still early morning when Buller's men came into sight of the Zulus at eZulaneni, and 300 of them formed a skirmish line between the British and the homesteads.  Buller formed his own line, on the opposite side of the Ntinini stream; Baker's Horse formed up on his left, the Frontier Light Horse in the centre and the Natal Light Horse on his right.  Buller then ordered a mounted charge against the Zulus, breaking into a gallop after they had crossed the steep-sided bed of the Ntinini.  The Zulus broke their line and reformed into companies in the cover of the vegetation and dongas at the foot of Zungeni mountain, around 400 yards (370 m) east of the homesteads, from which they opened fire on the British force.\nBuller led most of the Frontier Light Horse and Baker's Horse towards the Zulus as a distraction while the Natal Light Horse set fire to the homesteads.  Buller's men dismounted at the edge of the vegetation and engaged the Zulus from the cover of some nearby anthills.  The British found it hard to discern the Zulus in the cover and had to just fire at the smoke that indicated their position.  Buller observed the action by telescope from atop an anthill and gave the order to withdraw as soon as all the homesteads were on fire.  He had also become aware of the risk of being surrounded, as a party of Zulus who had moved up into a mealie field on his left.\nThe irregulars had to withdraw on foot and mount up under Zulu fire, particularly from the Zulus in the mealie field who were within 80 yards (73 m) of the British horses.  At least one horse was killed and several others wounded, one of which had to be abandoned.  Two men of Baker's Horse were also lightly wounded before Buller's force pulled back.\n\n\nRegular cavalry\n\nAfter leaving the camp of the flying column, Marshall's force followed the sound of gunfire until they found Buller's men retiring from combat at a point around 2,500 yards (2,300 m) west of Zungeni Mountain (and back across the Ntinini).  Marshall's regulars, who had recently arrived in Africa, were eager to see their first action and keen to avenge the death of the Prince Imperial.  Two squadrons of the 17th Lancers under their Colonel Drury Drury-Lowe were committed to an attack on the Zulus.  The lancers approached the mountain in line formation but came under fire as they reached the burning homesteads.  The cavalry passed by the Zulu position several times but were unable to engage them effectively in close combat owing to the difficult terrain.\nThe Zulus held their ground and shot at the passing riders.  The 17th Lancer's adjutant, Lieutenant Frederick John Cokayne Frith, was struck in the heart by a shot from a range of 300 yards (270 m) and killed. The Illustrated London News's correspondent, Melton Prior, witnessed Frith's death and noted he was killed whilst riding between Colonel Drury-Lowe and Francis Francis, correspondent of The Times.  In an 1899 talk on the war, eyewitness Private Miles Gissop of the 17th Lancers recalled that Frith had been shot immediately after Drury-Lowe had reassured his troops: \"you are all right men.  You are all right, they [the bullets] are all passing over your heads\".  Gissop noted that Frith stated, \"Oh I'm shot\", before falling dead from his horse. It was later determined that the bullet that killed Frith had been made in Britain and was fired from a Martini–Henry rifle, both having been captured by the Zulus during earlier engagements.  General Garnet Wolseley, who replaced Chelmsford as commander of British forces in southern Africa in early July, noted in his journal that he was told that Marshall had fainted from excitement when Frith was shot.\nFollowing Frith's death Drury-Lowe dismounted a troop within 150 yards (140 m) of the Zulu skirmishers in the vegetation and began exchanging fire, to little effect.  Again, Zulu forces moved to outflank the British skirmish line.  Marshall spotted the difficulty the Lancers were in and ordered them to retire, sending the squadron of the King's Dragoon Guards across the Ntinini to provide supporting fire from their right flank.  When the Zulu fire declined, the Lancers were able to withdraw with a captain and two troopers carrying Firth's body.  Gissop noted that after the withdrawal some Zulus emerged from the bushes to count the British dead, though Frith was the only one.\n\n\nWithdrawal\nThe Zulu pursued the retiring cavalry in skirmish order, keeping up a constant but ineffective fire.  Some Zulus crossed the Ntinini and entered into a donga on the British flank from which they were able to fire into Buller's irregulars who had offsaddled for a rest.  Although not suffering any injury Buller's men quickly mounted and withdrew over the Mathutshane.  They returned to the flying column, which had moved its camp southwards by 6 miles (9.7 km), burning a number of abandoned Zulu homesteads along the way.\nThe regular cavalry remained on a small plain west of the Ntini and attempted to tempt the Zulus into the open ground by hiding behind a small rise.  This failed as their long lances and fluttering pennons were still visible to the Zulus.  They eventually withdrew to the 2nd Division, which had advanced to the former site of the flying column's camp near the Nondweni River.  The Zulus shadowed the British for several miles but combat was not resumed.  Frith was buried that evening in a mealie field near the Nondweni River camp; the funeral was presided over by Chaplain George Smith and attended by Chelmsford and most of the division's officers.  Zulu casualties during the action are not certain but, on 3 August, a British firewood gathering party found the remains of 25 Zulus in the bushes and grass of the battlefield.  Prior had made a sketch of the moment of Frith's death during the skirmish and an engraving based on this was published on the front page of the 2 August 1879 edition of the Illustrated London News.\n\n\nAftermath\nDuring the day of the action Chelmsford had spoken at the Nondweni River camp with three peace envoys from Cetshwayo; these were sent away in the evening with conditions that Chelmsford knew would be largely unacceptable to Cetshwayo.  From 6 June the camp was developed into a fortified base, known as Fort Newdigate, to support the advance further into Zululand. The action at Zungeni Mountain and the death of the Prince Imperial, who had been a popular figure among the British staff officers, unsettled the men of the 2nd Division.  On the evening of 6 June, a false alarm at Fort Newdigate led to chaos with more than 1,000 rifle shots made from the perimeter and several rounds of artillery canister shot fired.  Seven British soldiers were wounded by friendly fire and several horses killed before order was restored.\nIntelligence gathered during the skirmish at Zungeni proved that the Zulus were not from the main army, whose men had largely returned to their homes after the victory at Isandlwana, but were local levies. Cetshwayo was still hopeful that peace could be negotiated and had delayed the recall of the royal army, now around 20,000 strong, to Ulundi until later in June.  A further raid on Zungeni was mounted on 8 June by a force of lancers, dragoons and two 7-pounder artillery pieces.  This forced the Zulus to withdraw towards Ulundi and lead to the burning of several more homesteads. Carey's delayed court-martial proceeded on 12 June and he was found guilty of \"misbehaviour before the enemy\" and sent home.  On 13 June Chelmsford removed Marshall from the 2nd Division, placing him in command of this lines of communication, Drury-Lowe became the senior cavalry officer with the two columns.\n\nThe 2nd Division and Wood's flying column continued their march into Zululand on 18 June, patrolling regularly to drive off Zulu forces and establishing several more fortified camps.  The Zulu were finally defeated at the 4 July Battle of Ulundi, where a British square stood firm against repeated assaults.  When the Zulus began to falter, Chelmsford ordered Drury-Lowe to lead five troops of lancers and one of sword-armed dragoon guards out of the square.  On an open plain against a spent enemy they proved their worth and swept the battlefield clear to a distance of 3 miles (4.8 km) and killed 150 Zulus.  Drury-Lowe considered the action demonstrated the superiority of the lance over the sword in pursuit conditions.  \nAfter the Ulundi, many of the mounted troops were returned to Natal, though some were kept on for some months to enforce the dismantling of the Zulu kingdom.  The iButho was abolished; Cetshwayo was deposed and his possessions, which included the majority of the cattle in the country, seized.  The kingdom was split into thirteen chiefdoms under rulers loyal to the British, including the white John Robert Dunn, and under the overall supervision of a British resident administrator.  The measures plunged Zululand into chaos with fighting erupting along the boundaries of the new chiefdoms, which had been drawn without care to Zulu social and political groupings. The partition broke down and British attempts to restore Cetshwayo led to the Third Zulu Civil War and annexation of swathes of territory by Transvaal.  After further fighting and rebellion, the remainder of Zululand was annexed to Natal in 1897, with the best land reserved for white settlers and many Zulus forced to become agricultural labourers or miners.  \n\n\nAnalysis\nBritish historian Ian Knight regards the skirmish as an example of the expanded role played in the war by irregular, locally-directed Zulu forces after Isandlwana.  South African historian John Laband notes that while the irregular forces were the only Zulus offering any real resistance to the second invasion, in the early 20th century they were derided by veterans of the royal army who had little praise for men who they considered fought \"in forests and fastnesses\" rather than taking \"up a position in the open and [coming] face to face with the foe\". \nLaband regards the unknown Zulu commander during the skirmish at Zungeni to have displayed excellent tactical command skills and the ability to innovate, which he considers was lacking in the elderly commanders of the Zulu royal army who defaulted to assaults on fortified positions.  Laband notes that at Zungeni the Zulus deployed skirmishing and enfilading tactics and made good use of cover and difficult terrain to engage the technologically superior British force.  This was particularly effective when Zulu marksmen, such as those with pre-war experience of work with hunting parties, were employed with modern weapons such as captured Martini-Henry rifles.\nLaband notes that the skirmish at Zungeni Mountain showed the limitations of the use of regular cavalry armed with melee weapons against the Zulu.  The lancers' large horses were also ill-suited to the terrain of Zululand when compared with the cobs and ponies preferred by the irregulars.  The lancers performed well in the latter stages of the Battle of Ulundi when they rode down withdrawing Zulu forces on an open plain but they were not the right choice for engaging a fresh force of firearm-wielding skirmishers in rough ground.  Laband regards the order by Marshall for the lancers to engage at Zungeni as a mistake, given that the objective of burning eZulaneni had already been achieved.\nThe lancers were armed with carbines and trained to use them dismounted, in a similar manner as Buller's irregulars but considered it an inferior form of combat used by lesser mounted troops.  The lancers had only arrived in Southern Africa in April 1879 and reached Natal in May. They had had little chance to adapt to local conditions and Zulu tactics.  A Times of Natal correspondent and eyewitness to the skirmish compared the tactics of the lancers unfavourably with that of the irregulars, though he commended their gallantry and discipline.\nEngagements such as the action at Zungeni Mountain, together with the skirmish that resulted in the death of the Prince Imperial, were successful in locally and temporarily disrupting the activities of the British and causing embarrassment to Chelmsford, but ultimately had no effect on the outcome of the war.\nLaband notes that the tactics exhibited by the Zulus at Zungeni Mountain resembled those of the most successful Zulu irregular forces, those operating in the north-west of Zululand.  There, partly under the leadership of the renegade Swazi prince Mbilini waMswati, locally-directed Zulu forces inflicted defeats on the British at the Battle of Intombe on 12 March  and the Battle of Hlobane on 28 March.  The Kubheka people of the region, operating as guerrillas from their cave homesteads, became the last Zulu forces to resist the British, not surrendering until 8 September.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nCastle, Ian (2003).

    "summary": "The Zungeni Mountain skirmish took place on 5 June 1879 between British and Zulu forces during the second invasion of Zululand, in what is now part of South Africa, during the later stages of the Anglo-Zulu War.  British irregular horse commanded by Colonel Redvers Buller discovered a force of 300 Zulus at the settlement of eZulaneni near Zungeni Mountain.  The horsemen charged and scattered the Zulus before burning the settlement.  Buller's men withdrew after coming under fire from the Zulus who had threatened to surround them.\nBuller's men were joined by more irregulars and a force of British regular cavalry, under the command of Major-General Frederick Marshall.  Two squadrons of the 17th (The Duke of Cambridge's Own) Lancers, led by Colonel Drury Drury-Lowe, approached the Zulus.  They were not able to close with the Zulus, who were in an area of long grass and bushes, and Zulu fire killed the Lancers' regimental adjutant, Lieutenant Frederick John Cokayne Frith.  Drury-Lowe ordered some of his men to dismount and return fire but again the Zulus threatened to outflank the British and Marshall ordered a withdrawal.  Aside from Frith the British casualties included two irregulars wounded; two months after the battle the remains of 25 Zulus were discovered on the battlefield.  The British paused to fortify their camp before proceeding further into Zululand. They then decisively defeated the Zulu in the 4 July Battle of Ulundi.",

    "text": "\"162 Candles\" is the eighth episode of the first season of The CW television series, The Vampire Diaries and the eighth episode of the series overall. It originally aired on November 5, 2009. The episode was written by Barbie Kligman and Gabrielle Stanton and directed by Rick Bota.\n\n\nPlot\nThe episode starts with Stefan (Paul Wesley) waking up at the living room and hearing noises in the house. He thinks that is Damon (Ian Somerhalder) but it is really his old friend Lexi (Arielle Kebbel) who came to celebrate his birthday. Stefan is happy to see her and he tells her about the recent happenings in Mystic Falls, including Elena (Nina Dobrev) but he does not mention that Elena looks exactly like Katherine.\nAt the police station, Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) interrogates everyone about Vicki's (Kayla Ewell) disappearance. Stefan and Elena match their stories that Stefan was just trying to help her with her drug issues, Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) only remembers the things Damon compelled him to remember and Matt (Zach Roerig) does not know anything other than what Jeremy told him. Matt and Jeremy believe she just left town and even Sheriff is not convinced, there is nothing more she can do. When the interrogations are over, Elena tells Stefan that they should stay away from each other.\nSheriff Forbes works late when Damon arrives at her office to bring her a package (supposedly from uncle Zach) that contains vervain. The Sheriff believes that Zach is out of town, as Damon made them believe, and now he tries to make the members of the council trust him and offers his help. That way, he can learn more things about the council and what they know.\nBonnie (Kat Graham) visits Elena at her bedroom who is down after her break up with Stefan. Bonnie tries to cheer her up by showing her a trick her grandmother taught her and she tells her that she is truly a witch. Bonnie is afraid that Elena will not believe her but Elena does.\nDamon runs into Caroline (Candice Accola) who is still mad at him after the way he treated her. He compels her to throw a party and he also asks her to get his crystal back from Bonnie. Caroline says that she will do it.\nAt the Salvatore house, Stefan and Lexi talk about Elena when Damon shows up to invite them to Caroline's party later. Stefan is not in the mood of partying but Lexi convinces him that they should go. While Stefan gets into the shower, Elena knocks on the door and Lexi calls her in. Lexi is shocked seeing how much she looks like Katherine and Elena is surprised seeing Lexi in a towel and knowing Stefan is in the shower, believing that the two of them slept together and leaves. Lexi immediately runs back to the bedroom and ask Stefan what is wrong with him and why is he after a girl who looks like Katherine's twin sister. Stefan reassures her that Elena has nothing in common with Katherine and Lexi sees that Stefan is really in love with Elena.\nStefan stops by Elena's house before he goes to the party to ask her what she wanted to talk to him about. He realizes what Elena thought seeing Lexi and he explains that she is only a friend — his oldest friend — and she is in town for his birthday. Elena is relieved but she still does not want to go to Caroline's party and declines Stefan's proposal.\nAt the party, Caroline asks Bonnie for the crystal, but Bonnie does not give it back. Caroline tries to take it, but it shocks her the moment she touches it. The two of them argue and Bonnie leaves. When later Damon asks Caroline if she got his crystal back and she tells him no, he tells her that she is useless and shallow and leaves the bar. When he gets out he sees a young couple making out, he attacks them, kills the boy and compels the girl.\nElena changes her mind and arrives at the party seeing Lexi and Stefan having fun while playing pool. Lexi gets to the bar to order some drinks when she sees Elena. She approaches her and the two of them have a nice talk about Stefan making Elena relax a little bit about Stefan being a vampire, to give him some time and he will soon be totally himself around her. When Lexi goes back to Stefan, Stefan thanks her for what she did.\nSheriff Forbes finds the girl who survived Damon's attack and she asks her if she saw anything. The girl nods that she did and the Sheriff asks her to tell her everything.\nBack at the party, a very drunk Caroline sits down with Matt who offers to take her back home. On their way out, they run into the Sheriff who sees that her daughter is drunk. She thanks Matt for offering to take her home and she gets back to work.\nElena finally decides to go and talk to Stefan while Lexi talks with Damon at the bar and asks him why he really is in town. Damon admits that he has a diabolical plan but he refuses to reveal it to her. While they are talking, Sheriff brings in the girl from the attack, who points to Lexi as her attacker. Sheriff walks up to Lexi and injects her with vervain. The cops drag Lexi out of the bar and Stefan, who saw everything, tries to get out to see what is happening.\nLexi throws off the men holding her and as she walks towards the Sheriff, Sheriff shoots her several times with wooden bullets but Lexi is strong and can handle the pain. Just as she is about to reach the Sheriff, Damon shows up and stakes her in heart. Lexi dies while Stefan and Elena watch from afar in shock. Damon whispers to Lexi before she dies that he did it because it was part of his plan. Sheriff thanks Damon for his help and asks him to put Lexi's body in the police car. Damon is relieved that his plan to throw the town off of his and Stefan's scent has worked.\nStefan is furious with Damon after killing Lexi and convinced that Damon will never change he tells Elena that he will go home and kill him. Elena tries to stop him because she knows that Stefan killing his brother will not do any good to him. She tells him that she will be there for him but he warns her to stay away.\nBack at home, Stefan finds Damon waiting for him and the two of them get into a fight. Stefan stakes Damon, but not in the heart, telling him that now they are even; he saved his life once and now he spares his. Stefan walks away and Damon pulls the stake out of his body.\nThe episode ends with Bonnie having a nightmare of her running through a forest. She trips and falls and when she rises her eyes she sees her ancestor Emily (Bianca Lawson) warning her that \"It's coming\". Bonnie wakes up terrified but she is no longer in her bed but in the cemetery, at the Salvatore crypt.\n\n\nFeature music\nIn \"162 Candles\" we can hear the songs:\n\n\"Yet\" by Switchfoot\n\"Love In Your Head\" by The Black Box Revelation\n\"All The World\" by Fauxliage\n\"Tokyo\" by Telekinesis\n\"Escape Me\" by Tiësto\n\"Feel It in My Bones\" by Tiësto\n\"Thinking of You\" by Pete Yorn\n\"Happy Birthday\" by The Birthday Massacre\n\"Too Close\" by Mike Sheridan & Mads Langer\n\n\nReception\n\n\nRatings\nIn its original American broadcast, \"162 Candles\" was watched by 4.09 million; down by 0.09 from the previous episode.\n\n\nReviews\n\"162 Candles\" received positive reviews.\nMatt Richenthal from TV Fanatic gave a good review to the episode saying that \"...it started out slow, but when the action picked up, it really picked up!\"\nJosie Kafka of Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3/4 saying that despite the surprising death of a new character [Lexie] we were just getting to know, the episode was \"pretty damn good\".\nLucia from Heroine TV also gave a good review to the episode saying: \"...this was another thoroughly entertaining episode, with great moments for all the characters involved — even my often-neglected favorites, Matt and Bonnie (hurrah for screen time!).

    "text": "The Mazda MX-6 is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive coupé manufactured and marketed by Mazda from 1987 to 1997 across two generations.\nMechanically identical to the Ford Probe, the Capella/626 and its hatchback platform mate, the Ford Telstar, these cars shared the GD (1988–1992) and GE (1993–1997) platforms. The MX-6 replaced the 626 Coupé, although it continued to share the same chassis.\nThe MX-6, 626, and Ford Probe were manufactured at joint-venture plants either by AutoAlliance in Flat Rock, Michigan, for the North American market, and by Mazda Japan for Asian and European markets.\n\n\nFirst generation (1987–1992)\n\nThe first-generation MX-6 appeared in 1987 and lasted until 1992 in the United States. In some markets, the model years were from 1987 to 1991. It was based on a series of futuristic sports compact concept cars of the early 1980s. It was a large coupé, based on the Mazda GD platform, and was powered by the inline-four Mazda F engines. It used the Mazda G4A-EL four-speed electronic-shift automatic transmission.\nThe US market made use of the F2 2.2-liter engine, with the base engine producing 110 hp (82 kW). The turbocharged option produces 145 hp (108 kW). European and Japanese market versions were shipped with either the 1.8 L F8 or the 2.0 L FE or FE-DOHC DOHC engines.\nThe MX-6 was produced with two transmission options, a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic with overdrive.\nThis generation was available in several trim levels, which differed depending on the market in which the vehicle was sold. In the United States, the MX-6 was available in DX, LX, LE, and GT trim levels:\n\nDX was the \"bare bones\" model, offering the base 110 hp (82 kW) and 130 lb⋅ft (176 N⋅m) F2 2.2 L engine and few options, but most MX-6s sold in the US were equipped with air conditioning.\nLX added power windows, power locks, and power mirrors, as well as an optional electric moonroof.\nLE was a rare \"Luxury or Leather Edition\" model that was the same as the LX, but included leather seating surfaces and a leather-wrapped shift knob on manual transmission-equipped vehicles.\nGT included all options from the LX, but also stepped up to the F2T 2.2 L turbocharged, intercooled engine, which put out 145 hp (108 kW) and 190 lb⋅ft (258 N⋅m) of torque delivering a significant performance boost. It also had four-wheel disc brakes with ABS as optional, and three-way electronically adjustable suspension, dubbed AAS.\nIn 1989, Mazda offered a special four-wheel steering (commonly abbreviated 4WS) option on MX-6 GTs destined for the U.S. This system consisted of an electronically controlled rear steering rack that turned the rear wheels opposite to the fronts at low speeds to improve cornering, and turned the rear wheels with the fronts at high speeds to improve highway lane change maneuvering. This option was available through all years for GT models in other markets.\nEuropean specification vehicles shipped as the 626 Coupé and commonly received either the 1.8 L SOHC F8 or 2.0 L SOHC FE engine in GLX models, or the 2.0 L FE-DOHC engine in their GT models. 4WS was a common option for European 626 Coupés. Australian vehicles were almost always equipped with the 2.2 L turbocharged F2T engine as the US models, as well as 4WS. They also carried the MX-6 name of the American models.\nJapanese specification vehicles were shipped as the Capella C2 and were available in several trims, most notably GT-R (FE-DOHC and 4WS), GT-X (FE-DOHC and AAS), or GT-S (F8 and 4WS or AAS). In other parts of East Asia, the MX-6 name was also used.\nNew Zealand received vehicles in either European or Australian specification, selectable on order. As such, New Zealand-market GTs can have either the F2T 2.2 L turbocharged engine or the FE-DOHC 2.0 L DOHC, with optional 4WS.\n\n\nSecond generation (GE; 1991–1997)\n\nMazda launched the second generation MX-6 using the GE platform, shared by the 626 and Ford rebadged cars, the Ford Probe and the Ford Telstar.\nIt was released in three distinct variants worldwide, known as A-spec, E-spec, and J-spec, which relates to their destined markets – U.S., Europe, and Japan, respectively.\n\n\nA-spec\nThe A-spec variant for the North American market was manufactured alongside the Ford Probe and Mazda 626 from 1992 as a 1993 model by AutoAlliance International in Flat Rock, Michigan. Three trim levels were available on the A-spec models:\n\nRS – Base model, fitted with the FS-DE 2.0 DOHC I4 engine, making 118 hp (88 kW).\nLS – Luxury model, fitted with the KL-DE 2.5 DOHC V6 engine, making 164 hp (122 kW). It was also equipped with alloy wheels, a low rear spoiler, an optional CD player, foglights, and leather or cloth interior.\nLS M-edition – A special edition based on the LS, including different, all-red tail lights, chrome scuff plates, an in-dash three-disc CD changer, gold alloy wheels (same design as LS), all gold badges, and M-edition embroidered on the front seats and floor mats. M-editions only came in three paint colors: a trim exclusive burgundy, black, and white. All had cream leather interiors and special gold pinstriping. The A-spec models never received 4WS.\nIn 1995, the second generation MX-6 was refreshed with different five-spoke alloy wheels, and emissions changes. Another major change after 1995 was the addition of OBD-II to the car. With this addition, the 164 hp (122 kW) was decreased to 160 hp (120 kW) for every year thereafter. Known as the \"GE2\", this model ran until 1997. Unlike the first generation, the second-generation MX-6 only had one model with a different moniker – the Canadian MX-6 Mystère.\n\n\nE-spec\nBuilt from 1991 in Japan, for Australia, New Zealand, and Europe, compared to the A-spec, the E-spec has different headlights (a two-piece projector setup giving far greater lighting) and taillights, different front and rear bumpers, fog lights, wing-mirrors (power and heated), steering wheel, interior trim, and alloys as standard. The side indicator lights were mounted behind the front wheels, and no corner bumper lights were used. It also came with optional air conditioning and leather interior (standard from '96), and the MX-6's main act – the 4WS system (not available in the UK). The engine was the same as the U.S. version (although not limited by lower-octane fuels) – the KL-DE 2.5 DOHC V6 engine, making 165 PS (121 kW) and with the higher octane fuels used in Europe as standard, slightly lower mileage but with greater performance.\nIn Australia, the MX-6 was released in November 1991. Only one trim was available. Equipped with the KL-DE 2.5 DOHC V6 engine, sunroof, 4WS, etc., with the only remaining options being leather and electric seats. September 1994 was the release of the GE2 update model. Like Mazda Australia did with the GD2, now two choices were available – the 4WS, all-options MX-6, or the 2WS version. They both had new wheels, interior trim, and steering wheel, but only the 4WS version got the sunroof, CD player, leather (which actually only became standard in late '96), and the digital climate control. The MX-6 lasted until 1997, with the last few rolling out of dealers in 1998. The last one rolled off the assembly line on June 20, 1997.\n\n\nJ-spec\n\nThis version was also released in 1991, and is very similar to the E-spec (as they are built in the same place), but with minor changes. The version sold in Japan was exclusive to Japanese Mazda dealerships, and was not badge engineered and sold at other Mazda Japanese dealerships, unlike the MX-3, the MX-5, and the RX-7 coupes. One-piece headlights were fitted, with indicators incorporated in the fog light housing, as well as a different rear bumper with smaller registration plate cutout, similar to the A-spec. Almost everything was an option, but the 4WS was available, as well as the digital climate control, electric folding mirrors, larger centre console, and of course, the Mazdaspeed body add-ons – a subtle lip kit with Supra-style high-rise rear spoiler.\nEngine choice was the KL-ZE 2.5 DOHC V6 making 200 PS (147 kW), a high-compression version of the KL-DE, or the KF-ZE 2.0 DOHC V6 making 160 PS (118 kW); all of the K-series engines in the MX-6 were based on the same engine block and included those found in the Ford Probe, Xedos 6, and MX-3 V6 models. The KLZE had about 40 more horsepower than the KLDE versions for a few reasons. Although the displacement was the same, the KLZE had more durations on the cams, higher compression due to a different shape of pistons, and the intake manifold was different on the ZE. The KL-ZE intake manifold runners were shorter and wider than the KL-DE manifold. Also, the heads on the KL-ZE were ported and shaped differently. Not only was the ZE higher in compression, but it was also a higher-revving engine. The only flaws in the KL-ZE design were the weaker valve springs on the intake valves. This is usually corrected by using the KL-DE springs, keepers, and retainers which are stronger.\nFour-wheel steering was used from 1987 to 1998 on both MX-6 GT and GE models. Four-wheel steering (4WS) was available on both the first-generation and second-generation MX-6 models, although the North American market only received it for the 1989 GT model. South African MX-6s never received 4WS.\nAccording to Mazda, the system provided:\n\nSuperior cornering stability\nImproved steering responsiveness and precision\nHigh-speed straight-line stability\nNotable improvement in rapid lane-changing maneuvers\nSmaller turning radius and tight-space maneuverability at low vehicle speed range\nThe system electronically controlled a rear rack that was behind the rear wheels. At low speeds (up to 35 km/h), the rear wheels move in the opposite direction from the front wheels, aiding parking and U-turns by lowering the turning circle. Above these speeds, the rear wheels move in the same direction as the front, meaning control during high-speed maneuvers such as lane changes or cornering was improved. Either way, the turning angle of the rear wheels was slight at just 5°, a measurement Mazda determined to be optimally effective and natural to human sensitivity.\n\nWhen the engine is turned off, the rear wheels straighten up. They change back to the angle of the front wheels when the engine is restarted. This is caused by the 4WS control unit powering down, and the fail-safe system overriding the rear rack.\nIf the system ever faults, as a fail-safe, the rear wheels lock straight to allow the vehicle normal 2WS functionality.\n\n\nModels\n\n\nFuture\nOn 16 October 2018, Mazda filed a trademark application with the Japanese Patent Office for the Mazda MX-6 nameplate which can be used for \"automobiles and parts and accessories thereof,\" hinting that the manufacturer may release a new generation MX-6 in the near future.\n\n\nReferences\n\nPatrick Bedard. \"Mazda MX-6 LS\".

    "title": "Enrique Peña Nieto",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2708922",
    "text": "Enrique Peña Nieto  (Spanish pronunciation: [enˈrike ˈpeɲa ˈnjeto] ; born 20 July 1966), commonly referred to by his initials EPN, is a Mexican former politician and lawyer who served as the 64th president of Mexico from 2012 to 2018. A member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), he previously was Governor of the State of Mexico from 2005 to 2011, local deputy from 2003 to 2004, and Secretary of Administration from 2000 to 2002.\nBorn in Atlacomulco and raised in Toluca, Peña Nieto attended Panamerican University, graduating with a B.A. in legal studies. After attaining an MBA from ITESM, he began his political career by joining the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1984. After serving as a public notary in Mexico City, he began an ascent through local political ranks in the late 1990s, culminating in his 2005 campaign for Governor of the State of Mexico. As governor, he pledged to deliver 608 compromisos (commitments) to his constituency to varying levels of success. His tenure  was marked by low-to-moderate approval of his handling of a rising murder rate, the San Salvador Atenco civil unrest, and various public health issues. He launched his 2012 presidential campaign on a platform of economic competitiveness and open government. After performing well in polls and a series of high-profile candidate withdrawals, Peña Nieto was elected president with 38.14% of the vote.\nAs president, he instated the multilateral Pact for Mexico, which soothed inter-party fighting and increased legislation across the political spectrum. During his first four years,  Peña Nieto led a breakup of state monopolies, liberalized Mexico's energy sector, instituted public education reforms, and modernized the country's financial regulation. However, political gridlock and allegations of media control gradually worsened, along with corruption, crime, and drug trade in Mexico. Global drops in oil prices limited the success of his economic reforms. His handling of the Iguala mass kidnapping in 2014 and the escape of drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán from Altiplano prison in 2015 sparked international criticism. Guzmán himself claims to have bribed Peña Nieto during his trial. As of 2022, he is additionally part of the Odebrecht controversy, with former Pemex CEO Emilio Lozoya Austin declaring that Peña Nieto's presidential campaign benefited from illegal campaign funds provided by Odebrecht in exchange for securing public contracts and political favors.\nHistorical evaluations and approval rates of his presidency have been mostly negative. Detractors highlight a series of failed policies and a strained public presence, while supporters note increased economic competitiveness and loosening of gridlock. He began his term with an approval rate of 50%, hovered around 35% during his inter-years, and finally bottomed out at 12% in January 2017. He left office with an approval rating of only 18% and 77% disapproval. Peña Nieto is seen as one of the most controversial and least popular presidents in the history of Mexico. \n\n\nEarly life and education\nEnrique Peña Nieto was born on 20 July 1966 in Atlacomulco, State of Mexico, a city 55 miles (89 km) northwest of Mexico City. He is the oldest of four siblings; his father, Gilberto Enrique Peña del Mazo, was an electrical engineer; his mother, María del Perpetuo Socorro Ofelia Nieto Sánchez, was a schoolteacher. He is the nephew of two former governors of the State of México: on his mother's side, Arturo Montiel; on his father's, Alfredo del Mazo González. He attended Denis Hall School in Alfred, Maine, during one year of junior high school in 1979 to learn English. After living in Atlacomulco for the first 11 years of his life, Peña Nieto's family moved to the city of Toluca.\nIn 1975, his father often took him to the campaign rallies of the State of Mexico's governor, Jorge Jiménez Cantú, a close friend of Peña del Mazo. The governor's successor was Alfredo del Mazo González, a cousin of Peña Nieto's father. During Del Mazo González's campaign in 1982, the fifteen-year-old Peña Nieto had his first direct contact with Mexican politics: he began delivering campaign literature in favor of his relative, a memory Peña Nieto recalls as the turning point and start of his deep interest in politics.\nIn 1985 at the age of 18, Peña Nieto traveled to Mexico City and enrolled in the Panamerican University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in legal studies. Peña Nieto's academic thesis was found to contain some improper citations and plagiarism, which stirred controversy in May 2016. Peña Nieto sought a master's degree in Business Administration (MBA) at the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), based in the State of Mexico.\n\n\nPolitical beginnings\n\nPeña Nieto joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1984, and with a law degree nearly completed, he began earning his own money. During his final years in college, Peña Nieto worked for a public notary in Mexico City, around the same time his relative Alfredo del Mazo González was mentioned as a firm candidate for the 1988 presidential elections. In his twenties, he worked at the San Luis Industrial Corporation, an auto parts manufacturer, and the law firm Laffan, Muse, and Kaye. While still a student at the Universidad Panamericana, he roomed with Eustaquio de Nicolás, the current president of Homex, a leading Mexican construction and real estate company. He also befriended and roomed with Luis Miranda, who occupied several offices during the 1999–2000 administration in the State of Mexico.\nPeña Nieto formally started his political career under the mentorship of Montiel Rojas, becoming the Secretary of the Citizen Movement of Zone I of the State Directive Committee of the National Confederation of Popular Organizations (CNOP), one of the three sectors of the PRI. For three consecutive years, Peña Nieto participated as a delegate to the Organization and Citizen Front in different municipalities of the State of Mexico. Then, between 1993 and 1998, during Emilio Chuayfett's term as governor, Peña Nieto was chief of staff and personal secretary to Montiel Rojas, the Secretary of Economic Development of the State of Mexico.\nAfter 1999, Peña Nieto went from having low-level secretary positions to higher and more qualified offices. He served from 1999 to 2000 as the sub-secretary of government, and as financial sub-coordinator of the political campaign of Montiel Rojas. In 2001, Montiel Rojas named Peña Nieto Sub-secretary of Interior in the State of Mexico, a position that granted him the opportunity to meet and forge relationships with top PRI politicians and business leaders. After his term concluded, he served as the administrative secretary, president of the Directive Council of Social Security, president of the Internal Council of Health, and vice president of the National System for Integral Family Development – all in the State of Mexico. Under the wing of Montiel Rojas, Peña Nieto formed a group known as the \"Golden Boys of Atlacomulco\" with other members of the PRI.\n\n\nCampaign for Governor\nPeña Nieto was elected to a local deputy position in his hometown of Atlacomulco, State of Mexico, in 2003. Two years later, the governorship of the State of Mexico was sought by Atlacomulco-natives Carlos Hank Rhon, Isidro Pastor, Héctor Luna de la Vega, Guillermo González Martínez, Óscar Gustavo Cárdenas Monroy, Eduardo Bernal Martínez, Cuauhtémoc García Ortega and Fernando Alberto García Cuevas. Peña Nieto was among the crowd but was not poised as one of the favorites. Nonetheless, in 2005, Peña Nieto was the last man standing, succeeding Montiel Rojas as governor of the State of Mexico. On 12 February 2005, with 15,000 supporters in attendance, he was sworn in as a candidate for the PRI.\n\n\nGovernor of the State of Mexico (2005–2011)\n\nOn 15 September 2005, Peña Nieto was sworn in as governor of the State of Mexico at the Morelos Theater in Toluca. Among the attendees were the outgoing governor, Arturo Montiel; the president of the Superior Court of Justice, José Castillo Ambriz; former governors, members of Peña Nieto's cabinet and party; mayors, businessmen, and church figures. The centerpiece of Peña Nieto's governorship was his claim that he was to deliver his compromisos – 608 promises he signed in front of a notary to convince voters that he would deliver results and be an effective leader. According to El Universal, during Peña Nieto's first year as governor, his administration delivered 10 of the structural promises he had advocated in his campaign – marking the lowest figure in his six-year term.\nBy 2006, his administration carried out 141 promised projects, making that year the most active in the governor's term. The 608 projects Peña Nieto proposed included creating highways, building hospitals, and creating adequate water systems to provide fresh water throughout the state. The most important was highway infrastructure, which tripled under Peña's government. By mid-2011, the official page of the State of Mexico noted that only two projects were left. The major projects in public transportation were the Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area and the \"Mexibús,\" both of which served commuters between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, providing service to more than 300,000 people every day and 100 million a year. Regarding public health services, 196 hospitals and medical centers were built throughout the state, and the number of mobile units used to attend remote and vulnerable areas doubled. Deaths caused by respiratory diseases were reduced by 55%, while deaths caused by dysentery and cervical cancer were reduced by 68% and 25% respectively. In addition, between 2005 and 2011, the State of Mexico was able to fulfill the requirement of the World Health Organization of having one doctor for every 1,000 inhabitants. The funds for these and all the other commitments were obtained through restructuring the state's public debt, a strategy designed by his first Secretary of Finance, Luis Videgaray Caso. The restructuring also managed to keep the debt from increasing during Peña Nieto's term because the tax base was broadened to the point that it doubled in six years.\nPeña Nieto also claimed that he halved the murder rate in the State of Mexico during his time as governor, but retracted this claim after The Economist showed that the murder rate did not diminish and was being measured differently.\nThe Yo Soy 132 student movement criticized Peña Nieto for his stance on the San Salvador Atenco unrest, which occurred during his term as governor. A report from the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) stated protestors were subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests, and sexual assault, and remarked on the excessive use of force by state and federal police. Peña Nieto stated in an interview that he does not justify the actions of the state and municipal forces, but also mentioned that they were not gladly received by the citizens of San Salvador Atenco upon their arrival.\n\n\nPresidential campaign\n\nOn 23 November 2011, Peña Nieto attended a book fair in Casa del Lago, Mexico City. There he presented his book México, la gran esperanza (Mexico, the great hope). He was accompanied by the writer Héctor Aguilar Camín, the former governor of Mexico's Central Bank, Guillermo Ortiz Martínez, and the journalist Jaime Sánchez Susarrey. In the book, Peña Nieto argued that Mexico needed to expand its economy to create more jobs, insisting that in the past, the country had only created jobs in the informal sector. Additionally, he argued that promoting Pemex (Mexico's state-owned oil company) to compete in the private sector would create more jobs, elevate productivity, and balance wealth distribution across Mexico. Peña Nieto dedicated the book to his wife Angélica Rivera and to governor Eruviel Ávila Villegas and his family. Peña Nieto said that the return of the PRI marks a new era in Mexico and that his book served as a starting point to take Mexico \"to better horizons\".\nOn 27 November 2011, a few days after the book fair, Peña Nieto was the PRI's last standing nominee for the 2012 Mexican presidential elections. The former State of Mexico governor completed his nomination at an event that gathered sympathizers and politicians. Six days earlier, the senator and preliminary candidate of the PRI, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, withdrew from the race and gave Peña Nieto a clear path toward the presidency. During a book fair a month later, Peña Nieto's public image came into question after he struggled to answer a question that asked which three books had marked his life. Later, Peña Nieto was interviewed by El País and admitted that he did not know the price of tortillas. When he was criticized as being out of touch, Peña Nieto insisted that he was not \"the woman of the household\" and thus would not know the price.\nHis campaign was supported by the Commitment to Mexico alliance.\n\n\nElections\n\nOn 1 July 2012, Mexico's presidential election took place. In an initial, partial count issued that night, the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) announced that based on a fast vote counting, Peña Nieto was leading the election with 38% of the votes. His nearest competitor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was just 6 points behind him. The figures were meant to be a representative sample of the votes nationwide, but shortly after this announcement, Peña Nieto appeared on national television claiming victory. \"This Sunday, Mexico won,\" he said. He thanked his voters and promised to run a government \"responsible and open to criticism.\" At the PRI headquarters in Mexico City, the victory party began. With more than 97% of the votes counted on election day, the PRI had won with about 38% of the votes, 6.4 points above the leftist candidate López Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), who refused to concede to the results and had threatened to challenge the outcome, criticizing the PRI for allegedly engaging in vote buying and receiving illegal campaign contributions.\n\n\nPresidency (2012–2018)\n\nPeña Nieto was sworn in as President of Mexico on 1 December 2012 at the federal congress and later flew to a military parade to formally take control of the armed forces. During his inauguration speech at the National Palace, Peña Nieto proposed his agendas and reforms for the new administration. Before and after the inauguration, in an event that has been labeled by the media as the 1DMX, protesters rioted outside of the National Palace and clashed with Federal Police forces, vandalizing hotel structures and setting fires in downtown Mexico City. More than 90 protesters were arrested, and several were injured. Mayor Marcelo Ebrard blamed \"anarchist groups\" for the violence. However, there is evidence that agents of provocation worked with the police, and paid 300 Mexican pesos (about US$20) for their acts of vandalism, according to media reports. Photos show protesters waiting in groups behind police lines before the violence. Previous protests had been entirely peaceful, but on this occasion, in apparent response to violence, the police fired rubber bullets. The day after his inauguration, Peña Nieto announced the Pact for Mexico, an agreement that he had struck with the leaders of the two other major parties at the time, Jesús Zambrano Grijalva of the Party of the Democratic Revolution and Gustavo Madero Muñoz of the National Action Party, about the government's goals for the next few years. On 1 December 2018, Enrique Peña Nieto left office and was succeeded by Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\n\nEconomic policy\n\nThe auto manufacturing industry expanded rapidly under Nieto's presidency. In 2014, more than US$10 billion was committed to investment in the sector. In conjunction with Kia Motors in August 2014, the president announced plans for Kia to build a US$1 billion factory in Nuevo León. At the time, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan were already building a US$1.4 billion plant near Puebla, while BMW was planning a US$1 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosí. Audi began building a US$1.3 billion factory near Puebla in 2013. As of December 2014, two years into Peña Nieto's term, total investment in the auto sector in Mexico had reached US$19 billion. The Bajío Region has received the majority of this investment, and with its rapidly expanding aerospace industry has become the fastest-growing region in the country. In February 2014, Time was met with controversy for the release of a cover featuring Enrique Peña Nieto with the caption \"Saving Mexico\" (written by Michael Crowley), as the cover article's title inside the magazine. The controversial article praised the president and his cabinet for reforms like opening oil fields for foreign investment for the first time in 75 years (a reform towards which Mexican citizens have shown mixed feelings), ending the Mexican drug wars (which was not completely accurate), and even going as far as saying \"the opposition party blocked major reforms that were necessary,\" that \"American leaders could learn a thing or two from their resurgent southern neighbor\" and saying Mexicans citizens' \"alarms were replaced with applause.\"\nAccording to the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), between December 2012 and June 2016, more than two million jobs were created in Mexico. Women comprised 41% of those jobs, and individuals between 20 and 34 took 36%. IMSS also revealed that 86% were long-term jobs and 14% were temporary. These jobs have led to a 26% increase in revenue accumulation for IMSS, an additional MXN$50 billion. More than half a million jobs had salaries worth five minimum wages (about MXN$10,000 per month) and there was a 22% increase in jobs with salaries greater than 20 minimum wages.\n\n\nSpecial economic zones\n\nAt the end of May 2016, Peña Nieto signed a law to create special economic zones in economically depressed southern states. The first three are Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán; Port Chiapas, Chiapas; and in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to better join the ports of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz and Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. Another zone in the petroleum region of Tabasco and Campeche, hit by the downturn in the oil industry, is planned for 2017.\nThe special economic zones are meant to alleviate the lack of industry in the South. During the signing, Peña Nieto highlighted the difference between the South and the industrial North and Center of Mexico: two of every three people in extreme poverty in Mexico live in the southern states. While the three poorest states (Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero) have about 10% of the population, they receive just $1 of every $36 in foreign direct investment in the country. He went on to say that there are two Mexicos: one \"that competes and wins in the global economy, with growing levels of income, development and well-being.\" At the same time, the other Mexico \"has been left behind [and] hasn't been able to take advantage of its potential.\"\nThe special economic zones will offer tax incentives (exemption from the 16% VAT), trade and customs benefits, and the streamlining of regulatory processes. There will also be an increase in infrastructure spending in these regions. Private administrators will run the zones on 40-year contracts (managing infrastructure and attracting tenants). According to Peña Nieto, at the latest, each of these zones will have an anchor tenant that will attract suppliers and other industries in the supply chain by 2018. The World Bank advised Mexico during the formulation of the special economic zones plan.\n\n\nDomestic policy\n\nPeña Nieto enacted a public education reform that aimed to curb the powerful teachers' union, Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), improve standards, centralize the process for hiring, evaluating, promoting, and retaining teachers, and crack down on corruption – such as wages for non-existent \"ghost teachers\". Five years after its signing, the plan has barely affected standards: Mexico still ranks last in education among the 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and the Secretariat of Public Education spent more money on communications (2,700% more on communications in 2017 than was budgeted) than on teacher training.\n\n\nSecurity policy\n\nWhile campaigning, Peña Nieto appointed a former general of the National Police of Colombia as his external advisor for public security and promised to reduce the murder rate in Mexico by 50% by the end of his six-year term. Critics of Peña Nieto's security strategy, however, said that he offered \"little sense\" in exactly how he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wondered whether he was holding back politically sensitive details or simply did not know how he would attempt to squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war. United States officials were worried that the election of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party may mean a return to the old PRI tactics of \"corruption [and] backroom deals\" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.\n\nIn 2012, the president-elect emphasized that he did not support the involvement or presence of armed United States agents in Mexico but considered allowing the United States to instruct Mexico's military training in counterinsurgency tactics. Beyond that, Peña Nieto promised that the States would take no other measures in Mexico.\nThe security policy of Peña Nieto prioritized the reduction of violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking a departure from the strategy of the previous six years during Felipe Calderón's administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their shipments.\nOn 13 December 2012, a law that included far-reaching security reforms was approved. Mexico's Interior Ministry, greatly strengthened by the bill, was solely responsible for public security. Part of Peña Nieto's strategy consists of the creation of a national police of 40,000 members, known as a \"gendarmerie.\" The Economist reported that the gendarmerie would have an initial strength of 10,000. Still, the Washington Office on Latin America reported that it was reduced to 5,000 members and would not be operational until July 2014. The Interior Ministry announced that 15 specialized police units were being formed to exclusively focus on major crimes that include kidnapping and extortion, along with a new task force dedicated to tracking missing persons. Peña Nieto also proposed centralizing the sub-federal police forces under one command.\nIn December 2017, the Law of Internal Security was passed by legislation. Still, it was met with criticism, especially from the National Human Rights Commission, accusing it of giving the President a blank check.\n\n\nEnergy policy\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Peña Nieto promised to allow private investment in Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company. He also indicated interest in an economic agreement with Petrobras, Brazil's oil company. By liberalizing Pemex, investors say Peña Nieto's proposal could allow joint ventures and private investment in the oil company.\nAccording to the Financial Times in 2012, Peña Nieto's PRI government, which held just over 38% of the votes in Congress, might have difficulty gaining a majority to pass such reforms, or the two-thirds majority needed to change the Mexican constitution. Pemex was founded through the nationalization of foreign oil interests, and the Mexican constitution bans major outside investments. Changing Pemex could transform the psychology of Mexico's business sector and involve cultural and political changes that cannot be rushed. President Lázaro Cárdenas led the expropriation of foreign oil company assets in 1938 to form Pemex, which has served as a symbol of national identity.\nEric Martin of Bloomberg News stated that if Peña Nieto wants to invite investment, he must face the challenges of union leaders and local officials who have benefited from the oil company's bonanza. Productivity in Pemex has been declined in the 2000s. Peña Nieto declared while campaigning that overhauling Pemex will be the PRI's and his \"signature issue,\" and that he will encourage private companies to invest in exploration and development activities. Following Peña Nieto's hike in the price of gasoline as a result of his privatization of the Mexican oil industry, protests erupted nationwide. Protestors blockaded major highways, forced the closing of foreign borders, and shut down gas stations.\n\n\nForeign policy\n\n\n2016 visit by Donald Trump\n \n\nPeña Nieto invited U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to visit on 31 August 2016 and appeared with him in a press conference. Peña Nieto was criticized for extending the invitation to Trump, and following the conference, journalist Jorge Ramos criticized Peña Nieto for not using the opportunity to publicly contradict Trump's campaign promise to make Mexico pay for his proposed Mexico–United States border wall, as well as what Ramos called, Trump's \"attacks on Latin American immigrants, his rejection of free trade agreements and his scorn for global organizations.\" Despite this, Peña Nieto stated on his Twitter that he made it clear to Trump that Mexico would not pay for the wall, only to shortly after get a reply from Donald Trump saying: \"Mexico will pay for the wall!\"\n\n\nTrump's presidency and border wall\n\nPeña Nieto and Trump were to meet on 26 January 2017, until Trump wrote on his Twitter account: \"If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\" This directly led Peña Nieto to cancel his visit to the U.S. president. In an interview with Aristegui Noticias, Washington-based freelance journalist Dolia Estévez said she obtained access to part of a one-hour phone conversation between the two presidents the day of the scheduled meeting. She stated, \"Trump humiliated Peña Nieto\" and said the conversation only lasted 20 minutes. She also explained that the speech was prolonged to an hour due to translation efforts because Trump does not speak Spanish and likewise Peña Nieto does not understand English. While many media outlets praised Peña Nieto for canceling the visit with Trump, Forbes Mexico stated that despite showing support toward Peña Nieto for canceling such an event, \"that shouldn't translate in forgiveness to what happens within our country [Mexico]\" adding that \"a state incapable of bringing credibility and stability could not grow\", and that more than Trump, the thing keeping Mexico from prosperity was the corruption within the Mexican government.\n\n\nControversies\n\n\nPublicity and public image\n\nAs of July 2017, Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Research Project claimed Mexico's social media manipulation (Peñabots) to come directly from the Mexican government itself.\nA December 2017 article in The New York Times reported Enrique Peña Nieto spent about 2 billion dollars on publicity during his first five years as president, the largest publicity budget ever spent by a Mexican President.\n\n\nIguala mass kidnapping\n\nIn September 2014, 43 male college students were forcibly taken and then disappeared in Guerrero. The forced mass disappearance of the students arguably became the biggest political and public security scandal Peña Nieto faced during his administration. It led to nationwide protests and international condemnation, particularly in Guerrero and Mexico City.\n\n\nFreedom of the press\nDuring his tenure as president, Peña Nieto has been accused of failing to protect journalists, whose deaths have been speculated to be politically triggered by officials attempting to prevent coverage of scandals. On 29 April 2017, The New York Times published a news report titled \"In Mexico, 'It's Easy to Kill a Journalist,'\" which covered the high rate of deaths and disappearances of journalists in Mexico and declared Mexico had become \"one of the worst countries in the world to be a journalist today.\"\nIn November 2014, an article was published by journalist Carmen Aristegui, indicating that a $7 million \"White House\" owned by Enrique Peña Nieto and his wife Angelica Rivera, in Lomas de Chapultepec was registered under the name of a company affiliated with a business group that had received government contracts to build a bullet train. The revelation of the potential conflict of interest in the acquisition of the house aggravated discontent about the government. Rivera released a video detailing her income as a former soap opera actress, stating that she was selling the house and that the property was not under her name because she had not made the full payment yet. She later deleted the video. Shortly after revealing the Mexican White House incident, Carmen Aristegui was controversially fired from her radio show at MVS Communications. As noted by The New York Times, Aristegui being fired was perceived as censorship toward news journalism and freedom of speech. Aristegui took it to trial and by June 2018, three years after MVS fired her, the jury determined that it was indeed unconstitutional and against the law, to fire her and indeed was an act of censorship towards the freedom of speech. Peña Nieto's successor in the presidency of Mexico, Andres Manuel López Obrador, promised Aristegui would be free to return to radio if she wanted and that there would be no more unfair censorship towards the freedom of speech.\nOn 19 June 2017, The New York Times, in conjunction with Carmen Aristegui and Televisa news reporter Carlos Loret de Mola, reported that the Mexican government had used the Pegasus spyware to surveil targets such as reporters, human rights leaders, and anti-corruption activists using text messages as lures. From 2011 to 2017, the Mexican government spent $80 million on spyware. Pegasus infiltrates a person's cell phone and reports on their messages, e-mails, contacts, and calendars.\nIn 2016, Aristegui revealed in a special report arguing that Enrique Peña Nieto had committed plagiarism in his law thesis, at least a third of it, with 197 out of 682 paragraphs being unsourced or wrongly sourced works.\n\n\nAllegations of corruption\n\nIn October 2017, Santiago Nieto Castillo, the head of the Office for Election-related Crimes (FEPADE), was controversially removed from office, shortly after opening an investigation into illicit campaign money during the 2012 presidential campaign, received by Peña Nieto and would be president of Pemex, Emilio Lozoya Austin from the Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht. In December 2017, The New York Times published accusations that Peña Nieto's government was blocking investigations against public corruption, with a commissioner saying the government was preventing the establishment of an impartial leader in FEPADE. 22 ex-governors, all members of the PRI, were investigated for corruption with five jailed.\nIn March 2018, during the campaign period for the 2018 presidential election, the Prosecutor General's Office (PGR) opened an investigation into the PAN's candidate, Ricardo Anaya, for money laundering. Santiago Nieto said that the accusations toward Anaya were minor in comparison to the Odebrecht and Peña Nieto scandal, as well as the SEDESOL scandal (in which 435 million pesos were lost) or the corruption amongst governors from the PRI such as Javier Duarte and César Duarte Jáquez (both who were later arrested). Santiago Nieto further charged that the PGR and FEPADE were not being neutral and were instead being used as tools by Peña Nieto's government to tamper with the upcoming election, by investigating Anaya, a political opponent, and not José Antonio Meade, a political ally.\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Santiago Nieto would later reveal that Peña Nieto's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused by saying, \"Sorry, but I can't receive any money from Peña Nieto.\" He subsequently received threatening calls with the words \"Death follows you\" and \"Words of advice: stay out of Trouble.\"\nThe Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht, which is accused of corruption and bribes throughout Latin America, is under investigation for allegedly overriding Peña Nieto's presidential campaign with illegal campaign funds. In exchange for campaign funds, the Peña Nieto administration allegedly granted contracts to Odebrecht through state-owned Pemex. An Odebrecht employee told a Brazilian court that he had been asked to pay a bribe to Lozoya, then head of Pemex. In March 2018, PRI legislators voted to stop the investigation into Odebrecht, which drew criticism. The investigation against Emilio Loyoza, then-head of Pemex, was also controversially ceased after a judge ordered it days later.\nWhile in office, Peña Nieto invoked two constitutional rights related to prosecution: amparo and fuero. Amparo gives anyone accused of a crime the right to know which crimes they are being accused of; it is mostly used by people expecting to go to trial and allows the prosecuted person to build a defense with the help of a lawyer. Fuero protects political figures from prosecution committed during their time in office, in effect delaying any investigations against him until the end of their terms. Peña Nieto is the first Mexican president to invoke either right.\nIn 2020, Lozoya was detained by the Mexican government. In his trial statements, he testified against Peña Nieto and Luis Videgaray (the former Minister of Finance during Peña's government). He detailed that following Peña's orders, he acted as the middle-man between Peña Nieto and Odebrecht, stating that Peña Nieto's presidential campaign benefited from illegal campaign funds provided by Odebrecht in exchange for future favors. According to the triangulation investigations that proved Lozoya guilty, he received $10 million from Odebrecht. During his trial, Lozoya described the payments for facilitating the exchange as a middle-man. Lozoya and Videgaray are featured prominently in spots from the 2012 presidential campaign. Mexican journalist Carlos Loret de Mola described being contacted by Peña Nieto's state, and being told the former president described himself as \"unaware of Lozoya's corruption\". Loret de Mola also said Peña Nieto was already in contact with his successor, Andres Manuel López Obrador, to declare his version of the events. Loret de Mola said that Peña Nieto was \"going to get lost within his lies\" during the trial.\nOn November 12, 2020, the Attorney General's Office (FGR) officially accused Peña Nieto of being a \"traitor to the country and of electoral fraud due to the Odebrecht scandal\" along with Lozoya and Videgaray.\nDuring United States of America v. Joaquín Guzmán Loera, Guzmán's lawyer alleged that the Sinaloa drug cartel had paid \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in bribes to Peña Nieto and his predecessor, Felipe Calderón; both presidents denied the claims, with Peña Nieto's spokesman calling the claims \"completely false and defamatory.\" Alex Cifuentes, who described himself as Guzmán's \"right-hand man\", later testified that Peña Nieto originally asked for $250 million before settling on $100 million.\n\n\nAllegations of crimes against humanity\nIn 2016, a report by the Open Justice Society Initiative claimed that there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that both the Mexican army and drug cartels had committed crimes against humanity during the Mexican drug war. The report accused both Peña Nieto and his predecessor, Felipe Calderón, of \"almost completely failing\" to ensure accountability for the actions of the Mexican army and of denying or minimizing the scale of the atrocities. In June 2018, human rights organizations presented documents alleging slayings, tortures, rapes, and forced disappearances to the International Criminal Court, and called on them to investigate.\n\n\nPublic image\n\n\nMedia gaffes\n\nPeña Nieto has occasionally lapses in memory or gaffes during public events or interviews. The most-noted incident occurred during the International Book Fair of Guadalajara on 3 December 2011. On that day, during a question and answer session, he was asked by an audience member to name three books that had influenced him, being only able to correctly reference the Bible. He then \"rambled, tossing out confused title names, asking for help in recalling authors and sometimes mismatching\" the two others. Other incidents have involved him not being able to recall Benito Juárez's year of birth, being unable to remember the acronym of the Federal Institute of Access to Information (IFAI), changing the date of foundation of the state of Hidalgo, mistaking the capital of the State of Veracruz, mentioning the U.S. presidential candidate \"La señora Hillary Trump\" (Mrs. Hillary Trump), among others, of varying degree of substantiation or credibility. These have gone viral on social media, especially Twitter and a website that counts the number of days since his last gaffe.\n\n\nAllegations of media bias\n\nTelevisa\nTelevisa, the largest conglomerate broadcasting in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, was accused of tilting their coverage towards Peña Nieto ahead of the 1 July vote. Thousands of students protested of the perceived bias throughout Mexico City and other cities.\nOn 7 June 2018, The Guardian's Jo Tuckman reported about dozens of computer files – forwarded to The Guardian by a source who worked with Televisa, but it has not been possible to confirm the authenticity of the documents – suggesting that Televisa sold favorable coverage to Peña Nieto when he was governor of the state of Mexico and developed a smear campaign against López Obrador ahead of his first bid for the presidency in 2006. Televisa and the PRI suggested that the documents were false.\nTime magazine\nOn the 24 March 2014 issue of the newsweekly Time, Peña Nieto was on the front cover with the caption, \"Saving Mexico.\" The front cover was met with widespread disapproval from the Mexican public, prompting various spoofs on social media, even prompting a petition to have him removed from the cover.\n\n\nEvaluations as president and legacy\nIn August 2016, Peña Nieto's approval ratings dropped to 23 percent (74 percent said they disapproved of his performance), which newspaper Reforma revealed to be the lowest approval rating for a president since they began polling in 1995. The approval decreased to 12% by 19 January 2017.\nThe lack of popularity and credibility of Peña Nieto's government is perceived to have caused the PRI to suffer a significant defeat in the 2018 Mexican general election, where the party received the lowest vote percentage in its history. The party's presidential candidate, José Antonio Meade, did not win a majority in Mexico's 300 voting locations, while the PRI was also defeated in the nine gubernatorial elections. The presidency of Mexico went to Andrés Manuel López Obrador (from MORENA), who won in a landslide. The PRI also lost to MORENA in Atlacomulco, the hometown of Enrique Peña Nieto.\nIn 2020, López Obrador asked Mexicans if they would like to see former presidents face trial for allegations of corruption. According to a survey conducted by El Universal, 78% of Mexicans wanted the former presidents to face trial, with Peña Nieto the one they wanted to be incarcerated the most.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 2014 Mexican comedy and political satire movie The Perfect Dictatorship had a plot based on the real-life perceived Televisa controversy, which consisted of Mexican citizens heavily perceiving the news media as unfairly favoring PRI candidate Enrique Peña Nieto during the 2012 presidential election in Mexico.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n\nFamily life\n\nIn 1993, Peña Nieto married his first wife, Mónica Pretelini (1965–2007). The couple had three children. Peña Nieto had two children outside his first marriage. Pretelini died on 11 January 2007 as the result of an epileptic episode. Pretelini played a supporting role during the campaign of Peña Nieto's governorship. In 2008, Peña Nieto began a relationship with Televisa soap opera actress Angélica Rivera, whom he had hired to help publicize his political campaign for the State of Mexico. The couple married in November 2010. After his tenure as president ended, Rivera announced their divorce on 8 February 2019. Peña Nieto began dating Mexican model Tania Ruiz Eichelmann weeks after his separation with Rivera. He and Eichelmann lived together in Madrid; on January 2023 they announced that they broke up.\n\nPeña Nieto is the cousin of Alfredo del Mazo Maza, who was the governor of the State of Mexico from 2017 to 2023, of which his grandfather, father, distant uncle Arturo Montiel, as well as himself, have previously been governors.\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nHonors\n\n\nNational honors\n: Collar of the Order of the Aztec Eagle (1° December 2012)\n\n\nForeign honors\n\n National Order of Juan Mora Fernández, Grand Cross with Gold Plaque, awarded by Laura Chinchilla on 19 February 2013.\n National Order of the Legion of Honour, Grand Cross, awarded by Francois Hollande on 10 April 2014.\n Order of Prince Henry, Grand Collar, awarded by Aníbal Cavaco Silva on 2 June 2014.\n Order of Isabella the Catholic, Grand Cross with Collar, awarded by King Juan Carlos I of Spain on 6 June 2014.\n Order of the Sun of Peru, Grand Cross with Diamonds, awarded by Ollanta Humala on 17 July 2014.\n Order of the Bath, Honorary Knight Grand Cross, awarded by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on 3 March 2015.\n Order of the Quetzal, Grand Collar, awarded by Otto Pérez Molina on 13 March 2015.\n Order of the Southern Cross, Grand Collar, awarded by Dilma Rousseff on 26 May 2015.\n Order of Charles III, Grand Cross with Collar, awarded by King Felipe VI of Spain on 20 June 2015.\n Order of the White Rose of Finland, Grand Cross with Collar, awarded by Sauli Niinistö on 25 May 2015.\n Order of Merit, Grand Collar, awarded by Michelle Bachelet on 13 August 2015.\n Order of King Abdulaziz, Collar, awarded by King Salman of Saudi Arabia on 17 January 2016.\n Order of Mubarak the Great, Collar, awarded by Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on 20 January 2016.\n Order of the Elephant, Knight, awarded by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark on 13 April 2016.\n Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, Grand Cross with Cordon, awarded by Sergio Mattarella on 21 July 2016.\n Order of the Liberator General San Martín, Grand Collar, awarded by Mauricio Macri on 29 July 2016.\n Military Order of Saint James of the Sword, Grand Collar awarded by Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on 17 July 2017.\n Medal of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay on 9 February 2018.\n\n\nSee also\n\n2015 Mexican legislative election\n2012 Mexican general election\n2005 State of Mexico election\nPeñabot\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nEnrique Peña Nieto, Biografía – CIDOB Foundation (in Spanish)\nEnrique Peña Nieto – Personal blog of Enrique Peña Nieto (in Spanish)\nLas 7 reformas que propone Peña Nieto para México – CNNMéxico (in Spanish)\nMexico Elections: Institutional Revolutionary Party Candidate Enrique Pena Nieto Wins Presidency – The Huffington Post",
    "summary": "Enrique Peña Nieto  (Spanish pronunciation: [enˈrike ˈpeɲa ˈnjeto] ; born 20 July 1966), commonly referred to by his initials EPN, is a Mexican former politician and lawyer who served as the 64th president of Mexico from 2012 to 2018. A member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), he previously was Governor of the State of Mexico from 2005 to 2011, local deputy from 2003 to 2004, and Secretary of Administration from 2000 to 2002.\nBorn in Atlacomulco and raised in Toluca, Peña Nieto attended Panamerican University, graduating with a B.A. in legal studies. After attaining an MBA from ITESM, he began his political career by joining the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1984. After serving as a public notary in Mexico City, he began an ascent through local political ranks in the late 1990s, culminating in his 2005 campaign for Governor of the State of Mexico. As governor, he pledged to deliver 608 compromisos (commitments) to his constituency to varying levels of success. His tenure  was marked by low-to-moderate approval of his handling of a rising murder rate, the San Salvador Atenco civil unrest, and various public health issues. He launched his 2012 presidential campaign on a platform of economic competitiveness and open government. After performing well in polls and a series of high-profile candidate withdrawals, Peña Nieto was elected president with 38.14% of the vote.\nAs president, he instated the multilateral Pact for Mexico, which soothed inter-party fighting and increased legislation across the political spectrum. During his first four years,  Peña Nieto led a breakup of state monopolies, liberalized Mexico's energy sector, instituted public education reforms, and modernized the country's financial regulation. However, political gridlock and allegations of media control gradually worsened, along with corruption, crime, and drug trade in Mexico. Global drops in oil prices limited the success of his economic reforms. His handling of the Iguala mass kidnapping in 2014 and the escape of drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán from Altiplano prison in 2015 sparked international criticism. Guzmán himself claims to have bribed Peña Nieto during his trial. As of 2022, he is additionally part of the Odebrecht controversy, with former Pemex CEO Emilio Lozoya Austin declaring that Peña Nieto's presidential campaign benefited from illegal campaign funds provided by Odebrecht in exchange for securing public contracts and political favors.\nHistorical evaluations and approval rates of his presidency have been mostly negative. Detractors highlight a series of failed policies and a strained public presence, while supporters note increased economic competitiveness and loosening of gridlock. He began his term with an approval rate of 50%, hovered around 35% during his inter-years, and finally bottomed out at 12% in January 2017. He left office with an approval rating of only 18% and 77% disapproval. Peña Nieto is seen as one of the most controversial and least popular presidents in the history of Mexico. ",

    "text": "Richard Walter Hubbell (November 8, 1840 – April 5, 1910) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge.  He was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing Oconto County during the 1872 and 1873 sessions, and also served as county judge and district attorney.  In the American Civil War, he served as a Union Army artillery officer.  He was a son of Levi Hubbell—the first Wisconsin state official to be impeached.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Ithaca, New York, Hubbell moved with his parents to Wisconsin Territory in 1844 and settled in Milwaukee.  Hubbell's father was a prominent lawyer and judge in these days, and afforded a good education for his sons.  Hubbell attended a college preparatory course in 1853, and then attended the University of Wisconsin from 1854 through 1858, graduating with a bachelor's degree.  Hubbell flourished at the university and was one of the charter members there of the Hesperia literary society, along with his lifelong friend William Freeman Vilas.  Hubbell subsequently earned his master's degree in 1861, and was admitted to the bar in 1862.\n\n\nCivil War service\nIn the second year of the war, as new calls were being made for volunteers to the Union Army, Hubbell saw several of his university classmates joining the service.  William F. Vilas recruited a company for the 23rd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, which Hubbell sought to join, but was too late to register a spot.  He instead joined a company for the 24th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, and was enrolled as a sergeant in Company I of that regiment.\nHe served only a few months with the 24th Wisconsin Infantry, but saw serious combat with them at the Battle of Perryville.  In the Winter of 1862–1863, he accepted a commission to become a first lieutenant in the 1st Wisconsin Heavy Artillery Regiment.  With the 1st Wisconsin Heavy Artillery, he served with Battery B, which was stationed for the rest of the war at forts in Kentucky and Tennessee.  He was promoted to captain of his battery in July 1864, and was then made a major in the regiment in September 1864.  He mustered out with the rest of the regiment in June 1865.\n\n\nLegal and political career\nAfter the war, Hubbell moved to Oconto, Wisconsin, and established a legal practice. Hubbell became active with the Republican Party of Wisconsin and first ran for Wisconsin State Assembly in 1867.  He failed in that campaign, but was subsequently elected to two consecutive terms, serving in the 1872 and 1873 sessions.  In the meantime, he was also elected to two four-year terms as county judge for Oconto County, serving in that office from 1870 through 1878.  In the 1877 election, rather than running again for judge, he ran for and was elected district attorney, for a two year term.\nIn 1890, Hubbell moved to Wautoma, Wisconsin, without his family and continued to practice law.  He died at his home in Wautoma in 1910, he had been in ill health.\n\n\nPersonal life and family\nRichard Hubbell was one of at least four children of Levi Hubbell, a Wisconsin pioneer lawyer and judge who served in Wisconsin's first state supreme court and was the first state official to be impeached by the Wisconsin Legislature.  He was not convicted in his impeachment trial, and later served as United States Attorney for Wisconsin.\nRichard's grandfather, Abijah Hubbell, served in the American Revolutionary War.  The Hubbells were descendants of Richard Hubbell, an English immigrant who came to the Connecticut Colony about 1650.\nRichard W. Hubbell married Emily Snover in 1871.  They had at least six children, but at least one died in infancy.\nIn addition to his legal career, Hubbell was a lifelong literary enthusiast and wrote his own poetry and prose.  For much of his life, including his final years, Hubbell wrote for and edited the Wisconsin Alumni Magazine in its various incarnations.  Near the end of his life, he published several of his poems in the magazine.\nHe was also apparently a fishing enthusiast, and authored a pamphlet on fly fishing, titled Hints on Fly Fishing.\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\nWisconsin Assembly (1871, 1872)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nRichard Walter Hubbell at Find a Grave",

    "text": "The Co-operative Publishing Company Building is a historic building in Guthrie, Oklahoma, that is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places.  The building was the home of the State Capital newspaper from 1902 to 1911, and it replaced another building on the same site, which the paper had been using since 1890.\n\n\nCompany history and predecessor building\nFounded on March 30, 1889, by Frank Hilton Greer and initially located in Winfield, Kansas, the State Capital newspaper moved to Guthrie less than one month later, with the Land Rush of 1889, and changed from being a weekly to a daily. The first edition in Guthrie was published on April 22, 1889, and the State Capital became \"the first daily paper ever published in what is now Oklahoma\".  The paper was originally based at a different location in Guthrie, but in 1890 Greer moved the business into rented space in a building at Second and Harrison Streets—the site of the surviving building. As the newspaper's circulation grew, additional space was rented, and in 1897 the paper purchased the three-story building (which had four floors, counting the basement).  After the building's top-floor occupant moved out in 1900, the newspaper/publishing company occupied the entire building, giving it a total of 10,000 square feet of floor space. Greer was soon employing up to one hundred people, and conducting business 24 hours a day, six days a week.\n\n\nSurviving building\n\nThe building that the State Capital had used since 1890 burned to the ground in 1902 and was replaced by this four-story structure, on the same site.  The new building was designed by Joseph Pierre Foucart, and completed in that year.  It was erected with the help of subscriptions in the amount of $50,000.\nHaving been the first newspaper published in the Oklahoma Territory, the State Capital grew into the largest printing house west of the Mississippi River. The State Capital Printing Company was awarded all the Territorial printing and soon became the territory's largest printing, book-binding, and school-supply business.  In 1911, Greer sold the Oklahoma State Capital to the Guthrie Daily Leader, its competitor, and publication under the State Capital title ended.  After 1911, the building continued to be used for printing and book-binding, its owner now being the Co-operative Publishing Company, which was the largest publishing company in Oklahoma for many years.\n\n\nUse as museum\n\nIn 1975, the building was acquired by the Oklahoma Historical Society, who had plans to outfit it as a publishing museum.  The State Capital Publishing Museum opened in 1983. In the 1990s and again in the 2000s, budget cuts led to the trimming of staff and programs at the museum, and unexpected building-maintenance problems in 2012 led to a decision to close the museum indefinitely.  As of 2016, the museum has remained closed since 2012.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Co-Operative Publishing Company Building at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "Matthew Christopher Miller, known professionally as Matthew Mercer or Matt Mercer, is an American voice actor, game designer, gamemaster and singer. He has been a voice-over artist in video games and animation since 2002.\nNotable animation credits include Levi Ackerman in Attack on Titan, Kiritsugu Emiya in Fate/Zero, Jotaro Kujo in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Yamato in Naruto, Trafalgar Law in One Piece, Hit in Dragon Ball Super, and Leorio in Hunter x Hunter.\nMercer's video games credits include Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 6, Kurtis Stryker in Mortal Kombat, Chrom in Fire Emblem, Jack Cooper in Titanfall 2, Cole Cassidy in Overwatch, Yusuke Kitagawa in Persona 5, Goro Majima in Like a Dragon, Ganondorf in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Espio the Chameleon in Sonic the Hedgehog, Shroud in Dispatch and Vincent Valentine in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. \nMercer developed and served as the Dungeon Master for the Dungeons & Dragons web series Critical Role since it premiered in 2015. He is the chief creative officer of Critical Role Productions. As a game designer, he has worked on tabletop role-playing game books such as Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (2020), Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn (2022), Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep (2022), and Daggerheart (2025).\n\n\nEarly life\nMatthew Christopher Miller was born in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He is primarily of Scottish descent. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was eight years old. He attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California. His father was a musician/audio engineer and his mother was an actress and writer. He has a brother who is a musician under the stage name Dave Heatwave. He spoke with a stutter when he was young, leading his father (who also stuttered) to recruit a speech therapist who managed to reduce the effects to the point that only certain words trigger it. He adopted \"Mercer\", which members of his family had used in the past, as his stage surname because his birth name was too similar to someone already represented by SAG-AFTRA. He had a stint as a member of The Groundlings.\n\n\nCareer\n\nMercer's family advised him against moving into theatre as a career, and so he initially considered working in animation. He was dissuaded by advice from professional animators about the working conditions in that field however, and joined the games industry instead. In his early career he worked as a QA tester and later associate producer on a number of Edutainment titles developed by Sound Source Interactive and TDK Mediactive. After \"friends of his father got him some odd jobs in voiceover\", Mercer decided to pursue the profession, and resigned from his game development job.\nMercer began his voice acting career performing English walla and additional characters in several Japanese anime, and has since also worked in cartoons, video games, and radio commercials. He has been a guest at conventions around the world, hosting at events such as Anime Expo and Anime Matsuri. His work has expanded to a multitude of roles in cartoons, video games and radio commercials. He directed and produced the web series There Will Be Brawl, based on the Super Smash Bros. video game series, where he provided the voices for both Meta Knight and Kirby, and portrayed the role of Ganondorf. He also acted in several shows from the Geek & Sundry and Nerdist networks and produced the web series Fear News with the Last Girl for FEARnet which was a 2010 Webby Awards Honoree for the Experimental & Weird category.\nIn 2016, Mercer served as the Dungeon Master for Force Grey: Giant Hunters, which ran for 2 seasons. In 2017, he was the Dungeon Master for the Nerdist show CelebriD&D, which puts D&D-playing celebrities into a small, mini-campaign where they are paired with role-players. He has also been a player in other actual play web series such as Dimension 20 and L.A. by Night.\n\n\nCritical Role\n\nMercer is the Dungeon Master of the web series Critical Role, which launched on Geek & Sundry in 2015, where he leads several other voice actors through a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. Critical Role was both the Webby Winner and the People's Voice Winner in the \"Games (Video Series & Channels)\" category at the 2019 Webby Awards; the show was also both a Finalist and the Audience Honor Winner in the \"Games\" category at the 2019 Shorty Awards. After becoming hugely successful, the Critical Role cast left the Geek & Sundry network in early 2019 and set up their own production company, Critical Role Productions; Mercer is the company's chief creative officer. Soon after, they aimed to raise $750,000 on Kickstarter to create an animated series of their first campaign, but ended up raising over $11 million. In November 2019, Amazon Prime Video announced that they had acquired the streaming rights to this animated series, now titled The Legend of Vox Machina; Mercer reprised his role as Sylas Briarwood and other characters.\nLuke Winkie, in a human-interest story for Slate, called Mercer \"an expert improviser\" and \"a maestro with the dice in his hands, weaving interlocking plot lines and complex thematic threads out of thin air\" with \"the innate ability to make a Dungeons & Dragons campaign feel like a tightly wound limited drama\". Winkie commented that \"it can be downright intimidating to watch Mercer when he's at the peak of his powers. As a career voice actor, he possesses all of the subtle performance intangibles that saturate his storytelling with life: the timing, the verve, the language flourishes\". Academics Zac Boyd and Míša Hejná, in the journal Language in Society, highlighted that Mercer \"introduced 1,144 unique NPC characters during\" the second campaign of Critical Role. They analyzed nineteen characters based on exceeding a threshold of minimum voice time and plot relevance and determined through \"holistic analysis of voice quality\" of these characters that \"breathiness\" in Mercer's voice \"emerged as signalling positive morality and stances of safety, comfort, and trust, where whisperiness signals negative morality and stances of threat. Qualitatively, pitch dynamism was also found to correlate with morality and stancetaking: the more limited the pitch dynamism, the more likely it is that the character portrayed is an Enemy and that they adopt stances of threat\".\nIn October 2020, Mercer became the creative advisor for the Critical Role board and card game imprint called Darrington Press. From June to August 2021, Mercer appeared on Exandria Unlimited, a spinoff of Critical Role, as a player. In March 2022, he reprised his role in the two part special Exandria Unlimited: Kymal. In 2025, he was the game master for the Age of Umbra limited series. In August 2025, Critical Role announced that Brennan Lee Mulligan would take over as Game Master from Mercer for their fourth campaign. It is scheduled to premiere on October 2, 2025; Mercer will appear in the campaign as a player. Rolling Stone stated that \"the inclusion of Mulligan is huge, but not entirely surprising\" given Mulligan's background as \"a well-established Game Master\" along with previous comments made by Mercer on eventually shifting \"into a 'Professor X' role as a mentor to the next generation of storytellers rather than remaining the face of the brand in perpetuity\".\n\n\nGame design\nHayley McCullough, for the American Journalism, commented that \"Mercer is well-known for his homebrew mechanics, character classes, and feats\". Mercer's work as Dungeon Master has led to the development of three campaign setting books being published about his world of Exandria. The first is the Critical Role: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting (2017) published through Green Ronin Publishing. The second is the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount (2020) published through Wizards of the Coast, thus making Exandria an official Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting. The third is Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn (2022), a revised and expanded edition of the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting, which was published by Darrington Press, the publishing label created by Critical Role Productions. Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn was nominated for the 2022 ENNIE Awards in the \"Best Setting\" category.\nOn March 15, 2022, a new adventure module titled Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep (2022), with Mercer, James Haeck and Chris Perkins as lead designers, was released. It is the second collaboration book between Wizards of the Coast and Critical Role Productions. Mercer was then a consultant on the Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) for the revised 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Mercer was a designer on Daggerheart (2025), a tabletop role-playing game system by Darrington Press, and created the \"Age of Umbra\" campaign frame for the system.\n\n\nPersonal life\nMercer began dating voice actress and Critical Role co-star Marisha Ray in 2011, and they were engaged in 2016 before marrying on October 21, 2017. The video of his proposal became popular among fans as it involved an entire escape room game he secretly created with the Critical Role cast as a surprise for Ray. They have a pet corgi named Omar. Their pet green-cheeked conure, Dagon, died in December 2021.\nMercer said in 2017 that, while he is heterosexual, he has also been attracted to men in the past and experienced homophobia while growing up as a boy who liked to experiment with an androgynous appearance. He explained that he tries his best in storytelling to also represent the experiences of close LGBT family and friends. As an activist, he works with various LGBT rights charities like OutRight Action International. In 2018, he revealed that he suffers from body dysmorphic disorder and has always struggled with his physical appearance.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nVoice acting\n\n\nAnime\n\n\nAnimation\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nAudio books\n\n\nLive-action dubbing\n\n\nLive-action\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nWeb series\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nRole-playing games\nCritical Role: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting (writer and designer, Green Ronin Publishing, 2017)\nExplorer's Guide to Wildemount (lead writer, Wizards of the Coast, 2020)\nDoom Eternal Assault on Armaros Station (writer, Critical Role Productions, 2020)\nTal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn (lead designer, Darrington Press, 2022)\nCritical Role: Call of the Netherdeep (project lead, Wizards of the Coast, 2022)\nDaggerheart (designer, Darrington Press, 2025)\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nMatthew Mercer on Twitter \nMatthew Mercer convention appearances on AnimeCons.com\nMatthew Mercer  at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\nMatthew Mercer at IMDb",

    "text": "Artjoms Rudņevs (born 13 January 1988) is a Latvian former professional footballer who played as a striker for Daugava Daugavpils in his home country, for Zalaegerszegi TE in Hungary, for Lech Poznań in Poland, and for Bundesliga clubs Hamburger SV, Hannover 96, and 1. FC Köln. At the international level, he represented the Latvia national team.\n\n\nClub career\n\n\nEarly career and ZTE\n\nRudņevs started his career with his local club FC Daugava in Daugavpils, where he played until February 2009, when he signed a contract with the Hungarian club Zalaegerszegi TE. However, the previous contract with Daugava was still active, so FIFA was involved in resolving the conflict. In May 2009, he made his debut in Hungary, where he played for three seasons, scoring 20 goals in 30 league matches.\n\n\nLech Poznań\n\nIn July 2010, rumors circulated that the Ekstraklasa club Lech Poznań were interested in signing him. These rumors were subsequently confirmed and Rudņevs joined the club on trial. After a successful trial at the club and after passing the medical tests, Lech started talks with ZTE regarding a permanent transfer. The clubs initially could not agree on the transfer fee and, when it was finally decided, the Polish team was unable to negotiate personal terms with Rudnevs. It seemed that the talks were over but in August, after Rudņevs had scored two goals in the season opener, Lech reopened discussions. This time talks were successful and Rudņevs signed a four-year contract with the Polish side.\n\n\n2010–11 season\nHe scored in his debut for Lech Poznań against Widzew Łódź. He added three more goals in five consecutive matches, the last of these the winning goal on 11 September 2010. Just five days later he scored a hat-trick against Juventus in the Europa League, the first goal a coolly slotted penalty, the second a scissors kick from three yards out, and the third a long-range equalizer deep into injury time. Rudņevs stated that it was \"the best match of his career so far\".\nBy the end of the Polish Ekstraklasa season, Rudņevs managed to score 11 goals in 27 matches to finish fourth in the league. On 1 December 2010, he scored yet again against Juventus, saying afterwards that Juventus' goalkeeper Alexander Manninger was his \"favourite goalkeeper to play against\". The match ended 1–1, a result that allowed Lech to progress to the next round, and eliminated Juventus. In the first match against SC Braga in the last 16 of the UEFA Europa League, Rudņevs scored a goal as Lech won 1–0. However, in the second match Lech lost 2–0 and were knocked out of the Europa League. With five goals in the Europa League, Rudņevs became the fourth top scorer, sharing this achievement with four other players.\n\n\n2011–12 season\nBy December 2011, Rudnevs was the Polish league's leading marksman, having scored 18 goals in 17 league matches. Rudņevs was named the best player of 2011 in the Ekstraklasa by the Polish Footballers' Association. Rudņevs finished the season with a league-leading 22 goals in 29 matches. On 8 May 2012, the German Bundesliga team Hamburger SV agreed on a transfer at the end of the 2011–12 season. On 11 May, the transfer was officially confirmed by both clubs.\n\n\nHamburger SV\nIn the 2012–13 season, Rudņevs became the first Latvian football player in the Bundesliga. Hamburger SV started the season with three consecutive losses with Rudņevs gaining only one assist. Rudņevs scored his first goal in the Bundesliga on 26 September 2012 in a 2–2 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach. In his first season with Hamburg Rudņevs appeared in 34 league matches, scored 12 goals with four assists, finishing as Hamburg's joint top scorer alongside Son Heung-Min, who also netted 12 times. However, his form dropped, and Rudņevs lost his place in the starting eleven early in the 2013–14 Bundesliga season.\n\n\n1. FC Köln\nOn 15 June 2016, it was announced that Rudņevs had joined 1. FC Köln on a free transfer. On 29 September 2017, the club announced it had agreed to terminate Rudņev's contract and that he would end his career.\n\n\nInternational career\nRudņevs was first called up to the national side on 12 November 2008 for the friendly match against Estonia. He started this match in the first eleven. Rudņevs also played for the U-21 side. He was called up to the national side again in January 2010 for the friendly match against South Korea. Rudņevs started the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches in the first eleven alongside Māris Verpakovskis, putting Ģirts Karlsons on the bench. On 7 October 2011, he scored his first international goal in the 2–0 victory over Malta in a Euro 2012 qualifying match.\n\n\nPersonal life and controversy\nRudņevs is married and has a daughter born in 2011.\nRudņevs provoked controversy in his native Latvia after switching to using \"Rudnev\" on the back of his jersey for his second season at Lech, indicating his Russian ethnicity. He also drew the ire of his national team captain, Kaspars Gorkšs, when he stated that he would not learn the Latvian language in addition to Russian. Gorkšs wrote an open letter criticizing Rudņevs for the statement.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\n\n\nInternational\n\nScores and results list Latvia's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Rudņevs goal.\n\n\nHonours\n\nDaugavpils Daugava\n\nLatvian Football Cup: 2008\nZalaegerszegi TE\n\nMagyar Kupa runner-up: 2009–10\nLech Poznań\n\nPolish Cup runner-up: 2010–11\nLatvia\n\nBaltic Cup: 2016\nIndividual\n\nEkstraklasa Polish Footballers' Association's Player of the Year: 2011\nEkstraklasa top scorer: 2011–12\nPolish Cup top scorer: 2010–11\nEkstraklasa Player of the Month: September 2011\nLatvian Rising Star of the Year: 2010\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nArtjoms Rudņevs at WorldFootball.net\nArtjoms Rudņevs at National-Football-Teams.com\nHlsz.hu profile Archived 5 October 2012 at the Wayback Machine (in Hungarian)\nzte.hu profile (in Hungarian)\nArtjoms Rudņevs at 90minut.pl (in Polish)",

He began his political career at the 1986 French Polynesian legislative election, when he was elected to the Assembly of French Polynesia as the second MP on the Tapura Napo des Tuamotu-Gambier list. Three months later he was elected mayor of Rangiroa.\nConstantly re-elected as Mayor and to the Assembly, in October 2004 he was appointed Minister of Culture, in charge of the promotion of Polynesian languages in the government of Gaston Flosse. He lost the position in March 2005. In December 2005, he and Michel Yip left the Tahoera'a to become independents. In 2006, he served briefly as Minister of Outer Island Affairs.\nIn 2007 he founded Te niu hau manahune, the party of the islanders. Following the 2008 election he formed the Te Mana o te Mau Motu party of outer island MPs. The group was the cause of the frequent changes of the government of this period, changing allegiance to overthrow the Flosse government in 2008, the Temaru government in 2009, and then to return Temaru to power in 2011. He was not re-elected in the 2013 election but was re-elected as a Tāpura Huiraʻatira candidate in the 2018 election. He was subsequently elected second vice-president of the Assembly.\nIn 2005 he was appointed chair of the Archipelago Development Fund. He quit the position in October 2008 after being questioned for alleged corruption. In March 2015 he was convicted of corruption and disqualified from office for a year for abusing public funds as mayor.\nOn 14 April 2021, he was sentenced by the Papeete Criminal Court to one year in prison and one year suspended sentence, a fine of five million Pacific francs and five years of ineligibility in the Archipelago Development Fund case. Thus, he was automatically resigned from his functions as mayor of Rangiroa but retained his mandate as a representative in the Assembly, his conviction not being final. The conviction was overturned on appeal in October 2022.\nHis son Tahuhu Maraeura succeeded him as mayor on 30 April 2021.\nMaraeura died on 11 May 2023, at age 72.\n\n\nReferences",

Its capital is the city of La Esperanza, in the municipality of La Esperanza.\n\n\nHistory\nThe department of Intibucá was created on April 16, 1883 upon recommendation of the Governor of the department of Gracias (now called Lempira), Jose Maria Cacho in 1869. He advised that the vast size of Gracias made it difficult to govern and that it would be desirable to divide it into more than one department.\nOn March 7, 1883 Decree No. 10 was issued, which called for the creation of a new department to be named Intibucá in April of that year. The town of La Esperanza was designated to be the capital of the new department. To create the new department, territory from both the departments of Gracias and La Paz were reassigned. \n\n\nGeography\nThe department of Intibucá is situated between latitudes 13°51'E and 14°42'N and longitudes 87°46'W and 88°42'W. It is bounded on the north by the departments of Comayagua, Lempira, and Santa Bárbara, on the east by the departments of Comayagua and La Paz, on the west by the department of Lempira, and on the south by the Republic of El Salvador. Intibucá is the most mountainous district of Honduras.  The capital of La Esperanza lies at an elevation of 4,950 feet (1,510 m) above sea level. The table-land and valleys are higher than in any other part of the country, and the ranges of the Cordilleras rise to an altitude approaching 10,000 feet (3,000 m) feet above sea level.\nThe valley of Otoro is 30 km long by 8 km wide.\nThe Opalaca mountains have several ridges and crosses over into the department of La Paz. Sierra de Montecillos is a natural border with the department of Comayagua, and contains the mountains Opatoro, Concepción, El Picacho, Goascotoro, El Granadino among others.\n\n\nRivers\nRivers of La Esperanza include the San Juan River and the Intibucá River, which passes through La Esperanza. Otoro River is a tributary of the Ulua River, and carries water to the Otoro valley. The Black River, known by the name of Guarajambala River, serves as a dividing line with the department of Lempira. Torola River and Gualcarque River flow into the Lempa river.\n\n\nPopulation\nAccording to the 1895 census, Intibucá had a population of 18,957 people at that time. In 2015, it had grown to 241,568 people, divided among 17 municipalities and 126 villages (aldeas).\n\n\nForest resources\nThe mountains and slopes are well supplied with pine and Oak forests, and the valleys thrive with fertile, well-watered soil, covered with vegetation characteristic of the temperate rather than tropical zone.\n\n\nMunicipalities\nIntibucá has the following municipalities of Honduras:\n\nCamasca\nColomoncagua\nConcepción\nDolores\nIntibucá\nJesús de Otoro\nLa Esperanza\nMagdalena\nMasaguara\nSan Antonio\nSan Francisco de Opalaca\nSan Isidro\nSan Juan\nSan Marcos de Sierra\nSan Miguel Guancapla\nSanta Lucía\nYamaranguila\n\n\nNotable residents\nGeneral Vicente Tosta Carrasco, President of the country (1924-1925)\nDoctor Vicente Mejía Colindres, Constitutional presidente of the Republic (1929-1933)\nGeneral Gregorio Ferrera, military officer, politician, and Honduran leader\nRafael Manzanares Aguilar, Honduran folklorist, author and musical composer; founder and first director of the National Office of Folklore of Honduras (Oficina del Folklore Nacional de Honduras); founder and first director and choreographer of the Cuadro de Danzas Folklóricas de Honduras.\nRafael Pineda Ponce, politician and educator, born in San Miguelito.\nNatanael del Cid Menedez, Politician, Rancher, Constitutionalist.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"La Esperanza Intibuca\".

    "text": "Joseph Taylor Compher (born April 8, 1995) is an American professional ice hockey center for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the second round, 35th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2013 NHL entry draft. Compher won the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2022.\nBorn and raised in Northbrook, Illinois, Compher was introduced to ice hockey by a preschool friend and played for a number of teams in the area before joining the USA Hockey National Team Development Program in 2011. He played for two seasons with the program, with appearances in two IIHF World U18 Championships. From there, he played three seasons of college ice hockey for the Michigan Wolverines. As a freshman during the 2013–14 season, Compher led all Big Ten Conference freshmen in scoring with 31 points, and he was named the inaugural Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Freshman of the Year. Two years later, he served both as the Wolverines' captain and as a member of the high-scoring \"CCM Line\". Made up of Compher, Kyle Connor, and Tyler Motte, the CCM Line combined for 83 goals and 107 assists during the 2015–16 season and helped Michigan to capture their first Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nWhile he was attending college, the Sabres included Compher in a trade package with the Colorado Avalanche, the team he joined after completing his career with Michigan. Compher spent the first part of the season with the San Antonio Rampage, the Avalanche's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, but finished the 2016–17 season in the NHL as a replacement for the traded Jarome Iginla. After finding success in his first full NHL season during 2017–18, Compher hoped to become Colorado's second-line center in 2018–19, a plan that was delayed when he was sidelined with a concussion. Compher posted consecutive 30-point seasons during the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons despite losing time to injury and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nEarly life\nCompher was born on April 8, 1995, in Northbrook, Illinois, to Bob and Valerie Compher. He lived in Deerfield, Illinois, until about the age of five, at which point his family moved to Northbrook, another suburb of Chicago. After the move, Compher met a classmate in preschool who invited him to go ice skating, and he began playing ice hockey shortly afterwards. As a child, Compher would practice firing slapshots at his younger sister Jesse, who wanted to be a goaltender. His other younger sister Morgan would participate in pickup ice hockey games as well, as would many of their neighbors. He played for a number of youth hockey teams in the Chicago area, including the Northbrook Bluehawks and Team Illinois, and attended Glenbrook North High School. He was invited to join the USA Hockey National Team Development Program for their 2011–12 season. In two seasons with the program, Compher recorded 33 goals and 92 points in 92 games.\n\n\nPlaying career\n\n\nCollege\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Compher in the second round with the 35th overall pick of the 2013 NHL entry draft. The Sabres acquired the pick that they used on Compher by trading Andrej Sekera to the Carolina Hurricanes. At the time, Compher had committed to play college ice hockey for the Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten Conference. He joined the Wolverines for the 2013–14 season, scoring his first collegiate goal on November 15, 2013, in a 3–2 loss to the Omaha Mavericks. In a rematch against Omaha the next day, Compher scored Michigan's first short-handed goal of the season in a game that the Wolverines won 4–3. On December 3, Compher was named the Big Ten Second Star of the Week after recording three goals and an assist in a two-game series against the Ohio State Buckeyes. With two goals and two assists on January 24, Compher gave Michigan their first win against the Michigan State Spartans at the Munn Ice Arena since 2010. It was the first four-point game for a Michigan freshman since Andrew Cogliano in 2005 and the first time that any Michigan player had recorded a four-point game since David Wohlberg in 2011. He was named the Big Ten First Star of the Week for his performance, after which he led all Big Ten freshmen with 1.00 points per game. He finished the season leading both the Wolverines and all Big Ten freshmen with 31 points (11 goals and 20 assists) and took home three team awards at Michigan's end-of-year banquet: the Deker Club Award for Rookie of the Year, the Hazel \"Doc\" Losh Award for leading scorer, and the Hal Downes Award for the Wolverines' most valuable player. In addition to being named to the All-Big Ten Second Team and Big Ten All-Freshman First Team, Compher finished the college awards season as the inaugural Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Freshman of the Year. Michigan was eliminated in the first round of the 2014 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament in a double-overtime 2–1 Penn State victory.\nGoing into the 2014–15 season, Compher was named an alternate captain for the Wolverines alongside Zach Hyman, with Andrew Copp serving as captain. His first collegiate hat-trick came on February 28, 2015, when Compher scored two goals against Wisconsin Badgers goaltender Joel Rumpel before finishing the game with an empty net goal to seal the 5–2 victory for Michigan. Compher's second hat-trick came on March 8, when he scored every goal for the Wolverines in their 4–3 loss to Penn State. He finished the regular season with 12 goals and 24 points in 34 games, including eight goals and two assists in his last eight games. After defeating Wisconsin 5–1 in the opening round of the 2015 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, the Wolverines won 4–1 against Michigan State in the semifinals, with Compher scoring what was ultimately the game-winning goal in the second period. Michigan lost to the Minnesota Golden Gophers 4–2 in the Big Ten tournament finals. That June, the Sabres traded Compher's prospect rights to the Colorado Avalanche as part of a larger package that sent Jamie McGinn and Ryan O'Reilly to Buffalo in exchange for Compher, Nikita Zadorov, Mikhail Grigorenko, and a second-round pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft.\nPrior to the 2015–16 season, the Wolverines elected Compher their captain, with Boo Nieves and Justin Selman as his alternates. He spent the season playing on a high-scoring offensive line with fellow NHL prospects Kyle Connor and Tyler Motte, which was nicknamed the \"CCM Line\" for their initials. The line was assembled on December 4, 11 games into the Wolverines' season, and after being placed together, Compher and Connor both tallied at least one point in 16 consecutive games. On January 8, Compher recorded a five-point game (two goals and three assists) in a 9–2 win over Michigan State, the largest margin of victory for Michigan against their state rivals since 1996. With two assists in a 5–2 win over Ferris State on February 19, Compher recorded his 100th collegiate point with the Wolverines. Through 38 regular season games with Michigan, Compher had 16 goals and 63 points. He finished second among all Big Ten players in scoring, one behind teammate Connor, and was first with 47 assists, 1.24 assists per game, 24 power play points, and a +35 plus-minus. Combined, the CCM line recorded 83 goals and 107 assists during the season. In the semifinal round of the 2016 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, Compher set a career-high five assists in Michigan's 7–2 win over Penn State, becoming the first Michigan player to have a five-assist game since Chad Kolarik in 2008. Michigan won its first ever Big Ten ice hockey championship with their 5–3 victory over Minnesota. Compher was named to the Big Ten All-Tournament Team, while the Wolverines automatically earned a bid into the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. They faced Notre Dame in the first round of the NCAA tournament, with Compher assisting on the game-winning overtime goal from Tyler Motte. They were eliminated from the tournament in the next round with a 5–2 loss to North Dakota. At the time of their elimination, Compher had an eight-game point streak with five goals and 11 assists. He was a top-10 Hobey Baker Award finalist and was named to both the All-Big Ten First Team and American Hockey Coaches Association All-American Second Team at the end of the season. Compher's collegiate hockey career ended in 2016, at which point he chose to forego his final year of NCAA eligibility to sign a three-year entry-level contract with the Avalanche.\n\n\nProfessional\n\n\nColorado Avalanche\nAfter attending the Avalanche's 2016 training camp, Compher was assigned to the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League (AHL) to begin the 2016–17 season. He spent his time in San Antonio working on becoming a two-way player while leading the team in scoring with 13 goals and 30 points in 41 games. After Jarome Iginla was traded to the Los Angeles Kings on March 1, 2017, Compher was called up to the Avalanche as his replacement, part of general manager Joe Sakic's plan to give the team a younger core. Compher made his NHL debut on March 2, centering the third line with Matt Nieto and Blake Comeau on the wings. Compher scored his first NHL goal two weeks later to put the Avalanche up 2–1 in what was ultimately a 3–1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on March 15. His first assist came on April 2, when Compher helped Gabriel Landeskog score against the Minnesota Wild. He played 21 games during his rookie season with the Avalanche, recording three goals and five points in the process while leading the team with a +1 rating.\nCompher was one of three rookie forwards to make the Avalanche's opening night roster for the 2017–18 season, joining Tyson Jost and Alexander Kerfoot. On October 19, in the eighth game of the season, Compher fractured his thumb while blocking a shot during Colorado's game against the St. Louis Blues. At the time of the injury, he had one goal and four points. He missed six games before returning on November 5 but was injured again on December 29. Compher sustained an upper body injury while playing against the Toronto Maple Leafs and stayed in the game to score an overtime goal for the Avalanche, but he did not play two days later against the New York Islanders. One of several young players to be injured around the midway point of the season, Compher returned on January 17 for a game against the San Jose Sharks. Compher's first NHL multi-goal game on March 14 moved the Avalanche up from the second to the first wild card position in the Western Conference, giving them a stronger opportunity to reach the postseason. He finished his first full season with 13 goals and 23 points in 69 games and was the first Avalanche rookie in franchise history to score two overtime game-winning goals in a season. The Avalanche, meanwhile, clinched a berth in the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, allowing Compher to make his NHL postseason debut in their first-round series against the Nashville Predators. He appeared in all six playoff games before the Predators eliminated the Avalanche, assisting on three goals in the process.\nFive games into the 2018–19 season, Compher sustained a concussion during the Avalanche's game against the Calgary Flames. At the time, he had hoped to become Colorado's second-line center, and he found both the timing of the injury and the unclear recovery timeline a frustrating setback in that push. He missed six weeks with the injury, returning on November 23 to score two short-handed goals in a 5–1 victory over the Arizona Coyotes. While playing his hometown Chicago Blackhawks on February 22, Compher recorded his first professional three-point game, registering two goals and an assist, including the game-winning goal, in Colorado's 5–3 win. His second goal of the game was also his 14th of the season, surpassing his previous season total. He finished the season with 16 goals and 32 points, including three short-handed goals, while the Avalanche faced the Flames in the first round of 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. While facing elimination in Game 6 of their second-round series against the San Jose Sharks, Compher scored two goals and an assist in a game that the Avalanche won in overtime to force a winner-take-all Game 7. Colorado was eliminated in the next game, losing 3–2 to the Sharks, and Compher finished the playoffs with four goals and six points in 12 games.\nOn July 17, 2019, Compher, at the time a restricted free agent, signed a four-year, $14 million ($3.5 million average annual value) contract extension with the Avalanche. He was once again injured early in the season, missing three games in October after sustaining a lower-body injury during a game against the Minnesota Wild. He spent most of the season playing on the third offensive line, but injuries to top-six forwards like Mikko Rantanen and Nazem Kadri throughout the season gave Compher opportunities to fill in for them on the higher lines. At the time that the COVID-19 pandemic forced the indefinite suspension of the 2019–20 NHL season in March, Compher was ninth for the Avalanche with 31 points, including 11 goals, in 67 games. When the NHL returned to play in July for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, Compher was one of 31 skaters invited to play for Colorado in the quarantine bubble. For the second year in a row, the Avalanche were eliminated in Game 7 of the second round of playoffs, this time falling to the Dallas Stars. Playing predominantly on the third line with Andre Burakovsky and Joonas Donskoi, Compher recorded eight goals in 15 postseason games.\nWith a number of key Avalanche players injured towards the beginning of the 2020–21 season, Compher had an opportunity to fill in for Nathan MacKinnon, centering Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen on the top line. Shortly after breaking a six-game scoring drought on February 24, Compher was injured himself. He missed seven games, returning on March 20 as a replacement for Logan O'Connor on the fourth line for a 6–0 shutout victory over the Minnesota Wild. After another scoring drought during which he had two goals in 19 games throughout April and the first half of May, Compher recorded his first NHL hat-trick on May 12 during a 6–0 shutout win over the Los Angeles Kings. The 2020–21 season proved an offensive step back for Compher, who recorded only 10 goals and 18 points in 48 games of the pandemic-shortened season. For the third year in a row, the Avalanche were eliminated in the second round of Stanley Cup playoffs, falling to the Vegas Golden Knights in six games. That July, the Avalanche exposed Compher in the 2021 NHL expansion draft, but the Seattle Kraken selected his teammate Donskoi instead.\nAs Colorado entered the 2021–22 season, head coach Jared Bednar told reporters that he was \"looking for [Compher] to have a bounce back season\". On November 13, Compher sustained an upper-body injury during a game against the San Jose Sharks and was expected to miss about a month of the season. In his absence, Nicolas Aubé-Kubel, who had recently been claimed from the Philadelphia Flyers on waivers, filled in for him as the right winger for Tyson Jost and Alex Newhook's line. He returned on December 10 after missing 11 games, opening the scoring in a 7–3 victory over the Detroit Red Wings in his first game since the injury. In the second half of the season, the Avalanche earned praise from sportswriters for their offensive depth, with Compher one of several players who, despite being on the lower offensive lines, was able to generate goals. At the end of the regular season, Compher set career highs with 18 goals and 33 points in 70 games. In the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, Compher played a key role in the Avalanche's first second round series victory, scoring two goals in Game 6 to help clinch the win over the St. Louis Blues. In the Western Conference Finals against the Edmonton Oilers, Compher continued to distinguish himself, notably scoring the game-winning goal in Game 3 to give the Avalanche a stranglehold on the series. They swept the Oilers, advancing to the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals. There, the Avalanche defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games to become Stanley Cup champions. Overall, Compher contributed five goals and eight points in 20 postseason games.\n\n\nDetroit Red Wings\nOn July 1, 2023, Compher signed a five-year, $25.5 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n\nInternational play\n\nCompher first represented the United States in international competition at the 2012 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. He had a team-leading four goals and seven assists in six games, including a goal in Team USA's gold-medal loss to Russia, and was named to the Tournament All-Star Team. That same year, Compher won a gold medal with Team USA at the 2012 IIHF World U18 Championships, recording two goals and five points in six games. He returned the following year as captain for Team USA at the 2013 IIHF World U18 Championships. Compher registered three goals and seven points in seven games, while the United States won the silver medal, falling 3–2 to Canada in the championship.\nCompher was meant to play for the United States junior team at the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, but he sustained a foot injury during practice and was cut from the team. The following year, he was one of several Wolverines to attend the 2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he was held pointless in five games for the fifth-place United States team.\nAll three members of Compher's \"CCM Line\" at Michigan were selected to represent the United States senior team at the 2016 IIHF World Championship in Russia. He recorded one goal and three points in 10 games, while the United States finished in fourth place, losing to Russia in the bronze-medal game. He returned the following year as one of nine Avalanche players to participate in the 2017 IIHF World Championship in Germany and France. There, he recorded two goals in eight contests.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhen deciding on his name, Compher's parents first decided on the initials \"J. T.\" before filling them out with his first and middle name, \"Joseph Taylor\". His younger sister, Jesse, is also a professional ice hockey player for the Toronto Sceptres and is a member of the United States women's national ice hockey team, with whom she won a silver medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics. She played college ice hockey for the Boston University Terriers and the Wisconsin Badgers.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nAwards and honors\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",
    "summary": "Joseph Taylor Compher (born April 8, 1995) is an American professional ice hockey center for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the second round, 35th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2013 NHL entry draft. Compher won the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2022.\nBorn and raised in Northbrook, Illinois, Compher was introduced to ice hockey by a preschool friend and played for a number of teams in the area before joining the USA Hockey National Team Development Program in 2011. He played for two seasons with the program, with appearances in two IIHF World U18 Championships. From there, he played three seasons of college ice hockey for the Michigan Wolverines. As a freshman during the 2013–14 season, Compher led all Big Ten Conference freshmen in scoring with 31 points, and he was named the inaugural Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Freshman of the Year. Two years later, he served both as the Wolverines' captain and as a member of the high-scoring \"CCM Line\". Made up of Compher, Kyle Connor, and Tyler Motte, the CCM Line combined for 83 goals and 107 assists during the 2015–16 season and helped Michigan to capture their first Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nWhile he was attending college, the Sabres included Compher in a trade package with the Colorado Avalanche, the team he joined after completing his career with Michigan. Compher spent the first part of the season with the San Antonio Rampage, the Avalanche's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, but finished the 2016–17 season in the NHL as a replacement for the traded Jarome Iginla. After finding success in his first full NHL season during 2017–18, Compher hoped to become Colorado's second-line center in 2018–19, a plan that was delayed when he was sidelined with a concussion. Compher posted consecutive 30-point seasons during the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons despite losing time to injury and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "text": "The Brothers Johnson was an American funk and R&B band consisting of the American brothers George (\"Lightnin' Licks\") and Louis E. Johnson (\"Thunder Thumbs\"). They achieved their greatest success from the mid-1970s to early 1980s, with three singles topping the R&B charts (\"I'll Be Good to You\", \"Strawberry Letter 23\", and \"Stomp!\").\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nFormation\nGuitarist/vocalist George and bassist/vocalist Louis formed the band Johnson Three Plus One with older brother Tommy and their cousin Alex Weir while attending school in Los Angeles, California. When they became professionals, the band backed such touring R&B acts as Bobby Womack and the Supremes. George and Louis Johnson later joined Billy Preston's band and wrote selections for his albums Music Is My Life and The Kids & Me before leaving his group in 1973. In 1976, the Brothers covered the Beatles' song, \"Hey Jude\", for the musical documentary All This and World War II.\nQuincy Jones hired them to play on his LP Mellow Madness, and recorded four of their songs, including \"Is It Love That We're Missin'?\" and \"Just a Taste of Me\".\nAfter touring with various artists including Bobby Womack and Billy Preston, they were hired by Quincy Jones for a tour in Japan and produced their debut album Look Out for #1, released in March 1976, which went to number 9 on the U.S. Billboard chart. Their Right on Time album was released in May 1977 and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 200. Blam!! came out in August 1978 and reached number 7 on the Billboard 200.\nTwo of the band's songs were featured on the soundtrack of the 1976 film Mother, Jugs & Speed and one on the 1997 film Jackie Brown. The instrumental track \"Thunder Thumbs and Lightnin' Licks\" refers to the brothers' nicknames. \"Get the Funk Out Ma Face\" was cowritten with Quincy Jones.\nTheir popular album Light Up the Night was released in March 1980 and rose to #5 on the Billboard 200. It was number 46 on the \"Top 100 LPs of 1980\" list in Rolling Stone. The brothers self-produced the subsequent album, Winners; released in July 1981, it only reached #48 on the Billboard 200.\nAmong their most popular songs are \"I'll Be Good to You\" (Billboard Hot 100 #3 in 1976) which prominently featured Syreeta Wright, \"Strawberry Letter 23\" (Hot 100 #5 in 1977, originally recorded by Shuggie Otis), \"Ain't We Funkin' Now\" (1978), and \"Stomp!\" (Hot 100 #7 and Hot Dance Music/Club Play #1 in 1980). Their styles include funk, and R&B ballads. Each album also included at least one instrumental cut that would either be considered light jazz (\"Tomorrow\", 1976; \"Q\", 1977; \"Streetwave\", 1978; \"Smilin' On Ya\", 1980; \"Tokyo\", 1984) or funk (\"Thunder Thumbs & Lightnin' Licks\", 1976; \"Brother Man\", 1977; \"Mista' Cool\", 1978; \"Celebrations\", 1980).\n\n\n1982 split\nThe duo split up in 1982 to pursue separate projects.\n\n\nLouis's solo work\nLouis Johnson recorded a gospel music album in 1981 with his own group Passage, which included his then-wife Valerie Johnson and former Brothers Johnson percussionist/singer Richard Heath. He played bass on Michael Jackson's Thriller. In 1985 he recorded a single, \"Kinky\", on Capitol Records; it appears on his Evolution album which was exclusively released in Europe that year. Louis then made 3 instructional videotapes for the Starlicks video-distribution company in which he shared his bass-playing skills. The first was released in 1985. He then settled down to enjoy family life with his wife and son, but by 1988 his then-manager Diane Taren talked him into going back into the recording studio. He started his bass academy during the 1990s and gave workshop clinics via his own Website. Louis Johnson died on May 21, 2015, age 60. His last performance was in 2013.\nTommy Johnson left the group and had a 29-year career with the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\n\nGeorge's solo work\nGeorge Johnson released one single in 1985, \"Back Against the Wall\", on Quincy Jones' own Qwest label. A complete album (recorded but unreleased) came from that session, as George confirmed when he and Louis were interviewed around 1987/88 for Blues & Soul Magazine in the United Kingdom (see link below). George also delivered guitar work for Steve Arrington's album Dancing in the Key of Life (1985) and had ad-libbed vocals on the track \"Think Back And Remember\" from the Galaxian album by the Jeff Lorber Fusion, released in 1981 on Arista Records.\n\n\nVarious 1980s reunions and other projects\n\nIn 1984 the brothers reunited in the recording studio. The resulting Leon Sylvers-produced LP, Out of Control, did not equal their past success, but it did garner them another R&B hit with \"You Keep Me Coming Back\". They teamed up again in 1988 to record Kickin', the title track of which (\"Kick It to the Curb\") was a collaboration with their then-neighbor Irene Cara. Although \"Kick It to the Curb\" became a minor hit, the album's success was even more limited.\nBetween the two albums, both George and Louis released their aforementioned solo material and also appeared on Street Shadows, an album by keyboardist/arranger David Diggs, who had provided horn and string arrangements for Winners, Blast!, and Louis' Passage. \"Last Night\", Streets opening track showcases George's bass-guitar playing. He previously showed his bass skills on tracks like \"Teaser\" from Winners and \"The Great Awakening\" from Blast, the same way Louis shows his guitar skills on the duo's various compositions.\nAlso during this time, the band's song \"Tomorrow\" (originally an instrumental on the B-side of \"Get the Funk Out Ma Face\") was recorded with vocals by Tevin Campbell for Quincy Jones' Back on the Block release in 1989. This album also included Jones' hit remake of the Brothers Johnson's \"I'll Be Good to You\", featuring Ray Charles and Chaka Khan.\nBesides the brothers' brief appearance in Japan around 1994 and George guest-appearing at a Graham Central Station concert in Japan (including a released double-CD), the duo launched an expanded US tour in 2002 which got positive, wide exposure. It was visited by many fans and various artists in the entertainment business. Along with a website and discussion-forum, online visitors could share their experiences of the shows by wandering through the Land of Ladies and reliving Funkadelia's heyday. A few years later, a combi-release of live-CD + DVD was released under the name Strawberry Letter 23: Live.\nIn 2006, Louis gave a duo-show with a drummer on the Poetry in Motion 1 Festival in Maryland. In late 2007 George performed with his own band at a Detroit festival, including a persona called Sir Nose. These days George performs with a special band, an initiative of Michael Henderson that includes Adina Howard, Cherrelle, Ray Parker Jr., and others.\nLouis Johnson was found dead at his home in Las Vegas, May 21, 2015. The cause of death was gastrointestinal bleeding of the esophagus.\nIn 2022, the brothers' song \"Ain't We Funkin' Now\" was sampled in singer Harry Styles' song 'Daydreaming\" from his third album Harry's House.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nLive albums\nStrawberry Letter 23: Live (2004, Goldenlane)\n\n\nCompilation albums\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nVideography\n1977 – Right on Time\n1980 – Stomp\n1981 – The Real Thing\n1988 – Kick It to the Curb\n\n\nSee also\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. dance chart\nList of Number 1 Dance Hits (United States)\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nBrothers Johnson career on A&M Records with gallery, international discography\nThe Brothers Johnson discography at Discogs\nBlues & Soul-interview (1987/1988)\nThe Brothers Johnson at AllMusic",

    "title": "Coalition of Domestic Election Observers",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=52401117",
    "text": "The Coalition of Domestic Observers (CODEO) is a network of civil society groups, faith-based organizations, and professional bodies that observe Ghanaian elections to ensure free, fair, and transparent elections.  Since its establishment in 2000, CODEO became the largest domestic election observer network in Ghana–consisting of forty-two civil society, professional, and faith-based organizations. CODEO also holds membership with the Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) and the West African Election Observers Network (WAEON). Despite the long history of both domestic and international election observers in Africa, CODEO has established itself as a continental example for successful election observation and peaceful transitions to democratization.\n\n\nHistory of CODEO\nThe Coalition of Domestic Observers was established in 2000 through the collaboration of the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF). A variety of fears and anxiety about Ghanaian elections inspired the need for election observation, however, the upcoming 2000 Ghanaian election was the catalyst for the creation of CODEO. Its creation was a direct response to demands for accountability and increasingly responsive governance from civil society. Originally, CODEO consisted of twenty-two civil society, professional, and faith-based organizations–including, but not limited to Federation of Muslim Councils (FMC), the Ghana Bar Association (GBA), and the Institute of Democratic Studies (IDS). Although the 2000 election was the first time that these organizations organized under the name \"Coalition of Domestic Election Observers,\" under the umbrella of CDD-Ghana, they had previously organized during the 1996 Ghanaian election as the Network of Domestic Election Observers (NEDEO). Because the 2000 election had a substantial influence on the creation of CODEO, understanding the complicated history of democratization in Ghana is crucial to grasping the motivations of CDD-Ghana and FNF.\n\n\n1992 election\nThe third and fourth wave of democratization of the 1980s and 1990s heralded significant change within African elections. Most notable were regime transitions and a shift to multi-party elections. This transition occurred in 1993 in Ghana with the replacement of a quasi-military regime, the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC) to the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the first contested election in the country since 1957. It was during his second coup, at the end of 1981, that Jerry John Rawlings would initially assume power. Rawlings established the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) which acted as a joint military-civilian government, with Rawlings as the acting chairman. Although the PNDC warranted overwhelmingly strong citizen support, the third and fourth waves of democratization in Africa prompted a switch to democratic systems. In response, Rawlings formed the National Democratic Congress (NDC) as the ruling party ahead of the 1992 election. Running against Rawlings in the 1992 election was Albert Adu Baohen from the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Hila Limann from the People's National Convention (NPC), Kwabena Darko from the National Independence Party (NIC), and Emmanuel Erskine from the People's Heritage Party (PHP). Despite voter turnout remaining relatively low at 50%, Jerry Rawlings won in a landslide, securing 58.3% of the popular vote. While his victory is incredibly significant considering that the election followed Rawlings' 10-year rule, it highlights several issues preventing a successful democracy: voter fraud, performative democracy, and voter participation.\n\n\n1996 election\nThe 1996 Ghanaian election, although highly anticipated, didn't carry the same weight as the previous election. Considering how the 1992 election established multi-party elections within Ghana, the 1996 elections now held questions about legacy and transitions of power. Although the 1996 election didn't see familiar names, outside of Jerry Rawlings, parties from the last election remained and floated to the top. Competitors included John Agyekum Kuffour of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and Edward Mahama from the People's National Convention (NPC). Unsurprisingly, Rawlings secured the presidency with 57.4% of the popular vote. It was during this election that the Network of Domestic Election Observers (NEDEO) formed and convened its first meeting. NEDEO included several civic organizations and religious bodies that recognized a need for election observation. For these organizations, voter fraud stood in the way of the free, fair, and transparent elections needed to construct a successful democracy in Ghana.\n\n\n2000 election\nConsidering that Jerry John Rawlings was in power under the quasi-military regime and remained president after Ghanaian democratization, it wasn't until the 2000 Ghanaian election that fears of unpeaceful democratic alteration of power would occur. If Jerry Rawlings refused to relent power or stirred doubts about a fair election, he could easily set a precedent of conflict and authoritarianism in the country. In light of these fears, the civic organizations and religious bodies that formed the Network of Domestic Election Observers (NEDEO) in the 1996 election reconvened for a second meeting.  It was with the assistance of the Ghana Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF) that NEDEO was able to expand and adopt the name Coalition of Domestic Election Observers (CODEO). It was during this turbulent 2000 election that CODEO sought to assist the electoral commission in ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections. Additionally, considering the necessity for a regime change, CODEO acted as a buffer between Ghana and potential election violence. The major competitors in the 2000 election were John Agyekum Kuffour of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), John Atta Mills of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), and Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention (NPC). In the first round of voting, John Agyekum Kuffour won the popular vote by 48% with John Atta Mills trailing behind at 44% of the popular vote. However, during the second round, Kufour defeated Atta-Mills with 57% of the vote. Kufour's victory translated to a significant shift in both the President and the ruling party. For the first time in Ghanaian history, the New Patriotic Party reigned both within the executive branch and parliament. The 2000 election also marked the first peaceful transfer of power via the ballot box in Ghanaian history. This was incredibly significant because it set a precedent for democratic elections within Ghana and prevented major democratic backsliding.\n\n\nStructure and membership\nStarting with a network of only twenty-two organizations, CODEO has now expanded to include forty-two organizations.\nCODEO is managed by a sixteen-member advisory board. Along with this advisory board, a large internal team provides project management and CDD-Ghana serves as a secretariat to provide technical and logical support. Although Sheikh Armiyawo Shaibu serves as the acting chairperson on the advisory board, Professor Miranda Greenstreet and Justice V.C.R.A.C Crabbe serve as the current co-chairs of the CODEO Advisory Board.\nCODEO currently includes forty-two members, these include a wide range of civil society, faith-based, and professional associations: ABANTU for Development; Amnesty International; Centre for Human Rights and Advanced Legal Research (CHRALER); Chartered Institute of Accountants Ghana; Civil and Local Government Staff Association, Ghana (CLOGSAG); Council for Islamic Education Unit; FIDA-Ghana; Ghana Center for Democratic Development; Ghana Institute of Planners; Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII); Ghana Medical Association (GMA); Ghana Muslim Mission, Ghana Pentacoastal and Charismatic Council (GPCC); Ghana Registered Nurses Association (GRNA); Islamic Council for Development and Humanitarian Servies (ICODEHS); Legal Research Centre (LRC); National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT); National Union of Ghana Students (NUGS); Penplusbytes/Africa Elections Project; WILDAF Ghana; Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, Ghana; Association of Ghana Industries (AGI); Centre for the Development of People (CEDEP); Christian Council of Ghana (CCG); Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, Council of Independent Churches; Federation of Muslim Councils (FMC); Ghana Bar Association (GBA); Ghana Institution of Surveyors; Ghana Journalists Association (GJA); Ghana Muslim Academy, Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT); Ghana Registered Midwives Associations (GRMA); Ghana Trades Union Congress (TUC); Junior Chamber-International Ghana; Muslim Dialogue and Humanitarian Organization; National Network of Local Civiv Union (NETCU); Office of National Chief Imam; University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG); Youth Bridge Foundation. While not an explicit member organization, CODEO has a list of notable donors including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Democratic Institute (NDI), and the Ford Foundation.\n\n\nImportance and accomplishments\nThe Coalition of Domestic Election Observers prides itself on impartially observing every election in Ghana since 2000, including party primaries, local government elections, general elections, and by-elections. The Coalition's observation is crucial both in public confidence and in improving the integrity of the electoral process. Throughout its tenure, CODEO claims numerous nationwide democratic accomplishments, significant improvements in election monitoring technology, and observation beyond Ghana.\nAlong with domestic election observation, CODEO has expanded beyond Ghana. In 2010, CODEO co-founded the West African Election Observers Network (WAEON). Similar to CODEO, WAEON is a non-partisan, independent organization with CDD-Ghana serving as its secretariat. However, WAEON serves a supporting and strengthening role for Citizen Election Observation Groups in the West African sub-region. Their support of various member organizations encourages election observation and electoral reform and advocacy within their respective countries. CODEO's co-founding of WAEON can be seen as an extension of their inspiration to other African countries. Considering that CODEO is a domestic election observer is incredibly significant because African countries have a legacy of international election observers. However, domestic election observers restore agency and ownership to citizens. They allow citizens to feel empowered in voting and electoral integrity\nThe Coalition of Domestic Election Observers claims membership to the Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM), along with 251 member organizations in 89 countries and territories. These peer membership organizations include the Coalition for Free and Fair Elections and Sustainable Democracy (CFFESD) in Albania, the Association for the Support of Democracy (EASD) in Egypt, the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), and others. GNDEM believes thoroughly in the participation and will of citizens as the backbone of the government. GNDEM works to push forward credible and advanced electoral monitoring methodologies that ensure accuracy while preventing voting hindrances. Because of its large membership, GNDEM can pool together a variety of practices from different regional and national monitors to ensure the facilitation of election observation innovations. Through success stories featured online, GNDEM is also able to share the events, programs, and initiatives of their member organizations across the globe.\nIn 2016, CODEO launched six broad-based projects and citizen support programs with the support of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The first of these six programs, Domestic Election Observation, is directly related to their mission of Election Observation. This program includes observing each phase of an election, including the pre-election, Election day, and the immediate post-election. CODEO deploys hundreds of election observers to monitor voter registration, the pre-election environment, and polling stations on Election Day.\nThe second project was the Implementation of a Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT), aimed at enhancing the quality of Election Day observation. PVT included a random sampling process that deployed observers to polling stations on Election Day to tabulate the results and their accuracy. Not only does PVT provide an incentive for polling stations and candidates to remain integral, but verifies the tabulation results from the Electoral Commission. PVT has been used successfully across the globe as an efficient and scientifically established method of observing important elections.\nAmong the remaining projects are two specifically aimed at electoral reforms: Advocacy and Education. The Advocacy for the Implementation of Electoral Reforms Program focuses on observing and tracking the implementation of electoral reforms accepted by the Electoral Commission. CODEO wants to ensure that electoral reforms are being implemented fairly and inclusively. Regarding electoral reforms, CODEO worked to deepen citizens' knowledge of electoral reforms through district-level civic and voter education. This education program is aimed at covering both basic information (i.e. casting a ballot correctly) and more advanced material (vote-buying and election peace).\nThe last two of the six projects include targeted collaboration programs toward vote-buying and parliamentary candidates. Along with STAR-Ghana, and CDD-Ghana, CODEO launched 'Educating the Public on Voting on Policy Issues: Reducing Vote Buying in Election 2016' to promote policy issue campaigning. Overall, the project sought to educate regional electorates to guide voting choices. The Parliamentary Candidates Platform project focuses on elevating the campaigns of parliamentary candidates to ensure post-election accountability and responsiveness. The project specifically highlights campaigns that include policy issues that affect the lives of marginalized communities (women, youth, people living with disabilities, and persons with HIV/AIDS). CODEO is partnering with the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), and CDD-Ghana to complete this project.\n\n\nSee also\nGolos (election monitor)\nElectoral Observation Mission (Colombia)\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "The Coalition of Domestic Observers (CODEO) is a network of civil society groups, faith-based organizations, and professional bodies that observe Ghanaian elections to ensure free, fair, and transparent elections.  Since its establishment in 2000, CODEO became the largest domestic election observer network in Ghana–consisting of forty-two civil society, professional, and faith-based organizations. CODEO also holds membership with the Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) and the West African Election Observers Network (WAEON). Despite the long history of both domestic and international election observers in Africa, CODEO has established itself as a continental example for successful election observation and peaceful transitions to democratization.",

    "text": "General elections were held in South Africa on 8 May 2019 to elect a new President, National Assembly and provincial legislatures in each province. These were the sixth elections held since the end of apartheid in 1994 and determined who would become the next President of South Africa.\nIncumbent President Cyril Ramaphosa led the ruling African National Congress, with the party attempting to retain its majority status and secure Ramaphosa a full term in office as president; his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, resigned from office on 14 February 2018. Zuma was already ineligible for a third term in office as the South African Constitution limits a president to serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nThe National Assembly election was won by the ruling African National Congress (ANC), but with a reduced majority of 57.50%, down from 62.15% in the 2014 election. This was the ANC's lowest vote share since the introduction of non-racial democratic elections in 1994. The official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) also saw its proportion of the vote decline, from 22.23% to 20.77%, while the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) significantly grew their vote share, from 6.35% to 10.80%. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) grew from 2.40% to 3.38%; this was the first time the party's vote share increased since 1994. The Freedom Front Plus (VF+) also grew from 0.9% to 2.38%, achieving its largest vote share since its founding.\nEight of the nine provincial legislatures were won by the ANC, though it lost its two-thirds majority in the National Council of Provinces for the first time since 1994. The EFF retained its position as official opposition in Limpopo and the North West, while simultaneously beating the Democratic Alliance to second place in Mpumalanga. The DA obtained second place in four provinces won by the ANC. In KwaZulu-Natal, the Inkatha Freedom Party beat the DA to second place for the first time since 2014. In the Western Cape, the only province not won by the ANC, the DA declined from 59.38% to 55.45%.\n\n\nElectoral system\nSouth Africa has a parliamentary system of government; the National Assembly consists of 400 members elected by closed list proportional representation. Two hundred members are elected from national party lists; the other 200 are elected from provincial party lists in each of the nine provinces. The 200 provincial seats are divided among the provinces based on population, ranging from 5 seats in the Northern Cape to 48 seats in Gauteng, as of this election. The largest remainder method and the Droop quota are used to allocate seats at both the provincial and national level. All 400 seats are first allocated to parties at the national level, then the 200 provincial seats are allocated to parties in each of the nine provinces. Finally, the national list seats are allocated to the parties by subtracting seats won at the provincial level for each party from that party's national allocation, generating a maximally proportional result. A provision in the electoral law limits the number of seats allocated in the highest remainder stage of the national allocation to 5, with any remaining unallocated seats distributed according to the highest average of votes per seat. The president of South Africa is elected by the National Assembly after the election.\nThe provincial legislatures, which vary in size from 30 to 80 members, are also elected by proportional representation with closed lists, using the same method as the provincial allocation in the national election. The premiers of each province are elected by the respective provincial legislatures.\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) consists of 90 members, ten elected by each provincial legislature. The NCOP members are elected by the provincial legislatures in proportion to the party makeup of the legislatures.\n\n\nDate of election\nThe term of the National Assembly is five years. The previous general election was held on 7 May 2014, and the term of the National Assembly therefore ended on 6 May 2019, but the National Assembly remained competent to function from the time it is dissolved, or its term expires, until the day before the first day of polling for the next National Assembly.\nWhen the National Assembly's term expires (or if it is dissolved), the President must call and set dates for an election, which must be held within 90 days of the date the National Assembly was dissolved or its term expired. Therefore, if the National Assembly had not been dissolved before 6 May 2019, the election had to be held by 4 August 2019. A proclamation calling and setting dates for an election may be issued before or after the expiry of the term of the National Assembly.\nOn 7 February 2019, while President Cyril Ramaphosa was delivering the annual State of the Nation Address before Parliament, he announced that national and provincial elections would be held on Wednesday, 8 May 2019. This was confirmed in the official proclamation of the election date, made on 26 February 2019, which also closed the voters' roll.\n\n\nVoter registration\n\n\nLocal voters\nOn the weekends of 10–11 March 2018 and 26–27 January 2019, all voting stations were opened for new voters to register and for those who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. All South African political parties launched voter registration campaigns. Politicians especially urged the youth to register to vote. Following the January 2019 registration, the commission announced that over 700,000 new voters had registered over the January registration weekend. This brought the combined total of new voters to over 1.1 million and the total number of voters on the voters' roll to 26,727,921.\n\n\nInternational voters\nVoter registrations for all South Africans living abroad took place from 1 to 4 February 2019. The registration took place during the office hours at all of South Africa's 120 diplomatic missions. On 14 March 2019, the Independent Electoral Commission confirmed that 30,532 South African voters abroad applied to be included in the election, of which 29,334 applications were approved.\n\n\nCandidates\n\n\nContesting political parties\n\nThe governing African National Congress (ANC) has held a majority of the seats in the National Assembly since 1994, being re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority in 2009 and 2014. The ANC is led by Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected to a five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, by a narrow margin. David Mabuza was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Ramaphosa.\nOn 14 February 2018, Zuma resigned as President of South Africa, leading Ramaphosa, as Deputy President, to succeed him as acting president and serve out the remainder of Zuma's term. Ramaphosa was elected president on 15 February 2018. Ramaphosa thus ran for a full term in office as president.\nThe official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) was led by Helen Zille. She announced on 12 April 2015, that she was not running for re-election.\nLeader of the Opposition Mmusi Maimane and Federal Chairperson Wilmot James were seen as prominent front-runners.\nAt the party's 2015 Federal Congress in Port Elizabeth, Maimane was elected leader of the DA, succeeding outgoing leader Helen Zille. He defeated Wilmot James, winning close to 90% of the vote. He was backed by prominent businessman and future Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba. He became the first black South African to lead the DA, as well as its youngest leader to date. In the 2016 municipal elections, the party contested the municipal elections for the first time under the leadership of Mmusi Maimane. The party gained significant support and control of municipalities all across South Africa while assuming control of most Western Cape councils. In addition, the party gained three metropolitan municipalities from the ANC – Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay. The party did increase its majority in Cape Town. They lost control of the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality in August 2018, after a vote of no confidence ousted the DA administration. The DA held its Federal Congress on 7–8 April 2018 in Pretoria. Mmusi Maimane was re-elected unopposed as the leader for another term.\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is a splinter party of the ANC that was formed in July 2013 by expelled ANC Youth League leader, Julius Malema, taking a strong anti-ANC position within its far-left economic platform, such as calling for the expropriation of land without compensation, and the nationalisation of South Africa's mines and the South African Reserve Bank. The party contested its first general elections in 2014 and garnered support across South Africa, giving it a total of 25 seats in the National Assembly.\nThe Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) was led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The party's support has decreased since 2004 due to internal party disputes. The party gained municipalities and support in its stronghold of KwaZulu-Natal in the 2016 municipal elections. This election would be Buthelezi's last election as party president, as he announced on 20 January 2019 that he would not seek re-election to another term. The party launched its manifesto on 10 March 2019. The party elected Velenkosini Hlabisa as Buthelezi's successor.\nThe National Freedom Party (NFP) was formed in 2011 by disgruntled IFP members. It was launched on 25 January 2011 by Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, former chairperson of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). The party made gains on the IFP in 2014 but lost support in 2016. The party launched its manifesto on 31 March 2019.\nThe Freedom Front Plus (FF+; Afrikaans: Vryheidsfront Plus, VF+) is a conservative, White separatist party formed in 1994, led by Pieter Groenewald. Since 2004, the party's support has increased but has maintained a small presence in parliament by securing no more than four seats in the National Assembly since the 2004 general election. According to the party's manifesto: \"The Freedom Front Plus is irrevocably committed to the realisation of communities', in particular, the Afrikaner's, internationally recognised right to self-determination, territorial or otherwise; the maintenance, protection and promotion of their rights and interests, as well as the promotion of the right of self-determination of any other community, bound by a common language and cultural heritage in South Africa.\" The party launched its manifesto on 2 March 2019.\nThe Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) announced on 20 March 2019 that a record number of 48 parties had registered candidates for the national parliamentary election. This is 19 more parties that contested the 2014 national elections. In the provincial legislature elections, the total number of parties that registered candidates were:\n\nEastern Cape – 26\nFree State – 28\nGauteng – 36\nKwaZulu-Natal – 31\nLimpopo – 34\nMpumalanga – 28\nNorthern Cape – 21\nNorth West – 29\nWestern Cape – 34\nThe electoral code of conduct was signed at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Gauteng on 20 March 2019. At the signing event, a draw was held in which the African Security Congress won the right to appear at the top of the ballot paper.\nNotable new parties that contested the elections include:\n\nBlack First Land First (BLF) is a controversial far-left black nationalist political party. The party is headed by its founder and expelled EFF member, Andile Mngxitama. Mngxitama was expelled from the EFF in April 2015 and subsequently lost his National Assembly membership. He founded the party in October 2015, along with other disgruntled EFF members. The party's leaders and its members have been criticised and condemned for making racially insensitive comments that call for the killing of white South Africans. The party launched its manifesto on 6 April 2019.\nDisgruntled former ANC Member of Parliament, Makhosi Khoza, founded the political party African Democratic Change (ADeC) in December 2017. She announced in April 2018 that she was retiring from politics. She later resigned from OUTA in March 2019.\nPatricia de Lille, former mayor of Cape Town and DA member, formed the political party Good in December 2018. The party is registered with the Electoral Commission of South Africa and contested the 2019 elections. The party launched its manifesto on 5 February 2019.\nOn 13 December 2018, former SABC Chief Operating Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng joined the country's political landscape and launched a new political group named the African Content Movement (ACM). The party launched its manifesto on 6 April 2019.\nThe African Transformation Movement (ATM) is a political party that was formed in October 2018. It is led by Vuyolwethu Zungula. Former Eastern Cape Democratic Alliance Provincial Chairperson Veliswa Mvenya defected to the party and became the party's Provincial Chairperson of the party.\nThe Capitalist Party of South Africa (ZACP) is a political party that was launched on 17 March 2018.  It was founded by ten people who describe themselves as \"positive disruptors\" and who believe that innovative thinking could find solutions to many of South Africa's problems. The new political party has a purple cow as its logo.\nThe Land Party is led by Gcobani Ndzongana. The party grew out of land access and housing protests in Zwelihle, Hermanus in 2018. The party launched its manifesto on 21 March 2019.\n\n\nNational\nThe IEC announced on 20 March 2019 that the following parties would contest the national ballot:\n\n\nProvincial-only\nThe following parties contested at provincial level only:\n\n\nParty defections\nFormer Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, resigned from the Democratic Alliance on 31 October 2018. Various City of Cape Town councillors resigned along with her, including Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Brett Herron, and City of Cape Town Chief Whip, Shaun August. De Lille has since formed a new political party named Good.\nOn 30 December 2018, former DA Western Cape MPP and special advisor to the Minister of Police Bheki Cele, Lennit Max, announced his resignation from the Democratic Alliance and subsequently joined the ANC. The DA had allegedly pressured Max to resign as a party member when he was appointed special advisor in July 2018.\nThe United Democratic Movement welcomed former Deputy Party President of the NFP, Sindi Maphumulo-Mashinini, to the party on 2 February 2019.\nOn 17 February 2019, African National Congress Member of Parliament, Dr Zukile Luyenge, resigned from the ANC and consequently joined the African Transformation Movement. Luyenge was a member of the ANC for thirty years and was elected MP in 2009. The Office of the ANC Chief Whip in the National Assembly confirmed the resignation.\nOn 2 March 2019, four Eastern Cape Democratic Alliance members resigned from the party and joined the African Transformation Movement. All of the ex-DA members had previously served as municipal councillors. On the same day, ANC, DA and EFF party t-shirts were burnt by defectors to the Minority Front at the party's manifesto launch.\nFormer Eastern Cape ANC Transport MEC, Thandiswa Marawu, defected to the African Transformation Movement on 11 March 2019.\nOn 13 March 2019, it was announced that former Provincial Leader of the Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal, Sizwe Mchunu, and several DA Msunduzi Local Municipality councillors, defected to the African National Congress. National Freedom Party MPL, Njabulo Mlaba, also defected to the ANC.\nFormer Eastern Cape Provincial Chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Themba Wele, defected to the African Transformation Movement on 15 March 2019.\nOn 26 March 2019, former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor announced that she was joining the African Christian Democratic Party.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nCorruption\nCorruption within the government and government-owned enterprises was a significant electoral issue with all three of the largest parties campaigning on the issue. The ANC promised to fight corruption within the government and its own party whilst also controversially claiming that it had set up the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture.\nThe DA wanted to impose a standard 15-year jail sentence for anyone caught committing corruption and establish a new anti-corruption unit in the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate politicians and government officials involved in misconduct. The EFF proposed amending the constitution to make the National Prosecuting Authority accountable to Parliament, rather than the National Government.\n\n\nLand reform\nLand reform was also a major campaign issue that the three largest political parties campaigned on.  The ANC pledged to accelerate redistribution through expropriation in a way that will not negatively impact food security. The EFF campaign for state ownership over all land and the abolition of rents whilst the DA campaigned to strengthen property rights but at the same time implementing a land-reform program that increases access to land ownership. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and Congress of the People (COPE) and many other parties are strongly opposed to land expropriation without compensation. COPE and AfriForum have since formed a partnership in their opposition to the controversial policy.\n\n\nEconomic growth\nThe ANC announced that it would be making economic growth and reducing unemployment the party's main campaign issues during the election. A particular focus for the ANC was on youth unemployment with a promise to create 275,000 new jobs a year for five years and attract R1.2 trillion in investment. Other parties also focused on job creation with the DA promising economic reforms to encourage growth and promoting the growth of small businesses. DA Federal Leader Mmusi Maimane advocated for a job in every household, whilst the EFF promised special economic zones to attract foreign investment.\n\n\nCrime\n\nA number of parties campaigned on the issue of crime and how to deal with it.  The ANC pledged to strengthen the police force through better training and recruiting more officers whilst also focusing on dealing with gender-based violence. The DA advocated for the creation and strengthening of local level police forces instead of existing government policy focusing on the national level South African Police Service. The EFF promised harsher sentences for offenders and to greatly expand the police force.\nThe Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), African Covenant and the African Transformation Movement (ATM) campaigned for the return of the death penalty.\n\n\nElectricity crisis\n\nRolling electricity blackouts caused by long-running and ongoing problems resulting from mismanagement and corruption at the state utility Eskom was an election issue that the Democratic Alliance campaigned on against the incumbent ANC. Mmusi Maimane and the Democratic Alliance Western Cape Premier candidate, Alan Winde, campaigned for the Western Cape to procure its electricity supply from Independent Power Producers (IPPs). ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa said that South Africa would overcome the electricity crisis.\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nDurban xenophobic riots\n\nOn 25 March 2019 in the run-up to the election xenophobic riots targeting African immigrants broke out in Durban resulting in the deaths of three people and the looting of foreign-owned stores. A speech given by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the ANC's election manifesto launch in the area two months prior where Ramaphosa committed to cracking down on undocumented foreigners involved in criminal activities was blamed for contributing to xenophobic feeling. The riots and the xenophobic feeling was condemned by political parties and the government.\n\n\nNational service delivery protests\n\nIn early April 2019, a number of service delivery protests took place in Alexandra and Tshwane. The protests were supported by the trade union SAFTU who called on other areas in the province to join the protests. On 11 April 2019, the protests spread to areas of other major cities in the rest of the country. The DA and EFF accused the ANC of instigating the Alexandra protests as an election tactic in the runup to the election in May whilst the ANC accused the DA of not effectively delivering services to the protesting communities. The DA made a counter-accusation that it was ANC governance in these areas two years before was the root cause of poor service delivery in Alexandra.\n\n\nAccusations of Russian influence\nJust before the election was concluded accusations of Russian influence operations in the elections were published in the South African media.  The Daily Maverick and Guardian newspapers reported that Putin associate Yevgeny Prigozhin worked to increase support for the ANC and undermine support for the DA and EFF. The Daily Maverick and Dossier Center report stated that Russian political analysis worked \"under the auspices of Afric and the International Anti-Crisis Center\" to conduct an influence-buying and disinformation campaign. The Russian embassy in South Africa denied the accusation and stated that the accusation does \"not stand [up to] basic scrutiny.\"\n\n\nVoting\n\n\nInternational special votes\nOver 29,300 South Africans registered to participate in the national election in the international voting phase, which took place at 120 international voting stations on 27 April 2019. The overseas ballots were counted along with the domestic votes on 8 May 2019.\n\n\nSpecial votes\nThe local special vote phase of the election took place from 6 to 7 May 2019, accommodating South Africans who are physically infirm, disabled or pregnant or are unable to vote at their voting station on the polling day. The registration for special votes took place from 4 to 18 April 2019. More than 770,000 voters had registered for special votes. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and his wife Leah cast their special votes on 6 May.\n\n\nVoting day\nVoting took place relatively smoothly at 22,925 voting stations in South Africa. Voting stations opened at 7:00. By 11:30, the IEC announced that 17 voting stations had not opened, of which 14 were located in the KwaZulu-Natal. A total of 5 voting stations were not operational on voting day. The Commission blamed ongoing community unrest for the derailing of election operations. Voting stations closed and counting began at 21:00.\n\n\nIncidents\nNineteen people were arrested for allegedly \"double voting\" in three KwaZulu-Natal municipalities. It is still unclear whether a twentieth person has been arrested.\nAn elderly woman died on voting day while trying to cast her ballot. The Gauteng African National Congress sent their condolences. An Eastern Cape deputy presiding officer also died.\n\n\nIndelible ink\nDuring the election there was some controversy over the quality of indelible ink used to mark voters and prevent double voting.  It was reported by some voters that the ink was easily removed shortly after voting, leading to questions around the quality of the ink used. An IEC investigation following the elections concluded that there were \"negligible risks\" to the election and its results caused by this event.\n\n\nOpinion polls\n\n\nResults\n\n\nParliament\n\n\nNational Assembly\n\n\nNational Council of Provinces\nAfter the elections of 8 May 2019, the new provincial legislatures met on 22 May to elect NCOP delegations. The delegations elected are described in the following table.\n\n\nProvincial legislatures\n\n\nEastern Cape\n\n\nFree State\n\n\nGauteng\n\n\nKwaZulu-Natal\n\n\nLimpopo\n\n\nMpumalanga\n\n\nNorthern Cape\n\n\nNorth West\n\n\nWestern Cape\n\n\nAftermath\n\n\nParty leadership\nThe African National Congress (ANC) announced its parliamentary leadership candidates on 20 May 2019. The party announced that outgoing National Council of Provinces Chairperson, Thandi Modise, would succeed Baleka Mbete as Speaker of the National Assembly. Amos Masondo was named the new Chairperson of National Council of the Provinces. Controversial ANC politician, Nomvula Mokonyane, was named as the party's candidate for the post of Chair of Committees, but she withdrew her name prior to the first sitting of the new National Assembly. Outgoing Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete and former ANC MP Malusi Gigaba declined their seats.\nAfter the elections, it was speculated that the Democratic Alliance (DA) would dismiss its leader, Mmusi Maimane, due to the party's decline in the polls. When asked about the speculations, the DA Federal Council Chairperson James Selfe said \"that will be up to the party to decide.\" The following week, the party's Federal Chairperson Athol Trollip, after in consultation with the Federal Executive members, announced that Maimane could remain leader until the next DA Federal Congress. Maimane resigned from the party on 24 October 2019. John Steenhuisen was elected his interim successor on 17 November 2019. Senior Freedom Front Plus member Philip van Staden stated that his party benefited considerably in the election due to the Maimane's positions on race and ethnic identity resulting in the alienation of many white voters.\nThe Congress of the People (COPE), who had a dismal showing and further declined in this election, was rumoured to be planning a motion of no confidence in its leader, Mosiuoa Lekota, to effectively dismiss him over the party's partnership with controversial AfriForum. The party quickly rubbished the claims, stating that it has full confidence in its leader.\nThe Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) held its elective conference in August 2019 to elect a new leader for the first time in its history as chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi stepped down after 44 years at the helm. The conference elected former mayor and current leader of the opposition in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, Velenkosini Hlabisa, as his successor.\n\n\nSwearing-in of MPs and MPLs\nThe National Assembly and all nine provincial legislatures reconvened on 22 May 2019, while the National Council of Provinces reconvened on the following day, 23 May 2019.\nOn 22 May 2019, the National Assembly reconvened, Chief Justice Mogoeng presided over the swearing-in of MPs and the election of the Speaker of the National Assembly. Former NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise of the African National Congress (ANC) was elected Speaker. Modise defeated the Democratic Alliance's candidate Richard Majola, by a margin of 250 votes to only 83 votes for Majola. Modise presided over the deputy speaker's election. Incumbent deputy speaker Solomon Lechesa Tsenoli of the ANC was re-elected unopposed. The chief justice then presided over the election of the president. Incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC was re-elected unopposed. After the election, Ramaphosa immediately ceased to be a Member of Parliament.\nThe first sitting of the National Council of Provinces was held on 23 May 2019. Permanent delegates were sworn in and a chairperson, deputy chairperson, House Chairpersons and Chief Whip were elected. Former mayor of Johannesburg Amos Masondo was elected chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, while former Northern Cape premier Sylvia Lucas was elected deputy chairperson. ANC Chief Whip Seiso Mohai was re-elected.\n\n\nPresidential inauguration and government formation\nThe official presidential inauguration took place on 25 May 2019. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng swore President-elect Cyril Ramaphosa in for his full-term as Executive President. The inauguration was the first to be held at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, and not at the Union Buildings. The Union Buildings had been the official venue of the presidential inauguration since the country's first democratically elected president, Nelson Mandela, took the oath of office in 1994.\nShortly after, on 29 May 2019, Ramaphosa announced his new cabinet. The restructured cabinet has been reduced from 36 to only 28 ministries and includes former Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy, Good Party Leader Patricia de Lille and former mayor of Johannesburg Parks Tau. Fourteen ministers were not reappointed to this cabinet. Notable outgoing ministers included Jeff Radebe, Bathabile Dlamini, Nomaindia Mfeketo and Tokozile Xasa. The newly appointed ministers were officially sworn in on 30 May 2019. In the following days, multiple former ministers resigned their seats in the National Assembly.\n\n\nFurther reading\nLieberman, Evan. 2022.

    "summary": "General elections were held in South Africa on 8 May 2019 to elect a new President, National Assembly and provincial legislatures in each province. These were the sixth elections held since the end of apartheid in 1994 and determined who would become the next President of South Africa.\nIncumbent President Cyril Ramaphosa led the ruling African National Congress, with the party attempting to retain its majority status and secure Ramaphosa a full term in office as president; his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, resigned from office on 14 February 2018. Zuma was already ineligible for a third term in office as the South African Constitution limits a president to serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nThe National Assembly election was won by the ruling African National Congress (ANC), but with a reduced majority of 57.50%, down from 62.15% in the 2014 election. This was the ANC's lowest vote share since the introduction of non-racial democratic elections in 1994. The official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) also saw its proportion of the vote decline, from 22.23% to 20.77%, while the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) significantly grew their vote share, from 6.35% to 10.80%. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) grew from 2.40% to 3.38%; this was the first time the party's vote share increased since 1994. The Freedom Front Plus (VF+) also grew from 0.9% to 2.38%, achieving its largest vote share since its founding.\nEight of the nine provincial legislatures were won by the ANC, though it lost its two-thirds majority in the National Council of Provinces for the first time since 1994. The EFF retained its position as official opposition in Limpopo and the North West, while simultaneously beating the Democratic Alliance to second place in Mpumalanga. The DA obtained second place in four provinces won by the ANC. In KwaZulu-Natal, the Inkatha Freedom Party beat the DA to second place for the first time since 2014. In the Western Cape, the only province not won by the ANC, the DA declined from 59.38% to 55.45%.",

The aircraft is powered by a Lycoming O-360 four-cylinder, direct-drive, horizontally opposed, air-cooled, piston engine.\nBölkow had built the two and three-seat Kl 107 and developed a four-seat variant, at first designated the Kl 107D. The low-wing cabin monoplane had a re-designed cockpit and canopy and a larger tail. The two prototype Kl 107Ds were built at Nabern and the first flew on 10 October 1960. With the change of name of the company to Bolkow and the move to new factory at Laupheim production of the new variant was started at the new factory. In May 1961 the design was re-designated the Bolkow F.207 but by July 1961 it was re-designated again as the Bolkow BO 207.\nThe first of 90 production aircraft built at Laupheim was flown on 24 May 1961 and production continued until 1963. A number of aircraft remained unsold and the last aircraft although built in 1963 did not fly until 1 April 1966. One aircraft was built with tricycle landing gear, and designated BO 217B or sometimes known as the BO 214 but it was fitted with a conventional landing gear before it was sold.\n\n\nVariants\nKl 107D\nTwo prototypes later re-designated F.207 and then BO 207.

    "text": "Divers voyages et missions du père Alexandre de Rhodes de la Compagnie de Jésus en la Chine et autres royaumes de l'Orient, avec son retour en Europe par la Perse et l’Arménie is a travel book written by the Avignonese Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes (1591-1660) which was published in 1653. In it, he narrates his voyage of 35 years and his missionary work.\nDuring the 17th century, the limited European presence in Southeast Asia consisted of merchants and missionaries who traveled through the area. Most of the available travel texts about this region were produced by a relatively small number of merchants and missionaries. Alexandre wrote his own narrative with the stated purpose to convince Popes, Jesuit leaders, and Christian princes that additional bishops and missionaries were needed in Tonkin and Cochinchina.  While Alexandre provides a relatively brief account about his travels through China, most of the book is devoted to his years of living in Tonkin and Cochinchina. He provides a detailed description of the local governments, armies, languages, customs, religions, and economic resources. He also emphasizes the political repression of the Christian minority by the local governments. \nIn retrospect, Alexandre's comments on the Vietnamese laws and customs tend to reveal his personal views about the European society of his era. . His description of the Vietnamese culture seems to be intentionally misleading. In order to provide a favorable view of the Vietnamese culture to his readers, the writer downplays controversial aspects, such as the practice of polygamy. \n\n\nContext\nDuring Alexandre de Rhodes’s time, European presence in Southeast Asia was rather limited. Europeans were principally there to trade, but the merchants were often accompanied by missionaries. Therefore, most travel texts about Southeast Asia were produced by a relatively small number of merchants and missionaries. These texts were immensely popular during the seventeenth century, because Europeans were very curious about these foreign lands, their inhabitants and their customs.\nAlexandre de Rhodes’s book was published when he was working in France (namely in Marseille, Lyon and Paris) between 1652 and 1654, in order to gain support for the Christian church in Vietnam. He was asked to fulfill the three following tasks: “to impress the Pope of the extreme need to send bishops to Tonkin and Cochinchina; to seek material help from Christian princes for the missions; and to ask the superior general to send more missionaries to the countries of Asia.” At the beginning of de Rhodes’s travel narrative, the Jesuit explains that the reason why he decided to write Divers Voyages [...], was because many great people who have read his short texts about his travels, have asked him to offer the public a full version.\n\n\nContents\nDivers voyages et missions du père Alexandre de Rhodes de la Compagnie de Jésus en la Chine et autres royaumes de l'Orient, avec son retour en Europe par la Perse et l’Arménie is divided in three parts: Alexandre de Rhodes’s journey from Rome to China, his missions in Tonkin and Cochinchina (today’s Vietnam) and finally his return from China to Rome. The main topic of this book is de Rhodes’s proselytizing work and his methods of conversion, but he does describe some of the foreign lands, customs, and politics as well.\nThe part about his journey in Tonkin and Cochinchina is the longest one, because he spent most of his time there. The first chapters describe Cochinchina’s and Tonkin’s historical relationship, governments, its armies, language, customs as well as its religions. De Rhodes also writes about their fertile lands, gold mines, high quantities of pepper, silk, sugar and other resources. After that, all the chapters on today’s Vietnam are mostly about his many successes and few failures in converting the natives, the government’s repression he and other Christians sometimes faced, and circumstances he portrayed as miracles. A recurring representation throughout the book is that of Vietnamese natives being highly receptive and devoted to Christianity, even risking their lives for their faith.\n\n\nPublication history\nThis travel account was first published in 1653 by the librarian and print worker Sébastien Cramoisy. It was republished in 1854 under the slightly different title: Les Voyages et Mission du P. Alexandre de Rhodes de la compagnie de Jésus en la Chine et autres Royaumes de l’Orient, by the publisher Julien, Lanier. The latter edition includes a foreword by the editor Auguste Carayon who belonged to the Society of Jesus, as well as some definitions of archaic words in the footnotes, no other alterations have been made.\n\n\nContemporary reception\nAlexandre de Rhodes’s Les Voyages et Mission du P. Alexandre de Rhodes de la compagnie de Jésus en la Chine et autres Royaumes de l’Orient has been examined in an essay by Micheline Lessard. She uses discourse analysis in order to examine a few passages in the book as well as other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Jesuit texts about Vietnam. She contends that the texts she analyses are all Orientalist. Through this argument she challenges Edwards Said’s definition of Orientalism, because according to him it developed in the eighteenth century, and not before. Moreover, in her analysis of de Rhodes’s travel narrative, Lessard has found that when the Jesuit would describe Vietnamese laws and customs, his commentary was revealing of his opinions on European society. Furthermore, she shows that the Chinese Rites Controversy affected de Rhodes’s writing as well. Due to the sensitive political climate created by the controversy, Jesuits felt the need to portray the Vietnamese in a more positive light. Alexandre de Rhodes did so by purposefully downplaying the practice of polygamy in Vietnam for instance. Finally, her comparison has shown, that de Rhodes’s representations slightly differed from the ones made by the other Jesuits. For instance, although he described Vietnamese religious customs as superstitious, he was still able to offer “a more descriptive and analytical account”.\nMichael Harrigan also briefly dealt with Alexandre de Rhodes’s travel book.

    "summary": "Divers voyages et missions du père Alexandre de Rhodes de la Compagnie de Jésus en la Chine et autres royaumes de l'Orient, avec son retour en Europe par la Perse et l’Arménie is a travel book written by the Avignonese Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes (1591-1660) which was published in 1653. In it, he narrates his voyage of 35 years and his missionary work.\nDuring the 17th century, the limited European presence in Southeast Asia consisted of merchants and missionaries who traveled through the area. Most of the available travel texts about this region were produced by a relatively small number of merchants and missionaries. Alexandre wrote his own narrative with the stated purpose to convince Popes, Jesuit leaders, and Christian princes that additional bishops and missionaries were needed in Tonkin and Cochinchina.  While Alexandre provides a relatively brief account about his travels through China, most of the book is devoted to his years of living in Tonkin and Cochinchina. He provides a detailed description of the local governments, armies, languages, customs, religions, and economic resources. He also emphasizes the political repression of the Christian minority by the local governments. \nIn retrospect, Alexandre's comments on the Vietnamese laws and customs tend to reveal his personal views about the European society of his era. . His description of the Vietnamese culture seems to be intentionally misleading. In order to provide a favorable view of the Vietnamese culture to his readers, the writer downplays controversial aspects, such as the practice of polygamy. ",

    "text": "Sir William Edwin Clegg  (21 April 1852 – 22 August 1932) was an English footballer and politician.\n\n\nFootball career\nBorn in Sheffield, he was the younger brother of Charles Clegg with whom he played at Sheffield Wednesday. The two were the first brothers to both be capped for England, although they never played in the same match. He was described as being \"a safe kick and good half-back\" in Charles Alcock's 1875 edition of the Football Annual.\nAfter retiring from football through injury, he continued within the game as an administrator and became president of Sheffield Wednesday and vice president of Sheffield and Hallamshire Football Association.\nClegg became a solicitor. His most notable case was when he represented the notorious criminal Charles Peace.\n\n\nPolitical career\nHe also went on to have a successful political career and was Lord Mayor of Sheffield in 1898. He became known as 'the uncrowned king of Sheffield'. Clegg was knighted in 1906.\nClegg was the leader of the Liberal group on Sheffield City Council from 1895. In his early years, he campaigned for the municipalisation of the tramways in the city, and then for the construction of council housing in the city. He was able to ensure that an estate was built at Wincobank, and a project to build 400 houses was begun in 1909. He also acted as the major financier of the local Liberal group.\nClegg was considered to be on the right of the Liberal Party and was associated with the Liberal League. He was opposed to socialism and was hostile to the Labour Party. From 1909, he began co-operating closely with the Conservative Party group on the council, and in 1920 the two parties formed the Citizens' Association, Clegg being its first leader. He pursued low-tax policies at the expense of cutting services and running up debts. He was an opponent of David Lloyd George's policies. The Association lost control of the council to Labour in 1926, who removed him from the aldermanic bench.\nFollowing his deposition from the council, Clegg concentrated on social and philanthropic work and in particular he took an interest in education. He became the pro-chancellor of the University of Sheffield and chairman of the Sheffield education committee.\nClegg had married twice and had a son and daughter. Clegg died in a Sheffield nursing home 22 August 1932 aged 80.\n\n\nSee also\nThe trial of Charlie Peace, the Banner Cross murderer\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWilliam Clegg at Englandstats.com \nEngland profile on www.englandfc.com Archived 14 May 2008 at the Wayback Machine\nWilliam Clegg at England Football Online",

This event was supported by the TC 2000 Championship, Fiat Linea Competizione and the Argentine Formula Renault Championship.\n\n\nBackground\n\nMichael Krumm and Lucas Luhr went into this weekend as championship leaders in the Drivers Championship, eleven points ahead of Young Driver AMR drivers Darren Turner and Stefan Mücke. The Championship was up for grabs, as far down as sixth place Marc VDS driver Maxime Martin who was on 98 points and could have won the championship by winning the two races thus picking up 33 points and tying with Krumm and Luhr but only if the Germans either did not finish in the points or retired. Martin could winn the championship by picking up a possible six wins to Krumm and Luhr's four. In the Teams Championship, Young Driver AMR overtook JRM in the previous round at Beijing and led by eight points.\nMarkus Palttala replaced Yann Clairay for this round returning behind the wheel of the No. 10 Belgian Racing Ford GT after racing with the team at Silverstone. Clairay replaced Bertrand Baguette behind the wheel of the No. 41 Marc VDS car. Exim Bank Team China drafted in two new drivers Yelmer Buurman and Francesco Pastorelli for the Argentine round both making their FIA GT1 débuts replacing Ho-Pin Tung and Jeroen den Boer. Ricardo Risatti returned to the championship competing in the No. 40 Marc VDS Ford replacing Marc Hennerici. He made a cameo appearance in the San Luis round last season with Young Driver AMR. Christopher Haase also returns to the championship replacing Benjamin Leuenberger in the No. 47 DKR Lamborghini. The 2010 FIA GT3 champion raced for Reiter Engineering in the previous season.\n\n\nQualifying\n\n\nQualifying result\nFor qualifying, Driver 1 participates in the first and third sessions while Driver 2 participates in only the second session.

They finished in second place behind the No. 11 Corvette with nearest rivals Turner and Mücke not starting the race due to an accident in pre-qualifying. The Corvette pairing of Buurman and Pastorelli won on their début outing in the GT1 World Championship. The Teams Championship was still up for grabs going into the Championship Race with Young Driver AMR leading over JRM by three points.\n\n\nRace result\n\n\nChampionship Race\nThe Championship Race immediately started in chaos with a 5-way crash as soon as the race went underway. One of the cars involved was the No. 23 car which was the Drivers Championship-winning car and also the first and only retirement for that car in the season. Other cars involved were the two All-Inkl Lamborghini's, the No. 48 DKR Lamborghini and the No. 21 Sumo Power Nissan. The Championship Race was won by Qualifying Race winners Buurman and Pastorelli and was the first and only Championship Race win for the Corvette brand.

    "text": "The Baltic air-policing mission is a NATO air defence Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) in order to guard the airspace above the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\n\nMission\n\nWithin the Alliance, preserving airspace integrity is conducted as a collective task jointly and collectively using fighter aircraft for air policing. Air policing is a purely defensive mission. Since the 1970s, NATO has established a comprehensive system of air surveillance and airspace management means, as well as Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) assets for intercepts (QRA(I)) provided by its member nations.\nBy means of radar sites, remote data transmission, Control and Reporting Centres (CRCs) and Combined Air Operations Centres (CAOCs) the Alliance ensures constant surveillance and control of its assigned airspace 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. NATO exploits these facilities to react within seconds to air traffic incidents in the Allies’ airspace. This structure of weapon systems, control centres and procedures is referred to as the NATO Integrated Air Defence System (NATINADS). NATINADS has been and remains one cornerstone of Alliance solidarity and cohesion.\nThe responsible Allied Air Headquarters are at Izmir, Turkey and Ramstein, Germany. The dividing line is the Alps. The Headquarters Allied Air Command Ramstein’s air area of responsibility is divided in two Air Policing Areas (APAs):\n\nAPA 1 is controlled by the CAOC Finderup, Denmark (deactivated in 2013);\nAPA 2 is controlled by the CAOC Uedem, Germany.\nNATO members without their own Air Policing assets are assisted by other NATO members. Luxembourg is covered by interceptors from Belgium, Slovenia is covered by the Italian Air Force and Albania is covered by Italian aircraft.\nSince March 2004, when the Baltic States joined NATO, the 24/7 task of policing the airspace of the Baltic States was conducted on a three-month rotation from Zokniai Air Base in Lithuania and, starting from 2014, at the Ämari Air Base in Harju County, Estonia. Starting with the Turkish deployment, rotations changed to a four-month basis. Usual deployments consist of four fighter aircraft with between 50 and 100 support personnel.\nTo ensure Air Policing performance is conducted in a safe and professional way, adequate training was and still is required, as NATO member nations deploy their assets to Šiauliai Air Base, Lithuania, on a rotational basis. To standardize training across nations, Headquarters Allied Air Command Ramstein introduced a series of training events formerly called Baltic Region Training Events, now referred to as Ramstein Alloy to capitalize on experienced aircrews deployed to Šiauliai and to offer superior training for Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian air forces and control facilities. The three host nations contributed €2.2 million in 2011 to cover the deployment expenses and are supposed to contribute €3.5 million yearly by 2015. In 2012, the Alliance allocated €7 million for Šiauliai airfield modernisation from the Security Investment Programme.\n\nHungary performed the mission for the first time in 2015. Italy carried out the mission in January–April 2015, with 14 members having participated in Baltic Air Policing so far.\nIn 2013, the Baltic patrol was called in when the Swedish Air Force was unable to respond to a simulated attack by Russian bombers against Stockholm.\nDuring the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the U.S. Air Force deployed six F-15C Eagle fighter jets from US-run Lakenheath air base in eastern England to the Lithuanian Air Force Base near Šiauliai. These aircraft will augment the present mission comprising four U.S. F-15C Eagle aircraft. The U.S. heightened its NATO presence to increase the strength of the Baltic Air Policing mission. Another two U.S. KC-135 aerial refuelling aircraft brought aircraft service personnel.\nIn May 2014, NATO established its second air base in Estonia's Ämari near Tallinn, beginning with a Danish deployment. In May 2014, Polish Air Force units at Malbork Air Base were reinforced by the French Air Force.\nIn January 2022, due to the massing of Russian military forces along its border with Ukraine; American and Danish fighter jets were deployed to the NATO Baltic Air Policing detachments in Estonia and Lithuania, respectively, to provide enhanced air policing (eAP) over the Baltic States.\nAccording to a former staff member of the National Defence University of Finland, the Baltic air bases are untenable in a war scenario as they lack hardened aircraft shelters, which make them vulnerable to attack. Also, Russia operates long-range SAMs in Kaliningrad, Pskov and Leningrad Oblast, which might severely hamper or stop air operations from the area.\nIn May 2023, the Latvian Minister of Defence, Ināra Mūrniece, announced that NATO fighter jets will be temporarily stationed at Lielvārde Air Base during the spring to autumn of 2024 whilst Ämari Air Base undergoes reconstruction work.\nOn September 19, 2025 three Russian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31 aircraft entered into Estonian airspace and remained there for approximately twelve minutes.\n\n\nDeployments\n\n\nAccidents\n30 August 2011 – A French Mirage collided with a Lithuanian Aero L-39 Albatros jet trainer, which crashed into a marsh. Both pilots ejected.\n29 April 2013 – A Danish F-16 landed in Tallinn after it suffered a bird strike, which caused minor engine damage.\n9 October 2015 – A German Eurofighter's right external tank dropped \"while taxiing to the start position\" on the taxiway in Ämari airbase, Estonia. The necessary torque of the tightening bolts \"was not present\".\n8 August 2018 – A Spanish Eurofighter accidentally launched an AMRAAM missile without a target while on patrol over Estonia.

    "text": "Anne Everett (1943–2013) was an American artist from Richmond, Virginia. She is best known for her work as an abstract expressionist, a colourist, and, after 1995, as an icon painter. The greater part of her 55 years as an artist was spent specialising in the egg tempera technique. Raised in Richmond, Virginia, Everett moved permanently to France in 1969. She died in Paris in 2013 and was buried in Vezelay, Burgundy.\n\n\nStudent years\nEverett studied fine arts for four years at the University of Virginia (Mary Washington College) with the painter Julien Binford. She was then awarded a two-year Tiffany Scholarship to further her studies in Paris.\n\n\nArtistic development\n\n\nAbstract expressionism\nIn the 1960s, Everett developed a keen interest in the compositions of abstract expressionism and was particularly influenced by Milton Avery and Richard Diebenkorn. She studied at the Provincetown Workshop with Robert Motherwell and Helen Frankenthaler.\n\n\nColourist\nInfluenced by Julian Binford's use of colour, Everett arrived in Paris in 1965 and studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts with Maurice Biranchon. Her interest in the French colourists, beginning with Pierre Bonnard, developed as she became familiar with works by Pierre Lesieur, the German painter Julius Bissier and the Scottish colourist Elizabeth Blackadder.\nAfter her marriage in New York City 1966 to Stephen C. Headley, an American anthropologist, Everett studied lithography at Columbia University, returning to Paris in 1969 when her husband began his studies at St Sergius Institute of Orthodox Theology. She began to gain a wider recognition and her work was exhibited in almost fifty different galleries in France, the United States and Great Britain, where her work was shown in the London gallery of James Mayor.\nIn 2014 there were two shows of her work in Vezelay and another major exhibit is planned for July 2015 at the Maison Jules Roy, the former home (and now museum) of writer Jules Roy, who owned one of Everett's paintings. He wrote about her artistic style in July 1980 in L’Yonne Républicaine newspaper, saying that Anne Everett ‘was a true painter who used whatever came within her vision in order to transform it into a symbol by enchantment.’\nThe art historian, Gregoire Aslanoff, said of her work: 'Contemplating each of her works... one's eye is taken by her unique manner of associating nuances of pigments. Anne Everett knew how to marry, or better still to oppose, complementary colors in an infinitely subtle manner. An orange line or spot surges from an area of dark blue, verging on turquoise and violet. The acid yellow of a lemon exalts the Abyssinian blue that is itself in dialogue with an unexpected, particle of gold leaf.' \n\n\nEgg tempera\nEverett renounced oil painting in the early 1980s in favour of the egg tempera technique. She no longer worked on canvas, using paper instead. After having taught weekly for several years at the Parisian branch of Parson's School of Art & Design, she gave annual classes from 1992 to 2002 in egg tempera technique at the National Portrait Gallery in London. \nIn her early years, (1960-1970) Everett concentrated on painting in oils - large canvases of nudes whose heads were almost always faceless.\nAfter twenty years of painting in egg tempera on paper, in 1990 she embarked on a third period of artistic development, showing a particular interest in portraiture. One of her most notable projects – a portrait of each inhabitant of Vezelay - was begun in 1989. This collection has often been exhibited and was most recently displayed at the Salle Gothique in Vézelay in August, 2014. In a review of Everett's portraits, Sylvu Abdel-Minem quotes the artist as saying: \"I painted people who live together more by chance than by choice and who are as diverse as the colors of a palette.\"\nEverett would eventually bring her interest in colour to Orthodox iconography. During the last fifteen years of her life, she completed the iconostasis of the parish of St Etienne and St Germain in Vézelay, Burgundy, painting some fifty icons (catalogue forthcoming 2014).\n\n\nMedia and articles\nFrançoise Lafaix, l'Yonne Républicaine August 13, 2014 : review article of exhibit, Les cent Portraits de Vézelay.\nFrance 3 Bourgogne, 8pm news broadcast: Les Cent Portraits de Vézelay, August 16, 2014.\nReview of Everett's 1997 exhibit in the Salle Gothique in Vézelay : L’Yonne Républicaine, August 5, 1997, p. 10.\nReview by Patrice Josset in Arts Actualité Magazine, No. 20, reviewing Everett's 1995 show at Les Arcenaulx, Marseille.\nSylvu Abdel-Minem, a review of Everett's 1990 Vézelay exhibit of One Vézelay Portraits in l’Autre Journal (No. 3, July–August 1990).

It has vertical plank siding and a gable roof. It was restored by the Allentown Parks Department.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n19th century\nBogert's Bridge was built between 1841 and 1842. It takes its name from the Bogert family. Peter Bogert purchased the land on which the bridge is located in 1744 as part of his farm. Settlers are said to have put stones in the Little Lehigh River at the location of the bridge, which were used as a crossing prior to its construction. In the 1760s, a crude log bridge, later replaced by a wooden plank bridge, was built on the site.\nWhen Indian tribes complained that the bridge blocked their canoes, Bogert was called on to settle the dispute. The Indians believed he treated them fairly, and called Bogert \"the Peacemaker.\"\nBogert's Bridge is a Burr Truss, named after a design created by Theodore Burr of Connecticut in the early 19th century. Its most distinctive feature is two long arch trusses resting on abutments at either end. It was built by local men. John Waltman of Allentown worked on the bridge as a carpenter's apprentice at the age of 16.\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1945, management of the bridge was transferred from Lehigh County to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways since it carried South 24th Street, which linked state routes Hamilton Street and Lehigh Street.\nOn February 19, 1956 at 3:15 a.m., a speeding truck pulling a trailer smashed into the bridge, splintering seven of the bridge's twelve-by-twelve-inch crossbeams. Its roof sagged in the middle. Lehigh County officials initially wanted to tear down the bridge, believing it had become a traffic hazard. The following year, on May 30, 1957, a second accident involving a truck carrying an earthmover crashed into the bridge, smashing the roof and causing extensive damage.\nIn 1957, a letter writing campaign by the Save the Bogert's Bridge Committee obtained state approval to redirect South 24th Street to a new bridge located a few hundred feet away from the structure.\nIn 1964, the covered bridge was reconstructed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and its management was then transferred to Allentown.\nBogert's is the oldest covered bridge in Lehigh County, and among the oldest in the country. It is open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic only. In 1980, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nList of historic places in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "How to Steal a Dog is a book written by Barbara O'Connor. It was written in 2007 and also has a 2014 film adaption.\n\n\nPlot\nGeorgina Hayes, her brother Toby, and their parents lived happily in an apartment in Darby, North Carolina until her father leaves their family. Their limited income results in Georgina and her family being evicted from the apartment, and since then, they have lived in their car and in poverty. Her schoolwork and social life both suffer due to this, but she doesn’t tell anyone about the circumstance.                                                                                                                                 She tells her best friend Luanne Godfrey about this and urges her to keep it secret, but soon finds a way to get money and a new place to live after seeing a reward for a missing dog: Steal one, \"return it\", and claim the reward money, which she hopes to be five hundred dollars. Throughout the novel Georgina also writes down unofficial dog theft rules in her notebook, such as giving the dog water, food, and shelter.\nAfter roaming around the neighborhood to search for suitable dogs to steal, Georgina and Toby locate a dog named Willy, who meets several criteria in her rules. She also assumes that Carmella is rich due to the exterior of her house, and that the matter’s surname is on the street the siblings are on.\nGeorgina’s mother manages to get an abandoned house as a temporary home, almost making Georgina abandon her plan, but it is so dilapidated it reinstates her confidence. The house is later boarded up as it turns out the owner did not want anyone there.\nUltimately, Georgina and Toby steal Willy together and hide him at the abandoned house. The plan works with few inconsistencies, but Georgina begins to feel guilty about her actions, and a traveler named Mookie begins to grow suspicious of the dog and his relation to Georgina.\nIn addition to this, as Georgina befriends Carmella, she realizes that the latter is actually in the lower middle class——the house and street belonged to her deceased grandfather, who sold the properties and left Willy behind for Carmella. Carmella also attempts to borrow money from her sister and uncle to offer a larger reward for Willy’s return, making the guilt worse.\nGeorgina finally realizes what she did was right and also wrong, and decides to return Willy without the reward money. She confesses to Carmella what she did, but is forgiven, and the two remain friends. It’s also revealed that Mookie knew Willy was stolen all along due to finding his collar, leaving Georgina confused as to why he was friendly to her.\nA three days pass and Georgina and Toby's mother announces they will now live in a house with a mutual friend, Louise. Georgina is thrilled to no longer have to live in a car, and they move in.\nFeeling happy and looking forward to her life improving, Georgina updates her rulebook one more time to clarify that stealing a dog isn’t a good idea. The novel closes with her smelling the night air instead of the interior of her car, saying that “it doesn’t stink at all.”\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Actress is a 2014 American documentary film about actress Brandy Burre, directed, edited and photographed by Robert Greene. The film was produced by Douglas Tirola and Susan Bedusa, and is a 4th Row Films and Prewar Cinema production. It was distributed by The Cinema Guild.\n\n\nSynopsis\nActress is a documentary about Brandy Burre, most known for her recurring role as Theresa D’Agostino on HBO's The Wire  as she attempts to return to her acting career after abandoning it to concentrate on raising a family.\nSet in suburban Beacon, New York, Burre struggles with duties and relationships in her domestic life. During the film, she pursues re-entering her former profession by meeting old contacts in the industry and rebuilding herself while juggling motherhood and her personal life.\nActress has been recognized for its use of poetic, more directed techniques and mise-en-scène, a tactic that is something of an anomaly in documentaries.  Poetic aspects were used mostly to represent Burre's crumbling emotional state. Greene has said that there was a performance to all of Burre's behavior.  His use of “composed indie-film moments,” seen in the consciously lit, stage-like opening scene, slow motion shots, and collaboration with Burre, allowed her to become more than just a subject. This enabled the actress to “explore her own authenticity” in a way that became a very cathartic experience for her.  Seeing her dismantling personal life told in present tense, Burre performs in roles as a mother and caregiver, as well as an actress pursuing a career, and a woman in romantic turmoil with her longtime partner and father of her children.\nGreene has called Burre's performance “fragile and open,” while at other points “opaque and hard,” and said that her “gestures of fragility to me are more devastating to me than watching someone totally unaware of what she’s doing. She’s authentically in pain, but she’s also demonstrating pain very consciously and dramatically. The combination of the real and the display is mind boggling to me. You don’t know where one begins and the other ends.”\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe film premiered at True/False Film Festival in Columbia, MO on February 27, 2014. Its theatrical release was on April 26, 2014 at Art of the Real at Lincoln Center, New York, NY.\nIt has been well-received critically, praised for blurring the line between fiction and non-fiction,  and has been called, \"a story with universal appeal rendered in intimate flourishes,\"  and, “beguiling, provocative and formally exciting.\"\nActress was nominated for a Gotham Award for Best Documentary,  named, \"best storytelling in a documentary feature,\" at the Nantucket Film Festival.  Boston Globe’s Peter Keough called Actress a film that \"underscores the inextricability of real life and make-believe... combining artifice with cinema vérité,\" and \"explores where the line between performance and genuine behavior meet and blur.\"\nIn a 2019 ranking, New York magazine's Vulture website listed Actress as the 11th best film of the entire 2010s, making it the highest-ranked documentary in the list. Critic Bilge Ebiri wrote, \"In its full-blooded, compassionate, complex portrait of its subject, it’s the rare documentary that achieves the emotional breadth of a great novel.\"\n\n\nAwards\nCPH:DOX (2014)\n\nNominated, CPH:DOX Award: Robert Greene\nNominated, Politiken's Audience Award: Robert Greene\nCinema Eye Honors Awards, US (2015)\n\nWon, Cinema Eye Honors Award: The Unforgettables, Brandy Burre\nNominated, Cinema Eye Honors Award: Outstanding Achievement in Direction, Robert Greene\nNominated, Cinema Eye Honors Award: Outstanding Achievement in Editing, Robert Greene\nGotham Awards (2014)\n\nNominated, Best Documentary: Robert Greene (director/producer); Susan Bedusa (producer); Douglas Tirola (producer)\nHot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival (2014)\n\nNominated, Best International Documentary: Robert Greene\nIndiewire Critics’ Poll (2014)\n\nICP Award: Best Documentary, Robert Greene (5th Place)\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (colloquially, the Volpe Center) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a center of transportation and logistics in the United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT).\nThe center's work includes projects that cut across traditional transportation modes and technical disciplines, including the Federal Aviation Administration's Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) and Safety Performance Analysis System (SPAS), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's SafeStat Online, the Maritime Safety and Security Information System (MSSIS), and SeaVision.\nThe Center helps federal, state, and local governments, industry, and academia in various areas, including human factors research, system design, implementation and assessment, global tracking, strategic investment and resource allocation, environmental preservation, and organizational effectiveness.\nVolpe differs from most federal organizations in that it receives no direct appropriation from Congress. Instead, its roughly $200 million annual budget is funded by fees for its work.\nThe center is named for John Volpe, a former Massachusetts governor and U.S. Secretary of Transportation. \n\n\nLocation\nVolpe is located on the campus of NASA's former Electronics Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Boston, across the street from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and next to the Kendall/MIT MBTA Red Line subway stop.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe older of the two main building on site was designated as the NASA Electronics Research Center. By direction of President John F. Kennedy after his pledge for America to go to the moon, it was to become Mission Control for all US space missions.  Extensive work was completed within the main building and massive amounts of communications equipment and cabling was installed around the site, under the streets leading to it and in the countryside.  When Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, a Texan, was sworn in to take over the Presidency.  Within 2 months, all work on Mission Control in Massachusetts was halted and a new site was named in Houston. The Research Center was phased out and all of the communications installations were abandoned in place.  The building sat idle before being named the Volpe Center.\n\n\nProblems with the building design\nThe original building shown with the vertical window lines in the foreground of the photo above had a serious design flaw.  The building was constructed with an interior steel frame and an exterior cladding of bricks that were fastened to the interior steel with rigid brackets every foot or so.  With the temperature fluctuating between the 80's in summer and below freezing in winter, the steel structure expanded and contracted substantially over the height of the building.  The brackets holding the brick facing could not accommodate this movement and as a result, portions of the brickwork would crack and fall off without notice.  It became so dangerous that all entry to the building was either through armor covered walkways or underground.   \n\n\nRedevelopment\nIn January 2017, MIT signed an agreement with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to redevelop the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, with the state aim of turning the 14-acre parcel into a more vibrant mixed-use site.\nIn October 2017, the Cambridge City Council approved MIT’s rezoning petition for the site and a team of architects and landscape planners have been working to imagine a new home for the Volpe Center.\n\n\nSee also\nAircraft Situation Display to Industry\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Shahid Ashraf SBt (born 1947), is a retired Pakistani naval officer and former spy whose role was central in a massive military scandal took place during the second administration of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\nHe was accused of receiving monetary corruption when he led the Naval Intelligence office under the staff of Admiral Mansurul Haq, the Chief of Naval Staff from 1994 until 1997. He was subsequently court-martial but his matter was later subjected to cover-up by the Pakistani military under the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Pervez Musharraf in 1999.\n\n\nBiography\n\nShahid Ashraf was born in early 1947 months before the independence of Pakistan and partition of India, and joined the Pakistan Navy in 1964. He participated in both the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.\nIn 1995, Captain Ashraf was appointed to the Naval Headquarters (NHQ) and was appointed as the Hydrographer of the Navy Hydrographic Department under then-Admiral Mansurul Haq, the Chief of Naval Staff. \nIn 1996, Captain Ashraf was promoted to one-star rank and was subsequently appointed as the Director-General of the Naval Intelligence. \nDuring this time, Commodore Ashraf was briefed by Naval Intelligence, led by Rear-Admiral Javed Iqbal, on the Navy receiving massive illegal financial credits from the French Navy under the auspices of Admiral Mansurul Haq. Ashraf later confronted Haq, but joined the latter when Haq subsequently pressured him, according to the official inquiry of Naval Intelligence. In 1997, Ashraf handed over command of Naval Intelligence to Rear-Admiral Tanvir Ahmed and traveled to Great Britain to attend the war course at the Royal College of Defence Studies.\nIn 1997, Ahmed eventually exposed the military scandal after he led the arrests of Mansurul Haq and later wound up his operation when he requested the government to recall Commodore Ashraf from his overseas studies. The Navy JAG prosecution leveled charges against Ashraf of receiving ₨. 1.5 million when he faced a court-martial at Zafar Naval base in Islamabad. In 1998, Ashraf, along with Captains Liaquat Ali Malik and Z.U. Alvi, pleaded guilty of taking the bribes and was sentenced to imprisonment for nearly seven years. However, Ashraf maintained in the court-martial that he had sought permission of leading an attempt to catch the foreign agent who was giving bribe money to naval officers, but was not allowed to do so by the NHQ.\nHis case findings were later subjected to a military cover-up by Chairman Joint Chiefs General Pervez Musharraf in 2000 from the inquiries of the National Accountability Bureau.\nIn 2010, Ashraf later blamed the outcomes of the scandals on the successive government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and senior naval officers in the NHQ, but declined to comment his role in receiving ₨. 1.5 million. He claimed that the corruption charges leveled against the Bhutto-Zardari family, were politically motivated when the Sharif family was the largest beneficiary of the Agosta submarine deals.\n\n\nAwards and decorations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"ISLAMABAD: The submarine kickbacks Pandora's box reopened\".

    "text": "Cecilia Salvai (born 2 December 1993) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Serie A club Juventus FC and the Italy women's national team. She has represented Italy U19 at the 2011 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship.\n\n\nClub career\nSalvai started her professional career with Canavese in 2008, and after a single season she moved to Torino, where she developed into a regular for the Turinese club. The team's website described her as \"without doubt, the player with most appeal in Torino's roster.\" She plays primarily as a left-back, but she can move to become a centre-back when needed.\nBefore the start of the 2012–13 season, she moved to Swiss club Rapid Lugano, and left at the end of the season to return to Italy, as she signed with Veronese club Bardolino Verona.\nOn 11 July 2016, ahead of the 2016–17 season, she joined ACF Brescia Femminile. She joined Juventus starting in the 2017–18 season.\nIn August 2021, the Juventus Twitter account posted an image of Salvai using her fingers to pull back her eyes while wearing a training cone on her head, prompting accusations of racism against Asian people. The tweet was soon deleted, and the club apologized.\n\n\nInternational career\n\n\nUnder-19\nDuring the 2011 Championship Salvai was named on the starting XI of the opening group stage match against Russia. She did no play in the second group stage match against Switzerland, but she scored the equalizer against Belgium in an eventual 3–1 win for the azzurre. Italy reached the semi-finals unbeaten, but eventually lost 2–3 to Norway.\nShe was also called for the first qualifying round for the 2012 Championship, and she started all three matches as Italy advanced to the second qualifying round, where, again, she was a regular and started all three matches. Italy, however, finished second in its group and last amongst the runners-up, and therefore did not advance to the final tournament.\n\n\nUnder-20\nSalvai was called by Italy's U-20 coach Corrado Corradini to take part in the 2012 World Cup, where she was a starter in all three group stage matches. As Italy finished last in Group B, they did not play any other match.\n\n\nSenior\nSalvai made her début for the senior team on 19 September 2012, as Italy faced Greece in the final qualification match before UEFA Women's Euro 2013. She started the first two group stage matches against Finland and Denmark but did not play against Sweden, as Italy advanced to the quarter-finals.\nSalvai was called up to the Italy squad for the UEFA Women's Euro 2017.\nOn 2 July 2023, Salvai was called up to the 23-player Italy squad for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nOn 25 June 2025, Salvai was called up to the Italy squad for the UEFA Women's Euro 2025.\n\n\nPersonal life\nSalvai contracted and was treated for Hodgkin lymphoma at age four.\nIn 2019, she married amateur footballer and member of Fortitudo Mozzecane Women's staff Matteo Borgese near Asti.\n\n\nInternational goals\n\n\nHonours\nJuventus\n\nSerie A: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2020–21, 2021–22\nCoppa Italia: 2018–19, 2021–22\nSerie A Women's Cup: 2025\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2019, 2020–21, 2021–22\nIndividual\n\nAIC Best Women's XI: 2019\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nCecilia Salvai – UEFA competition record (archive)\nCecilia Salvai at Soccerway",

He has also exhibited his work in the UK, France and the US.\n\n\nLife and work\nRoss Eccles was born in Blackburn, England in 1937 [1]. He was educated at Clitheroe Royal Grammar School and later studied Architecture at the Birmingham School of Architecture. He practiced as an architect for 30 years, first in England and then in Canada, before settling in Ireland where he ran his own practice up until 1992. In 1992 he retired from Architecture in order to devote himself to art on a full-time basis.\nRoss’s often twisted, abstract style of painting is a reaction to the rigidity and structure that he faced as an architect. His architectural background has undoubtedly influenced his artworks and his subjects frequently include familiar architectural landmarks, although these are painted in an entirely new light that reflects the artist’s own vision, with bold colours and broken lines. His paintings are created to provide a fresh perspective on otherwise mundane subjects and to free the viewer from the confinements and limitations of everyday existence.\nRoss often gives demonstrations to school students in the hope that he can get them to see the world around them in a new way and change their mindset in regards to life and art. He believes that conventional teaching “moulds people into similar patterns and suppresses natural individuality”.\nHis early work and style was influenced by his architectural training and was in the form of architectural sketches and watercolours. In recent years Ross’s style has become looser and his brushstrokes more obvious and less defined as he works more and more with acrylic paint. There is a lot of movement within his works and an emphasis on the importance of colour and light over line. Rather than recreating the subject precisely he wants to re-create the sense of what the eye captures when it looks at the subject and merge that with an element of fantasy to create a fresh vision of an everyday subject matter. His main influences include the Surrealists, the Cubists and the Impressionists .\n\n\nReferences\n\nArt Attack, Lancashire Life Magazine, July 2008\nStar Attractions, Lancashire Telegraph, May 14, 2008\nRovers Ace to Open Show, Clitheroe Advertiser and Times, May 1, 2008\nArtist’s Visit, Clitheroe Advertiser and Times, May 1, 2008\nWhat a Draw, by Mauve Quigley, ICROSS Celebrity Art Auction, Sunday Mirror, November 10, 2002\n\n\nExternal links\nWestholme School - Upper School\nRoss Eccles - Contemporary Art - Biography\nThe Green Gallery Dublin - Irish Art, Art Gallery Dublin, Galleries in Dublin, Gallery Ireland, Irish Gallery, Dublin Art Gallery, Ireland\nRoss Eccles art for sale and Biography – Artbank.com\nThe ROSS ECCLES Collection\nRoss - A Journey into Art - Matador Non-Fiction - Dawn Eccles\nWOW.ie - Ross Eccles Dublin Book Launch\nJuxtapoz Art & Culture Magazine - Ross Eccles 'In Which We Exist' Exhibition - Infusion Gallery Los Angeles\nAffordable Art in Dublin - Art in Dublin - the green gallery\nArt Slant Los Angeles - Ross Eccles Autotelism Exhibition\nTHE Magazine LA - Ross Eccles 'Autotelism' Exhibition\nCitizen LA - Art Spotting - Andie Villafane - April 2009",

    "text": "Hell's Doorway is a 1932 adventure novel by Australian author F. J. Thwaites.\n\n\nPlot\nVallance Hunter is a Sydney medical student whose mother is dying of cancer. Vallance euthanizes her and is sent to prison. After two years, he escapes from Goulburn Gaol and goes to live on a cattle station in the Wolgan Valley run by a grazier and his daughter. He falls in love with the daughter and goes blind.\n\n\nBackground\nSales of the novel boomed after it was read out on 2UE radio. This led to Thwaites' novels being routinely adapted for radio.\nThe novel sold over 27,000 copies within its first year. Sales of The Broken Melody and this were described as \"remarkable\".\n\n\nReception\nThe book critic in the Sydney Morning Herald said that \"Mr Thwaites writes vigorously and extracts the last ounce of excitement from the sensational elements of his plot. His characters, however, appear to be somewhat unreal, probably because Mr Thwaites has not mastered the art of writing good dialogue, and because he is regrettably prone to sentimentality.\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHell's Doorway at AustLit",

In fact, for all values of s, except possibly one, Hs(E) is either 0 or +∞; this exceptional value is called the Hausdorff dimension of E, here denoted dimH(E). Intuitively speaking, μs(E) = +∞ for s < dimH(E) for the same reason as the 1-dimensional linear length of a 2-dimensional disc in the Euclidean plane is +∞; likewise, μs(E) = 0 for s > dimH(E) for the same reason as the 3-dimensional volume of a disc in the Euclidean plane is zero.\nThe idea of a dimension function is to use different functions of diameter than just diam(C)s for some s, and to look for the same property of the Hausdorff measure being finite and non-zero.\n\n\nDefinition\nLet (X, d) be a metric space and E ⊆ X.

There are many conventions as to the properties that h should have: Rogers (1998), for example, requires that h should be monotonically increasing for t ≥ 0, strictly positive for t > 0, and continuous on the right for all t ≥ 0.\n\n\nPacking dimension\nPacking dimension is constructed in a very similar way to Hausdorff dimension, except that one \"packs\" E from inside with pairwise disjoint balls of diameter at most δ.  Just as before, one can consider functions h : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞] more general than h(δ) = δs and call h an exact dimension function for E if the h-packing measure of E is finite and strictly positive.\n\n\nExample\nAlmost surely, a sample path X of Brownian motion in the Euclidean plane has Hausdorff dimension equal to 2, but the 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure μ2(X) is zero. The exact dimension function h is given by the logarithmic correction\n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        r\n        )\n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        log\n        ⁡\n        \n          \n            1\n            r\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        log\n        ⁡\n        log\n        ⁡\n        log\n        ⁡\n        \n          \n            1\n            r\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(r)=r^{2}\\cdot \\log {\\frac {1}{r}}\\cdot \\log \\log \\log {\\frac {1}{r}}.}\n  \n\nI.e., with probability one, 0 < μh(X) < +∞ for a Brownian path X in R2.  For Brownian motion in Euclidean n-space Rn with n ≥ 3, the exact dimension function is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        r\n        )\n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        log\n        ⁡\n        log\n        ⁡\n        \n          \n            1\n            r\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(r)=r^{2}\\cdot \\log \\log {\\frac {1}{r}}.}\n  \n\n\nReferences\n\nOlsen, L.

    "text": "Pevek (Russian: Певе́к; Chukchi: Пээкин / Пээк, Pèèkin / Pèèk) is an Arctic port town and the administrative center of Chaunsky District in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia, located on Chaunskaya Bay (part of the East Siberian Sea) on a peninsula on the eastern side of the bay facing the Routan Islands, above the Arctic Circle, about 640 kilometers (400 mi) northwest of Anadyr, the administrative center of the autonomous okrug. Population: 4,015 (2021 census); 4,162 (2010 census); 5,206 (2002 census); 12,915 (1989 Soviet census).Pevek is a modern settlement established after World War I to provide a port for the export of minerals as part of the expanding Northern Sea Route. During the 1940s and 1950s, the area surrounding Pevek was the site of several gulags where prisoners mined uranium. In recent years, many of the mines became unprofitable and have closed, causing many residents to move to more central regions in Russia and the port infrastructure to decay.\nPevek is the present location of the Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant, which carries two marine-type KLT-40S nuclear reactors generating 35 megawatts of electricity each.\n\n\nEtymology\nThere are two theories for the origin of the town's name. The first is that it is derived from the Chukchi word for fat; it was originally named for the nearby hill Peekin'ey, meaning \"swollen mountain\". The more macabre theory is that the name is derived from the Chukchi word \"Pagytkenay\", meaning \"smelly mountain\". Legend has it that a battle was fought on the site of the modern town between the local Chukchi and Yukaghir peoples. At the time, there was no tradition of burying the dead among the indigenous people, so the odor of rotting flesh was present for a long time. This legend suggests a reason why when Russian explorers first discovered the bay, they did not find any settlement, as the Chukchi refused to settle in the region following the battle and only brought their animals to pasture in the summer.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n18th and 19th centuries\nThe area around Pevek was already known to Russians by the mid-18th century, as the records of the Great Northern Expedition document the discovery of Cape Shelag. Further references to the cape were made in the records of the Billings expedition, with Russian explorers first describing Chaunskaya Bay in the 1760s.\n\n\n20th century\nThe earliest records of the settlement of Pevek were made by the writer Tikhon Semushkin, who discovered a Chukchi hunting lodge and yaranga in 1926. By the mid-1930s, Pevek became an important port in the region, due to the natural harbor provided by Chaunskaya Bay, the expansion of the Northern Sea Route, and the discovery of tin at the Pyrkakay mine (which would later be renamed Krasnoarmeysky) 60 kilometers (37 mi) away. The discovery of minerals throughout this region meant Pevek had an important part to play in importing the required plant and machinery and exporting the extracted minerals and by 1950, the settlement had nearly 1,500 permanent residents. On April 6, 1967, Pevek was granted town status.\nDuring the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the town's population dropped by more than half as commercial navigation in the Arctic declined, and people began to gravitate towards the central Russian regions. More or less regular shipping is presently to be found only from Murmansk to Dudinka in the west and between Vladivostok and Pevek in the east. Ports between Dudinka and Pevek have virtually no shipping.\n\n\nGulag\n\nThe workforce for the mines that provided the Soviet Union with tin and uranium throughout the large parts of the 20th century were prisoners in the Gulag system. There was a network of camps in the region itself, through which an uncertain number of criminal and political prisoners passed. There are the remains of two large camps, \"North\" and \"West\", which continued to supply uranium during and after World War II. Barracks dot the landscape and have the appearance of being hastily abandoned. Large graveyards on the edge of the various encampments show that a large proportion of those sent to work in the mines did not survive.\n\n\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Pevek serves as the administrative center of Chaunsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Pevek is, together with two rural localities (the selos of Apapelgino and Yanranay) incorporated within Chaunsky Municipal District as Pevek Urban Settlement.\n\n\nClimate\nPevek has a tundra climate (Köppen ET), with long, very cold winters, and short, cool summers. February is the coldest month, with average temperature of −27.5 °C (−17.5 °F), while July, with +8.7 °C (47.7 °F), is the warmest. Although the average temperature for July is below +10.0 °C (50.0 °F), sometimes it may be several degrees warmer with a record high average of +15.7 °C (60.3 °F) for July 2007. Sometimes, but very rarely, it happens that the lowest night temperature stays above +20.0 °C (68.0 °F), which is characteristic for subtropical areas with very mild climates. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −50.0 °C (−58.0 °F) on  February 7, 8 and 10, 1978, and the highest was +29.2 °C (84.6 °F) on July 8, 2010.\n\n\nEconomy\n\n\nPort\n\nThe town is a large port on the Northern Sea Route, the most important northern port in Chukotka, although shipping levels have dropped significantly in recent years. The port is the eastern base of the northern sea route's Marine Operations Headquarters, run by the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO) from an icebreaker in the harbor, though the port is still owned by the Russian Ministry of Transport. The port's authority stretches as far as 125° east, just west of the Lena River. Past this point, the western Marine Operations Headquarters, in Dikson, has control. The headquarters govern all routes that ships take when using the northern sea route, organizing convoys and providing up-to-date information on ice conditions throughout their sphere of influence. Apart from FESCO, the port is also used by the Arctic Shipping Company, based in Tiksi, who take coal from Zheleny Mys to Pevek.\nDespite its prominence as the eastern Marine Operations Headquarters, the level of cargo the port has had to deal with in recent years has been declining rapidly. Although there is still gold mining around Bilibino and Leningradsky, there is little in the way of cargo generation as a result of that industry. The port is not a significant exporter of goods at all and is mainly responsible for dealing with the import of fuel (coal from Beringovsky and oil from Europe and the United States) for the region, though in the second half of the 1990s even this activity rarely exceeded a few thousand tons, and in 1997, Mys Shmidta, traditionally the second most important of the northern Chukotkan ports, was handling nearly four times as much cargo. The future does not look promising either, and although mining for other materials such as tin still occurs in the region, many of the mines have closed, being deemed unprofitable, and a number of settlements, such as Iultin, Komsomolsky, and Krasnoarmeysky have been depopulated, with any remaining economic activity producing only very low cargo volumes at best.\n\nThe result of the closing of the mines in the region is that many people have moved to other regions of Russia. This has caused the almost complete eradication of an export market as well as a corresponding drop in the required level of imports. This causes a lack of demand for the facilities at the port whose precarious profitability leads to a lack of investment. This decaying infrastructure is endemic across the northern sea route and makes the supply route unreliable. For example, winter fuel bound for Pevek did not arrive until the end of November in 1998; this is for a port whose average sailing season lasts only until October 25.\nA slight recovery is perhaps indicated by an increase in cargo handled. In 1997, Pevek handled over 200,000 tons of cargo, second only to Dudinka of the true northern sea route ports, with 1,143,000 tons.\nThe port has a maximum ship draft of 10.25 meters (33.6 ft).\n\n\nOther industry\nThere is some mining in the area; tin, mercury, gold, and black coal deposits are all located near the town. However, many of the mines that previously produced significant quantities of minerals for export have been deemed to become unprofitable and have closed. Most mining that takes place in the region is relatively low key. However, this level of activity is still sufficient to provide enough business to keep two processing plants in Pevek.\nA floating nuclear power plant, Akademik Lomonosov, is located in Pevek. It started commercial operation in May 2020. It has two small reactors that generate 35 megawatts of electricity each.\n\n\nTransportation\n\nBesides the port as a key transport link with the rest of Russia, the town is also served by the Pevek Airport, located 17 kilometers (11 mi) to the northeast of the town in the village of Apapelgino, a locality established specifically to house the airport's staff. The airport provides flights to major regional centers such as Anadyr and Bilibino, as well as to Moscow.\nPevek also has the most developed road infrastructure in the autonomous okrug. There is approximately 150 kilometers (93 mi) of year-round, paved roads going to local destinations such as the now abandoned settlement of Valkumey and the mines at Komsomolsky and Krasnoarmeysky. There is also an ice road to Bilibino.\n\n\nIn literature\nPevek is described as the place of death of Edith Abramovna in Varlam Shalamov's short story \"Descendant of a Decembrist\".\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nList of inhabited localities in Chaunsky District\nExtreme points of Russia\nChief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\nДума Чукотского автономного округа.

    "text": "In aviation, aircraft ground handling or ground operations defines the servicing of an aircraft while it is on the ground and (usually) parked at a terminal gate of an airport.\n\n\nOverview\n\nMany airlines subcontract ground handling to airports, handling agents or even to another airline.  According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), conservative estimates indicate airlines outsource more than 50 per cent of the ground handling that takes place at the world's airports. Ground handling addresses the many service requirements of an airliner between the time it arrives at a terminal gate and the time it departs on its next flight. Speed, efficiency, and accuracy are important in ground handling services in order to minimize the turnaround time (the time during which the aircraft must remain parked at the gate). Faster turnarounds for lower ground times are correlated to better profits.\nAirlines with less-frequent service or fewer resources at a particular location sometimes subcontract ground handling or on-call aircraft maintenance to another airline, as it is a short-term cheaper alternative to setting up its own ground handling or maintenance capabilities.\n\nAirlines may participate in an industry-standard Mutual Assistance Ground Service Agreement (MAGSA). The MAGSA is published by the Air Transport Association (the current version is from 1981) and is used by airlines to assess prices for maintenance and support to aircraft at so-called MAGSA Rates, which are updated annually based on changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index. Airlines may choose to contract for ground handling services under the terms of a Standard Ground Handling Agreement (SGHA) published in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Airport Handling Manual. Airlines may also contract for ground handling services under non-standard terms.\nMost ground services are not directly related to the actual flying of the aircraft, and instead involve other tasks. The major categories of ground handling services are described below.\n\n\nAircraft appearance and provisioning\n\nServices related to aircraft cleanliness and passenger comfort:\n\nCabin cleaning – cleaning seats, galleys, and lavatories. Resetting the cabin (folding seatbelts, uniform seat and window shade position) to appear untouched.\nLavatory service – exterior service of lavatory by draining and filling of waste tanks.\nProvisioning – replacing literature, blankets, pillows, and consumable supplies.\nSecurity search – searching aircraft for prohibited items as required by airline policy or regulatory requirement.\nWater service – exterior service of aircraft water system by filling tank with potable water for use inflight.\n\n\nCatering\n\nCatering includes the unloading of unused food and drink from the aircraft, and the loading of fresh food and drink for passengers and crew. In flight airline meals are delivered at the seats in airline service trolleys. Empty or trash-filled trolley from the previous flight are replaced with fresh ones.  Meals are prepared mostly on the ground in order to minimize the amount of preparation (apart from chilling or reheating) required in flight.\nWhile some airlines provide their own catering, others have either owned catering companies in the past and divested themselves of the companies, or have outsourced their catering to third-party companies. Airline catering sources include the following companies:\n\nAirline Services & Logistics PLC(EPZE)\nAtlas Catering (Royal Air Maroc)\nCara Operations\nCathay Pacific Catering Services (Cathay Pacific)\nDHL Supply Chain\n\nGate Gourmet\nKLM Catering Services (KLM)\nLSG Sky Chefs\nSky Cafe’\nQ Catering (Qantas)\nSATS Food\nServair\nThai Catering Services (Thai Airways)\n\n\nRamp service\n\nThis includes services on the ramp or apron, such as:\n\nGuiding the aircraft into and out of the parking position (by way of aircraft marshalling),\nTowing with pushback tractors\nPre-Conditioned Air and Heating\nAirstart units (for starting engines)\nLuggage handling, usually by means of beltloaders and baggage carts\nGate checked luggage, often handled on the tarmac as passengers disembark\nAir cargo handling, usually by means of cargo dollies and cargo loaders.\nGround power (so that engines need not be running to provide aircraft power on the ground)\nPassenger stairs (used instead of an aerobridge or airstairs, some budget airlines use both to improve turnaround speed)\nPIGS (Passenger Integrated Guidance System), a retractable barrier, is used to ensure passengers do not walk underneath the wings\nWheelchair lifts, if required\nDeicing\n\n\nPassenger service\n \n\nThis includes services inside the airport terminal such as:\n\nProviding check-in counter services for the passengers departing on the customer airlines.\nProviding gate arrival and departure services. The agents are required to meet a flight on arrival as well as provide departure services including boarding passengers and closing the flight.\nStaffing the transfer counters, customer service counters and airline lounges.\n\n\nField operation service\nThis service dispatches the aircraft, maintains communication with the rest of the airline operation at the airport and with Air Traffic Control.\n\n\nList of notable handling agents\n\n\nAsia\nTurkey\n\nJetmate Aviation\n\n\nBangladesh\n Biman Bangladesh Airlines\n\n\nIndia\n Air India Airport Services Limited – all Indian airports – presently providing services at 74 airports in India\n Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited – Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Trivandrum, Mangalore, Cochin\n LAS Ground Force Handling – Goa, Udaipur, Bagdogra\n Bhadra International India Pvt Ltd – Chennai\n Bird Worldwide Flight Services Pvt Ltd – Delhi, Mumbai, Kochi\n Livewel Aviation – Mumbai, Delhi\n Globe Ground India – Ahmadabad, Bangalore\n Indo Thai Airport Management Services Pvt Ltd – Amritsar, Lucknow, Mohali\n Agile Airport Services Pvt Ltd – presently providing services at 8 airports in India\n\n\nHong Kong\n Cathay Pacific\n Hong Kong Airport Services (parent company: Cathay Pacific)\n Jardine Aviation Services (parent company: Jardine Matheson)\n SATS HK (parent company: Hong Kong Airlines)\n United Airlines\n\n\nJapan\n All Nippon Airways\n JAL Ground Service\n Japan Airport Ground Handling\n Japan Airport Service Co., Ltd.\n International Air Cargo Terminal Co., Ltd.\n\n\nKorea\n Korea Airport Service\n Asiana Airport Service\n DongBo Airport Service\n\n\nLaos\n Andaman Aviation Services\n\n\nNepal\n Nepal Airlines – Kathmandu\n\n\nPakistan\n Pakistan International Airlines\n Shaheen Airport Services (Pvt) Ltd\n Gerry’s dnata (Pvt) Ltd\n Royal Airport Services (Pvt) Ltd\n\n\nSingapore\n SATS Ltd\n dnata Singapore\n Universal Aviation\n\n\nPhilippines\n Airmach Aviation\n 1 Aviation\n dnata Philippines\n MacroAsia Airport Services Corporation\n MDFS PHILIPPINES\n Philippine Airport Ground Support Solutions\n\n\nTaiwan\n China Airlines Co., Ltd.\n Taoyuan International Airport Services Co., Ltd.\n Taiwan Airport Service Co., Ltd.\n Evergreen Airlines Service\n Taiwan Sky Ground Service Co., Ltd.\n\n\nThailand\n Wingspan Services Co., Ltd.\n BAGS Ground Services Co., Ltd.\n Andaman Aviation Services\n AOTGA AOT Ground Aviation Services Co., Ltd.\n\n\nThe Caribbean\n\n\nBahamas\n Earco Elite FBO\n\n\nBarbados\n Caribbean Aircraft Handling Co., Ltd.\n\n\nJamaica\n AJAS Aviation Services\n Eulen America\n GCG Ground Services Jamaica\n Jamaica Dispatch Services Ltd.\n\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\n Caribbean Aviation Management, Inc.\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nBelgium\n Aviapartner\n\n\nCyprus\n LGS Handling\nCTT Aviation Ltd.\n SWISSPORT\n\n\nDenmark\n SAS Ground Handling\n\n\nFinland\n AIRPRO\n Aviator\n\n\nFrance\n Groupe Europe Handling\n 3S Alyzia\n Aviapartner\n Ladybird Ground Services\n Samsic Assistance\n Servair\n Elyxan Aviation\n\n\nGreece\n Goldair\n Skyserv\n Swissport hellas\n\n\nIreland\n Sky Handling Partner\n\n\nItaly\n Airport Handling\n Aviapartner\n Aviation Services\n Ags Handling\n\n\nLatvia\n HAVAS Ground Handling Co.\n\n\nLithuania\n Baltic Ground Services\n Litcargus\n\n\nNetherlands\n KLM Ground Services\n Aviapartner\n dnata\n Menzies\n Swissport\n Viggo\n\n\nNorway\n Menzies Aviation\n SAS Ground Handling\n\n\nPoland\n Baltic Ground Services\n LS Airport Services\n Welcome Airport Services\n\n\nPortugal\n Groundforce Portugal\n Portway\n\n\nRussia\n Sheremetyevo Handling\n Domodedovo Airport Handling\nand others.

    "text": "Identity and Democracy (ID; French: Identité et démocratie) was a political group of the European Parliament during the Ninth European Parliament term, launched on 13 June 2019. It comprised far-right, right-wing populist, Eurosceptic and nationalist national parties from six European states. It was the successor to the Europe of Nations and Freedom group formed during the eighth term and almost all of its members merged into the Patriots for Europe group formed during the tenth term.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n2019 European Parliament elections\nIn April 2019, the Danish People's Party and the Finns Party (at the time members of the European Conservatives and Reformists) announced their intention to form a new grouping with Alternative for Germany, formerly of the ECR, ENF and EFDD groups, and Italy's League following the 2019 elections. AfD spokesman Jörg Meuthen appeared alongside Northern League leader Matteo Salvini to formally announce the formation of the new European political alliance with the Finns Party and Danish People's Party which was provisionally named European Alliance for People and Nations.\nOn 12 June 2019, it was announced that the group would be named \"Identity and Democracy\" (ID), include Italy's League (LSP), the French National Rally (RN) and Alternative for Germany as member parties, and be a successor to the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF). The Finns Party also joined the group. Lega MEP Marco Zanni was announced as the new group's chairman. The group, composed at that time of 73 MEPs, was launched in Brussels by RN leader Marine Le Pen on 13 June 2019. It was expanded to include former ENF members Vlaams Belang and the Freedom Party of Austria, as well the new Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party from the Czech Republic and the Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE). Ahead of the 2019 European Parliament elections, the group held joint rallies in different European cities and developed coordinated campaign materials, including joint election videos and shared social media platforms.\nThe Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) failed to secure any seats at the election; however, it gained one in the post-Brexit apportionment of seats. Before Brexit occurred, Party leader Geert Wilders stated his intention to align the PVV with ID, provided that the post-Brexit apportionment was confirmed by the European Council. PVV MEP Marcel de Graaff subsequently took the seat, but in 2022 defected to the Forum for Democracy, citing his support for the FvD's policies against the COVID-19 vaccine. The FvD accordingly changed its affiliation from the ECR group to Identity and Democracy.\nIn 2023, the FvD was suspended from the group after de Graaf shared messages on Twitter supportive of Putin following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and later quit the group citing difference in views on the matter.\nThe group's political platform is defined by Euroscepticism, nativism, and opposition to globalization. Its primary objective is to resist uncontrolled migration to the European Union and to dismantle the EU’s supranational framework, advocating instead for its transformation into an intergovernmental organization composed of sovereign nation-states.\nAlthough political commentators have noted the group contains members who have called for Europe to open up relations with Putin's government, the group has taken a pro-Ukraine stance and voted in support of a motion in the European Parliament to condemn \"Russian aggression against Ukraine\" following the Russian invasion of the country.\nIn April 2023, the Finns Party changed membership to the European Conservatives and Reformists group citing their change in policy to support NATO membership as the reason for the move.\n\n\n2024 European Parliament elections\nAhead of the 2024 European Parliament election, AfD lead candidate Maximilian Krah made controversial statements on the Waffen-SS in an interview which was met with anger within the group. In response, National Rally spokespeople Jordan Bardella and Caroline Parmentier announced they would part ways with Alternative for Germany after the election and not include the AfD in the group due to Krah's remarks and allegations of Chinese espionage influence on the party. The League's leader Matteo Salvini and the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy subsequently backed the position taken by the National Rally, with both parties saying they would terminate collaboration with the AfD after the election. Vlaams Belang criticized Krah's statements with VB MEP Gerolf Annemans calling Krah \"increasingly problematic\" but declined to immediately expel and cut cooperation with AfD, instead arguing that they would wait until after the election before making a decision. The Danish People's Party issued an ultimatum that the AfD could only remain in the ID group on the condition of Krah's expulsion with MEP Anders Vistisen stating that the AfD should purge extremist elements if the two parties were to keep working together. The Portuguese Chega, a member of the ID Party, described the RN’s decision as a “game changer” and suggested it would now consider joining the European Conservatives and Reformists group or a new merged European Parliament group. The Estonian EKRE and the Austrian FPÖ supported removing Krah but opposed the expulsion of the entire AfD faction. After an internal meeting and vote, the Identity and Democracy board subsequently voted in favour of ejecting the AfD, with group leader Marco Zanni citing Krah's interview, as well as reports of Chinese and Russian influence on the AfD. The AfD consequently moved to non-inscrits. Following the decision, the AfD said that Krah would not be permitted to sit with the AfD faction in the European Parliament after the election and that they would negotiate to rejoin Identity and Democracy. However, AfD failed in a bid to rejoin, with ID leaders making the decision not to re-admit the party.\nOn 28 June, Freedom and Direct Democracy announced it would leave the group to form a new group called \"Europe of Sovereign Nations\", citing disagreements with other ID members on the European Green Deal, immigration, censorship and Ukraine. This new group is described as being led by the AfD.\nOn 30 June, the Freedom Party of Austria also announced it would leave ID to form a new group called \"Patriots for Europe\", alongside Fidesz and ANO 2011. Shortly after, Chega, a member of the ID Party, also announced it would join \"Patriots for Europe\" instead of the ID group. The Dutch Party for Freedom's leader, Geert Wilders, also announced his party would join the new group, followed by the Danish People's Party and Vlaams Belang, which both said they would also join. The League stated that it was strongly considering joining, while the National Rally entered \"advanced talks\" to discuss joining.\nOn 8 July 2024, the League and the National Rally also left the group to join Patriots for Europe.\n\n\n2025 EPPO probe\nIn July 2025 a leaked internal parlamentary audit suggested far-right parties may have spent millions in EU funds improperly. An investigation into alleged misuse of funds by – meanwhile defunct – Identity and Democracy was launched by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.\n\n\nIdeology\nThe group lists its core priorities as protecting European cultural heritage and the sovereignty of European nations, creating jobs and growth, increasing security, stopping illegal immigration, regulating legal immigration, fighting EU bureaucracy and preventing what it describes as the potential Islamisation of Europe. Identity and Democracy also opposes the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union. The group calls for a Europe based on cooperation and further reforms of the EU through \"more transparency and accountability\" at Brussels, but rejects any further evolution towards a European Superstate. Political commentators have variously described Identity and Democracy as nationalist, right-wing populist, anti-immigrant, and Eurosceptic, although the group emphasises itself as sovereigntist as opposed to \"anti-European\".\n\n\nMEPs\n\n\n9th European Parliament\n\n\nFormer members\n\n\nOrganization\n\n\nPresident\n\n\nBureau\nGroup bureau during the 9th European Parliament.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Identity and Democracy at Wikimedia Commons",

    "title": "Wahasuchus",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=57851564",
    "text": "Wahasuchus is an extinct genus of engimatic mesoeucrocodylian, likely a neosuchian, of the Middle Campanian age found in the Quseir Formation, Egypt. First described in 2018, Wahasuchus is known mostly from fragmentary remains representing multiple individuals. Given its incomplete nature, it is not entirely clear what its closest relatives are, though features of the skull including its generally flattened morphology akin to that of modern crocodiles suggests it was part of the clade Neosuchia. However it bears no close resemblance to any of the early Cretaceous forms known from northern Africa nor the contemporary taxa of Europe, suggesting that it might have been part of a unique radiation endemic to Africa. The genus currently only contains a single species, Wahasuchus egyptensis.\n\n\nHistory and naming\nFossils of Wahasuchus have been recovered from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian)  El Hindaw Member of the Quseir Formation in Egypt, with the discovery having been made in 2010 by members of Mansoura University. All material assigned to this taxon have been collected form an outcrop near Mut in Dakhla Oasis in Egypts Western Desert. In addition to the various skull remains that form the holotype, several additional fossils were referred to Wahasuchus from a nearby bonebed. The material was described by Sara Saber and colleagues in 2018 and is held in the collection of the Mansoura University Vertebrate Paleontology Center.\nThe name Wahasuchus is derived from the Arabic word واحة (waha), which means \"oasis\", in reference to the origin of the material, and the commonly used souchos, the Ancient Greek word for crocodile, itself derived from the Egyptian deity Sobek. The species name simply refers to the fact that the material was found in Egypt.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSkull\nThough no complete skulls are known, reassembly based on what is available suggests that the skull of Wahasuchus was platyrostral, meaning it was flattened in a similar manner to those of modern crocodiles. At the same time however, Saber and colleagues highlight that the snout of Wahasuchus was massively built, with the individual elements being relatively expanded giving some depth to the rostrum.\nThe premaxillae, which form the very tip of the snout, were rounded and encased most of the external nares. Five alveoli were present in each premaxilla, with the first two being confluent, the third being the largest and the fourth and fifth being smaller again. The fifth premaxillary tooth is further noted for being the smallest in the entire premaxilla and for only being separated from the fourth tooth by a very thin section of bone. As is common in many neosuchians, the premaxillary toothrow is followed immediately by a toothless region marked by a large notch, which when the jaws are closed serves to receive the enlarged fourth dentary tooth. This notch further houses the contact between the premaxilla and the maxilla, which appears as a large element with a sinuous outer and lower margin. More specifically, the maxilla expands laterally (to the side) in tandem with an increase in tooth size among the maxillary teeth, of which there are 14. The first wave of tooth enlargement consists of the first five teeth, gradually becoming larger until they hit their peak with the third maxillary tooth, then growing smaller again. When looking at the skull from below it is clearly visible that the position of the largest tooth coincides with the maxilla bulging out, while the end of the first wave and transition to the second wave is marked by another prominent notch in the bone which may have received an enlarged dentary similar to what is the case for the notch between the premaxilla and maxilla. The second wave of tooth enlargement spans from the sixth to fourteenth tooth, displaying rapid increase leading up to the 8th, remaining fairly constant across the following three teeth and then decreasing again until the final maxillary tooth.  It has also been noted that through the maxilla the teeth are closely spaced, with the last seven being confluent, with little to no space between the individual tooth sockets.\nThe jugal preserves the typical triradiate anatomy of crocodyliforms with a broad anterior and narrow posterior as well as a contribution to the postorbital bar, which separates the eyesockets and the infratemporal fenestra. The anterior process in Wahasuchus is especially large, thrice as broad as the posterior process and bearing an expanded orbital lamina. The surface texture differs across the jugal, with the external surface dominated by crenulations, pits, and grooves, the ventral surface bearing foramina and pits and the surface just below the eyesockets being marked by shallow grooves. The posterior process of the jugal contacts the anterior portion along a straight contact, which helps set it apart from the semi-aquatic notosuchians of the Mahajangasuchidae, which have starkly bent contact between the two processes. Instead, Wahasuchus resembles various neosuchians in this aspect of its anatomy. However, other aspects of the jugal anatomy clearly differentiate Wahasuchus from most neosuchians. Notably the external surface of the postorbital bar is only weakly inset relative to the rest of the jugal's surface, which contrasts with neosuchians like Ocepesuchus, Goniopholis and Sarcosuchus. Overall the postorbital bar is oriented in a way that its lower end is ahead of its upper end, which positions the front end of the infratemporal fenestra ventrolateral to the eyesocket, which is not seen in other crocodyliforms. Both quadrate bones are known, but poorly preserved. The surface of these bones is smooth and Saber and colleagues hypothesize that there was no contact with the exoccipital bone, unlike in goniopholidids and allodaposuchids, though they mention that this might also be caused by preservation.\nVarious parts of the skull table are also known, among them the postorbital bone. The postorbital is triradiate, meaning it consists of three main sections. Two of them are well visible from above, the anteromedial process that connects to the parietal and frontal bone and the posterior process that extends back and contacts the squamosal, both of them together forming whats called the dorsal lamina. The third element of the postorbital is its contribution to the postorbital bar. Among the diagnostic features of Wahasuchus is that the region where the dorsal lamina meets the postorbital bar bears a rugose depression or fossa. While similar structures are known in notosuchians, in the case of Wahasuchus this feature does not appear to be associated with a palpebral bone. The difference lies in the fact that in Wahasuchus this fossa is overhung by the dorsal lamina, while in the afforementioned notosuchians the fossa is a projection of the postorbital bar that projects upwards as a shelf. The postorbital is also among the three bones that form the margins of the supratemporal fenestra alongside the parietal and the squamosal. The parietal has a weak groove that runs down its center and overhangs parts of the supraoccipital bone towards the back of the skull table, though a notch in the parietal allows for the supraoccipital to still be visible in top view. The supraoccipital also possesses a small tuber that is directed towards the back of the skull, just below of which the animal had a distinct fossa. The squamosals, which forms the back edges of the skull table, are only incompletely known from both their dorsal and descending laminae (visible from the side). The dorsal laminae is among the elements that participate in forming the supratemporal fenestra and on the outer edge it bears a point of attachment for the musculature of the ear. The lateral descending bears the otic opening and the otic recess was enclosed like in neosuchians, while notosuchians have a posteriorly open otic recess.\nThe lower jaw bears a relatively straight upper margin and a broad mandibular symphysis (the region where the two halves of the lower jaw meet). At least 16 teeth were housed in the dentary, although preservation suggests that one or two more were likely present, bringing the total to 17 or 18 teeth. The first five of these are all located around the dentary symphysis, with a poorly preserved tooth suggesting that the first dentary tooth was angled forward. As is most often the case for neosuchians, the largest tooth of the lower jaw is the fourth, which slides neatly into the notch present between the premaxillary and maxillary teeth in the upper jaw. In turn, several occlusal notches are present in the lower jaw to receive the larger maxillary teeth. One such notch is present in the short toothless region between the fifth and sixth dentary tooth and again between the sixth and seventh, likely to accommodate for the enlarged third and fourth maxillary teeth (the largest of the first wave). The seventh to tenth dentary teeth were similarly enlarged to those in the upper jaw and the seventh in particular may have been so large that it slid into the constriction between the first and second wave of maxillary teeth. Following these, the remaining dentary teeth are small. Only parts of the splenial are known, but they reveal that it did contribute to the mandibular symphysis.\n\n\nPostcrania\nVarious elements of the postcranial skeleton have been found and described for Wahasuchus, including vertebrae of the body and tail, a partial upper arm bone, a femur and parts of a tibia.\n\n\nSize\nTho the size of Wahasuchus is not explicitly stated in the original description, a later conference abstract by Saber and colleagues described it as \"large\".\n\n\nClassification\nA wide range of different crocodyliforms are known from the Cretaceous of North Africa, with continental deposits of the Aptian and Albian heavily featuring notosuchians like peirosaurids, uruguaysuchids and even mahajangasuchids in addition to neosuchians like Stomatosuchus, Sarcosuchus and Elosuchus. Especially towards the end of the Cretaceous however, marine formations similar to the Quseir Formation more heavily feature members of the Dyrosauridae, coastal marine animals, typically with slender jaws, though the overall record of crocodyliforms following the Cenomanian is relatively poor.\nWahasuchus is notable not only due to it being distinct from any of the major groups recognized from the Cretaceous of North Africa, but also since it does not bear any resemblance to the many specialised neosuchians that inhabited Europe around the same time either. This does however also mean that its exact relationship with other crocodyliforms remains elusive, not helped by the poor preservation of the known material, especially concerning the palate.\nSome features would agree with Wahasuchus being classified as a member of neosuchia, such as the flattened skull, enclosed otic opening and the simple dentition. The fact that the vertebrae are amphicoelous suggests that it could have been an early-diverging member of the group while the platyrostral skull shape is likely to have been acquired independently from other members of the group, given that this feature has evolved multiple times across Neosuchia. The lack of ties to European neosuchians could suggest that Wahasuchus was part of an as of yet unknown radiation endemic to Africa. One hypothetical position for Wahasuchus within Neosuchia has been provided by Krause and colleagues in 2019.\n\n\nPaleobiology\n\n\nPaleoenvironment\nThe sediments of the Quseir Formation represent a diverse range of environments that would have been present along the shore of northern Africa, ranging from rivers to brackish waters and even shallow parts of the Tethys sea. Angiosperms were the dominant terrestrial flora at the time as revealed by fossil pollen from the Bulaq area, especially the genera Foveotricolpites and Arecipites, though the flora also featured pteridophytes like ferns, aquatic plants and green algae. Gymnosperms like araucarias were also present, forming forests during high moisture periods, but they are generally rarer than the angiosperms. Accordingly, the environment has been proposed to have featured  Overall this combination of plants suggests that the Formation experienced a warm and humid climate, possibly tropical or subtropical, though periods of somewhat dryer conditions may have also occurred. Lowlands would have been covered by palms, herbaceous ferns,hepatics and freshwater algae, while the araucariaceae forests occupying the dryer hinterlands. Preserved charcoal also suggests that the forests present were affected by wildfires.\nAt least two more crocodylomorphs have been recovered from the formation, namely a dyrosaurid, which are generally regarded as coastal marine animals, and a thoracosaur gavialoid. Dinosaurs were also present, namely in the form of some indetermined non-avian theropods and the sauropods Igai and Mansourasaurus.\n\n\nPaleoecology\nThe generalized platyrostral snout shape, which Wahasuchus shares with a great many neosuchians including most modern crocodilians, was likely acquired convergently to these animals and would suggest a similar lifestyle. This suggests that it likely spend much of its time in the water and had opportunistic feeding preferences, its prey possibly including turtles, fish and various land vertebrates.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "John Fothergill Crosfield CBE DSc MA (22 October 1915 in Hampstead, London – 25 March 2012 in Hampstead, London) was an English inventor and entrepreneur. He was a pioneer in the application of electronics to all aspects of colour printing and the inventor of the acoustic and subsonic mines during the World War II.\nGraduating with a degree in mechanical sciences from Cambridge University in 1936, Crosfield was working on electrical lifts for ASEA in Sweden when war was declared. He joined the Admiralty, where with a team of mathematicians and engineers he was charged with developing sonar, to detect midget submarines and new types of mines.\nIn 1947, Crosfield founded J F Crosfield Ltd. (later Crosfield Electronics Ltd.) to develop press control equipment The first product was the Autotron, that enabled magazines to print economically in colour.  Following this, the company played a leading role in the introduction of colour scanning in 1958, phototypesetting and later the automated composition of pages incorporating pictures and text, a 1970s precursor to Photoshop.  He founded Crosfield Business Machines Ltd. in 1966 to develop and produce banknote inspection, counting and sorting machines. The companies won 4 Queens Awards for Technology and Exports. De La Rue acquired the Crosfield businesses in 1974.\nIn 1971, Crosfield was appointed a CBE for Services to Industry. He was a board member of De La Rue, Baker Perkins and the Scientific Instruments Research Association until 1985. Crosfield researched and wrote The Crosfield Family, The Cadbury Family and, in 1991, Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947 to 1975. He installed an electron-microscope in his studio, using it to scan and image microscopic insect and plant life from his garden. He used these images as the inspiration for surreal but fascinating paintings.\nCrosfield was noted for his generosity, giving away most of the fruits of his success in his lifetime. He was widely read, a good conversationalist and always interested in the exploits of his large, extended family and his many friends and their offspring. After a short illness, he died at his home at the age of 96.\n\n\nEarly life, family and education\n\nCrosfield was the third child and second son of a family of prominent Quakers. His father, Bertram Fothergill Crosfield (1882–1951), was managing director and co-proprietor of the liberal dailies The News Chronicle and The Star, president of the Mid-Bucks Liberal Association and Clerk of the Meeting at Jordans Meeting House.  John Crosfield's mother, Eleanor Cadbury (1885–1959), was a daughter of the chocolate manufacturer and Quaker George Cadbury. She was well known locally as a magistrate, elected as a Liberal to Bucks County Council, and for her work in local charities and political associations.\nJohn Crosfield was born at Grove Lodge in Hampstead, London in 1915, the third of six children. As the house was too small for his growing family, his father sold Grove Lodge to the novelist John Galsworthy in 1918 and they moved to Buckinghamshire, on the outskirts of Beaconsfield. From a very young age, he had a passion for making things. In the family workshop he made boats, steam engines, jigsaw puzzles and a cannon that he tested on the garage door. The shot went straight through the door and through his father's beloved Daimler. At prep school he and his friends built a model railway through the school grounds. At public school he built an O gauge model railway with a friend and with another friend linked two of the houses with a telephone line and exchanges for their respective studies. He played second violin for the school orchestra, but dropped music in favour of painting and model making.\nWhile his early schooling was idyllic, he was bullied and hated the bad food and harsh discipline at the Downs School, where he was sent as a border at the age of nine. The boys slept in three-sided huts with the fourth side open to the elements and here he contracted pneumonia followed by pleural empyema.  He was ten years old and spent nearly a year recuperating at the Cadbury holiday home, Winds Point, high in the Malvern Hills. At thirteen, Crosfield went to Leighton Park School, a Quaker school in Reading, where his father had been head boy.  He liked physics and maths and Crosfield chose to study engineering. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father had also read mechanical sciences. Crosfield was a founder member of the university's Gliding Club, where the flyers developed what they believed to be the first successful winch launch, using an old Buick they adapted for that purpose.  Although Crosfield enjoyed Cambridge to the full, with parties, sports (rowing, squash, golf and gliding) and high jinks, he worked hard, noting he had 27 hours of lectures and workshops a week compared to 6 hours for some of his friends. He graduated in 1936 and spent six weeks in Munich to improve his German. Here he was shocked by the virulence of anti-Semitic propaganda, the thin and haggard political prisoners he passed building new autobahns and by Hitler's hate-filled yet strangely mesmerising radio speeches. On his return to England, he found that his reports of what was going on in Germany were met with disbelief.\n\n\nApprenticeship and war years\nAfter Cambridge, Crosfield joined the British Thomson-Houston Company (BTH) at Rugby as a student apprentice, where he worked in departments testing electric motors, turbines and generators, and in the drafting, design and estimating departments. Adjoining the turbine department, where the monotony of the production line exasperated him, was Frank Whittle's laboratory. Crosfield sneaked in to see the first prototype of a jet engine.  Frustrated at being stuck for six months in the drafting department, Crosfield left BTH in February 1938 to continue his apprenticeship at ASEA, based in their headquarters in Västeräs, Sweden. The summer of 1939 found him in Stockholm at one of ASEA's companies making electric lifts. He was on a painting holiday in the Skärgäden when he heard that the Luftwaffe had bombed Warsaw. After a false start he reached Newcastle by boat from Bergen and, as he had sailed in the Baltic, he volunteered for the Navy. He had to wait for his papers and ASEA gave him a job to install a newspaper drive at Manchester for Allied Newspapers, his first work on a printing press. Crosfield was impatient to get into the Navy, where he wanted to join a fighting ship. He explained his frustration to an acquaintance at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, who referred him to a friend in the Admiralty.\nIn February 1940, the Admiralty assigned Crosfield to the Mine Design Department HMS Vernon at Portsmouth. The first assignment he completed was to design equipment for detecting midget submarines at Britain's harbour entrances. He was then charged with designing a magnetometer to measure a ship's magnetic field, but he realised that magnetic mines were useless against German E-Boats (motor torpedo boats) that were built with wooden hulls. So he started work on an acoustic mine that worked on the sound emitted by a ship's propeller. He had made a prototype and started testing it when Commander Brown called him in and told him to get back to the magnetometer. He ignored the order and, \"with improved security\", continued the development of the acoustic mine. This became an official priority after a British destroyer, which had been 'degaussed' and was therefore impervious to magnetic mines, set off a mine in the Thames Estuary. With the help of a mathematician and much testing he overcame the technical obstacles.  In its first use in the Baltic Sea, 200 of the new acoustic mines sank 47 enemy vessels and the Baltic was closed to shipping for two weeks. One of his colleagues at HMS Vernon was his friend and future Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick, who built up a little organization which modified mines to meet new tactical requirements.\nCrosfield's superior, the mathematical physicist Professor Harrie Massey, asked him to do a special job for the Normandy landings. Crosfield and his team developed a new acoustic and subsonic mine. He was put in charge of producing enough of them for the RAF by 15 May 1944. He found that the four depots assembling mines were chaotically run. By commandeering a lorry to move parts to where they were needed, sending in his engineers to control stock and quality and convincing the manager of the Milford Haven depot to deploy eight of his secretarial staff together with six of the Admiralty's mathematicians on the production line, they met their target. The new mines were dropped by the RAF in the Kiel Canal, the Straits of Dover and the Western Approaches (Operation Maple and Operation Bravado), with the result that very few German vessels were able to reach and attack the invasion fleet. The Admiralty awarded Crosfield 500 pounds for his invention, and with this he bought his first house at Emsworth.\n\n\nCrosfield Electronics Limited (CEL)\n\n\nOrigins\nAfter the war, Crosfield writes, \"We worked on a number of research projects at ASEA, some of which seemed very good to me, but they were not appreciated by management and very little was going into production. I was earning a good salary, but I felt that if I stayed there my life would be wasted. So I decided to start up on my own account.\" In 1947, Crosfield set up a laboratory in the attic of his house in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London to develop two new projects. He learnt that the commercial banks wanted equipment to automatically sort cheques to replace the large number of staff engaged in cheque sorting. He developed a cheque sorting machine designing magnetic characters that could be read photo-electrically. But when Barclays Bank produced a huge cheque they wanted his machine to sort and, as cheque sizes were not standardized, Crosfield realised it wasn't practical to continue with the project. Working with his first employee, Dennis Bent, who lived at the Crosfield home, the second project was a success. Magazines could not print in four colours and keep them in register (alignment) as this depended entirely on manual braking by machine operators. Quality was poor and paper wastage high. Crosfield's former ASEA manager and friend, Niels Haglov, asked him if this could be resolved. Crosfield worked out a photo-electric control system to do it automatically on web-fed presses, thereby improving the quality of colour printing and reducing paper waste from 25% to 4 or 5%. The printer of Women's Illustrated allowed them to try the new colour register control, dubbed the Autotron, on their rotogravure press.  Although they \"sweated blood for 18 months\" they got it working and the word spread around the printing industry. Crosfield's first customer (1950) was The Melbourne Herald, and soon Crosfield was shipping Autotrons around the world.\n\n\nPress control equipment\nThe Autotron spurred spinoffs: the Secatron (1954) for carton makers to ensure their pictures were centred; the Webatron for bag making machines; the Trakatron (1953) for the special requirements of cellophane and paper printers, and the Inkatron (1960) for sheet-fed offset presses. At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The Synchroscope gave machine minders the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop \"speckling\", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas. In 1966 the Heliostat, which applied an electric charge of several thousand volts to attract ink to paper, appeared.  By then Crosfield had the support of a team of talented researchers, installation engineers, a production facility and sales and administrative staff.\n\n\nColour scanners\nIn the early 1950s Sun Printers asked Crosfield if he could design an electronic machine to do the job of retouchers (skilled artists who reworked the contact print of the film negatives so that a 4-colour ink process would produce a good quality print on paper). Sun was expanding its facilities for colour printing but, due to trade union restrictions, the company could not hire and train enough retouchers. Crosfield thought it a very difficult task, but Sun offered to pay half the R & D costs and Crosfield \"decided to have a go\". He built a new research team and rented premises at Old Street for the laboratory to develop the colour scanner. The first Scanatron appeared in 1958. By then CEL had a large back order for scanners from rotogravure printers in Europe and the US. Colour scanners became the biggest money earner for the company and Crosfield continued their development, launching the Diascan, an improved and cheaper model in 1965 and the enlarging Magnascan in 1969. This machine scanned a colour slide and had all the equipment and software necessary to adjust the size, form, colour and hue to get the desired result for the publisher. The Magnascan's launch at the Milan printing fair caused a sensation. The company continued development of scanners, bringing out new models that improved the versatility, quality and productivity of earlier versions. High quality colour printing was now common in catalogues, magazines and newspapers around the world.\n\n\nCrosfield Business Machines\nTen years after Crosfield's frustrated attempt to design a cheque sorting machine, the Scottish banks came to Crosfield and asked him to build a banknote sorting machine. The American equipment then used for cheque sorting could not handle the soft, light paper of used, sometimes sticky banknotes. In 1959, Crosfield set up a team of engineers at Fortress Road, London, and in 1964 they produced the first banknote sorting machines for the Scottish banks. He used optical character recognition and a new patented process for handling small, flimsy pieces of paper, called the 'Double curvature sheet feeder'.  The banknote sorter was followed by machines for sorting and reading luncheon vouchers, postal orders and lottery tickets and for counting and dispensing banknotes. In 1966 Crosfield spun this new division off as Crosfield Business Machines, with its own management, offices, production and research in Watford. New equipment, built first for Nord West Lotto in Germany, coupled to small computers automatically printed out a list of prize winners and the weekly profit and tax liability for the lottery. Simultaneously a high-speed camera made a microfilm of the coupons as a security check. A few machines replaced hundreds of production staff. Another development, a sorting machine and 'garbler', first installed for the Dutch Central Bank, sorted good used banknotes from bad and bundled the good while shredding the bad, a task that formerly required a staff of thousands.\n\n\nFinancing CEL\nCrosfield founded his company with 2,000 pounds of his own savings, but these were soon exhausted. His father refused to help, but his brother Edward and sisters Margaret and Rachel put up 2,500 pounds that saw him through the first three years, until he made his first sale of an Autotron. He relied on advance payments from customers and a bank overdraft to fund the growing needs of CEL, dipping into his own bank account for emergencies. In 1959 he brought his cousin, Ken Wilson, into the business, with Wilson putting up 10,000 pounds to buy 15% of the company and 14,000 pounds as a loan. Six years later, requiring further funding, Hambros Bank bought out Ken Wilson's shares and provided a further loan. In 1971, after Crosfield had rejected Hambro's proposal to merge CEL with Muirheads, the merchant bank Keyser Ullman bought Hambro's shares.\n\n\nFrustrated stock market listing and sale to De La Rue Ltd.\nIn the spring of 1974, CEL, with 1,300 employees, was ready for a public listing on the London Stock Exchange. The company had increased sales from 3.6 million to 10.6 million pounds and profits from 0.2 million to 1.0 million pounds in the preceding 5 years. 85% of sales went abroad, with the US and Japan its largest markets, and CEL was a world leader in press control and colour scanner equipment. Bank borrowings had increased from 0.2 million to 1.1 million pounds in the same period and, although net equity had increased fourfold to 2.1 million pounds, the company required a larger capital base to finance production to satisfy the soaring demand for its colour scanners. The Stock Market crashed, the FTSE 30 losing 73% of its value, all new issues were pulled and the company found itself in a quandary: in this period of uncertainty neither banks nor Government were willing to make a loan to CEL. To ensure its future, Crosfield sold the company to De La Rue for 6 million pounds in September 1974. This proved to be an excellent investment for De La Rue. In 1988, just the scanner business of CEL made an operating profit of 21 million pounds on sales of 210 million. De La Rue sold the colour scanning business to a joint venture of Fuji and DuPont for 235 million pounds in 1989.\n\n\nLater years\nAs a main board member of De La Rue through to 1985, and Honorary President of CEL thereafter, Crosfield maintained a close interest in the development of the businesses. At the request of the Chairman of CEL, he wrote a history of the company that was published in 1991 as Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947-1975. Recollections is more about the people who made CEL than anything else, reflecting Crosfield's essentially people-orientated approach to both research and business. His staff responded with loyalty and dedication, without which his venture would not have succeeded.\nIn 2000, former CEL employees formed the John Crosfield Foundation as a charitable trust to assist young people in furthering their education in the graphic arts.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n\nFamily\n\nCrosfield married Geraldine Fitzgerald of Lockport, New York (1915-1987), where her father was a prominent surgeon, in 1938, and they had a son, Robin Braden Fitzgerald (b. 1939). After a lengthy separation caused by the war, they were divorced in 1945. In 1945, Crosfield married Edythe Miriam Bertinet (1917-2009) of Rockville Centre, New York and they had three children: Richard John (b. 1946), Eleanor Miriam (b. 1949) and James Michael (b. 1951). Their marriage lasted 64 years. She supported him in difficult times and she organised their active social life that they both so enjoyed.\nCrosfield had a strong sense of family. He corresponded with his mother from schooldays through to his first marriage and enjoyed frequent family gatherings. After his mother's death in 1959, he remained close to his brothers and sisters and their children and, eventually, to their grandchildren. On leaving full-time employment in 1975, he devoted years to researching, writing and editing two large family histories. These brought him into contact with distant relations, including the American branches of the Crosfield and Cadbury families. He published The Crosfield Family in 1980 (revised and updated in 1990) and  The Cadbury Family  in 1986.\n\n\nPainting\nCrosfield's youthful oil paintings showed promise. His interest in art was awakened by Maurice \"Grassy\" Field, his art master at the Downs School, when he was 11. By the age of 15 (around 1930) his landscape oils show the influence of Impressionism. His father, himself an amateur painter, thought that his artistic talent and interest in engineering would best be served in architecture.  Marriage, the war, starting his own business and his growing family left little time for painting, but when he returned to it seriously, his art reflected the change in artistic values. He was very interested in the development of abstract art and a frequent visitor to galleries. He had seen a scanning electron microscope in a Helsinki research institute and, in 1975, when he had the money and the time to use it, he bought one from Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company.\nCrosfield was to be seen in his painter's smock at the top of Grove Lodge (his birthplace, which he had bought in 1965) preparing, scanning and photographing minute objects - insect parts, pollen, petals, crystals - that he subsequently reproduced in colour and in a much larger scale on canvas. Viewing nature magnified thousands of times \"was like opening a door onto another planet.\" Though he sponsored an exhibition at a West End gallery, he did not receive the recognition he hoped for, and he abandoned the subject but not painting itself. He continued to paint landscapes, drawn from his extensive travels, and portraits, mainly for the family, until he packed up his paint box for the last time in April 2007, at the age of 91. Though these later paintings demonstrated his technical skill and, given that he projected slides onto his canvas, were very realistic, they did not show the feel for his subjects that he had demonstrated as a boy nor the originality of the sometimes surreal paintings based on what he saw through the viewfinder of the electron microscope.\n\n\nSailing\nCrosfield was a keen sailor who bought his first boat in 1938, \"an ancient sailing boat for about ten pounds\", shared with a Dutch apprentice like himself at ASEA. They sailed her on Lake Mälaren. He bought another boat after the war and he chose a 25-foot catamaran, Orlando, because a catamaran's speed, unlike a monohull sailing vessel, is not limited by its overall length. For four years he sailed around the Solent and Isle of Wight, with his family and any friend who might be aboard as crew. In 1962 he had a hankering for a larger and faster boat and was taken with a 38-foot catamaran that had won the Round the Isle of Wight race against much larger boats. Snowgoose had been built by the Prout brothers but, \"they seemed to have no idea how to build a family cruiser.\" Crosfield took a drawing board home and, using Snowgoose's hot moulded plywood hulls, designed her himself. The Prout brothers built Gemini and asked Crosfield if they could use his design for future customers. The Crosfield family sailed Gemini for ten years, first in the Thames estuary and the North Sea, and then in the Western Mediterranean. In 1972, Gemini hit a heavy object in strong winds off the coast of Corsica and was irreparably damaged. In 1975 Crosfield bought a summer house on the Salcombe estuary. For some years he sailed a Salcombe yawl.\n\n\nQuaker influence\n\nCrosfield's maternal grandfather, George Cadbury, was a prominent Quaker whose public works included the building of the model town of Bournville for his employees. Crosfield's paternal grandfather, Albert Crosfield, devoted most of his life to the Society of Friends, spending nine years as Chairman of the Friends Foreign Mission Association. Crosfield's family were practising Quakers, and every Sunday they went to Jordans Meeting. The Quakers, as pacifists, were conscientious objectors in wartime. They abstained from alcohol and both his parents had taken the pledge not to touch it. Crosfield writes about champagne parties at Cambridge and he volunteered for the Navy soon after the outbreak of war. And Crosfield was an atheist, who did not keep his opinion to himself. Yet he held in high esteem the perceived Quaker values of honesty, probity, hard work, a strong social conscience and simplicity in personal matters.\nCrosfield was a modest man. He bought most of his clothes at Marks and Spencer, he would travel only in economy, and he considered flamboyant cars a waste of money. Yet Crosfield was a generous man. After the sale to De La Rue, Crosfield set up a charitable trust with 75,000 pounds capital (closed in 2000 with its capital distributed to charities). Over the years he gave away most of his capital to family, friends and people he knew in need and to a large number of charities. These included the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and Dignity in Dying.\nCrosfield detested discrimination of any kind, and Crosfield Electronics hired staff only for their ability. Crosfield was a long-standing member of Hampstead Golf Club, as was the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The Club did not admit Jews, but in the early 1960s Crosfield put up his friend and neighbour Leon Smulian, who was admitted. Crosfield said, \"I put an end to that.\"\nThe Crosfield home was always open to friends who were ill or in need. Sometimes friends stayed with them for months and, in one case, for two years.\nCrosfield died at home on 25th March 2012 and was buried with his wife on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.\n\n\nHonours and awards\n1971 - Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for Services to Industry.\n1973 - Gold Medal of the Institute of Printing\n1980 - Doctor Honoris Causa, (DSc), Cranfield Institute of Technology\n2010 - Champion of Print, International Printing Exhibition (IPEX)\nCrosfield Electronics received Queen's Awards for Technology in 1967, 1972 and 1973 and the Queen's Award for Export in 1973.\n\n\nPublications\nThe Crosfield Family: A history of the descendants of Thomas Crosfield of Kirkby Lonsdale who died in 1614 (Cambridge, England 1980, Revised Edition 1990) ISBN 0950734020\nA History of The Cadbury Family (Cambridge, England 1985) 2 Vols ISBN 0950734012\nRecollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947 to 1975 (Peterborough, England 1991) ISBN 0950734039\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "John Fothergill Crosfield CBE DSc MA (22 October 1915 in Hampstead, London – 25 March 2012 in Hampstead, London) was an English inventor and entrepreneur. He was a pioneer in the application of electronics to all aspects of colour printing and the inventor of the acoustic and subsonic mines during the World War II.\nGraduating with a degree in mechanical sciences from Cambridge University in 1936, Crosfield was working on electrical lifts for ASEA in Sweden when war was declared. He joined the Admiralty, where with a team of mathematicians and engineers he was charged with developing sonar, to detect midget submarines and new types of mines.\nIn 1947, Crosfield founded J F Crosfield Ltd. (later Crosfield Electronics Ltd.) to develop press control equipment The first product was the Autotron, that enabled magazines to print economically in colour.  Following this, the company played a leading role in the introduction of colour scanning in 1958, phototypesetting and later the automated composition of pages incorporating pictures and text, a 1970s precursor to Photoshop.  He founded Crosfield Business Machines Ltd. in 1966 to develop and produce banknote inspection, counting and sorting machines. The companies won 4 Queens Awards for Technology and Exports. De La Rue acquired the Crosfield businesses in 1974.\nIn 1971, Crosfield was appointed a CBE for Services to Industry. He was a board member of De La Rue, Baker Perkins and the Scientific Instruments Research Association until 1985. Crosfield researched and wrote The Crosfield Family, The Cadbury Family and, in 1991, Recollections of Crosfield Electronics 1947 to 1975. He installed an electron-microscope in his studio, using it to scan and image microscopic insect and plant life from his garden. He used these images as the inspiration for surreal but fascinating paintings.\nCrosfield was noted for his generosity, giving away most of the fruits of his success in his lifetime. He was widely read, a good conversationalist and always interested in the exploits of his large, extended family and his many friends and their offspring. After a short illness, he died at his home at the age of 96.",

    "text": "Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy () is an Indian musical trio consisting of Shankar Mahadevan, Ehsaan Noorani and Loy Mendonsa. They have composed music for over 50 soundtracks across five languages: Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi and English.  Amongst the most critically acclaimed Indian musicians, the trio have won numerous awards, including National Film Awards, Filmfare Awards, and IIFA Awards. \nThey are often referred to as the Amar Akbar Anthony (AAA) of the Hindi film music industry. They are known for their compositions in Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), My Name Is Khan (2010), Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) and Dil Dhadakne Do (2015).\n\n\nMembers\n\n\nShankar Mahadevan\n\nShankar Mahadevan, the main vocalist of the trio, was born and brought up in Chembur, a suburb of Mumbai, in a Tamil family from Kerala. He learned Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music in his childhood and started playing the veena at the age of five. He studied under Shrinivas Khale, a popular Marathi music composer. After graduating in 1988 with a degree in Software Engineering from Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology in Navi Mumbai under the auspices of Mumbai University, he worked as a software engineer on Oracle Version Six. After working for a while for Leading Edge Systems, Shankar ventured into the field of music. He earned his first award as a playback singer in a Tamil movie, collaborating with A. R. Rahman and winning a National Film Award for his song in Kandukondain Kandukondain. A prominent star in Tamil cinema, he gained further recognition upon the release of his first music album, Breathless, in 1998. In 2019 he was felicitated with the Padma Shri Award for his contribution to Film Music. He has two sons, Siddharth and Shivam Mahadevan, both of whom are singers as well.\n\n\nEhsaan Noorani\n\nEhsaan Noorani is the guitarist of Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy. He studied music with Bismarck Rodrigues from a young age. Prior to going abroad to study further music at GIT (Los Angeles), Ehsaan was an integral part of two local bands in Mumbai, Pegasus and Crosswinds. Ehsaan returned to Mumbai and was in demand for his musical skills in composing jingles, working for all the top composers of the time. Until the day Magic Box productions approached him to compose the jingle for Sona Spices, and that marked the beginning of Ehsaan's independent journey as a composer of jingles in India.\nEhsaan was approached by Mukul S. Anand to compose the music for his film Dus, and he in turn asked Shankar and Loy to join him in composing the music for the film. Dus never made it to the big screen, due to the death of the director.\nEhsaan is the only Indian musician to have endorsed a signature line, 'The Ehsaan Noorani Fender Squier' signature series, for Fender guitars, one of the largest and most reputed guitar manufacturers in the world.\n\n\nLoy Mendonsa\n\nLoy Mendonsa plays the piano, bass guitar, and harmonica and is currently learning to play the trumpet. Loy was a genius music teacher for a school in New Delhi, when he was invited to write the music for the show Quiz Time by Siddharth Basu, who gave him his first break. Loy then went on to compose the title track for The World This Week and for the Shahrukh Khan TV serial Fauji. Loy moved to Bombay and met Ehsaan in 1989, and together they composed several ad jingles. His daughter Alyssa Mendonsa is a playback singer who has lent her voice to their songs.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nFormation (1985–96)\n\nShankar, Ehsaan and Loy came up from the ranks of the non-film music scene, performing rock, blues, jazz and pop before entering the film music industry. Shankar Mahadevan, a software engineer, worked on Oracle Version Six and studied Western, Hindustani and Carnatic classical music. He made his debut with the 1985 Marathi film Vahinichi Maya. A leading playback singer with Pukar, Sapnay and Biwi No.1 to his credit, he also composed Breathless.\nEhsaan Noorani studied music at the Musicians' Institute in Los Angeles and worked with the likes of Ronnie Desai, Laxmikant–Pyarelal, Kalyanji-Anandji and Louis Banks. He composed Alien Desire, did several jingles and like Loy, was part of a blues-and-acid jazz band. Loy Mendonsa is trained in Western classical and also learnt the rudiments of Indian classical music. He performed with several group bands and plays (Godspell, West Side Story, Jesus Christ Superstar) and composed jingles and signature tunes (Fauji, The World This Week).\nEhsaan was doing jingles and Loy was in Delhi before the union. Loy was writing for television then. The show Quiz Time was his first work and Siddharth Basu gave him his first break. Then he did Prannoy Roy's The World This Week. A few more shows came along and he also did theatre and Shahrukh Khan's Fauji. Loy had also worked as keyboardist with A. R. Rahman and Shankar had sung many famous tracks for him. In 1989, Ehsaan met Loy, who was working for Ranjit Barot, an ad film composer. From then on, they joined and composed several ad jingles together. Later, Ehsaan and Loy met Shankar when he was roped in by Ranjit Barot to sing for the Pepsi ad directed by Mukul Anand. Since then, they started to compose for ads as a trio.\n\n\nEarly years (1997–2001)\nShankar–Ehsaan–Loy were to make their debut as composers in Mukul Anand's film Dus. Director Anand wanted Ehsaan to compose the music for the film, but he insisted that Shankar and Loy work with him and Anand agreed. The film remained incomplete after Anand's death, though the album was released later in 1999. After Dus, they had composed music for a couple of films like Rockford and Bhopal Express, but all of them went unnoticed. Their entry to mainstream cinema was with Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Mission Kashmir, which was a musical hit and earned the trio a place in the Bollywood film industry. They also earned IIFA nominations for the same.\n\n\nDil Chahta Hai and rise to fame (2001–04)\n\nIn 2001, they made their film debut in Tamil film industry, as Kamal Haasan signed them to compose for Aalavandhan. The music sold well due to the hype surrounding the movie, though the movie itself was a dud in the box-office. The turning point of their career as music directors though, was Dil Chahta Hai, which was the debut film of Farhan Akhtar as a director. Initially, A. R. Rahman was considered to do the music, but he backed out due to other assignments. Then the trio composed a title track for the film, which Farhan liked, and he signed them for the film. The film won widespread critical acclaim and went on to attain cult status among audiences, and also earned them their first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. This marked the beginning of the trio's friendship with Farhan Akhtar and long-term association with Excel Entertainments.\nPost Dil Chahta Hai, they composed music for several small budget films like Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai?, Nayee Padosan and Ek Aur Ek Gyarah, where all of them went unnoticed as all the movies were panned by the critics. They also had two big ventures, Honey Irani's Armaan and Rohan Sippy's Kuch Naa Kaho, which yet again, failed to impress both critics and audiences – though their work in Armaan was lauded by critics.\n\n\nKal Ho Naa Ho and First National Award (2004–06)\n\nFollowing Dil Chahta Hai, their next big venture was Dharma Productions' Kal Ho Naa Ho, directed by Nikhil Advani. The album received a highly positive response when the film was released and it became one of the best selling Indian music albums of the year and was the highest seller album of 2003. The soundtrack won numerous awards including the National Film Award for Best Music Direction and their first Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\nThe year 2005 saw them collaborate with Shaad Ali for Bunty Aur Babli, as his first choice, A. R. Rahman, was busy with other assignments. The soundtrack, despite the initial mixed reaction from various critics, became immensely popular among the public, and went on to win several awards including their second Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. The song \"Kajra Re\" featuring Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan became a rage among the listeners.\nIn 2006, they reteamed with Dharma Productions for Karan Johar's musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. The soundtrack and background score of the film received universal acclaim and became the second highest-selling Indian music album of the year. Their next album that year was Farhan Akhtar's Don: The Chase Begins Again. They composed seven songs, including two versions of \"Yeh Mera Dil\" and \"Khaike Paan Banaraswala\", from Don (1978). The track \"Aaj Ki Raat\" was also included in the Academy Award-winning soundtrack Slumdog Millionaire. The soundtracks of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Don: The Chase Begins Again earned them several nominations at various award ceremonies, including their fourth and fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\n\n\nLater career (2007–present)\n2007 was arguably the best year of their career. The year started off with Nikhil Advani's multistarrer Salaam-e-Ishq, which was lauded by critics and music lovers alike, and went on to rule the music charts. The music was praised by the movie critics too, despite the movie itself receiving mixed-to-negative responses. Same was the fate of their next release, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Despite the music getting positive reviews and becoming quite a sensation among listeners, the movie failed to make a mark. However, this pattern was broken by their next release, Akshay Kumar's Heyy Babyy, where both the film and the music were commercial successes.\nIn August, the album Johnny Gaddaar was released, which was co-produced by the trio and Adlabs, first of its kind in the history of Bollywood. Both the music and movie received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.\nTheir year ended on a good note, as their last album of the year, Aamir Khan's Taare Zameen Par, was well received by critics, and both the film and the music got a cult status among the audience. Thus, a really good year for the trio came to an end, with most of the above albums making their way to the top 10 lists of all major websites.\nIn 2008, their major release was Rock On!! – which was a cult favourite and rage among the audience, and went on to become a huge commercial success, despite the initial cold reaction from the critics. The soundtrack earned them their sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. Luck By Chance was their last album of 2008, which garnered positive reviews from both Indian and international critics alike.\nIn 2009 they scored music of Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan starrer London Dreams. Although the music received favourable reviews, the movie didn't fare well in the box office. They also composed the music of Ayan Mukherjee's debut film Wake Up Sid starring Ranbir Kapoor and Konkona Sen Sharma along with Amit Trivedi. The music, especially the title track, topped charts, and received widespread critical acclaim. The soundtrack earned them their seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. \nTheir first soundtrack of 2010 was the Karan Johar's social drama My Name Is Khan. The soundtrack blends western bar blues and techno sounds with Indian classical styles such as Sufi and Hindustani. The soundtrack was well received, and they won several awards including the Screen Award for Best Music Director, the Big Star Award For Best Music Director, and the IIFA Award for Best Background Score, in addition to their eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. This was followed by Farhan Akhtar's Karthik Calling Karthik which despite getting mixed reviews from critics, went on to rule the charts. The track \"Uff Teri Adaa\" marked the debut of Loy's daughter Alyssa Mendonsa and became immensely popular. The next major release of the year was Sajid Khan's Housefull, which received generally favourable reviews from reviewers and the track \"Oh Girl\" crooned by Alyssa and Tarun Sagar topped the charts. Ali Zafar's Tere Bin Laden then followed, of which the song \"Ullu Da Pattha\" became a rage. The phrase was hence used for the promotion of the movie. Their final release of 2010, was Dharma Productions' We Are Family starring Kajol, Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal. The album received mixed response, and the film was an average success at the box office either.\n2011 began with Nikhil Advani's Akshay Kumar-starrer Patiala House, which was well received by all mainstream critics, though the movie didn't quite get such an enthralling reception. The following release, Excel Entertainment's Game, was met with poor reviews. the movie itself was met with extremely negative reception from the critics and turned out to be a disaster at the box office. They also scored music for Walt Disney's maiden Indian venture, Zokkomon. The music and the film failed to generate any positive buzz.\nTheir first international venture, the UK movie West is West, was released on 18 February 2011. The music was well received by almost all the reviewers, despite the movie itself receiving reviews ranging from mixed to positive.\nTheir major release of the year, Zoya Akhtar's multistarrer Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, was met with universal critical acclaim and opened well in the charts. However, the year ended on a low note for them with Farhan Akhtar's much-anticipated Don 2 receiving mixed response from the critics. Their work on the former earned them their ninth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\nThe trio had three releases in 2012. The bigger of their biggest releases, Kamal Haasan's controversial film Vishwaroopam, went on to become a major financial success. Their other release, Chittagong, was met with critical praise, and won Shankar the 2013 National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer, and Prasoon Joshi the National Film Award for Best Lyrics. They had also composed for the animated film Delhi Safari, whose title song was shortlisted for nominations in the Original Song category for the 85th Academy Awards.\nIn 2014, they collaborated with Dharma Productions for the romantic drama 2 States (2014), which earned them high critical praise and their third Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\nIn 2015, they composed the soundtrack and background score for Zoya Akhtar's Dil Dhadakne Do which earned them their eleventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\nIn 2016, their work on the soundtrack of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Mirzya earned them their twelfth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\nAfter a year-long hiatus, they composed music for the spy thriller Raazi (2018) starring Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal and directed by Meghna Gulzar for which they received their thirteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\nIn 2019, it was announced that the trio would be making their debut in the digital streaming space by composing the soundtrack and background score for an upcoming web series named Bandish Bandits. They also composed songs for multilingual film Saaho in four languages starring Baahubali-fame Prabhas.\nIn mid-2018, the trio was signed to compose for Prithviraj Sukumaran's Malayalam-language period epic Kaaliyan. Meanwhile, in Hindi, they also composed for another period film, Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, but backed out of the Amitabh Bachchan-Aamir Khan-starrer Thugs of Hindostan due to scheduling conflicts.\nIn 2020, they composed the soundtrack of Meghna Gulzar's Chhapaak which earned them their fourteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director.\n\n\nOther works\n\nShankar–Ehsaan–Loy have been involved in several projects aside from films. Ehsaan, Loy and Farhad had formed the band Instant Karma, and they released redone versions of R. D. Burman and other composers over two albums in 2002. They have also composed music for several jingles, signature tunes for corporates including Reliance and Aircel, and public awareness campaigns. In 2010, the troika wrote music for the first ever Bollywood musical, Zangoora.\nIn 2011, they composed the official anthem for ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, titled De Ghuma Ke, which became highly popular among youths and cricket enthusiasts within days of its release.\nIn 2004, they performed for a concert organised by The Indian Express held in celebration of the Indian democracy, which was also attended by Aamir Khan, Farhan Akhtar and other celebrities. They organised a concert at IFFI titled Salaam Boss (Salute to the Boss) in 2006 paying tribute to the legendary music composer R.D. Burman. Later in 2008, they performed for the Live Earth India Concert to help light homes with solar energy along with several other celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi. They have also performed a worldwide tour in 2010, called Inspiration: Aman Ki Aasha Tour, which began in New Jersey, United States. The tour was a major success, garnering overwhelming response from the audience. They performed at UK for the first time, in the Asia Rocks! concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in September 2011. In 2018, they embarked on a Tour of the US & Canada along with Farhan Akhtar.\n\n\nFrequent collaborators\nThey have composed music for most of the films produced by Excel Entertainment, founded by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani. They have also associated frequently with Dharma Productions, under Karan Johar. Their other notable collaborations have been with directors like Shaad Ali, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Zoya Akhtar, and Meghna Gulzar.\nMost of the lyrics for the songs composed by the trio have been penned by Gulzar and Javed Akhtar. However, they have also frequently associated with lyricists like Prasoon Joshi and Amitabh Bhattacharya.\n\n\nMusical style\nEach member of the trio brings his own talents and experiences to the group, combining the Carnatic and Hindustani vocal tradition (Shankar), Western rock (Ehsaan) and a deep understanding of fusion including a virtuoso mastery over the electronic synthesizer (Loy). They continue a tradition quite common in Bollywood music, that of partnerships between music composers contributing and pooling their individual strengths, often combining deep knowledge of Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic (South Indian) classical music with technical expertise as composers and orchestral arrangers. Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy probably represent the first trio of composers to entertain Bollywood audiences themselves with their chart-topping music.\nThe eternal quest among Bollywood's music composers has been to create interest among younger audiences who tend to be inspired more by musical themes and influences from the West. Since a film's soundtrack is an influential and critical component of commercial and critical success (required and achieved or sometimes squandered at the box office), this quest to \"deliver a film\" has always inspired composers to create tunes which combine the best of both traditional Indian music and popular Western or international influences. An overwhelming majority of Bollywood's most popular music has been composed based on classical Indian rāgas (in Sanskrit \"raga\" is literally \"color\" or \"mood\"). Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy have bridged that gap.\n\n\nInspiration\nAcademy Award-winning lyricist Gulzar described the music of the trio as \"a sensible synthesis of popularity and class\". Composer duo Vishal–Shekhar considers them as an inspiration. Upcoming filmmakers Pavel Singh and Shantum Singh consider the trio as their inspiration while upcoming musicians Arko Mukherjee, Rajkumar Sengupta and Debopratim Bakshi of the Friends of Fusion band from Kolkata said \"We have been influenced by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, so we mix our own elements to their composition. It's our way of paying homage to them.\" The Marathi film Satrangee Re paid a tribute to Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy by playing their song \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\". Shankar Mahadevan's nephew Saumil Shringarpure also acted in this.\nThe trio is known for launching the career of numerous singers, including Mahalakshmi Iyer, Anusha Mani, Caralisa Monteiro, Dominique Cerejo, and Hard Kaur.\n\n\nAwards\n\nShankar–Ehsaan–Loy were the recipients of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards (Bunty Aur Babli, Kal Ho Naa Ho, 2 States), three IIFA Awards (Kal Ho Naa Ho, Bunty Aur Babli, 2 States), three Screen Awards (Dil Chahta Hai, Bunty Aur Babli, My Name Is Khan), the Filmfare R. D. Burman Award for New Music Talent and two MTV Immies Awards. In 2004, they received the National Film Award for Best Music Direction for Kal Ho Naa Ho.\nIn 2010, they were honoured with the Years of Excellence at the Jack Daniel's Annual Rock Awards at Hard Rock Café, Mumbai.\n\n\nOther ventures\n\n\nBusiness\nSEL co-produced the album Johnny Gaddaar, with Adlabs, first time ever in the history of Hindi film music. In 2010, they also launched their own record label, SEL Songs and an iPhone app, making them the first Hindi film composers to do so.\nThey provide celebrity endorsement for various brands, including Sennheiser, Philips Consumer Lifestyle and Radio One 94.3.\n\n\nCharitable causes\nShankar–Ehsaan–Loy have been involved in many charitable activities. They composed the music for an album Haath Se Haath Mila as the part of an AIDS Awareness campaign launched by BBC World Service Trust. In 2007, they performed in Chennai for a concert organised by The Shakti Foundation – For the Physically Challenged to raise funds. Organized by Farhan Akhtar, they lead the Rock concert for raising funds for a paediatric medical camp in Bihar in 2008. They also launched the You Know You Can Rock Harder G3 Challenge talent hunt in search of the most talented rock band in the country in the same year. They had performed for a fund raising concert for the NGO Alert India which fights against leprosy in 2009. \n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Website\nShankar–Ehsaan–Loy YouTube Channel\nShankar Mahadevan at IMDb\nEhsaan Noorani at IMDb\nLoy Mendonsa at IMDb",

    "text": "The Bowdoin Orient is the student newspaper of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, United States. Established in 1871, the Orient is the oldest continuously published college weekly in the United States.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Bowdoin Orient was established in 1871 as Bowdoin College's newspaper and literary magazine. Originally issued bi-weekly, it has been a weekly since April 1899. It is considered to be the oldest continuously-published college weekly in the U.S., which means that it has been in publication every academic year that Bowdoin has been in session since it began publishing weekly. (Other college weeklies stopped printing during certain war years.)\nIn the beginning, the Orient was laid out in a smaller magazine format and included literary material such as poems and fiction alongside its news. In 1897, the literary society formed its own publication, The Quill, and the Orient has since primarily focused on reporting news. In 1921, the Orient abandoned the magazine format and moved to a larger broadsheet layout to keep up with the trend of the times. Since then, it has variously moved between broadsheet and tabloid sizes and has seen major format updates every decade or two.\nIn 1912, The Bowdoin Publishing Company was established as the formal publisher of the Orient, and remained independent of the college for many years, while using college facilities and working with faculty-member advisers. The Bowdoin Publishing Company was a legal, non-profit corporation in the state of Maine for many years, at least from 1968 to 1989, though it was most likely an independent corporation since its inception. In 2002, the college forced the Orient to close the Bowdoin Publishing Company's off-campus checking account, which represented the final step in the company's dissolution.\nThe Orient building has its own archives, with issues dating back to 1873, but it is missing several periods of time. The Hawthorne-Longfellow Library at Bowdoin College has a nearly complete archive of past Orient issues, both in print and on microform. Virtually all print issues are available from 1871 to the present in the library's George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives. Bound copies from 1871 to 1921 can be found in the periodicals section of the library. The Orient is available on microfilm for issues from 1921 to the present. Archives are also available online through the Internet Archive.\n\n\nCirculation and distribution\nThe Orient currently has an on-campus print distribution of approximately 1,000, and mails the paper to several hundred paid subscribers, including alumni, parents and other friends of the College. The paper is published each Friday that classes are in session at the presses of the Portland Press Herald. It is distributed to the dining halls, the library, the student union and various other College buildings, as well as in a number of businesses and restaurants in downtown Brunswick.\nThe Orient began publishing its content on the Web around 2000. Running on a custom content management system, it was redesigned in 2001; 2004, becoming database-driven; 2009, with a visual overhaul; and 2012. The most recent version is a responsive design intended to work better across all devices, including phones and tablets. Web content has always been free. The paper launched online advertisements in 2017.\n\n\nMission statement\nThe current mission statement, published in every edition, reads: \"The Bowdoin Orient is a student-run weekly publication dedicated to providing news and information relevant to the College community. Editorially independent of the College and its administrators, the Orient pursues such content freely and thoroughly, following professional journalistic standards in writing and reporting. The Orient is committed to serving as an open forum for thoughtful and diverse discussion and debate on issues of interest to the College community.\"\n\n\nNotable alumni\nEdward Page Mitchell, co-founder, editorialist for The Sun and early science fiction author\nCynthia McFadden, NBC News correspondent, former co-anchor of Nightline\nKary Antholis, former HBO executive and director of One Survivor Remembers\nJay Caspian Kang, staff writer at The New York Times Magazine\nEvan Gershkovich, reporter for The Wall Street Journal, detained by Russia in 2023\nZohran Mamdani, mayor-elect of New York City\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Bowdoin Orient web site\n@orientbowdoin on Twitter\nOrient Express blog\nBowdoin College",

    "text": "Silver Charm (foaled February 22, 1994) is a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and 1998 Dubai World Cup (of all of which he is the oldest surviving winner). He stood at stud in the United States and Japan, and is now retired at Old Friends Farm in Kentucky. \nUpon the death of Hansel, Silver Charm became the oldest living winner of the Preakness Stakes; upon the death of Grindstone, he also became the oldest living winner of the Kentucky Derby; the last surviving Derby winner born in the 20th century; and, upon the 2022 death of 1996 Belmont Stakes winner Editor's Note, Silver Charm became the oldest living winner of an American Triple Crown race. \n\n\nBackground and early career\nSilver Charm was foaled in Florida on February 22, 1994, at Silverleaf Farm, out of the mare Bonnie's Poker and sired by Silver Buck, who was a son of Buckpasser. He was a gray colt with a blaze and was bred by Mary Lou Wootton. As a two-year-old Silver Charm was purchased by trainer Bob Baffert for $85,000, and then resold to Beverly and Robert Lewis, who kept him in training with Baffert.\nSilver Charm's first win was as a two-year-old, in the Del Mar Futurity. Silver Charm entered the 1997 Kentucky Derby with Gary Stevens as his jockey. Silver Charm drew the sixth post position out of a field of 13, and broke well at the starting gate. He came out between other horses going into the backstretch and took the lead with less than a furlong to go. He won the Derby, finishing a head in front of Captain Bodgit.\nIt was Baffert's second time entering the Kentucky Derby or any American classic race; his horse Cavonnier had come in second the year before.\nSilver Charm won the Preakness Stakes in the same manner, pulling ahead of Captain Bodgit and Free House just before the wire.\nSilver Charm lost the third jewel of the Triple Crown by placing second in the 1997 Belmont Stakes to Touch Gold; he lost by three quarters of a length. He was the winner of the 1997 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse. He closed out his sophomore season with a runner-up finish in the Malibu Stakes.\n\n\nLater racing career\nAt age 4, Silver Charm won the 1998 Dubai World Cup, San Fernando Stakes, Strub Stakes, Kentucky Cup Classic Handicap, Goodwood Handicap (now called the Awesome Again Stakes), and the Clark Handicap. He also finished second in both the  Stephen Foster Handicap and Breeders' Cup Classic.\nAt age 5, Silver Charm won the 1999  San Pasqual Handicap and placed third in both the Donn Handicap and  Santa Anita Handicap. He also competed in the 1999 Dubai World Cup, finishing sixth. After his fourth-place finish in the Stephen Foster Handicap, Silver Charm was retired.\n\n\nStud career\nFollowing the end of his race career, Silver Charm was retired to Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky for an initial stud fee of $25,000. He stood stud in North America for five seasons, siring five crops of foals. In 2004 he was purchased by the Japanese Breeders Association, and was sent to stud in Japan.\nHe stood at the Shizunai Stallion Station in December 2004. In 2008, he stood at the Shichinohe Stallion Station and in 2009, at the Iburi Stallion Station.\nSilver Charm's North American progeny features 15 stakes winners, most notably multiple graded stakes winners Preachinatthebar and Miss Isella. Silver Charm was not particularly successful in Japan, of 149 foals of racing age, he has been represented by one stakes-placed runner (in Korea). Overall, however, Silver Charm's progeny have made $2 million and won more than 1,000 races.\n\n\nHonors\nIn the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, Silver Charm was ranked #63.\nIn 2007, Silver Charm was inducted into the United States Racing Hall of Fame.\n\n\nRetirement\n\nSilver Charm went to Japan to the Shizunai Stallion Station in 2004, with a so-called \"buy-back clause\" included in his sales contract. Since the slaughterhouse death of Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, the New York Owners and Breeder's Association has begun asking for a small voluntary per-race charge called the \"Ferdinand Fee\". These monies are intended for the Bluegrass Charities and the Thoroughbred Charities of America to help fund racehorse rescue and retirement groups and keep horses from slaughter when their breeding or racing careers are over.  This has led racehorse owners to include buy-back clauses within their stallion contracts.\nOn October 29, 2014, it was announced jointly by Three Chimneys Farm and Old Friends Farm that Silver Charm would return from Japan and be retired permanently at Old Friends Equine, a horse retirement facility, in Georgetown, Kentucky. Beverly Lewis and her son Steve paid to bring Silver Charm back to Kentucky, where he remains at Old Friends and can be visited by the public.\n\n\nPedigree\n\n\nReferences\nPreakness winners\n\n\nExternal links\nSilver Charm Racing Into History",

    "title": "George Jolly",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=14272478",
    "text": "George Jolly, or Joliffe (in Germany, Joris Joliphus or Jollifous) (fl. 1640 – 1673) was an actor, an early actor-manager and a theatre impresario of the middle seventeenth century. He was \"an experienced, courageous, and obstinate actor-manager\" who proved a persistent rival for the main theatrical figures of Restoration theatre, Sir William Davenant and Thomas Killigrew.\n\n\nBeginnings\nNothing is known of Jolly's early life. He began his acting career c. 1640, at the crisis point of Caroline era theatre and society, when the English Civil War was about to start. The Puritan authorities suppressed the London theatres in September 1642; Jolly, like most actors, playwrights, and poets, was a royalist supporter, and served Prince Charles, then Prince of Wales, in Paris until 1646. Jolly eventually organised a company of fourteen actors, his English Comedian Players, and led them around Europe from 1648 to 1659. They began in Germany, and were in Poland and Sweden in 1649 and 1650. They regularly performed in Vienna and Frankfurt, and may have performed before the future King Charles II in Frankfurt in September 1655. The company came to include German as well as English actors over time, and apparently adapted its personnel to the countries in which it operated. Jolly also brought woman actors onto the stage in Germany in 1654, anticipating the greatest innovation of the Restoration theatre in England by several years. At the Krachbein (an inn in Frankfurt), Jolly used a tennis court (\"Ballhaus\") as a theatre, another technique that would be followed later in London, at Lisle's Tennis Court and Gibbon's Tennis Court.\n\n\nRestoration\nWith the end of the Interregnum period and the return of Charles to the throne, the London theatres re-opened; in August 1660 Killigrew and Davenant received a patent to establish two theatre companies under royal patronage, the King's Company and the Duke's Company respectively – their famous \"duopoly.\" Jolly had set up his own acting troupe by November 1660; on 24 December 1660, Jolly obtained his own patent from the King to run a company and theatre. Jolly's 1660 company was apparently made up mostly of personnel from William Beeston's last effort, and acted at first at the Cockpit Theatre. By March 1661 they were at the old Red Bull Theatre, where Samuel Pepys saw them perform William Rowley's All's Lost by Lust. They were working in the Salisbury Court Theatre by September of that year. Soon, though, they were back at the Cockpit; Jolly's company appears to have worked in whatever theatre was available to them. Their repertory probably included Marlowe's Doctor Faustus; Pepys and his wife saw a performance of that play at the Red Bull on 26 May 1662, though he found it \"so wretchedly done that we were sick of it.\" (The 1663 edition of Faustus may reflect the version of the play that Jolly staged.)\nJolly maintained a toehold in London for two years, though the erstwhile rivals Davenant and Killigrew united in opposing his presence in the capital as strenuously as they could. On 1 and 29 January 1663, Jolly was granted new licenses (from Master of the Revels Sir Henry Herbert and from the King respectively) to play in any city in England except for London and Westminster; he led his troupe on a tour of provincial cities. Norwich became a de facto base of operations for Jolly's company, where they played at the King's Arms Inn; their repertory in this period appears to have included Massinger's A New Way to Pay Old Debts, Cooke's Greene's Tu Quoque, Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, and the Fletcher/Shirley play The Night Walker among other works.\nDuring this time, Jolly leased his London license to Killigrew and Davenant for £4 weekly. They falsely claimed that Jolly had sold them his license, which led to its revocation in July 1667. After 1667, Davenant and Killigrew were able to mollify Jolly somewhat by putting him in charge of \"the Nursery\", a school for the training of young actors.\n\n\nTouring\nJolly still maintained his touring troupe; they remained successful at playing cities outside London – provided they didn't stay too long. In 1669 the city authorities of Norwich complained about Jolly to the King; the actors' popularity with the town's cloth workers had led Jolly to stay there for three months, and the town fathers were worried over his impact on the wool trade.\nJolly was left behind in one key development of Restoration dramaturgy: the use of scenery. The London patent companies built larger and more elaborate theatres for themselves, equipped with ever more advanced resources for the scenes and properties needed for the spectaculars of the era. Jolly's touring companies had to travel light, as the touring companies of English Renaissance theatre had done in previous generations. Jolly therefore preserved the last remnant and vestige of the theatre of the previous age into the Restoration era.\n\n\nCharacter\nThe available evidence indicates that theatre managers of this age, from Philip Henslowe and Francis Langley to Christopher Beeston, were sometimes (often, regularly) ruthless and unscrupulous. Jolly was cut from the same cloth. (His name was a malapropism and a misnomer: Jolly wasn't jolly.) He has been characterised as an \"irascible\" man \"whose hot temper made it difficult for him to keep a company together.\" Alfred Harbage wrote that Jolly \"always proved venal in proportion to his opportunities, and it is difficult to feel much sympathy for him.\"\n\n\nSee also\nJohn Rhodes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Houston International Festival, also known as iFest, was a contemporary, multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural arts and music festival held annually in Houston, Texas. This North American festival takes place every April on 16 acres (65,000 m2) in downtown Houston's parks and plazas. By city ordinance this annual 10-day event is Houston's official city celebration of the visual and performing arts. According to an article in the Houston Chronicle,  Ifest announced  in June 2014 that it was seeking Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, making it clear that the 2014 fest would be the last ever festival.\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe annual downtown event celebrates music, dance and cultures from around the world. Early festivals featured almost exclusively local acts; as the festival grew, more international and nationally known artists (most recently in 2010, George Clinton, Steel Pulse, Eddie Palmieri, and Ozomatli were scheduled in addition to regional and local performers).\nThe festival features vendors selling local and international foods and crafts. iFest also features six to eight arts markets with more than 400 artists including a juried art market.\nThe festival has the large areas dedicated to cultural and educational exhibits depicting different cultures. The footprint is divided into zones, each one focusing on a specific culture through food, exhibits and entertainment. The Living Museum represents the spotlighted culture each year with iconic structures, interactive exhibits, artisan demonstrations and performances.\nThe festival impacts Houston's tourism and economy by drawing 22% tourists attendance and generates local and state tourist-based taxes of $2.19 million.\nThe Houston International Festival is owned by the Houston Festival Foundation, Inc., a 501 (c)(3) organization, which uses the proceeds from the festival for year-round arts and education programs for schoolchildren in the Greater Houston area.\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1971 Main Street 1 was the name given to a Salute to the Arts to be held Downtown—a weekend happening of celebrations highlighting the performing and visual arts, on the sidewalks, streets, and store windows located between Dallas and McKinney on Main Street in Houston, Texas. Sakowitz and Foleys Department Stores, and the Cultural Affairs Committee of the Houston Chamber of Commerce, with the blessing of Mayor Louie Welch, sponsored the event. It was the beginning of the cultural salute that grew and evolved into today's Houston International Festival. In 1987, iFest began featuring the art and culture of a different honoured country each year and began complementing local artists with regional, national and international artists. Today, the international component sets the tone for an evolving celebration of world culture.\n\n\nTimeline\n1973: Houston's Main Street Art Happening was moved from Downtown Houston, Texas (where the City Ordinance prohibited street closings) to the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and its grounds across from the Contemporary Arts Museum, still on Main but now more \"mid-town\". This attempt at an outdoor-indoor celebration created safety concerns with crowds of pedestrians crossing streets, so in...\n1974: The Art Happening moved to Hermann Park, near the Museum. It was expanded to two weekends to help minimize the risk of inclement weather affecting attendance.\n1976: The event was named \"The Houston Festival\", and remained so for the next ten years. The organizational structure changed, with the creation of The Houston Festival Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) non-profit with its own board of directors and budget, separate from the Houston Chamber of Commerce sponsorship. The foundation still remains the producing entity today.\n1977: The festival moved back downtown, this time with two stages across from the Alley Theatre and Jones Hall, at what is now Jones Plaza. Attendance grew but expansion was limited in that site.\n1979: The festival moved to a larger potential site at Market Square, in order to accommodate the growing number of participants and attendees.\n1980  The Houston Festival Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)3 organization was spun off, as an independent entity, from the Houston Chamber of Commerce, with a mission to celebrate and promote the arts of Houston to the rest of the world. It was supported by the City of Houston, the Houston Cultural Arts Council, and the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Council. The board of Directors hired their first President, Rochella Cooper who immediately set out to involve the performing, visual, and literary arts organizations and individuals in promoting Houston through the Festival.\n1981   The Festival expanded its location to encompass, over the next six years, twenty downtown blocks including nine performing stages, 350 fine craft artists, an outdoor sculpture exhibition along the banks of the Buffalo Bayou, and the involvement of all major arts organizations. (Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre) And all of this was free to the public.\n1983   The president was charged by the board of directors with developing a five year plan that would include the important sesquicentennial of Houston and Texas in 1986. Out of this plan emerged the big event in 1986.\n1985   The first Art Car Parade took place during the Houston Festival exposing thousands of attendees to the creativity of the art car makers. \n1986   New Music America, a national showcase for new music, chose Houston for their annual gathering of top professionals in all genre including world renowned composers such as John Cage. \n1986: \"Rendez-vous Houston\", highlighting the anniversaries of Houston and Texas' Sesquicentennial celebrations was the biggest event ever staged in Houston, produced as the centerpiece of the Houston Festival. Lasers and fireworks danced above and around the skyscrapers downtown accompanied by French composer Jean-Michel Jarre's original music compositions. In June 1986 President Rochella Cooper resigned to accept other opportunities.\nDr. James Austin was hired in late summer 1986, and with the board set out to re-examine the path and future for the festival. This began the expansion of the basic concepts of the event, adding the now-established education and business collaborations and programs.\n1987: The name of the celebration was changed to \"The Houston International Festival\" to celebrate Houston's role as an international city. Following this event, a plan was developed to spotlight the arts and cultures of an individual country or region of the world each year, with request for assistance from the participating governments at the highest levels possible. At this point the board of directors decided to charge admission to the Festival and fenced the entire area to contain the event.\n1988: Australia was the first country of honor, with the international theme presenting an amalgam of that country's culture and arts. A different country or region in alternate parts of the globe were to be selected for the \"spotlight\" thereafter, although the festival continued to build more performing stages to ensure on-going presentations of arts from throughout the world during the two-week event.\n1989-2003: 1989 continued the new pattern with the spotlight on France, followed by the United Kingdom (1990); Japan (1991); Spain & the New World (1992); Mexico (1993); Italy (1994); Turkey (1995); West Africa (1996); China (1997); Islands of the Caribbean (1998); Southern Africa (1999); Brazil for the 2000 Millennium; Ireland (2001); and a revisit to France in 2002 and Mexico in 2003. After twenty years, the City Ordinance regarding the festival's unique status lapsed, and downtown Houston was in the throes of a major renaissance of urban development and street improvements. Possible congestion and other factors presented the foundation with the need for an examination for alternative sites. The Houston International Festival moved south, this time following the tracks of the METRO's new light rail transportation line for better access and more space to Reliant Park.\n2004: The Houston International Festival turned towards Asia with its first spotlight on Thailand at Festival Plaza at Reliant Park. Five Asian elephants joined the programming mix in a special appeal to families.\n2005-2007: The Houston International Festival returned to its previous downtown footprint covering 16 acres (65,000 m2) in downtown Houston parks and plazas. iFest  turned its spotlight on India in 2005, Jamaica in 2006 and China in 2007.\n2008: The Houston International Festival offered a new twist on its honored country theme. The theme for iFest 2008, \"Out of Africa: the Three Journeys\", celebrated the rich history, achievements, contributions and triumphs of African people in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, the United States and the rest of the world.\n2009: iFest returned to its honored country theme and revisited the culture of Ireland.\n2010: The honored region for the 2010 Houston International Festival was the Caribbean.\n2011: THE SILK ROAD – The 2011 theme for the Houston International Festival follows the route of Marco Polo with a focus on China, India and other cultures of the Silk Road.\n2012: Honored country was Argentina.\n2013: Honored country was Brazil.\n2014: Australia becomes the honored country theme.\nJune 2014: Houston Festival Foundation announces plans to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\n\nPresenters of world music\nFrom its inception in 1971, artists from Houston had been the primary source of programming. In 1987, iFest began featuring the art and culture of a different honored country each year and began complementing local artists with regional, national and international artists. The festival is a very popular event in Texas for world music, afropop, blues, rock, country, reggae, soul, cajun, zydeco and almost all other music fans. The event features hundreds of performers on six to ten stages including many internationally touring artists. The festival has become one of the premier music festivals in the state of Texas.  Performers who have appeared at the festival include:\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nifest.org",

It is bordered by the Gulf of Suo on the Seto Inland Sea, and to the west by the Hiraodai, which is known for its karst plateau. The southern area adjacent to Yukuhashi City is a lush rural area on the Miyako Plain.\n\n\nNeighboring municipalities\nFukuoka Prefecture\n\nKitakyushu\n Yukuhashi\n\n\nClimate\nKanda has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall.

The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.2 °C.\n\n\nDemographics\nPer Japanese census data, the population of Kanda has been steadily increasing since the 1950s.\n\n\nHistory\nThe area of Kanda was part of ancient Buzen Province. During the Edo Period, the area was part of the holdings of Kokura Domain.  The village of Kanda within Miyako District, Fukuoka was established on May 1, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system.  Kanda was raised to town status on August 1, 1924.

In recent years, the automobile industry has become extremely concentrated, with the Nissan Motor Kyushu Plant (currently Nissan Motor Kyushu) starting operations in 1975 and the Toyota Motor Kyushu Kanda Plant starting operations in 2005.  It is developing as an area that is responsible for the automobile industry in northern Kyushu.\n\n\nEducation\nKanda has six public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the town government and one combined public high school operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education.

    "text": "\"Love Is in the N2-O2-Ar-CO2-Ne-He-CH4\" is the thirteenth episode of the twenty-seventh season of the American animated television series The Simpsons, and the 587th episode of the series overall. The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland and written by John Frink. It aired in the United States on Fox on February 14, 2016.\nIn this episode, Professor Frink uses science to attract women while Grampa uses a drug to relive his happiest memories. The episode received mixed reviews.\nThis episode was dedicated to the memory of Julie Kavner's father David Kavner, who died on February 1, 2016.\n\n\nPlot\nMr. Smithers reminds Mr. Burns about Valentine's Day and tries to convince him to let the employees leave early to stay with their loved ones. Burns refuses, but Smithers convinces him to host a Sweethearts Dance. While enjoying the party with Marge, Homer gets a phone call from Grampa saying that he is alone and scared that a cat who can smell death is staring at him. Homer and Marge visit Grampa at the Retirement Castle, where a nurse gives a pill to the elders, making them hallucinate and start dancing with the ghosts of late loved ones, including Grampa's deceased wife Mona. Marge thinks it is not fair to do that to the old folks and decides to do something about it.\nMeanwhile, at the party, Professor Frink is alone because he is not good at getting a girlfriend. The next day, Homer discovers him sleeping in one of the power plant's rooms. Frink confesses that Valentine's Day is hard for people like him. Homer explains that love is a matter of trial and error. Frink gets the idea of determining what women like in a man and using science to become that person. Frink replaces his glasses with blue contact lenses and uses shoe lifts for him to look taller, but even a droid that he programmed to say \"yes\" still thinks he is not attractive. Homer suggests it could be because of his voice, so Frink decides to use a chip under his tongue to make his voice more attractive.\nTo test his new self, Frink goes to a yoga class. He manages to impress all the girls in there and eventually begins an active dating life, but he soon notices that he cannot handle his new life and decides to hide inside Moe's Tavern, where he realizes that most men there are lonely. He brings all the women to Springfield Planetarium, but instead of telling which woman he has chosen to be his girlfriend, he pairs them up with the lonely men of Springfield and goes back to his life as a single scientist. It is only then that the droid begins to see him as attractive while watching the stars, only to get interrupted by her mother as Frink wonders why he built the robot's mother.\nAt the Simpsons' house, Marge discovers that Bart is taking advantage of the old people's hallucinations to win money on gambling. She takes them back to the Retirement Castle, only to discover that the nurse gives powerful drugs to them only to ease her job. Marge manages to convince the nurse to stop medicating the old people. Though the nurse hides the drugs in the library, Grampa finds the pills and takes them, so he can start hallucinating and win Mona back, running out of the Retirement Castle and into a 1940s-esque world. During his hallucination, Marge, Bart and Lisa convince Grampa to leave the past behind and live in the present, where there are people that still love him. He says goodbye to Mona before waking up in a mechanic's garage, having somehow wandered there during his hallucination.\nIn the final scene, Marge experiences the hallucinations and asks Grampa why they are there again. He explains that he flushed the drugs down the toilet, but suspects that the drugs may have entered Springfield's water system. Marge thinks they should wake up, but is distracted by Homer calling attention to Dean Martin's presence.\n\n\nCultural references\nProfessor Frink's transformation is similar to the one from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, whose main character is the basis for Frink. The female robot that Frink builds looks similar to the one from the 2014 film Ex-Machina. Homer is looking at a poster for the 1943 film The Outlaw.\n\n\nReception\n\"Love Is in the N2-O2-Ar-CO2-Ne-He-CH4\" received a 1.3 rating and was watched by 2.89 million viewers, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.\nDennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B−, stating that the episode, \"This episode (fine, 'Love Is in the [N2-O2-Ar-CO2-Ne-He-CH4]') is a moderately amusing mush of good and bad ideas making up two half-realized stories. I found things to like in both, and wished each were better, and longer.\"\nTony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars.  He stated that the episode is well-paced and fun, but it was a remake of Jerry Lewis material.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Love Is in the N2-O2-Ar-CO2-Ne-He-CH4\" at IMDb",

The Ducks lead the overall series at 69–49–10 as of the 2024 season.\n\n\nSoccer\nThe men's soccer teams have only played 3 times, with the Ducks dropping this as a sport at the conclusion of the 1989 season.  The Beavers won all three contests played, leaving the record at 3–0–0 in favor of OSU.\n\n\nWrestling\nOregon State has traditionally dominated in this sport, leading the Ducks 103–24–4 in the all-time series as of the end of the 2005–06 season. Oregon State has won the past 7 meets, dating back to the 2003 season. The Ducks have dropped this sport and it has been absent for several years.\n\n\nWomen's sports\n\n\nBasketball\nBoth teams have recently made the Final 4 with Oregon State going in 2016 and Oregon going in 2019.

    "text": "Hazlerigg (often misspelled Hazelrigg) is a village and civil parish north of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear, England.  It is about 5 miles (8.0 km) north of the city centre, on the A1. It is split between Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside, each side of the A1 being a different district. The parish council administer the Newcastle side, whereas the area located in North Tyneside is unparished. Much of the Newcastle Great Park development is within the area administered by the Hazlerigg Parish Council.\nLocated in the village is a post office, a fish & chip shop, a beauty salon, a hairdresser, a garage, a convenience store and a social club that is now open under new management.  In spite of having a population of 1,053, and almost 800 homes, Hazlerigg has never had a pub. The population of the civil Parish taken at the 2021 Census was 1,114. \nThe village Community Centre is located at the west of the village next to the 'show field', formerly the site of the annual village Gala. A football field is located between Hazlerigg and the neighbouring Brunswick Village. Although Brunswick Village is only a 2-minute walk from Hazlerigg, the journey may take longer by car as there is no direct road linking the two villages, as they were once separated by a railway line for coal wagons. The path between the villages now follows the route of this wagonway. The shortest journey by road is two miles via Wideopen and the old Great North Road. The village is now being expanded by a large housing development called Havannah Park to the west, across the road from the Havannah Nature Reserve.\n\n\nHistory\nHazlerigg was once the site of a colliery, which was in use from 1892 to 1964. The village prospered due to the export business thriving within it. Local houses for miners were built and they founded the village seen today by visitors and inhabitants. The site of Hazlerigg Colliery is now covered by trees, immediately to the west of the village.\nThere was a second and newer coal mine a mile further to the west of Hazlerigg, known as the Havannah Drift Mine, which was opened in 1950. There were concerns that subsidence from the mining was threatening the runway of Newcastle Airport, and the pit closed in 1977. Many of its buildings survive and are now part of a plastics factory. A large area of the surrounding land is now the Havannah Nature Reserve to the south of Coach Lane.\nThe village nature of Hazlerigg is threatened by the encroaching Newcastle Great Park development to the south, built on what was formerly Green Belt land.\n\n\nEducation\nThe nearest school is Hazlewood Community Primary School, which most of the village children attend until Year 6.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Hazlerigg at Wikimedia Commons",
    "summary": "Hazlerigg (often misspelled Hazelrigg) is a village and civil parish north of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear, England.  It is about 5 miles (8.0 km) north of the city centre, on the A1. It is split between Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside, each side of the A1 being a different district. The parish council administer the Newcastle side, whereas the area located in North Tyneside is unparished. Much of the Newcastle Great Park development is within the area administered by the Hazlerigg Parish Council.\nLocated in the village is a post office, a fish & chip shop, a beauty salon, a hairdresser, a garage, a convenience store and a social club that is now open under new management.  In spite of having a population of 1,053, and almost 800 homes, Hazlerigg has never had a pub. The population of the civil Parish taken at the 2021 Census was 1,114. \nThe village Community Centre is located at the west of the village next to the 'show field', formerly the site of the annual village Gala. A football field is located between Hazlerigg and the neighbouring Brunswick Village. Although Brunswick Village is only a 2-minute walk from Hazlerigg, the journey may take longer by car as there is no direct road linking the two villages, as they were once separated by a railway line for coal wagons. The path between the villages now follows the route of this wagonway. The shortest journey by road is two miles via Wideopen and the old Great North Road. The village is now being expanded by a large housing development called Havannah Park to the west, across the road from the Havannah Nature Reserve.",

He taught philosophy and theology, and distinguished himself as pulpit orator.\nBeing called to France in 1620, he was assigned important offices both in the order and at the Court of Louis XIII.\n\n\nWorks\nDe la Haye is the author or editor of some forty folio volumes, besides several unpublished manuscripts. He edited the works of Bernardine of Siena, and the writings of Francis of Assisi and Anthony of Padua, but his project of bringing out all important works by Franciscan authors in a Bibliotheca Ordinis Minorum was not realized.\nDesigned principally for the use of preachers were his commentaries:\n\n\"In Genesim, sive Arbor vitae concionatorum\", 4 vols.;\n\"In Exodum, vel Concionatorum virga, percutiens peccatores\", 3 vols.;\n\"In Apocalypsim\", 3 vols.\nTwo major works were the \"Biblia Magna\", 5 vols. (Paris, 1643) and the \"Biblia Maxima\", 19 vols. (Paris 1660). The text of the Vulgate forms the basis of the two. In the former the author quotes verbatim, after every chapter, the commentaries of Gagnaeus, Estius, Manuel de Sá, Menochius, and Tirinus, S.J.; whereas in the latter he appends to each extract\n\nthe various readings of the versions,\na paragraph in which the harmony of these readings and the literal meaning of the text are briefly discussed, and\nannotations drawn from the commentators above cited, but headed, in this case, by Nicolaus Lyranus.\nThe methods followed by the author have been praised; yet it has been observed that the prolegomena and his own interpretations of the text are lacking in judgment.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nLuke Wadding, Scriptores (Rome, 1908), s. v.\nSbaralea, Supplementum (Rome,1806), s. v.\nJungmann in Kirchenlexikon, s.v.

    "text": "Roy Jones Jr. vs. Bryant Brannon, billed as Charity Bash, was a professional boxing match contested on October 4, 1996 for the IBF super middleweight title.\n\n\nBackground\nIn early September 1996, it was announced that Roy Jones Jr., the reigning IBF super middleweight champion and The Ring magazine's top ranked pound-for-pound fighter, would face Bryant Brannon, the IBF's number-one ranked super middleweight challenger, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden the following month. Jones and Brannon would headline a boxing card dubbed the Charity Bash, named as such because Jones, with help from cable network HBO, would donate the proceeds earned from the gate to three non-profit organizations; the New York City Police Foundation, the NYPD Self Support Group and the Congress of Racial Equality, as well as former boxer Gerald McClellan, who had been severely injured the previous year in a bout against Nigel Benn. The Jones–Brannon bout was supplemented with a WBA welterweight title fight featuring champion Ike Quartey defending against challenger Oba Carr. Jones explained that his decision to hold the event was because \"people are always talking about athletes being selfish. I want people to understand we're not robots; we're human beings\".\nBrief portions of the fight can be seen in the 1997  horror film The Devil's Advocate starring Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves.\n\n\nThe Fight\nFrom the opening bell, Brannon charged Jones, backing him into the ropes for the first minute plus of the first round as he threw a bevy of punches in a vain attempt to penetrate Jones' defense. Finally, roughly midway through the round, Jones landed a left hook which wobble Brannon and sent him on the defensive for the first time. Jones would proceed to land several punches to Brannon's head, ending with a left hook that dropped Brannon to the canvas. Brannon stumbled back to his feet and was allowed to continue the fight by referee Ron Lipton. Jones then spent the remainder of the round landing numerous combinations, though Brannon was able make it through to the end of the round. Jones started off the second round rather tentatively, as Brannon tried to engage Jones but continued to get past Jones defense. Just past the midway point of the second round, Jones dropped Brannon for the second time with another left hook. Though Brannon was clearly dazed, he was able to get back up and was again allowed to continue, though Jones quickly backed him into a corner and landed numerous unanswered punches before a right-left combination sent Brannon down again. Lipton immediately stopped the fight and Jones was declared the winner by technical knockout at 2:23 of the second round. \n\n\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n^Note 1 For IBF Super Middleweight title ^Note 2 For WBA Welterweight title ^Note 3 For NABU Light Middleweight title ^Note 4 For NABU Super Middleweight title ^Note 5 For WBC Continental Americas Featherweight title \n\n\nBroadcasting\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Banff-class sloop was a group of ten warships of the Royal Navy. Built as United States Coast Guard Lake-class cutters, in 1941 these ships were loaned to the Royal Navy as antisubmarine warfare escort ships. The transfers took place at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; the sloops were manned for transport to Britain by personnel from the damaged battleship Malaya which was under repair there.\nThe sloops were initially part of Western Approaches command used to escort convoys such as SL convoys from Sierra Leone to Liverpool, and one, HMS Culver, was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic while so employed January 1942.\nIn 1943, the nine surviving sloops were assigned to Operation Torch—the Allied invasion of French North Africa. Two—Walney and Hartland—were destroyed in Operation Reservist in the assault to capture Oran harbor. The remaining seven escorted Mediterranean convoys in support of the North African invasion and saw varied employment in the Atlantic until assigned to the Kilindini Escort Force in late 1943 and early 1944. They stayed in the Indian Ocean for the remainder of the war escorting trade convoys in the Arabian Sea, and five served in the Bay of Bengal supporting Operation Dracula and Operation Zipper in the last months of conflict with Japan. Six were returned to the United States after the conclusion of hostilities; and one, disabled by mechanical failure, was scrapped overseas.\n\n\nShips\n\n\nLulworth (ex-Chelan)\n\nOriginally cutter #45, she was named for Lake Chelan, built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding in Massachusetts, and launched on 19 May 1928.

    "title": "Abraham",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1436",
    "text": "Abraham (originally Abram) is the common Hebrew patriarch of the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Judaism, he is the founding father who began the covenantal relationship between the Jewish people and God; in Christianity, he is the spiritual progenitor of all believers, whether Jewish or non-Jewish; and in Islam, he is a link in the chain of Islamic prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad. Abraham is also revered in other Abrahamic religions such as the Baháʼí Faith and the Druze faith.\nThe story of the life of Abraham, as told in the narrative of the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible, revolves around the themes of posterity and land. He is said to have been called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land of Canaan, which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. This promise is subsequently inherited by Isaac, Abraham's son by his wife Sarah, while Isaac's half-brother Ishmael is also promised that he will be the founder of a great nation. Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin to earn his parents' approval. Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives \"all Abraham's goods\" while the other sons receive only \"gifts\".\nMost scholars view the patriarchal age, along with the Exodus and the period of the biblical judges, as a late literary construct that does not relate to any particular historical era. It is largely concluded that the Torah, the series of books that includes Genesis, was composed during the Persian period, as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their \"father Abraham\", and the returning exiles who based their counterclaim on Moses and the Exodus tradition of the Israelites.\n\n\nThe Abraham Cycle\n\n\nStructure and narrative programs\nThe Abraham cycle (Genesis 11:27–Genesis 25:11) unfolds as a narrative of mounting tension, centered on the conflict between God's promise that Abram would father a lineage and become the ancestor of numerous nations, and a succession of crises that jeopardize this divine commitment. The storytelling method used here is the “obstacle story,” a literary device renowned for its enduring and universal popularity across cultures and eras.\nThe Abraham cycle is not structured by a unified plot centered on a conflict and its resolution or a problem and its solution. The episodes are often only loosely linked, and the sequence is not always logical, but it is unified by the presence of Abraham himself, as either actor or witness, and by the themes of posterity and land. These themes form \"narrative programs\" set out in Genesis 11:27–31 concerning the sterility of Sarah and Genesis 12:1–3 in which Abraham is ordered to leave the land of his birth for the land God will show him.\n\n\nOrigins and calling\n\nTerah, the ninth in descent from Noah, was the father of Abram, Nahor, Haran (Hebrew: הָרָן Hārān) and Sarah. Haran was the father of Lot, who was Abram's nephew; the family lived in Ur of the Chaldees. Haran died there. Abram married Sarah (Sarai). Terah, Abram, Sarai, and Lot departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named Haran (Hebrew: חָרָן Ḥārān), where Terah died at the age of 205. According to some exegetes (like Nahmanides), Abram was actually born in Haran and he later relocated to Ur, while some of his family remained in Haran.\nGod had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and their possessions and people that they had acquired, and traveled to Shechem in Canaan.\n\n\nSarai\n\nThere was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram, Lot, and their households traveled to Egypt. On the way Abram told Sarai to say that she was his sister, so that the Egyptians would not kill him. When they entered Egypt, the Pharaoh's officials praised Sarai's beauty to Pharaoh, and they took her into the palace and gave Abram goods in exchange. God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with plagues, which led Pharaoh to try to find out what was wrong. Upon discovering that Sarai was a married woman, Pharaoh demanded that Abram and Sarai leave.\n\n\nAbram and Lot separate\n\nWhen they lived for a while in the Negev after being banished from Egypt and came back to the Bethel and Ai area, Abram's and Lot's sizable herds occupied the same pastures. This became a problem for the herdsmen, who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict between them. Lot decided to go eastward to the plain of Jordan, where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoara, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward Sodom. Abram went south to Hebron and settled in the plain of Mamre, where he built another altar to worship God.\n\n\nChedorlaomer\n\nDuring the rebellion of the Jordan River cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, against Elam, Abram's nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading Elamite forces. The Elamite army came to collect the spoils of war, after having just defeated the king of Sodom's armies. Lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Sodom which made them a visible target.\nOne person who escaped capture came and told Abram what happened. Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram's force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the Battle of Siddim. When they caught up with them at Dan, Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King Chedorlaomer at Hobah, just north of Damascus. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken.\nUpon Abram's return, Sodom's king came out to meet with him in the Valley of Shaveh, the \"king's dale\". Also, Melchizedek king of Salem (Jerusalem), a priest of El Elyon, brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. Abram declined to accept anything other than the share to which his allies were entitled.\n\n\nCovenant of the pieces\n\nThe voice of the Lord came to Abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars. Abram and God made a covenant ceremony, and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt. God described to Abram the land that his offspring would claim: the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaims, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.\n\n\nHagar\n\nAbram and Sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations, because after 10 years of living in Canaan, no child had been born. Sarai then offered her Egyptian slave, Hagar, to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son.\nAfter Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Sarai responded by mistreating Hagar, and Hagar fled into the wilderness. An angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain on the way to Shur. He instructed her to return to Abram's camp and that her son would be \"a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.\" She was told to call her son Ishmael. Hagar then called God who spoke to her \"El-roi\", (\"Thou God seest me:\" KJV). From that day onward, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi, (\"The well of him that liveth and seeth me.\" KJV margin), located between Kadesh and Bered. She then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child. Abram was 86 years of age when Ishmael was born.\n\n\nSarah\nThirteen years later, when Abram was 99 years of age, God declared Abram's new name: \"Abraham\" – \"a father of many nations\". Abraham then received the instructions for the covenant of the pieces, of which circumcision was to be the sign.\nGod declared Sarai's new name: \"Sarah\", blessed her, and told Abraham, \"I will give thee a son also of her\". Abraham laughed, and \"said in his heart, 'Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear [a child]?'\" Immediately after Abraham's encounter with God, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and Ishmael (age 13), circumcised.\n\n\nThree visitors\n\nNot long afterward, during the heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order ash cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.\nOne of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.\n\n\nAbraham's plea\n\nAfter eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the 'cities of the plain' to discuss the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that \"if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?\" For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city.\nWhen the two visitors arrived in Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham's nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two \"men\" stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot's home and demanded that Lot bring out his guests so that they may \"know\" (v. 5) them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not \"known\" (v. 8) man to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lot's door to get to his male guests, thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.\nEarly the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he stood before God. He \"looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah\" and saw what became of the cities of the plain, where not even \"ten righteous\" (v. 18:32) had been found, as \"the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\"\n\n\nAbimelech\n\nAbraham settled between Kadesh and Shur in what the Bible anachronistically calls \"the land of the Philistines\". While he was living in Gerar, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King Abimelech had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.\nEarly next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: \"And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\" Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah.\nAfter living for some time in the land of the Philistines, Abimelech and Phicol, the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of Abraham's Well. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: Beersheba. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to Philistia, Abraham planted a tamarisk grove in Beersheba and called upon \"the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\"\n\n\nIsaac\nAs had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was \"an hundred years old\", when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, \"God hath made me to laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.\" Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac.\n\n\nIshmael\n\nIshmael was fourteen years old when Abraham's son Isaac was born to Sarah. When she found Ishmael teasing Isaac, Sarah told Abraham to send both Ishmael and Hagar away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that \"in Isaac shall seed be called to thee.\" He also said Ishmael would make a nation, \"because he is thy seed\".\nEarly the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread and water and sent them away. The two wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation, and will be \"living on his sword\". A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.\n\n\nBinding of Isaac\n\nAt some point in Isaac's youth, Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of Moriah. The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God told him of. He then commanded the servants to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone into the mount. Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied \"God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering\". Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by the angel of the Lord, and he saw behind him a \"ram caught in a thicket by his horns\", which he sacrificed instead of his son. The place was later named as Jehovah-jireh. For his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. After this event, Abraham went to Beersheba.\n\n\nLater years\n\nSarah died, and Abraham buried her in the Cave of the Patriarchs (the \"cave of Machpelah\"), near Hebron which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from Ephron the Hittite. After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a concubine named Keturah, by whom he had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. According to the Bible, reflecting the change of his name to \"Abraham\" meaning \"a father of many nations\", Abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the Bible, among others the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Edomites, Amalekites, Kenizzites, Midianites and Assyrians, and through his nephew Lot he was also related to the Moabites and Ammonites. Abraham lived to see Isaac marry Rebekah, and to see the birth of his twin grandsons Jacob and Esau. He died at age 175, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael.\n\n\nHistorical context\n\n\nHistoricity\n\nIn the early and middle 20th century, leading archaeologists such as William F. Albright and G. Ernest Wright and biblical scholars such as Albrecht Alt and John Bright believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the \"patriarchal age\", the 2nd millennium BCE. However, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in Thomas L. Thompson's The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives (1974), and John Van Seters' Abraham in History and Tradition (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were Iron Age creations. Van Seters' and Thompson's works were a paradigm shift in biblical scholarship and archaeology, which gradually led scholars to no longer consider the patriarchal narratives as historical. Some conservative scholars attempted to defend the Patriarchal narratives in the following years, but this has not found acceptance among scholars. By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had stopped trying to recover any context that would make Abraham, Isaac or Jacob credible historical figures.\n\n\nOrigins of the narrative\n\nAbraham's story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory (he is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Isaiah). As with Moses, Abraham's name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in the Book of Genesis no longer understands its original meaning, which is likely \"father is exalted\" – the meaning offered in Genesis 17:5, \"Father of a multitude\", is a folk etymology. At some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the Pentateuch; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the Persian period, roughly 520–320 BCE. The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown, but there are currently at least two hypotheses. The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that the Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for determining who would belong to the post-Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay \"elders\".\nThe completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions. In the Book of Ezekiel, written during the Exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century BCE), Ezekiel, an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe Torah. The Book of Isaiah similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the \"gôlâ\"), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham. The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., Ezra–Nehemiah), is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.\n\n\nAmorite origin hypothesis\nAccording to Nissim Amzallag, the Book of Genesis portrays Abraham as having an Amorite origin, arguing that the patriarch's provenance from the region of Harran as described in Genesis 11:31 associates him with the territory of the Amorite homeland. He also notes parallels between the biblical narrative and the Amorite migration into the Southern Levant in the 2nd millennium BCE. Likewise, some scholars like Daniel E. Fleming and Alice Mandell have argued that the biblical portrayal of the Patriarchs' lifestyle appears to reflect the Amorite culture of the 2nd millennium BCE as attested in texts from the ancient city-state of Mari, suggesting that the Genesis stories retain historical memories of the ancestral origins of some of the Israelites. Alan Millard argues that the name Abram is of Amorite origin and that it is attested in Mari as ʾabī-rām. He also suggests that the Patriarch's name corresponds to a form typical of the Middle Bronze Age and not of later periods.\n\n\nCanaanite origin hypothesis\nThe earliest possible reference to Abraham may be the name of a town in the Negev listed in the Bubastite Portal inscription of Pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak), which is referred as \"the Fortress of Abraham\", suggesting the possible existence of an Abraham tradition in the 10th century BCE. The orientalist Mario Liverani has proposed to see in the name Abraham the eponymous ancestor of a 13th-century BCE tribe, the Raham, mentioned in a stele of Seti I found at Beth-Shean and dating back to around 1289 BCE. The tribe probably lived in the area surrounding or close to Beth-Shean, in Galilee (the stele in fact refers to battles that took place in the area). Liverani hypothesized that the members of the tribe of Raham called themselves \"sons of Raham\" (*Banu-Raham), so that the name of their eponymous ancestor would have been \"father of Raham\" (*Abu-Raham), that being the name of the patriarch Abraham. Israel Finkelstein and Thomas Römer suggested that the oldest Abraham traditions originated in the Iron Age (monarchic period) and that they contained an autochthonous hero story, as the oldest biblical references to Abraham outside the book of Genesis (Ezekiel 33 and Isaiah 51) do not have an indication of a Mesopotamian origin of Abraham and present only two main themes of the Abraham narrative in Genesis—land and offspring. Finkelstein and Römer considered Abraham as ancestor who was worshiped in Hebron, with the oldest tradition of him possibly being about the altar he built in Hebron.\n\n\nReligious traditions\nAbraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Judaism, he is the founding father of the covenant, the special relationship between the Jewish people and God—leading to the belief that the Jews are the chosen people of God. In Christianity, Paul the Apostle taught that Abraham's faith in God—preceding the Mosaic law—made him the prototype of all believers, Jewish or gentile; and in Islam, he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad.\n\n\nJudaism\nIn Jewish tradition, Abraham is called Avraham Avinu (אברהם אבינו), \"our father Abraham\", signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, the first Jew. His story is read in the weekly Torah reading portions, predominantly in the parashot: Lech-Lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ), Vayeira (וַיֵּרָא), Chayei Sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת).\nHanan bar Rava taught in Abba Arikha's name that Abraham's mother was named ʾĂmatlaʾy bat Karnebo. Hiyya bar Abba taught that Abraham worked in Teraḥ's idol shop in his youth.\nIn Legends of the Jews, God created heaven and earth for the sake of the merits of Abraham. After the biblical flood, Abraham was the only one among the pious who solemnly swore never to forsake God, studied in the house of Noah and Shem to learn about the \"Ways of God\", and continued the line of High Priest from Noah and Shem, assigning the office to Levi and his seed forever. Before leaving his father's land, Abraham was miraculously saved from the fiery furnace of Nimrod following his brave action of breaking the idols of the Chaldeans into pieces. During his sojourning in Canaan, Abraham was accustomed to extend hospitality to travelers and strangers and taught how to praise God also knowledge of God to those who had received his kindness.\nAlong with Isaac and Jacob, he is the one whose name would appear united with God, as God in Judaism is called Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak, vEilohei Ya'akov (\"God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob\"). He was also mentioned as the father of thirty nations.\n\n\nMandaeism\nIn Mandaeism, Abraham (Classical Mandaic: ࡀࡁࡓࡀࡄࡉࡌ, romanized: Abrahim) is mentioned in Book 18 of the Right Ginza as the patriarch of the Jewish people. Mandaeans consider Abraham to have been originally a Mandaean priest, however they differ with Abraham and Jews regarding circumcision which they consider to be bodily mutilation and therefore forbidden.\n\n\nChristianity\n\nIn Christianity, Abraham is revered as the prophet to whom God chose to reveal himself and with whom God initiated a covenant (cf. Covenant Theology). Paul the Apostle declared that all who believe in Jesus (Christians) are \"included in the seed of Abraham and are inheritors of the promise made to Abraham.\" In Romans 4, Abraham is praised for his \"unwavering faith\" in God, which is tied into the concept of partakers of the covenant of grace being those \"who demonstrate faith in the saving power of Christ\".\nThroughout history, church leaders, following Paul, have emphasized Abraham as the spiritual father of all Christians. Augustine of Hippo declared that Christians are \"children (or \"seed\") of Abraham by faith\", Ambrose stated that \"by means of their faith Christians possess the promises made to Abraham\", and Martin Luther recalled Abraham as \"a paradigm of the man of faith.\"\nThe Roman Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination, calls Abraham \"our father in Faith\" in the Eucharistic prayer of the Roman Canon, recited during the Mass. He is also commemorated in the calendars of saints of several denominations: on 20 August by the Maronite Church, 28 August in the Coptic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East (with the full office for the latter), and on 9 October by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. In the introduction to his 15th-century translation of the Golden Legend's account of Abraham, William Caxton noted that this patriarch's life was read in church on Quinquagesima Sunday.\nHe is the patron saint of those in the hospitality industry. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as the \"Righteous Forefather Abraham\", with two feast days in its liturgical calendar. The first time is on 9 October (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 9 October falls on 22 October of the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is commemorated together with his nephew \"Righteous Lot\". The other is on the \"Sunday of the Forefathers\" (two Sundays before Christmas), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus. Abraham is also mentioned in the Divine Liturgy of Basil the Great, just before the Anaphora, and Abraham and Sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple. A popular hymn sung in many English-speaking Sunday Schools by children is known as \"Father Abraham\" and emphasizes the patriarch as the spiritual progenitor of Christians.\n\n\nIslam\n\nIslam regards ʾIbrāhīm (Abraham) as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad via ʾIsmāʿīl (Ishmael). Abraham is mentioned in 35 chapters of the Quran, more often than any other biblical personage apart from Moses. He is called both a hanif (monotheist) and muslim (one who submits), and Muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch, the archetype of the perfect Muslim, and the revered reformer of the Kaaba in Mecca. Islamic tradition considers Abraham the first \"pioneer of Islam\" (which is also called millat ʾIbrāhīm, the 'religion of Abraham'), and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the oneness of God. In Islam, Abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as Khalīlullāh, meaning 'Friend of God'. Besides Ishaq and Yaqub (Isaac and Jacob), Abraham is among the most excellent and honorable men in the view of God. He is also mentioned in Quran as the \"Father of Muslims\", and is put forward as a role model for the community.\n\n\nDruze faith\nThe Druze regard Abraham as the third spokesman (natiq) after Adam and Noah, who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (tawhid) intended for the larger audience. He is also among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history according to the Druze faith.\n\n\nBaháʼí Faith\nBaháʼís considered Abraham as a Manifestation of God, and as the originator of monotheistic religion. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá states that Abraham was born in Mesopotamia, and Bahá'u'lláh states that the language which Abraham spoke, when \"he crossed the Jordan\", is Hebrew ('Ibrání), so \"the language of the crossing.\" To ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the Abraham was born to a family that was ignorant of the oneness of God. Abraham opposed his own people and government, and even his own kin, he rejected all their gods, and, alone and single-handed, he withstood a powerful nation. These people believed not in one God but in many gods, to whom they ascribed miracles, and hence they all rose up against Abraham. No one supported him except his nephew Lot and \"one or two other individuals of no consequence\". At last the intensity of his enemies' opposition obliged him, utterly wronged, to forsake his native land. Abraham then came to \"these regions\", that is, to the Holy Land. To Bahá'u'lláh, the \"Voice of God\" commanded Abraham to offer up Ishmael as a sacrifice, so that his steadfastness in the faith of God and his detachment from all else but him may be demonstrated unto men. The purpose of God, moreover, was to sacrifice him as a ransom for the sins and iniquities of all the peoples of the earth.\nIn the Baháʼí texts, like the Islamic texts, Abraham is often referred to as \"the Friend of God\". 'Abdu'l-Bahá described Abraham as the founder of monotheism.\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá also suggested the \"holy manifestations who have been the sources or founders of the various religious systems\" were united and agreed in purpose and teaching, and the Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, the Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are one in \"spirit and reality\".\n\n\nArtistic depictions\n\n\nPainting and sculpture\n\nPaintings on the life of Abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: the sacrifice of Isaac; meeting Melchizedek; entertaining the three angels; Hagar in the desert; and a few others. Additionally, Martin O'Kane, a professor of Biblical Studies, writes that the parable of Lazarus resting in the \"Bosom of Abraham\", as described in the Gospel of Luke, became an iconic image in Christian works. According to O'Kane, artists often chose to divert from the common literary portrayal of Lazarus sitting next to Abraham at a banquet in Heaven and instead focus on the \"somewhat incongruous notion of Abraham, the most venerated of patriarchs, holding a naked and vulnerable child in his bosom\". Several artists have been inspired by the life of Abraham, including Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), Caravaggio (1573–1610), Donatello, Raphael, Philip van Dyck (Dutch painter, 1680–1753), and Claude Lorrain (French painter, 1600–1682). Rembrandt (Dutch, 1606–1669) created at least seven works on Abraham, Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) did several, Marc Chagall did at least five on Abraham, Gustave Doré (French illustrator, 1832–1883) did six, and James Tissot (French painter and illustrator, 1836–1902) did over twenty works on the subject.\nThe Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus depicts a set of biblical stories, including Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. These sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble Early Christian sarcophagus used for the burial of Junius Bassus. He died in 359. This sarcophagus has been described as \"probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture.\" The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under Old St. Peter's Basilica, was rediscovered in 1597, and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of St. Peter's Basilica) in the Vatican. The base is approximately 4 ft × 8 ft × 4 ft (1.2 m × 2.4 m × 1.2 m).\nGeorge Segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael. The human condition was central to his concerns, and Segal used the Old Testament as a source for his imagery. This sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father's tenderness, Sarah's rage, and Hagar's resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist's death in 2000.\n\n\nChristian iconography\n\nAbraham can sometimes be identified by the context of the image –  the meeting with Melchizedek, the three visitors, or the sacrifice of Isaac. In solo portraits a sword or knife may be used as his accessory, as in this statue by Giovanni Maria Morlaiter or this painting by Lorenzo Monaco.\nAs early as the beginning of the 3rd century, Christian art followed Christian typology in making the sacrifice of Isaac a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice on the cross, and its memorial in the sacrifice of the Mass. See for example this 11th-century Christian altar engraved with Abraham's and other sacrifices taken to prefigure that of Christ in the Eucharist.\n\nSome early Christian writers interpreted the three visitors as the triune God. Thus in Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, a 5th-century mosaic portrays only the visitors against a gold ground and puts semitransparent copies of them in the \"heavenly\" space above the scene. In Eastern Orthodox art, the visit is the chief means by which the Trinity is pictured (example). Some images do not include Abraham and Sarah, like Andrei Rublev's Trinity, which shows only the three visitors as beardless youths at a table.\n\n\nLiterature\nFear and Trembling (original Danish title: Frygt og Bæven) is an influential philosophical work by Søren Kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym Johannes de silentio (John the Silent). Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God asked him to sacrifice his son. W. G. Hardy's novel Father Abraham (1935) tells the fictionalized life story of Abraham. In her short story collection Sarah and After, Lynne Reid Banks tells the story of Abraham and Sarah, with an emphasis on Sarah's view of events.\n\n\nMusic\nIn 1681, Marc-Antoine Charpentier released a Dramatic motet (Oratorio), Sacrificim Abrahae H.402 – 402 a – 402 b, for soloists, chorus, doubling instruments and continuo. Sébastien de Brossard composed a cantata Abraham ou le sacrifice d'Isaac between 1703 and 1708.\nIn 1994, Steve Reich released an opera named The Cave. The title refers to the Cave of the Patriarchs. The narrative of the opera is based on the story of Abraham, and his immediate family, as it is recounted in religious texts, and understood by individuals from different cultures and religious traditions.\nThe eponymous track on Bob Dylan's 1965 album Highway 61 Revisited contains five stanzas, with someone in each describing an unusual problem that is ultimately resolved on Highway 61. In the first stanza, God tells Abraham to \"kill me a son\". God wants the killing done on Highway 61. Abram, the birth name of Abraham, is also the name of Dylan's father. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Highway 61 Revisited\" at number 364 in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\nAbraham smashes the idols\n\"Journey and Life of the Patriarch Abraham\", a map dating back to 1590",
    "summary": "Abraham (originally Abram) is the common Hebrew patriarch of the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Judaism, he is the founding father who began the covenantal relationship between the Jewish people and God; in Christianity, he is the spiritual progenitor of all believers, whether Jewish or non-Jewish; and in Islam, he is a link in the chain of Islamic prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad. Abraham is also revered in other Abrahamic religions such as the Baháʼí Faith and the Druze faith.\nThe story of the life of Abraham, as told in the narrative of the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible, revolves around the themes of posterity and land. He is said to have been called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land of Canaan, which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. This promise is subsequently inherited by Isaac, Abraham's son by his wife Sarah, while Isaac's half-brother Ishmael is also promised that he will be the founder of a great nation. Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin to earn his parents' approval. Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives \"all Abraham's goods\" while the other sons receive only \"gifts\".\nMost scholars view the patriarchal age, along with the Exodus and the period of the biblical judges, as a late literary construct that does not relate to any particular historical era. It is largely concluded that the Torah, the series of books that includes Genesis, was composed during the Persian period, as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their \"father Abraham\", and the returning exiles who based their counterclaim on Moses and the Exodus tradition of the Israelites.",

She wrote, directed and produced numerous films and documentaries such as The Invention of the Adolescence (1967) and The Legacy of Mary McEwan (1987) which were her most well known and significant films.\n\n\nBackground\nPatricia Watson was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on March 12, 1930. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts in History and Modern Languages from the University of Toronto From 1970-1987 Watson was married to film director Allan King, during this time she worked alongside Allan King, directing, producing and writing films that were watched throughout North America. Watson had two children, Sasha and Maggie King and one step daughter, Anna King. On February 13, 2015, due to declining health, Watson died.\n\n\nCareer\nWatson began her career at The National Film Board in Montreal, starting in the 1950s as a screenwriter. In the late 70s, with the help of her friend and producer, Babs Church, Watson created many documentaries on controversial topics such as immigration and adoption. In the film industry, she was known for her unique use of symbolism which was first noticed in her film The invention of the Adolescence, as described by Brian J. Lowe, \"In The Invention of the Adolescent (1967), [Patricia] Watson devised a clever argument based, in part, upon Philippe Ariès' popular history of the family, Centuries of Childhood (1962) and also upon her personal fascination with the chain-link fence surrounding school grounds as both a physical and metaphorical barrier -- a barrier that segregated children, adolescents in particular, from their historically 'normal' participation in adult social affairs.\"  Her films also stood out through her incorporation of feminism in many of her documentaries and her interesting ways of portraying characters, for example The Legacy of Mary McEwan is described in a review by John Hasslett Cuff, \"The most frustrating aspect of tonight's otherwise intriguing documentary about feminist psychiatrist Mary McEwan, is the absence of the woman herself. In the NFB production, The Legacy of Mary McEwan (Vision TV at 8 and 11), she appears only briefly at the beginning and near the end. This is not a criticism of producer/director Patricia Watson; the film is actually a testimonial to McEwan, who died in 1985. But the seven women interviewed, who were her patients and friends, speak with such emotion and affection and reveal so many tantalizing glimpses of this fascinating woman, that the viewer is curious to experience something of the paragon herself.\"  Aside from films, Watson also wrote the short story, My Husbands Wedding, and had some of her art work featured at the Heliconian Club.\n\n\nFilmography\nThe Purse (1966) - director, writer\nThe Summer we Moved to Elm Street (1966) - director, writer\nThe Invention of the Adolescence (1967) - director\nThe Admittance (1968) - director, writer\nWho Has Seen the Wind (1977) - writer\nThe Best Time of my Life: Portraits of Women in Mid-life (1985) - director, producer\nThe Legacy of Mary McEwan (1987) - director, producer\n\n\nAwards\n1969: International Children’s Film Festival, La Plata Argentina (For The Invention of the Adolescence)\n1969: The American Film and Video Festival, New York (For The Invention of the Adolescence)\n1970: International Educational Film Festival, Tehran, Iran (For The Invention of the Adolescence)\nGolden Reel Award (For Who Has Seen the Wind)\nGrand Prix at the Paris International Film Festival (For Who Has Seen the Wind)\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Perfectly Preserved is the second studio album by American Christian metal band Love and Death. The album was released on February 12, 2021 through Earache Records. This is the band's first album with current Breaking Benjamin and former Red guitarist Jasen Rauch on bass and Phinehas drummer Isaiah Perez.\n\n\nBackground and release\nLove and Death's debut album, Between Here & Lost, was released on January 22, 2013 through Tooth & Nail Records. Later that year Welch would rejoin his former band Korn and recorded his first album with that band in ten years, The Paradigm Shift. Love and Death would have sporadic activity over the next few years as Welch focused on his work with Korn. The band released the single \"Lo Lamento\" on March 15, 2016. Bassist Michael Valentine and drummer Dan Johnson would depart the band shortly after the single's release.\nAfter the release of \"Lo Lamento,\" Love and Death became inactive once again. In August 2019, Welch announced he was recruiting musicians such as Jasen Rauch and Lacey Sturm to appear on an album. The band announced on October 24, 2020 that it had signed with Earache Records and that a new album was planned to be released in 2021. The single \"Down\" was released on November 13, 2020 and introduced the band's new lineup. The song \"White Flag\" was released as a 3rd single on January 8, 2021. The song \"The Hunter\" was released as a 4th single on February 5, 2021.\nBefore the album's release, Welch stated that work on the album was able to move forward as the musicians' main projects were on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPerfectly Preserved was released on February 12, 2021.\n\n\nReception\n\nPerfectly Preserved received generally positive reviews upon release.\nMetal Hammer's Sophie Maughan praised JR Bareis's clean vocals, saying that they sound \"a lot more confident this time\" along with Welch's harsh vocals. Maughan also praised the band's ability to \"incorporate personal beliefs amongst huge, punchy hooks and pummelling riffs without coming across as overly preachy.\"\nJesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver praised the album, highlighting JR Bareis's increased involvement on the album, calling it a \"wise choice\" and gives the album a more youthful perspective that makes it more accessible. He stated that the album's more accessible sound doesn't come off as a negative and feels like a logical progression from Between Here and Lost. Weaver also praised the cover of \"Let Me Love You,\" calling it a \"great melodic rock song.\" Wall of Sound's Ricky Aarons also praised the album, saying the album will \"go down in history as something really special.\"\nA more mixed review came from James Hickie of Kerrang!, who said the album is more of the same from the band and called the cover of \"Let Me Love You\" a \"novelty blip.\" Hickie did praise the album's heavier moments and Welch's vocals.\nIn April 2021, the album was included on Metal Hammer's list of \"The Top 20 Best Albums of 2021 so Far.\" Perfectly Preserved was selected as the seventh best alternative metal album of 2021 by Metal Hammer.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nLove and Death\nBrian \"Head\" Welch – lead vocals, guitar\nGary \"JR\" Bareis – guitar, backing vocals on \"The Hunter\", co-lead vocals (1-6, 8-10), programming\nJasen Rauch – guitar, bass, programming\nIsaiah Perez – drums\n\n\nAdditional musicians\nJoe Rickard – programming\nKeith Wallen – lead vocals on \"The Hunter\", programming, additional vocals\nTom Hane – programming\nLacey Sturm – vocals on \"Let Me Love You\"\nRyan Hayes – vocals on \"White Flag\"\nJennea Welch – performing in \"Slow Fire\"\n\n\nProduction\nJasen Rauch - producer, engineering\nJoe Rickard - producer, engineering, mixing\nJoshua Sturm - engineering\nMike Warren - engineering\nLester Estelle - drum engineering\nPaul DeCarli - digital editing\nNiels Nielson - mastering\n\n\nTechnical\nKevin Moore (Mindreader) - Art Direction & Design\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Jorge Luján (born March 18, 1955) is a Panamanian who was a professional boxer and fought many top-flight boxers and several champions during the 1970s and 1980s. Luján is the former Lineal and WBA Bantamweight world champion. He was managed by Aurelio Cortez.\n\n\nProfessional boxing career\nLuján was born in Colon, and began his professional boxing career by knocking out one Baby San Blas III in one round on June 16, 1973, at Gimnasio Nuevo Panama (now Roberto Durán Arena).\nLuján proceeded with another first-round knockout, this one of a fighter named Tranquita Brown. He ran a record of 4-0 with 2 knockouts and then met future Guty Espadas world title challenger Alex Santana, 0-1 at the time. He defeated Santana on January 19, 1974 by a second-round knockout at Gimnasio Neco de la Guardia in Panama City.\nLuján then met Socrates Batoto, a boxer who had fought in seven countries and had challenged Betulio Gonzalez for his WBC world Flyweight title and who would later challenge Alfonso Zamora for his Lineal and WBA world Bantamweight title. Batoto was 15-3 with 6 knockouts. Luján knocked Batoto out in round six on July 20, 1974 at the Nuevo Panama gym.\nJorge Luján obtained three more wins, including one over 10-2-2 prospect John Cajina, before going against Reyes Arnal, who was 5-1-2 and who'd later on lose a close, 15 round split decision to Miguel Canto in a challenge for the Hall of Famer's WBC world Flyweight title. On June 21, 1975, Luján scored a fifth-round technical knockout win over Arnal.\nLuján kept winning, beating his five next opponents, including 18-3-1 Juanito Herrera (not the Juan Herrera who won the WBA world Flyweight title), before meeting Gilberto Illueca, who ten months before had lost to Zamora in a world title try. Luján and Illueca, 25-4, fought on May 14, 1977, with Luján losing his status as an undefeated boxer by a close, 10- round majority decision, the two judges who voted against Luján deeming him loser by only one point each.\nOn July 30, 1977, Luján boxed trial-horse Jaime Ricardo, 7-5-1 before their bout, and dispatched him with a seventh-round technical knockout victory. Now 16-1, Luján then had his first professional bout to be held abroad, when he traveled to Colombia to face the future Wilfredo Gómez world title challenger, Jose Cervantes, brother of Antonio \"Kid Pambele\" Cervantes, at Coliseo El Pueblo in Cali, on September 2, 1977. Luján suffered his second defeat in three fights when deemed points loser after ten rounds with Cervantes.\n\n\nWorld championship\nDespite having lost his previous bout to Cervantes, Luján received a world title try in his next bout, facing the hard-hitting and popular champion, Zamora, 29-1 with all 29 wins by knockout coming in. Despite being recognized as Lineal and WBA Bantamweight world champion, Zamora had also lost his last fight, a non-title affair to WBC world champion Carlos Zarate. On November 19, 1977, in what also constituted Luján's debut in the United States as a professional boxer at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California, Luján built a six-point lead in one judge's scorecard and four point leads in the other two scorecards before becoming world champion by knocking Zamora out in round ten.\n\n\nTitle defenses\nLuján was a busy champion, defending his title with success five times in the next three years, including an eleventh-round knockout of Mexico's Roberto Rubaldino at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas after Luján had been dropped in round one on Luján's birthday of March 18, 1978; a fifteen-round decision win over future world champion Alberto Davila at the Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana as part of the second Muhammad Ali-Leon Spinks fight's undercard on September 15, 1978; his Caesars Palace debut when he beat Cleo Garcia with a technical knockout at 2:29 of round fifteen on April 8, 1979; a rematch win against Roberto Rubaldino, this time stopped in round fifteen at the La Villa Real Convention Center in McAllen, Texas on October 6, 1979, and a ninth-round knockout win over challenger Shuichi Isogami at the Kuramae Kokugikan, Tokyo, Japan on April 2, 1980.\nOn August 29, 1980, Luján faced Puerto Rican challenger, undefeated Julian Solís, 20-0 at the time of their bout. Luján and Solís had a closely contested bout at the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida, but Luján lost his world championship to the Puerto Rican by a split fifteen-round decision. Puerto Rican judge Waldemar Schmidt gave Solís the fight by 144-142, and Panamanian judge Medardo Villalobos saw Luján win by 148-144. This left American judge (and also the fight's referee) Jimmy Rondeau, who scored it for Solís, 144-143.\n\n\nFurther championship attempts\nLuján quickly went about trying to regain his title or becoming a champion in another weight division. After Solís lost his title to Jeff Chandler, Luján challenged the new champion on January 31, 1981 at the Franklyn Plaza Hotel in the new champion's hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Luján and Chandler fought fifteen rounds, but Chandler won by a unanimous decision to retain the championship.\nOn August 15, 1981, Luján faced old nemesis Roberto Rubaldino, this time in a 10-round non-title affair. Rubaldino beat Luján by a ten-round majority decision at the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston, Texas.\nOnce again, despite coming off defeat-in this case, three losses in a row-the World Boxing Association gave Luján a chance at becoming a world champion for the second time when he was matched with Argentina's Sergio Palma for the latter's WBA recognized world Super Bantamweight title; on January 15, 1982, Palma and Luján boxed at Estadio Chateau Carreras in Cordoba, Argentina, and Palma won by a unanimous decision to retain the crown with scores of 143-139 by Stuart Winston, 145-141 by Carol Polis and 144-140 by Roberto Ramirez Sr.\nLuján took off eight months before his next fight, when he was outpointed by WBC world Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor, 48-5-1, in ten rounds at the Olympic Auditorium at Los Angeles, California, on September 23, 1982. This was  not a title fight; it was a preparation bout for Pintor who would later challenge Wilfredo Gómez for Gomez's WBC world Super Bantamweight championship, the Pintor-Luján bout held at the Super-Bantamweight division's weight; the winner of the bout to get a title chance at Gomez.\nThe Pintor fight marked Luján's fifth loss in a row. Luján started to regroup by boxing Javier Guido on November 13 at Panama City. This was a mismatch as Guido only had one victory in seven bouts. Luján won this bout by an eighth-round knockout.\nA more adequate opponent was Francisco Fernandez, reported to have a record of 10-3 when he and Luján squared off on December 18 at Panama City. Luján won this bout by ten rounds points decision, after recovering from an eighth round knockdown. Then, on May 14, 1983, Luján met Mario Miranda, who had just come off an unsuccessful bid for the vacant WBC world Featherweight championship versus Juan Laporte. Luján-Miranda was held at the Nuevo Panama Gym in Panama City and Luján earned a spot among the WBA's top ten Featherweights by outpointing the Colombian over ten rounds.\nAnother huge mismatch took place on November 26 of 1983 at the Nuevo Panama Gym when Luján, now fighting at Junior Lightweight, took on one Wilson Peraza, who was making his professional boxing debut versus the former world champion.\nLuján managed to post a ten-round unanimous decision win.\nLuján faced a more experienced rival on June 30, 1984, when he fought Colombia's former WBA world Super Bantamweight champion, Ricardo Cardona, who was 26-9-1 coming in. This bout was to determine WBA world Featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza's next opponent, and Luján won by scoring a tenth-round knockout over the Colombian.\nLuján's challenge of Pedroza was a major sporting event in Panama; world title fights between two Panamanians being so few in boxing history (Pedroza-Hector Carrasquilla was, in fact, the first boxing bout in history to pit two Panamanians for a world title). The bout was fought on February 2, 1985 at the Nuevo Panama Gym. The legendary Pedroza, later on inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame, was 37-3-1 and making the 19th defense of his world title. Luján won a few rounds on each judge's scorecards, but he was dropped in round fourteen and defeated by a unanimous decision, the three judges giving the fight to the champion by scores of 148-139, 147-140 and 146-141.\n\n\nLast bout\nLuján took off ten months after the Pedroza loss, and returned on December 14, 1985, to face local prospect Jose Marmolejo, who was 11-2 in 13 previous bouts. This fight was for the WBA Fedelatin Featherweight title and it was also held at the Nuevo Panama Gym. Luján was dropped in rounds six and ten and lost a unanimous twelve-round decision, prompting him to retire. Unlike many other famous boxers, Luján never attempted a comeback to professional boxing once retired; he had a record of 27 wins and 9 losses, with 16 wins by knockout; he was never knocked out himself.\n\n\nProfessional boxing record\n\n\nSee also\nList of world bantamweight boxing champions\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBoxing record for Jorge Luján from BoxRec (registration required)\nJorge Luján profile at Cyber Boxing Zone",

    "text": "The Pink Line (Line 7) is a metro rail line of the Delhi Metro, a rapid transit system in Delhi, India. It consists of 38 metro stations from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar, both in North Delhi.\nAt 59.24 kilometres (36.81 mi), the Pink Line is the longest individual line in the Delhi Metro and in India, exceeding the length of the operational Blue Line (excluding its branch line). It is mostly elevated and covers Delhi in a Circle. The Pink Line is also known as the Ring Road Line, as the line passes mostly alongside the Ring Road in Delhi.\nThe Pink Line has interchanges with most of the operational lines of the network, such as the Red Line at Netaji Subhash Place & Welcome, Yellow Line at Azadpur & Dilli Haat - INA, Green Line at Punjabi Bagh West, Blue Line at Rajouri Garden, Mayur Vihar Phase-I, Anand Vihar & Karkarduma, Dhaula Kuan of Airport Express (Orange Line) at Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus, Violet Line at Lajpat Nagar, as well as with Hazrat Nizamuddin and Anand Vihar Terminal (Indian Railways / Namo Bharat) and the ISBTs at Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan.\nThe Pink Line has the highest point of the Delhi Metro at Dhaula Kuan with a height of 23.6 metres (77 ft), passing over the Dhaula Kuan grade separator flyovers and the Airport Express Line. It also possesses the country's smallest metro station, Ashram, with a size of just 151.6 metres (497 ft) against the usual 265 metres (869 ft). The usual platform length for a six-coach train on this route is 140 metres (459 ft) but it has been reduced to 135 metres (443 ft) in the Ashram station.\nAs of September 2025, main services run between Majlis Park and Maujpur-Babarpur. The further route towards Shiv Vihar acts as a feeder line with separate services, for which passengers have to change platforms. This is because the line will be extended from Maujpur - Babarpur to Majlis Park via areas in North Delhi, effectively creating a circular metro which would be one of the world's longest circular railway lines. Once it happens, trains will run in anti-clockwise and clockwise directions in the main loop. Construction is complete, although full service trials on the whole circular route are being done since August 2025.\n\n\nHistory\nThe line was initially put on table as a metro route that would run almost along the Delhi's busy Ring Road, on the lines of the existing Delhi Circular Railway. A route length of 59.24 kilometres (36.81 mi) was proposed from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar, that would cut through all the existing lines at various interchanges as part of Phase 3's expansion plans. There are 38 stations in the Pink Line, out of which 26 are elevated and 12 are underground.\nThe line was opened in stages from 2018 to 2021. The first section on the Pink Line become operational from 14 March 2018 between Majlis Park to Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus, it was then extended to Lajpat Nagar on 6 August 2018. A separate section between Shiv Vihar to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake was opened on 31 October 2018 and the initial section was extended to Mayur Vihar Pocket I on 31 December 2018.\nThe section between Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake and Mayur Vihar Pocket I was not completed as construction of a 1.5 km (0.93 mi) viaduct began late due to land acquisition issues at Trilokpuri. This had rendered the Pink Line into two independent lines and forced DMRC to convert the Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 station into a terminating station with reversal facilities so that trains from Majlis Park would terminate there. On the eastern section, trains would run in separate loops - Shiv Vihar to Maujpur-Babarpur, Maujpur-Babarpur to IP Extension/Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake. Every third train from Maujpur-Babarpur would move beyond IP Extension to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake as the latter has no reversal facilities and single line movement took place in that section. Both disjoint sections were finally bridged on 6 August 2021.\nIn December 2024, trial runs were initiated on the Phase 4 extension from Majlis Park to Jagatpur Village stations which were gradually done till Sonia Vihar and finally Maujpur-Babarpur by August 2025.  \n\n\nStations\n\nThe stations of the Pink Line are: \n\n\nTrain Info\n\n\nPlanned extension\n\nGokulpuri-Hindon Airport-Arthala Pink Line Extension: In September 2024, the DMRC proposed a branch of 13 km from Trans-Yamuna North-East Delhi (existing Gokulpuri metro station of Pink Line) to the west Ghaziabad (existing Arthala metro station of Red Line) via Hindon Airport connecting 2 existing Red Line metro stations with 10 new Pink Line stations namely Gol Chakkar, DLF, Shalimar Garden, Hindon Airport, Bhopura, Tulsi Niketan, Rajendra Nagar, New Karhaira Colony, Karhaira, and Loni Road Industrial Area.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Delhi Metro stations\nTransport in Delhi\nDelhi Metro Rail Corporation\nDelhi Suburban Railway\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nDelhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=49194102",
    "text": "The Villa Strohl Fern is a semi-urban Neo-Gothic-style, palace, or casino, and gardens erected in the late 19th century on the grounds of the Villa Borghese in Rome. It is known for having housed and provided studios for dozens of prominent artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Entrances to the site, when open, are from Piazzale Flaminio, Avenue Madame Letizia, and across from the Villa Poniatowski, part of the National Etruscan Museum.\n\n\nHistory\nThe aristocratic Alsatian Alfred Wilhelm Strohl (1847–1927) was exiled from his native land soon after the German occupation in 1870. By 1879, he had purchased a substantial plot of land at the site, and built the main villa, and additional housing and studio facilities, and organized the gardens at the site. Strohl also designed the casino and gave it the name by adding the adjective \"fern\" (far away) to Strohl, to emphasize his exile.\nThe park contains odd elements such as cement trees, fountains adorned with stalactites, grottoes, covered bridges between sections of land at different levels, and an artificial pond with a cement boat on its bank.\nThe property is best remembered for the diverse artistic community that Strohl gathered there, at small chalets in the park. Among the many artists who stayed at the site were Nicola D’Antino; Bruno Barilli; Alfredo Biagini; Amedeo Bocchi; Arnold Bocklin; Anton Giulio Bragaglia; Renato Brozzi; Ercole Drei;  Emil Fuchs and his mistress, the painter Barbara Leoni; Vincenzo Gemito; Baldomer Gili i Roig; John William Godward; Virgilio Guidi; Carlo Levi; Arturo Martini; Umberto Moggioli; Ludwig Nick; Cipriano Efisio Oppo; Ilya Repin; the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and his wife in 1903–1904; Ottilie Reylaender; the sculptor Clara Westhoff; Aleardo Terzi; Francesco and his son Antonello Trombadori; and Mikhail Alexandrovich Vrubel.\n\nAfter his death in 1927, Strohl was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, near the Pyramid of Cestius; and the property was willed to the French Government with a number of restrictions, including on the maintenance of the structures and purpose. In 1957 transferred it to the Lycée Chateaubriand.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Legislature II of Italy (Italian: II Legislatura della Repubblica Italiana) was the 2nd legislature of the Italian Republic, and lasted from 25 June 1953 until 11 June 1958. Its composition was the one resulting from the general election of 7 June 1953.\n\n\nMain chronology\nThe election was characterized by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a superbonus of two thirds of seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the coalition which would obtain at-large the absolute majority of votes. The change was hugely opposed by the opposition parties as well as the smaller DC coalition partners, which had no realistic chances of success. The new law was called Scam Law by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial landslide to the DC.\nThe complaint campaign of the oppositions against the Scam Law reached its goal. The Centrist coalition (DC, PSDI, PLI, PRI) won 49.9% of the national vote, coming just a few thousand votes short of the threshold for a two-thirds majority. Instead, the election resulted in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Minor dissident parties resulted determinant for the final result, especially the short-lived National Democratic Alliance (ADN). Technically, the government won the election, with a clear working majority of seats in both houses. But frustration at the failure to garner the expected supermajority caused big problems for the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign and the legislature continued with many weak governments, with minor parties refusing institutional responsibilities. Because of the extreme governmental instability and the consequent absence of considerable reforms proposed by the government, the legislature was later defined by some historians \"the lost legislature\".\nAfter De Gasperi lost the support of the Parliament, Giuseppe Pella rose to power, but fell after five months only, following strong disputes about the status of the Free Territory of Trieste which Pella was claiming. Amintore Fanfani not receiving a vote of confidence, Mario Scelba and Antonio Segni followed with more traditional centrist coalitions supported by PSDI and PLI: under the administration of the first one, the problem of Trieste was closed ceding Koper to Yugoslavia. The parliamentary term was closed by the minority government chaired by Adone Zoli, finishing a legislature which hugely weakened the office of the Prime Minister, held by six different rulers. Zoli himself governed for more than one year as a care-taker Prime Minister, after having resigned when the neo-fascist MSI resulted decisive in the government's investiture confidence vote. Zoli remained in office after being invited by President Gronchi to govern until the natural dissolution of the legislature in 1958.\n\n\nPresidential election\nOn 28 April 1955 the Parliament met to elect the second President of Italy. On 29 April 1955 the President of the Chamber of Deputies Giovanni Gronchi was elected on the fourth ballot with 658 votes out of 843.\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\nParliamentary composition\n\n\nChamber of Deputies\n\nPresident:\nGiovanni Gronchi (DC), elected on 25 June 1953 and resigned on 29 April 1955;\nGiovanni Leone (DC), elected on 10 May 1955.\nVice Presidents: Giovanni Leone (DC, until 10 May 1955), Gaetano Martino (PLI, until 10 February 1954), Cino Macrelli (Ind, from 5 March 1954), Edoardo D'Onofrio (PCI), Ferdinando Targetti (PSI), Giuseppe Rapelli (DC, from 27 September 1955)\n\n\nSenate of the Republic\n\nPresident: Cesare Merzagora (Ind), elected on 25 June 1953\nVice Presidents: Michele De Pietro (DC, until 17 January 1954 and then from 4 July 1957), Giorgio Bo (DC, until 18 May 1957), Mauro Scoccimarro (PCI), Enrico Molé (PSDI), Mario Cingolani (DC, from 24 February 1954)\n\n\nSenators for Life\n\n\nReferences",

The village was founded in 1758, by order of the king to colonize the Warta valley. Initially, the name, Neu Borkow (Nowy Borek), referred to the nearby, old village of Borek. Then, to celebrate the commander of the dragon regiment of Gorzów, Lieutenant General Ernst Heinrich Freiherr von Czetteritz, the name was changed to Gross Czettritz. In 1767 the neighboring colony Klein Czettritz was founded. Both villages were united in 1929.

    "text": "KXLT-TV (channel 47) is a television station in Rochester, Minnesota, United States, serving as the Fox affiliate for Southeast Minnesota and Northern Iowa. It is owned by Gray Media alongside NBC/CW+ affiliate KTTC (channel 10). The two stations share studios in Rochester on Bandel Road Northwest along US 52. KXLT-TV's transmitter is located in Grand Meadow Township, Minnesota, with a translator in Mason City, Iowa.\nChannel 47 was originally a satellite station of KXLI in St. Cloud, Minnesota, a regional independent station and later an outlet for the Star Television Network, home shopping, and infomercials. Shockley Communications purchased KXLT in 1997 and relaunched it as a Fox affiliate for southern Minnesota. KTTC assumed KXLT's operations in 2001 when the remainder of Shockley was acquired by Quincy Media, adding a local newscast to channel 47's schedule, with KXLT remaining under separate ownership until 2025.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nKXLI satellite\nKXLT signed-on for the first time on August 13, 1987, as a full-time satellite of St. Cloud–based independent outlet KXLI. It was the market's first independent station, as well as the area's first new commercial station in 33 years. Its programming consisted mostly of low-budget syndicated fare and cartoons, though for a time it also aired Minnesota North Stars hockey. However, it found the going difficult, not in the least because KMSP-TV and WFTC, two independent stations from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, were both already available on cable.\nKXLI and KXLT were owned by Halcomm Inc. with its majority stockholder and president Dale W. Lang, chairman of magazine publisher Lang Communications Inc. Lang attempted with partners to create the \"Minnesota Independent Network\" (MIN) with 11 stations, but never got past planning and initial work.\nLang also made a $9.6 million loan to Halcomm. The station closed down in December 1988, with Lang calling the loan in 1989 and taking possession of the stations.\nIn 1989, Lang became the primary investor in a new television network, the Star Television Network, which featured four hours of infomercials and eight hours of classic programming under the TV Heaven banner. KXLT returned on September 29, 1990, again simulcasting KXLI programming as an owned and operated Star station, with both stations on the air 22 hours a day. Following the closure of Star in January 1991, KXLI and KXLT implemented a schedule of infomercials, religious programming, and the Home Shopping Network.\nAs a KXLI satellite, KXLT operated at lower-than-licensed power due to KXLI's financial problems. KXLI and KXLT were sold to Paxson Communications in 1996, which converted both stations to an all-infomercial format under Paxson's \"inTV\" network. In 1997, Paxson decided to sell KXLT to raise money to launch the Pax network (today's Ion Television). Late that year, Shockley Communications purchased KXLT.\n\n\nFox affiliate\nOn January 19, 1998, Shockley relaunched the station as a Fox affiliate. Previously, cable systems on the Minnesota side of the market carried WFTC (and before it KMSP), while those on the Iowa side carried KDSM-TV from Des Moines. Shockley instantly invested in the station, upgrading it to full power operations and moving to new studios in November of that year. On November 1, 1998, in partnership with The WB, KXLT established a cable-only affiliate of the network. Known by the faux calls \"KWBR\", the station was programmed by the national The WB 100+ service, but local promotion and advertising sales were handled by KXLT.\nIn 2001, Shockley Communications was bought by Quincy Newspapers, owner of KTTC. However, Quincy could not buy KXLT due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules governing duopolies. The FCC does not allow two of the four highest-rated stations to be owned by one company. Additionally, Rochester–Austin–Mason City has only six full-power stations, not enough to legally permit a duopoly in any case. Nevertheless, Quincy took over KXLT's operations under a shared services agreement. As part of the arrangement, Quincy provided all technical support, promotions, commercial production, and master control for KXLT. Shockley would later sell the station to SagamoreHill Broadcasting in 2005.\nIn September 2006, The WB and UPN merged to create The CW. KTTC subsequently established a new second digital subchannel to offer The CW through The CW Plus, a similar national programming service to The WB 100+. At that point, the \"KWBR\" operation was shut down. KXLT has been digital-only since February 17, 2009, with it remaining on-air for a few more days airing \"nightlight\" service. KXLT's digital facility on channel 46 has been fully operational since 2004 until 2018, when the station relocated to channel 26 in the repack.\nOn January 9, 2025, Gray Media, which assumed the KXLT SSA through its purchase of Quincy Media, announced it would buy the station outright for $490,000. Gray applied for a failing station waiver. The sale was completed on March 21.\n\n\nNews operation\n\nThrough a news share agreement in place since 2001, KTTC produces a half-hour prime time newscast on KXLT seen Sunday through Friday nights. Known as Fox 47 News at Nine, the program originates from a secondary set at the Bandel Road Northwest studios. It features a unique graphics package and news music theme that is different from KTTC. KXLT uses most of the NBC outlet's on-air personnel, but maintains separate news anchors who can report for KTTC.\nAt some point in 2009, CBS affiliate KIMT (channel 3) added the market's second prime time local news show at 9 to its MyNetworkTV-affiliated second digital subchannel. This newscast could be seen for thirty minutes, competing with KXLT's broadcast. Eventually, the effort would be reduced to a five-minute weather cut-in featuring an updated forecast. On March 21, 2011, a day after KTTC performed an upgrade to high definition news production, KXLT completed the switch. With the change to HD came an updated set of graphics (still separate from the NBC station). \nOn July 28, 2014, KXLT debuted a weekday morning show known as Fox in the Morning (that is produced by KTTC). Airing for thirty minutes at 8 a.m., the program is formatted with news, weather, local features, and entertainment segments. Fox in the Morning is the area's only 8 a.m. newscast. Nicholas Quallich, anchor, and Ted Schmidt, meteorologist, have been with the show since its summer 2014 premiere. In June 2015, Tori Bokios, who joined channel 47 in January 2015, became the anchor of Fox 47 News at Nine. Amanda Hari is the newest member of the morning show, arriving in September 2015, replacing Bokios. In December 2016, Quallich left KXLT, leaving Hari and Schmidt to handle the morning news. Earlier in 2016, chief meteorologist Randy Brock left his post and went on to pursue a career in real estate. He said that part of his decision was to spend more time with his family.\nOn September 27, 2019, Fox in the Morning broadcast its last show, with anchor Jack Keenan and meteorologist Ted Schmidt. The 30-minute slot for the morning was used to expand Fox 47 News at Nine to a one-hour broadcast in January 2020, anchored by Maddy Wierus and chief meteorologist Nick Jansen.\nThe evening program on KXLT maintains its own graphics scheme and separate anchors from KTTC (except for weather segments), though the KTTC anchors do substitute when necessary. The NBC outlet also maintains an Austin bureau, within the Riverland Community College campus, on 8th Avenue Northwest.\n\n\nSubchannels\nKXLT-TV's transmitter is located in Grand Meadow Township, Minnesota. Since October 2025, the station is also rebroadcast by K30QY-D at Mason City, Iowa.

    "text": "Gato Fedorento (pronounced [ˈɡatu fɨðuˈɾẽtu]; \"Smelly Cat\") is a Portuguese surreal comedy group, known for their subjective and absurd satire centering both on the Portuguese language and the Portuguese social reality. The group is composed of the four comedians José Diogo Quintela, Miguel Góis, Ricardo Araújo Pereira and Tiago Dores. They started their comedy careers as screenwriters, writing for other comedians, which later developed into their own television shows, radio programs, a talk show and several advertising campaigns. They have been credited with introducing and popularizing the surreal humour genre in Portugal and are one of the most important influences in the modern Portuguese comedy. Their humour is heavily influenced by Monty Python.\nGato Fedorento, their homonym television show, ran for nine seasons. In its original unique surreal humour, the group is known for overusing Portuguese idioms, especially in indirect speech, within current discourse on their sketches, turning apparently objective quotidian situations into subjective and often illogical ones. Season names during the first four seasons were meant to satirically represent typical Portuguese surnames and are used as a last name for every single character in every episode of the show within their respective seasons. They also use satirical fictional city names that sound like realistic traditional Portuguese villages, often by including altered forms of Portuguese slang, in the same fashion as in the case of the surnames that give the name to the different seasons.\nCurrently, they have an exclusivity advertisement agreement with Portugal Telecom of unspecified duration, that spans multiple mediums, being the brand ambassadors.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe four screenwriters worked at the Portuguese production company Produções Fictícias, where they worked with some of the big names in the Portuguese comedy, like Herman José and Maria Rueff.\nIn 2002, they started delivering their own material in the show O Perfeito Anormal (The Perfect Dork) on SIC Radical. Their success in that role led the then director of SIC Radical, Francisco Penim, to invite them to create their own show.\nMeanwhile, in 2003, they created an homonym weblog where they regularly presented some of their material. When they were deciding how to name the group, they chose it after the song \"Smelly Cat\", from the soundtrack of Friends, which translates as \"Gato Fedorento\" in Portuguese. In the same year, Gato Fedorento, their homonym television show, premiered on SIC Radical, running for three seasons, the Fonseca Series, the Meireles Series and the Barbosa Series (from 2 May 2005). This last season was known for having a decline in quality, as well as repeating the same formula for certain sketches in several successive episodes.\nThe series made it to terrestrial television in July 2005, when the first season was broadcast on SIC. In December 2005, the group signed a contract with RTP for two years.\nIn 2006, after moving their show to RTP1, the fourth season, Lopes da Silva, premiered with moderate success. As stipulated in the contract (26 episodes during 2006), the first 13 episodes (the fourth season) followed the traditional sketch format from the previous seasons. The fifth season, titled Diz que é uma Espécie de Magazine (lit. It's a sort of talk show), a talk show with live audience, brought a significant change in the show's format, with sketches now spoofing current events and news, instead of relying on subjective and surreal gags. In this new format, they also do impressions of Portuguese politicians and celebrities, mostly played by Ricardo Araújo Pereira, with the most spoofed being José Sócrates, Valentim Loureiro, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Paulo Bento. The sixth and seventh seasons were the last television shows made by Gato Fedorento on RTP1.\nAfter returning to SIC in 2008, now on the flagship channel, the group kept the new format and made their eighth season, Zé Carlos. Their ninth and last season, Gato Fedorento Esmiúça Os Sufrágios, ran for 30 episodes, broadcast live from Monday to Friday, covering the 2009 Portuguese elections, featuring guests from the world of politics.\nThe group has released a DVD with the Fonseca season and performed live all over Portugal, being a huge success and breaking all DVD sale records in the country. In late 2005, they released another DVD with the Meireles season. The first three seasons still aired on SIC Radical, as reruns.\nWith the end of Gato Fedorento Esmiúça os Sufrágios in October 2009, the group announced that they would no longer make daily news-based formats.\nGato Fedorento were Portugal Telecom's brand ambassadors from 2006 to 2016. They have an exclusivity advertisement agreement of unspecified duration, that spans multiple mediums, including TV, radio, press, Internet and billboards, featuring a sketch-like comedy similar to their television programs.\n\n\nSee also\nSmelly Cat\nMonty Python\n\n\nReferences",

After the Sicilian Wars began with the Punic invasion in the sixth century BC, part of them retreated to the mountainous interior of the island, from which they opposed the foreign rule for centuries.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nMythological origins\nAccording to the legend recorded by Greek historians, the etymology of their name (Iolaes) is to be traced back to Iolaus, the hero who led the Thespiades, sons of Heracles and the daughters of Thespius (king of the Boeotian city-state of Thespiae) in Sardinia, where he founded a colony. Another myth tell that the old inhabitants of Ilium, better known as Troy, after the fall of the city established themselves in this part of Sardinia (where they mixed with the Iolaes), hence the name of Ilienses. Pomponius Mela considered the Ilienses as the oldest people of the island.\n\nA fourth component part of the population was the army of Iolaus, consisting of Thespians and men from Attica, which put in at Sardinia and founded Olbia [...] Be this as it may, there are still today places in Sardinia called Iolaia, and Iolaus is worshipped by the inhabitants.[...] When Troy was taken, among those Trojans who fled were those who escaped with Aeneas. A part of them, carried from their course by winds, reached Sardinia and intermarried with the Greeks already settled there (Iolaes). But the non-Greek element (Balares ?) were prevented from coming to blows with the Greeks and Trojans, for the two enemies were evenly matched in all warlike equipment, while the river Thorsus (Tirso), flowing between their territories, made both equally afraid to cross it..\n \n\n\nNuragic period\nDespite the myth, they were most likely a tribal group indigenous to the island. According to the archaeologist Giovanni Ugas, the Ilienses were the most important population of Nuragic Sardinia and were connected with the Sherden, one of the Sea Peoples widely cited in Ancient Egyptian sources. This hypothesis has been, however, opposed by other archaeologists and historians.\nEduardo Blasco Ferrer correlates their name with the Iberian root *ili-, meaning settlement. In the nuragic period their territory extended from the plain of Campidano (called in antiquity Iolean plain) to the Tirso river in north where began the territory of the Balares. They were probably divided into 40 tribes, each ruled by a king or chieftain. These rulers lived in the complex nuraghi, called \"polilobates\", such as Su Nuraxi of Barumini.\nIn what was once their territory, very important are the findings of Mycenaean artifacts, confirming the wealth of exchanges between these two ancient populations. Of particular interest are also the Oxhide ingot, which perhaps came from Cyprus and was discovered in various locations, including the Cagliari area, in the province of Ogliastra and other central areas. Between 1300 and 1200 BC in central-southern Sardinia was produced a kind of gray pottery also called \"gray Sardinian\"; remains of this type of pottery have been found in Kommos, Crete, and at Cannatello near Agrigento, Sicily.\n\n\nPunic and Roman period\nAs witnessed by the ancient sources (Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica and Pausanias, Description of Greece) since the sixth century BC this population opposed fiercely to the domination of Carthage.\n\nWhen the Carthaginians were at the height of their sea power, they overcame all in Sardinia except the Ilians (Ilienses) and Corsicans, who were kept from slavery by the strength of the mountains. \nAfter the end of the First Punic War in 238 BC the Romans occupied the main strongholds of the Punic Sardinia, but the people of the interior opposed even to the new invaders.\nIn 227 BC, Corsica and Sardinia became the second Roman province (the first was Sicily). The outbreak of the Second Punic War and the victories of Hannibal in the Italian Peninsula provoked new stirrings of rebellion in Sardinia where, after the Roman defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Sardinian-Punic landowner and military Hampsicora, helped by the Carthaginians and by Ilienses, organized a new uprising. In 215 BC the rebels were defeated and massacred in the battle of Decimomannu by Titus Manlius Torquatus and so Carthage lost the island definitively.\nIn Roman times the Ilienses and the Balares of the interior continued to resist, but in 177 BC they were heavily defeated by the consul Tiberius Gracchus who killed or enslaved about 80,000 Sardinians. However still in imperial time they were not completely subjugated by Rome and continued to live relatively independently in the central region called Barbagia.\n\n\nIlienses / Iolaes tribes (Iolei)\nSource:\n\nAcconites (Acconiti)\nAechilenenses / Aichilenses (Aichilensi) / Cornenses / Cornenses Pelliti\nAesaronenses / Aisaronenses (Esanorensi)\nAlcitani (Alkitani)\nAlticientes (Altikientes) / Altic(ienses)\nBarbaricini (Barbarikini) (in the region later known as Barbagia)\nBeronicenses (Beronikenses) (Beronicensi)\nBulgares (Ilienses Bulgares)\nCampani (Patulcenses Campani)\nCaralitani (Carales, today's Cagliari, was in their territory)\nCarenses, they dwelt south of the Coracenses and north of the Salcitani and the Lucuidonenses.\nCeles(itani) / Celsitani, they dwelt south of the Rucensi and north of the Scapitani and the Siculensi.\nCorpicenses, they dwelt south of the Rucensi and north of the Scapitani and the Siculensi.\nCunusitani / Cusin(itani), they dwelt south of the Coracenses and north of the Salcitani and the Lucuidonenses.\nEuthychiani (Euthicani) (they were not a tribe of the Balares)\nFifenses\nGalillenses (Galillesi)\nHypsitani\nIlienses (Ilienses Proprii) / Iolei (Iolei Proprii) / Pelliti / Sardi Pelliti\nLesitani\nMaltamonenses\nMartenses\nMauri (Paleo-Sardinian tribe) (Mauri Ilienses), in an area of far southwestern Sardinia (they may have been a tribe related to or of Mauri origin that was assimilated by the Ilienses (Iolei))\nModdol(...)\nMuthon(enses)\nNeapolitani, they dwelt north of the Sulcitani and the Noritani.\nNoritani / Norenses, they dwelt at the extreme south part of the island, immediately south of the Neapolitani and the Valentini (not to be confused with the Nurritani or Nurrenses)\nNurrenses (Nurensi) (not to be confused with the Norenses or Noritani)\nParati\nPatulcenses (not to be confused with the Patulcii or Patulci)\nPatulcii / Patulci (not to be confused with the Patulcenses)\nRubrenses / Rubri / Rubrinses\nRucenses (Rucensi), they dwelt south of the Æchilenenses (also called Cornenses) and north of the Celsitani and the Corpicenses\nSalcitani (Salkitani), they dwelt south of the Carenses and the Cunusitani and north of the Æsaronenses.\nSarrapitani\nScapitani, they dwelt south of the Celsitani and the Corpicenses and north of the Neapolitani and the Valentini\nSemilitenses (Semilitensi) / Maltamonenses (Maltamonensi)\nSiculenses (Siculesi), they dwelt south of the Celsitani and the Corpicenses and north of the Neapolitani and the Valentini.
