    "text": "Angel City Football Club is an American professional soccer team based in Los Angeles, California, that competes in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). The formation of the team was announced on July 21, 2020; it began play in the 2022 season. The team plays its home games at BMO Stadium.\nAngel City FC is the Los Angeles area's first women's professional soccer team since the Los Angeles Sol of Women's Professional Soccer folded in 2010. The team has many high-profile owners, including Lilly Singh, Natalie Portman, America Ferrera, Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, and Eva Longoria.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOn July 21, 2020, the NWSL announced that Los Angeles would be awarded an expansion franchise for the 2022 season. The team was announced with a majority female ownership group led by actress Natalie Portman, venture capitalist Kara Nortman, entrepreneur Julie Uhrman, and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Ohanian also represents the club on the league's board of governors. Other founding members of the team included professional tennis player Serena Williams, actors Uzo Aduba, Jessica Chastain, America Ferrera, Jennifer Garner, and Eva Longoria, late night talk show host and YouTuber Lilly Singh, YouTuber Casey Neistat, Broadway producer Jenna Segal, and former members of the United States national team including Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Rachel Van Hollebeke, Shannon Boxx, Amanda Cromwell, Lorrie Fair, Ronnie Fair, Joy Fawcett, Angela Hucles, Shannon MacMillan, Tisha Venturini, Saskia Webber, Lauren Holiday, and Abby Wambach.\nIt was also announced during the team's launch that they would be announcing their official name before the end of the year but were going to use 'Angel City' as a tentative nickname. The team was also in discussions with various groups for a stadium agreement, including the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer.\nIn the time since the club's name was confirmed as Angel City FC on October 21, 2020, additional members of the ownership group were announced, among them tennis great Billie Jean King, former tennis player and current tennis administrator Ilana Kloss, WNBA star Candace Parker, NHL star P. K. Subban, actress and activist Sophia Bush, Latin pop star Becky G, actor and TV host James Corden, former U.S. men's international soccer star Cobi Jones, NFL offensive lineman Ryan Kalil, and actor Uzo Aduba.\nAngel City FC hosted Mexican club Tigres UANL Femenil in the club's first-ever International Friendly match in August 2022, which Angel City FC won 1-0. The first edition of the Copa Angelina on September 5, 2022 saw Angel City FC fall 2-0 to the Mexico women's national team off a goal by Scarlett Camberos and an own goal. \nA three-part documentary chronicling the team's first season entitled Angel City was released in May 2023 on HBO.\nAngel City FC qualified for their first-ever playoff berth in 2023, losing to OL Reign on October 20, 2023.\nAhead of the 2024 season, it was reported that the four primary owners of the club had voted to have investment firm Moelis & Company seek a new owner and investor that would assume control of Angel City’s board for a reported valuation of $180 million.\nIn July 2024, it was reported that the CEO of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger, and his wife, Willow Bay, were close to purchasing Angel City FC's franchise, with the intention of becoming the team’s majority shareholder for upwards of $250 million. The deal was officially announced by the club on July 17, 2024, with Iger and Bay investing $50 million into the club to become the majority shareholders, the $250 million valuation made Angel City the most valuable women's sport team in the world. Portman, Uhrman, Ohanian and Gillian Berry will continue to serve on the club's board.\n\n\nColors and crest\nAngel City FC's official colors are \"asphalt\" and \"armor\" with \"sol rosa\" as an accent color, a pink-tinted hue unique to the club.\nOn June 30, 2021, the club revealed its crest featuring an angel with wings inspired by the Southern California red-tailed hawk and shaped to mimic the area's palm trees, with the top of the crest sloping at a 22-degree angle to represent their 2022 entry into the league. The crest was designed by Amedea Tassinari.\nThe club collaborated with supporters in the design of the colors, crest, and kit to ensure the club represented Los Angeles.\nIn October 2021, Angel City pre-emptively retired shirt number 22 to recognize its founding year and the number of players on the pitch during matches. The team sells shirts bearing the number 22 and donates 10 percent of revenue through a charitable program managed by the California Community Foundation.\nOn November 17, 2021, the club unveiled a black primary kit made of recycled materials called 'Dawn'. The kit's design features hints of sol rosa, an art deco pattern, and the team's motto \"Volemos\" above player names. Angel's City's first away kit, called 'Daylight', which was only used in their 2022 inaugural season, was unveiled in April 2022 ahead of their match against rivals San Diego Wave FC. The primarily white kit, with black and sol rosa palm details inspired by the palm trees of Los Angeles, was created by art director and graphic designer Matthew Wolff. \nOn March 16, 2023, Angel City released a new secondary kit featuring a print of the Los Angeles County coastline called 'Represent'.\nTwo new kits were unveiled on February 27, 2024 as part of a league-wide refresh. The black primary jersey, named 'Moonlight', places the wing from Angel City’s crest in a gritty asphalt-like texture over a black background, and an all sol rosa and pink secondary jersey named 'Sol'.\n\n\nKit history\n\n\nSponsorship and revenue\nThe club's eight-figure deal with DoorDash as the inaugural primary kit sponsor is the largest in the NWSL. Angel City also sold $6 million in merchandise in 2022 to lead the league. The club's revenue accounted for 38.75% of the NWSL's total revenue on the year. In 2023, Angel City's reported revenue was $31 million, nearly double the second-highest team. \n\n\nStadium\nIn November 2020, it was announced the team would play its home matches at BMO Stadium in Exposition Park near Downtown Los Angeles. BMO Stadium, formerly named Banc of California Stadium until 2023, is also home to Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer.\n\n\nPlayers\n\n\nCurrent squad\nAs of November 11, 2025.\n\n\nOut on loan\n\n\nFormer players\nFor details of former players, see Category:Angel City FC players and List of Angel City FC players.\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nCurrent staff\nAs of June 1, 2025.\n\n\nRecords\n\n\nYear-by-year\n\n\nHead coaching record\nAs of November 1, 2024\nOnly competitive matches are counted.

    "text": "Afforestation efforts in Scotland have provided an increase in woodland expansion. By the 20th century mark, Scotland had diminished woodland coverage to 5% of Scotland's land area. However, by the early 21st century, afforestation efforts have increased woodland coverage to 17%.    The Scottish government released their Draft Climate Change Plan in January 2017. The 2017 draft plan has increased the targeted woodland coverage to 21% by 2032 and increases the afforestation rate to 15,000 hectares per year. \n\n\nModern history 1980–present\nBy the 1980s the Forestry Commission retained the services of three foresters with qualification in landscape design. This was in line with the inclusion of the social and recreational aspects of Scotland's new view on woodlands expansion. However, design, conservation and recreation all fell behind the commercial aspect of afforestation. In 1981 the Thatcher government amended the 1967 Forestry Act that included a shift in favor of privatization of woodland expansion. Grants for afforestation were simplified as incentive to private landowners and would work in conjunction with the tax deductions in place since the 1950s. Tax breaks lured investors looking for long-term investments. This eventually led to expansion into areas less conditioned for forest. This included the Flow Country, which was drained and used for commercial timber, mostly Sitka Spruce. This resulted in 90% of Scotland's afforestation being carried out through tax break and grant.\nIn 1982 the Forestry Commission and the Institute of Chartered Foresters organized a conference on broadleaves in Britain. This marked a turning point for afforestation. After the conference the British government reviewed all aspects of broadleaves policy. On July 24, 1985, the government presented a new broadleaved woodland policy. Even with the new policy in place that sought to protect and further afforestation of native woodlands, the northern highlands and Flow Country were still seeing commercial afforestation of non-native species.\nIn 1987 the Nature Conservancy Council published Birds, Bogs and Forestry. The publication took aim at the use of the Flow Country for commercial plantations. It argued that the use of the land was having a big impact on wildlife. Other publications enforced the claim made by the NCC and it also came at a time of public allegations of the government catering to the wealthy. In 1988 the Chancellor of the Exchequer canceled all tax incentives. The late '80s and '90s saw an increased interest by the public in Scotland's forests and the Forest commission was on board. As a result, in 1992 the Forest Commission established the Native Pinewoods Initiative, whose goal was to increase the area of native pinewood to 6,000 hectares by the late '90s.\nThe rise of the Labour Party in 1997 gave a further boost to afforestation of native tree species. Environmental preservation was high on the list of importance as was the inclusion of community in afforestation of woodland. Devolution from the U.K. took place in 1999. The Forestry Commission was dissolved and reorganized as the Forestry Commission Scotland.\nIn 2000 Forestry Commission Scotland released the first Scottish Forestry Strategy. In 2006 it was revised to reflect the issue of climate change as an important factor in woodland expansion. Scotland's emission target was not met in 2017 due to adjustments made in the EU's Emissions Trading System. In 2018 Scotland met its tree planting goal and introduced 11,200 new hectares of afforestation. This helped solidify Scotland's position as the leader in new tree planting within with UK, with 84% of new UK tree planting taking place in Scotland.\nIn April 2019, Forestry Commission Scotland was dissolved and formed into two new Scottish government agencies, Forestry and Land Scotland and Scottish Forestry. Forestry and Land Scotland is responsible for the conservation, management and promotion of Scotland's forest. Scottish Forestry is responsible for forestry policy, support and regulation.\n\n\nFuture\nThe Scottish Government's Draft Climate Change Plan was published in 2017 and has set goals for the future of Scottish afforestation. Targets range from the years 2020–2050. This includes a woodland creation target of 12,000 hectares per year by 2020/21, 14,000 hectares by 2022/23 and 15,000 hectares per year by 2024/25. Included in the draft is the 2050 goal of greater ecosystem services through forestation that contributes to natural flood protection, biodiversity improvement and the country's natural capital.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Lantung is a traditional fabric originating from Bengkulu, Indonesia. This fabric has a long history related to the Japanese colonial period in 1943. During that time, Indonesia experienced an economic crisis and had difficulty obtaining raw materials for clothing. As a solution, the people of Bengkulu began to utilize the bark of certain trees to make fabric, known as \"Lantung\".\n\n\nHistory\nLantung emerged during the Japanese occupation, when many clothing materials were difficult to obtain due to supply shortages and colonial government policies. As an alternative, the Bengkulu community utilized bark from trees such as rubber, ibuh (Fig tree), terap (Scholar tree), or old kedui (Sterculia). The bark was processed manually to produce cloth that could be used as clothing.\nLantung cloth became a solution for the clothing needs of the community who had difficulty obtaining textile materials at that time. The process of making this cloth also shows the creativity of the community in surviving in the midst of difficulties.\n\n\nMaking process\nThe making of Lantung cloth begins with the collection of bark from certain trees. The bark is then beaten with a special tool until it widens and thins. This process aims to soften the wood fibers, so that the bark can be more easily made into cloth. After being processed, the bark is cleaned, dried in the sun, and finally sewn to form a cloth that is ready to be used.\n\n\nPhilosophy and Meaning\nLantung cloth not only has practical value as clothing, but also holds a philosophy about the resilience and creativity of the Bengkulu people. Making this cloth involves high hand skills and shows a close relationship between humans and the surrounding environment, because the main material of this cloth comes from local natural resources.\n\n\nUse of Lantung Cloth\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Lantung cloth was used as a substitute for ordinary clothing due to limited materials. This cloth is often used for everyday clothing, but can also be used in various traditional ceremonies and rituals. Now, Lantung cloth is starting to be preserved again by the younger generation as part of Bengkulu's cultural identity.\n\n\nPreservation\nAfter the colonial period, the use of Lantung cloth began to decline due to technological developments and increased availability of clothing materials from abroad. However, at the end of the 20th century, efforts to preserve this cloth began to develop. Several local arts and culture groups in Bengkulu actively held weaving training and introduced Lantung cloth to the public.\nIn addition, the local government has also begun to promote Lantung cloth as part of the region's cultural heritage. This effort aims to keep this traditional cloth appreciated and maintained, as well as an attraction for cultural tourism in Bengkulu.\n\n\nCover\nLantung cloth is one of the important cultural heritages for the people of Bengkulu and Indonesia in general. This cloth not only has practical value, but is also a symbol of the resilience and creativity of the community in facing difficult times. As part of the regional cultural identity, the preservation of Lantung cloth is very important to maintain the sustainability of Indonesia's cultural heritage.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Youssou N'Dour (French: [jusu (ɛ)nduʁ], Wolof: Yuusu Nduur [juːsu ⁿd̺uːɾ]; also known as Youssou Madjiguène Ndour; born 1 October 1959) is a Senegalese singer, songwriter, musician, composer, and politician. N'Dour helped develop a style of popular Senegambian music known as mbalax, a genre that has sacred origins in the Serer music njuup tradition and ndut initiation ceremonies. From April 2012 to September 2013, he was Senegal's Minister of Tourism.\nRolling Stone described him in 2004 as \"perhaps the most famous singer alive\" in Senegal and much of Africa, and ranked him in 2023 at number 69 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. N'Dour is the subject of the award-winning films Return to Gorée (2007) directed by Pierre-Yves Borgeaud and Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love (2008) directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi. In 2006, N'Dour portrayed Olaudah Equiano in the film Amazing Grace.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nEthnically, N'Dour is Serer, born to a Serer father and a Toucouleur mother. However, culturally, N'Dour is Wolof. He was born in Dakar. He started performing at the age of 12 and would later perform regularly with the Star Band, Dakar's most popular group during the 1970s.\nDespite N'Dour's maternal connection to the traditional griot caste, he was not raised in that tradition, which he learned instead from his sibling. Although patrilineally from the noble N'Dour family, his parents' world-view encouraged a modern outlook, leaving him open to two cultures and thereby inspiring N'Dour's identity as a modern griot. As a Mouride disciple, taalibé in Wolof, a Muslim of the Mouride brotherhood, one of the large four Sufi orders in Senegambia, he often incorporated aspects of Islamic music and chants into his work.\n\n\nMusic career\nAt the age of 15, Youssou N'Dour joined a band called Diamono and, in 1975, toured with the band in West Africa.\nIn 1976 when N'Dour was 16 years old, he signed a contract to sing with Ibra Kasse's Star Band at Kasse's Miami club in Dakar where he would become a sensation.\nIn 1978, N'Dour would follow as several members of the Star Band left to form Étoile de Dakar, a band that made important contributions to Senegal's newly evolving musical style called mbalax which incorporated traditional Senegalese music into the Latin styles that had dominated Senegalese popular music. Although they quickly became one of the city's most popular bands, the group was short-lived due to internal problems. Étoile de Dakar split into two groups: Étoile 2000 and Super Étoile de Dakar.   The latter group included N'Dour,  guitarist Jimi Mbaye, bassist Habib Faye, and tama (talking drum) player Assane Thiam. Super Étoile de Dakar produced four albums on cassette in just a few months and eventually evolved into N'Dour's backing band.\nBy 1991, he had opened his own recording studio, and, by 1995, his own record label, Jololi.\nN'Dour is one of the most celebrated African musicians in history. His mix of traditional Senegalese mbalax with eclectic influences ranging from Cuban rumba to hip hop, jazz, and soul has won him an international fan base of millions. In the West, N'Dour has collaborated with Peter Gabriel, Axelle Red, Sting, Alan Stivell, Bran Van 3000, Neneh Cherry, Wyclef Jean, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman, James Newton Howard, Branford Marsalis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Dido, Lou Reed, Bruce Cockburn, and others.\nThe New York Times described his voice as an \"arresting tenor, a supple weapon deployed with prophetic authority\". N'Dour's work absorbed the entire Senegalese musical spectrum, often filtered through the lens of genre-defying rock or pop music from outside Senegalese culture.\nIn July 1993, Africa Opera composed by N'Dour premiered at the Opéra Garnier for the French Festival Paris quartier d'été.\nIn 1994, N'Dour released his biggest international hit single, the trilingual \"7 Seconds\", a duet sung with Neneh Cherry.\nHe wrote and performed the official anthem of the 1998 FIFA World Cup with Axelle Red \"La Cour des Grands (Do You Mind If I Play)\".\nFolk Roots magazine described him as the African Artist of the Century. He toured internationally for thirty years. He won his first American Grammy Award (best contemporary world music album) for his CD Egypt in 2005.\nHe is the proprietor of L'Observateur, one of the widest-circulation newspapers in Senegal, the radio station RFM (Radio Future Medias) and the TV channel TFM.\nIn 2002, N'Dour was honoured with a Prince Claus Award, under that year's theme \"Languages and transcultural forms of expression\".\nIn 2006, N'Dour played the role of the African-British abolitionist Olaudah Equiano in the movie Amazing Grace, which chronicled the efforts of William Wilberforce to end slavery in the British Empire.\nIn 2008, N'Dour offered one of his compositions, Bébé, for the French singer Cynthia Brown.\nIn 2011, N'Dour was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in music from Yale University.\nIn 2013, N'Dour won a share of Sweden's $150,000 Polar music prize for promoting understanding between faiths as well as for his music.\nHe got a 2026 Grammy Awards nomination for his album Eclairer le monde - Light the World in the Best Global Music Album category. \n\n\nActivism\nN'Dour was nominated as Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on 16 October 2000.\nIn Senegal, N'Dour became a powerful cultural icon, actively involved in social issues. In 1985, he organized a concert for the release of Nelson Mandela. He was a featured performer in the 1988 worldwide Amnesty International Human Rights Now! Tour collaborating with Lou Reed on a version of the Peter Gabriel song \"Biko\" which was produced by Richard James Burgess and featured on the Amnesty International benefit album The Secret Policeman's Third Ball. He worked with the United Nations and UNICEF, and he started Project Joko to open internet cafés in Africa and to connect Senegalese communities around the world.\n\nIn 2003, N'Dour cancelled an upcoming American tour in order to publicly deny support for the upcoming American invasion of Iraq. In a public statement explaining his decision, N'Dour said:It is my strong conviction that the responsibility for disarming Iraq should rest with the United Nations. As a matter of conscience I question the United States government's apparent intention to commence war in Iraq. I believe that coming to America at this time would be perceived in many parts of the world--rightly or wrongly--as support for this policy, and that, as a consequence, it is inappropriate to perform in the US at this juncture.He performed in three of the Live 8 concerts (in Live 8 concert, London, Live 8 concert, Paris and at the Live 8 concert, Eden Project in Cornwall) on 2 July 2005, with Dido. He covered John Lennon's \"Jealous Guy\" for the 2007 CD Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. N'Dour appeared in a joint Spain-Senegal ad campaign to inform the African public about the dramatic consequences of illegal immigration. He participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007.\nIn 2008, he joined the Fondation Chirac's honour committee. The same year, Youssou N'Dour's microfinance organization named Birima (\"Birima\" is also a song's title) was launched with the collaboration of United Colors of Benetton.\nIn 2009, he released his song \"Wake Up (It's Africa Calling)\" under a Creative Commons license to help IntraHealth International in their IntraHealth Open campaign to bring open source health applications to Africa. The song was remixed by a variety of artists including Nas, Peter Buck of R.E.M., and Duncan Sheik to help raise money for the campaign.\nN'Dour is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.\nN'Dour is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.\n\n\nPolitical career\nAt the beginning of 2012, he announced plans to stand as a candidate in the 2012 Senegalese presidential election, competing against President Abdoulaye Wade. However, he was disqualified from running in the election over the legitimacy of the signatures he had collected to endorse his campaign. N'Dour backed the opposition candidate Macky Sall, who defeated Wade in a second round of voting in March 2012. N'Dour was appointed as Minister of Culture and Tourism in April 2012 as part of the cabinet of new Prime Minister Abdoul Mbaye. The story of N'Dour's presidential campaign was filmed for the PBS TV program Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders. Later his portfolio was modified and he was appointed as Minister of Tourism and Leisure. He was dismissed from that post on 2 September 2013, when a new government under Prime Minister Aminata Touré was appointed. N'Dour was instead appointed as Special Adviser to the President, with the rank of minister, and tasked with promoting the country abroad.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nEarly cassettes\nThis numbered series of cassettes was released in Senegal between 1982 and 1988, and was credited to Youssou N'Dour & Le Super Etoile de Dakar.\n\nVol 1 Tabaski\nVol 2 Ndakarou\nVol 3 Independence\nVol 4 Banjoly N'Diaye\nVol 5 Yarou\nVol 6 Marguedy\nVol 7 Daby\nVol 8 Immigres\nVol 9 Africa\nVol 10 Ndobine\nVol 11 Bekoor\nVol 12 Jamm\nVol 13 Kocc Barma\nVol 14 Gainde\nVol 15 Set\n\n\nAlbums\nNdiadiane Ndiaye (1982)\nMouride (1982)\nIndependance Vol. 3 (1982)\nShow!!!

    "text": "A high-field domain is a band of elevated field orthogonal to the equi-current lines, and seen in photoconductive CdS and monochromatic light at the band edge as dark band was discovered by Böer, using the Franz–Keldysh effect. Such domains must appear whenever the conductivity decreases stronger than linearly. This can be caused by the field dependence of the carrier density, as observed in copper-doped CdS caused by Frenkel Poole excitation of holes, causing faster electron recombination, known as field quenching. These high-field domains, now referred to as Böer domains, or by field dependence of the mobility, caused by excitation of electrons into higher conduction bands with lower mobility as observed in GaAs, called the Gunn effect. The high-field domains can be identified by periodical field oscillations between high (the domain) and low values, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nMany other crystals show such domains by typical current oscillations. The high-field domains in copper doped CdS can be easily observed by the Franz–Keldysh effect as stationary, adjacent to the cathode or moving.  These are analyzed as another example below.\nTheory: Stationary high-field domains can be analyzed  from the transport- and Poisson equations:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              n\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            e\n            \n              k\n              T\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                j\n                \n                  e\n                  μ\n                \n              \n            \n            −\n            n\n            F\n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dn}{dx}}={\\frac {e}{kT}}\\left({\\frac {j}{e\\mu }}-nF\\right)}\n  \n   and   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              F\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            e\n            \n              ϵ\n              \n                ϵ\n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            n\n            −\n            \n              n\n              \n                a\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dF}{dx}}={\\frac {e}{\\epsilon \\epsilon _{0}}}\\left(n-n_{a}\\right)}\n  \n\nThe projection of any solution curves into an arbitrary nF plane can be filled with direction arrows at any point of this plane. Two auxiliary curves for which dn/dx = 0, called n2(F) and dF/dx = 0 called n1(F) divide this plane into four quadrants with the same type of directions. This is shown in Fig. 2(left) in a double logarithmic representation.\nAny solution of an n-type semiconductor with blocking cathode must start at the boundary density nc that is below the density in the bulk, and approaches the singular point at which dn/dx = dF/dx = 0, that is in the bulk where both n(x) and F(x) are constant. The solution curve represents a Schottky-blocking contact as shown in Fig. 2(B), curve (a).\n\nWhen n(x) decreases at higher fields due to field-quenching cause by Poole-Frenkel excitation of holes from Coulomb attractive hole traps, that consequently enhances electron recombination through recombination centers, and thereby deforms the n1(x) curve at higher fields as shown in Fig. 2(B). When the bias is increased the current curve n2(x) is shifted upwards and to the right, and when it crosses n1(x) again, it produces a second singular point II. With further increased bias this singular point II reaches the value of the boundary density nc, and the solution curve changes from a monotonic increasing Schottky-solution, to a high-field domain, curve (b): that remains constant near the cathode, and then changes within a few Debye lengths to approach the constant value in the bulk, near the singular point I. The width of the domain increases with bias (Fig. 3a), while the current remains constant (Fig. 3c). The domain is visible as dark part in the transmission picture through the CdS platelett, extending from the cathode as shown in Fig. 3a. The field in the domain can be obtained from the slope of the domain that increases with bias (Fig. 3b).\n\nWhen, with further increased bias the domain fills the entire sample, then it flips to an anode adjacent high-field domain (Fig. 4b). The field at the cathode is now much higher than for the cathode adjacent domain (Fig. 4b and c), while the current still remains essentially constant (Fig. 4c).\n\nHigh-field domains to determine the work function of blocking contacts\nSince the high field domain starts at the electron density given by the work-function at the cathode and pulls the Schottky barrier open to a constant field in the domain, this work function can be determined precisely, and it can be used as a tool to determine the changes of the work function, as it varies depending on external parameters. As an example, it can be shown that it depends on the optical excitation in a photoconductor (See Fig. 5).\n\nHigh-field domains as tools to measure the electron density in the field quenched branch and of the electron mobility as a function of the temperature\n\nThe high-field domain is determined by the boundary density at the cathode and the field within the domain. A shadow band in front of the cathode acts as a pseudo-cathode, as it reduces the electron density within the shadow (Fig. 6). This can be used as an experimental tool to change the boundary density as a function of the light intensity within the shadow.\nThis permits to measure directly the electron density in the field-quenched range, using different pseudo-electron densities, causing a shift of the singular point, and measuring the domain field.\nThe electron Hall mobility can be measured by placing the CdS platelett in a magnet and applying a bias sufficient to create a high-field domain. When the domain is extended to include the Hall electrodes one can determine the Hall mobility within the domain. Different fields in the high-field domain are achieved by using different samples or different cathode metals.\nStationary domains to explain efficiency improvement of CdTe solar cells with a thin CdS cover layer\nThe application of a 200Å thick copper doped layer of CdS on top of a typically 2 μm thick CdTe solar cell, increases the open-circuit voltage substantially, so that it can reach the theoretical limit of the band gap of the CdTe-emitter when extrapolated to 0 K.\nThis improvement can be explained by limiting the field in the CdS side of the junction when it reaches the critical value for a high-field domain to appear and thereby limits the maximum junction field to the domain field of typical 50 kV/cm. This field is below a field in which electron leaking from the CdS into CdTe occurs, resulting in an increase of the open-circuit voltage and thereby an increase of the solar cell conversion efficiency.\nMoving high-field domains in copper-doped CdS with a small circular cathode\nThe domains started from the cathode, separates and, with increasing bias increases its radius. When the anode is reached the ring disappeared and a new domain grows from the cathode. The process repeated itself with a period of 10 sec (Fig. 7).\n\nSuch undeformed moving domains in crystals with slit electrodes are bands parallel to the electrodes, and seen by the oscillating field, when plotted in a x,F,t diagram give the optical impression of bifurcation (Fig. 8).\n\nSuch moving high-field domains are measured in p-Ge with (a) local voltage (b) field- and (c) carrier density oscillation (Fig. 9).\n\nUndeformed moving high-field domains and domains with deformation (Chaos) are observed in many other crystals, and also in nanocrystals or superlatices.  However, because of the small size they can only be analyzed by the changing shape of the current-voltage characteristics.\nBöer domains\nThe high-field domains were renamed Böer domains at the 50th anniversary of their discovery.\nThe Benefits of the High-Field Domains\nCopper-doped photoconductive CdS shows high-field domains when at sufficient bias and with blocking contacts these domains remain attached to the contacts. The field within the domain is constant and the current is by drift only. With increased bias the domain  width increases. When it reaches both electrodes the entire crystal becomes space-charge free (this is one more example at which an interaction vanishes: for the interaction of electrons with phonons, superconductivity results; from the interaction of photons with phonons, lasers can be produced). This gives the opportunity to measure the spectral distribution of defect levels free of interaction of the broadening electric field surrounding the defects. A first example is shown by the extremely sharp quenching spectrum of a CdS crystal that has been inverted to become p-type with a high-field-domain (Fig. 10)\n\nAnother benefit of the high-field domain is the direct connection of any p-type emitter through a copper-doped thin CdS layer directly to an electron-blocking electrode through which the holes are extracted, and  the open-circuit voltage is increased to approach the theoretical limit of the band gap or the emitter at 0K. Because in the CdS the hole current is now carried by drift only, we can finally draw the band model of a typical solar cell. e.g. the CdS/CdTe cell as given in Fig. 11. For the first time we can replace the estimate of the band connection of abrupt hetero-junctions from the difference  of electron affinities by calculating it from the continuity of the majority carrier current, with the only small discontinuity left by the difference of the effective masses of the carriers at the different carrier bands.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "A high-field domain is a band of elevated field orthogonal to the equi-current lines, and seen in photoconductive CdS and monochromatic light at the band edge as dark band was discovered by Böer, using the Franz–Keldysh effect. Such domains must appear whenever the conductivity decreases stronger than linearly. This can be caused by the field dependence of the carrier density, as observed in copper-doped CdS caused by Frenkel Poole excitation of holes, causing faster electron recombination, known as field quenching. These high-field domains, now referred to as Böer domains, or by field dependence of the mobility, caused by excitation of electrons into higher conduction bands with lower mobility as observed in GaAs, called the Gunn effect. The high-field domains can be identified by periodical field oscillations between high (the domain) and low values, as shown in Fig. 1.",

    "text": "Kemner v. Monsanto was a landmark toxic tort lawsuit brought against the Monsanto Company in the wake of a 1979 train derailment in Sturgeon, Missouri. The case involved claims by local residents who alleged that they had been exposed to toxic dioxin released during the derailment and suffered adverse health effects. It became one of the longest civil trials in Illinois history and is significant for its role in shaping toxic tort law and environmental litigation.\n\n\nBackground\nOn January 10, 1979, a freight train derailed in the small town of Sturgeon, Missouri. Among the derailed cars was one carrying 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, a chemical used in the manufacture of herbicides such as Agent Orange. During the derailment, the chemical spilled and released dioxin, a highly toxic compound linked to serious health problems in animals and potentially in humans.\nResidents living near the derailment site reported a range of health concerns in the months and years following the incident. Symptoms included skin rashes, headaches, fatigue, and fears of long-term illnesses such as cancer and reproductive harm. Concerns over the chemical’s potential impact, combined with allegations of corporate negligence, eventually led a group of plaintiffs to pursue legal action against Monsanto.\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nIn the early 1980s, 17 plaintiffs filed suit against Monsanto, alleging that exposure to dioxin caused their medical conditions and that the company was liable for failing to warn the public about the dangers of the chemical. The legal claims included negligence, strict liability, and willful and wanton misconduct.\nMonsanto denied the allegations, disputing both the toxicity of the low-level exposure and its responsibility for the incident. The company argued that scientific evidence did not support the plaintiffs’ claims and that the levels of dioxin present were too low to cause harm.\nThe trial began in St. Clair County, Illinois, in 1985 and lasted nearly 11 months, making it one of the longest jury trials in the state’s history at the time. Proceedings featured extensive expert testimony, prolonged scientific debate, and close examination of environmental safety standards.\n\n\nDecision\nIn 1987, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Monsanto, finding that the plaintiffs had not proven that their injuries were caused by exposure to dioxin. The court concluded that while the plaintiffs may have experienced health issues, the evidence presented at trial did not establish a direct causal link to Monsanto’s chemical.\nThe verdict was upheld on appeal by the Illinois Appellate Court. The appellate decision highlighted the difficulty plaintiffs face in proving causation in toxic tort cases, particularly where low-level chemical exposures are concerned.\n\n\nPublic reaction\nThe trial drew significant media coverage, both locally and nationally. Time magazine published a feature on the case, noting its extraordinary length and the community’s concern over chemical safety.\nReactions in Sturgeon were mixed. Some residents accepted the jury’s verdict, while others felt the legal system had failed to hold a major corporation accountable for potential health risks. The case intensified local concerns about environmental hazards and transparency in corporate practices.\n\n\nSignificance\nKemner v. Monsanto has been cited in discussions of toxic tort litigation as an example of the evidentiary challenges in proving harm from environmental exposures. The case underscored the importance of scientific evidence in environmental lawsuits and revealed the limitations of the court system in addressing community-wide environmental concerns.\nSocially, the trial contributed to broader public awareness of corporate responsibility in environmental safety and fueled debate about the adequacy of regulations governing hazardous materials. It remains a reference point in environmental law, public health policy, and academic discussions about toxic torts.\n\n\nReferences",

LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant statute and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to corporate by-laws, or analogous to a partnership agreement in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLC, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.\nMost states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.",

From an early age, Polo showed a talent for storytelling and improvised singing, absorbing the oral traditions of the Magdalena River region.\n\n\nMusic career\nAlthough initially taught to play the gaita by his father, Polo gravitated towards the accordion, first learning on his own and later receiving formal guidance from Pacho Rada, one of the great masters of vallenato. He was an early pioneer of vallenato, alongside others including Alejo Durán, Luis Enrique Martínez, Abel Antonio Villa, and Emiliano Zuleta Baquero. He travelled extensively through the Greater Magdalena region in what were known as cantos de juglaría—musical journeys that combined performance with oral history.\nHe adopted \"Valencia\" as a second surname in homage to Colombian poet Guillermo Valencia, whose modernist works he admired deeply.\nPolo was known for his \"slow, cadenced style\" and for lyrics rich in metaphor and regional imagery—mountains, valleys, rivers, and birds—which to some listeners seemed unusual, but which he delivered with a spontaneity that gave his songs emotional authenticity. Many of his compositions were rooted in personal experiences, local events, and traditional stories, often blending romantic lament with playful social commentary.\nThroughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, he established himself as a sought-after performer at festivals, village celebrations, and cattle ranch gatherings, where the competitive art of the piqueria—musical duels between juglares—was a central feature. His travels often involved weeks on horseback across rural trails, carrying only his accordion and provisions, exchanging songs for food, lodging, or modest payment.  \nWhile Polo never enjoyed the commercial recording success of some of his contemporaries, his influence on the vallenato tradition was significant. His songs were interpreted and popularized by others, helping shape the poetic dimension of the genre. His repertoire included laments such as Alicia Adorada, playful narratives like Se robaron mi sombrero, and competitive challenges such as El provincianito, which targeted fellow juglar Emiliano Zuleta in the tradition of lyrical rivalry.\n\n\nDeath\nPolo died on 22 July 1978 in Fundación, after falling asleep in a hammock following a performance in Aracataca the previous night. Several of the musician's old cattle rancher friends from Fundación took it upon themselves to purchase his coffin and arrange his final funeral rites. He was initially buried in Fundación, but his body was later moved to Santa Rosa de Lima.\n\n\nCompositions and accordion playing\nPolo was widely believed to be illiterate, but in fact he was a keen reader of poetry and of the bible, and would \"lock himself in his room for hours and compose songs, writing them down in careful handwriting and with respect for the rules of language.\"\nPastor López said of him in the 1970s: \"Juancho Polo Valencia has no teeth, didn't get a school degree, but his singing is a science.\" (Spanish: Juancho Polo Valencia, no tiene dientes ni tiene muelas, no tuvo grado de escuela pero al cantar es la ciencia.)\n\n\n\"Alicia Adorada\"\nPolo's best-known song is \"Alicia Adorada\", considered his most emblematic work and one of the representative pieces of traditional Colombian vallenato music. It was written as an expression of grief after the death of his wife, Alicia María Cantillo Mendoza, who died alone while pregnant in the village of Flores de María, where the couple lived, while Polo was away. \nAccording to journalist Ernesto McCausland in his program Mundo Costeño, when Cantillo fell gravely ill, Polo set out on horseback for Pivijay to find medicine, travelling along the poor roads of the time on a journey that could take more than three days. Upon his return, he found that Alicia had died and been buried.\nAlthough Polo rarely performed \"Alicia Adorada\" himself, a version by Alejo Durán became widely known in Colombia; Marcos Fidel Vega Seña called Durán's interpretation \"the most successful and grandiose lament in accordion music\". It was later covered by performers such as Diomedes Díaz and Carlos Vives.\nOther artists who have performed or recorded the song include Orlando y Su Combo, Aníbal Velásquez, Los Black Stars, Ariza y Su Combo, Eneida Cedeño, Dorindo Cárdenas y su Conjunto Orgullo Santeño, Jorge Oñate with Juancho Rois, and Chirimía.\n\n\nOther works\nOther notable compositions by Polo include \"Sí, Sí, Sí\", \"El Paseo de Concordia\", \"Lucero Espiritual\", \"La Muerte de Alfredo Gutiérrez\", \"Niña Mane\", \"El Pájaro Carpintero\", \"El Provincianito\", and \"La Muerte Es La Que Puede\".\nPolo's song \"Jesús Cristo Caminando con San Juan\" is his retelling of the baptism of Christ.\nHe released 21 LPs between 1971 and 1978 on various Colombian record labels.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJuancho Polo Valencia discography at Discogs",

On the monument there was a dedicatory plaque drawn up by Professor Carlo La Mura which read \"here as children we dreamed of a serene life; but we threw it into the whirlwind of war, certain of your memory, oh fellow citizens of Angri.\" This inscription was later covered with the marble slab which bears the names of the 235 fallen from Angri in the Second World War.\n\n\nDescription\nThe monument consists of a flight of five steps, on which rests a bronze relief, depicting two helmets, two swords, two rifles and oak branches. The statue of the winged Victory, covered by a peplos that leaves one breast uncovered, rests one foot on the last step and has an arm stretched forward carrying the hilt of a sword in her hand. Large blocks of stone are assembled to form three levels on which rests a marble base. On the four sides are placed the lists of the fallen. At the top, a bronze sculptural group depicts an infantryman raising a collected flag and supporting a dying comrade.\n\n\nSee also\nAngri\nMarshal Pietro Badoglio\nWorld War I\nWorld War II\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nBooks\nGiuseppe Barbella (March 2025).

Emanuel Fthenakis was the President and Chief Executive Officer upon the founding of the corporation. He was replaced in 1976 by Harry Dornbrand, who was President of Fairchild Space and Electronics division at the time. Under their leadership, ASC pioneered advancements in satellite broadcasting both domestically and abroad.\n\n\nOverview\nIn June 1973 ASC became the first company to transmit United States domestic television via satellite. The first broadcast was of an address by then Speaker of the House Carl Albert delivered in Washington, D.C., and sent to the National Cable Television Association convention in Anaheim, California.\nOn the same day, they became the first company to broadcast a major sports event via satellite: the fight between Jimmy Ellis and Ernie Shavers in Madison Square Garden.\nASC was headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, and had 4 Earth stations located in SFES - San Francisco, CA (Benicia), LAES - Los Angeles, CA (Nuevo), DAES – Dallas, TX, NYES – New York, NY.\nIn 1976 ASC began commercially delivering The Wall Street Journal via satellite.\nIn 1982 ASC began commercially delivering the fledgling USA Today via satellite.\nASC contributed to Department of Defense communications systems and built the first digital satellite route from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland via a land base in California.\nThe corporation also invented a shipboard antenna that could connect military vessels to satellite communications despite the pitch and yaw motion of the ship.\nBy 1978 ASC \"established the first wideband digital data transmission service via domestic satellite for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\".\nIn 1984, the corporation control became the largest U.S. transceiver satellite communications network.\nThe Transmission Operations department was responsible for operations and maintenance. The Network Operations Control Center was located at Vernon, NJ, and was later relocated to Ellenwood, DeKalb County outside of Atlanta, GA.\nAt the end of 1987, the Southeast Region consisted of the following sites:\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt MD, DOD Ft Meade MD\nFairchild Industries Gaithersberg VA, DOD Ft Belvoir VA, DOD Virginia Beach VA, DOD Damneck VA\nNASA Etam WV\nAllstate Insurance Charlotte NC, USA Today Greensboro NC, DOD Ft Bragg NC\nDOD Shaw AFB SC, Metropolitan Life Insurance Greenville SC\nDOD Savannah GA, USA Today Gainesville GA\nDOD McDill AFB FL, New York Times Lakeland FL, NASA Merritt Island FL, FAA Miami FL,\nDOD Hurlburt Field FL, DOD Eglin AFB FL, DOD NAS Pensacola FL\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center Huntsville AL, SCI Huntsville AL, Lockheed Martin Huntsville AL\nSocial Security Birmingham AL\nUS Pencil and Pen Shelbyville TN, Dept of Energy Oak Ridge TN, Olin Mills Inc Chattanooga TN\nFederal Express Memphis TN\nDOD Ft Campbell KY\nNASA Slidell LA\nDOD Hattiesburg MS\nAbbott Labs, Puerto Rico.\nAmerican Satellite initially leased satellite service on the Western Union WESTAR satellites.\nAmerican Satellite contracted with RCA Astro to build the ASC-1 satellite which was launched via NASA space shuttle Discovery mission STS-51-I on August 27, 1985. The satellite has 18 C-band and 6 Ku-band transponders. On C-band, the satellite had 12 each 36 MHz transponders that used Solid State Power Amplifiers (SSPAs) and 6 each 72 MHz transponders that used Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs). The SSPAs had 8.5 watts of Radio Frequency (RF) power and the TWTAs had 16.2 watts of RF power. On Ku-band the satellite had 6 each 72 MHz transponders. The satellite had a Horizonal polarity beacon at 4100 MHz, a Vertical polarity beacon at 3700 MHz. The Satellite was parked at 81 degrees west. ASC-2 was launched via a Delta-7925 rocket from Cape Canaveral on April 3, 1991 and was parked at 101 degrees west. ASC-3 was not used and sold to PanAmSat.\n\n\nReferences",

He received multiple decorations while serving as a medical officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps (Special Reserve) during the First World War.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMcCarthy was born in 1885 in Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland. In 1903, he matriculated into Trinity College, Dublin, studied medicine. He won the Reid Scholarship in his first year of university. He graduated first in his year in 1909 with a Bachelor of Medicine (MB) degree. He then undertook further training at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and worked as a physician in Paris and Vienna. In 1911, he earned the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) from Dublin and was also awarded a Diploma in Public Health (DPH) by the University of Oxford.\n\n\nCareer\nOn 17 November 1909, McCarthy was commissioned in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Special Reserve of Officers, as a lieutenant (on probation). His commission and rank were confirmed in April 1910. He was promoted to captain on 17 May 1913.\nAs a member of the Special Reserve, McCarthy was called up at the start of the First World War. He was posted to France as a medical officer with the Irish Guards in 1914. During the war, he moved from being a front line medical officer to commanding field ambulances. He was mentioned in despatches in June 1915 and in January 1916. On 1 January 1916, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) \"for distinguished service in the Field\".\nOn 30 November 1916, he was promoted to acting lieutenant colonel upon his appointment as commanding officer of a field ambulance. He relinquished the rank of lieutenant colonel on 2 July 1917 upon reposting, but on 17 July 1917, he was once more promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of a field ambulance. On 26 August 1917, he again relinquished the rank of lieutenant colonel upon reposting. He was promoted to acting major on 22 April 1918, before relinquishing the rank on 14 May 1918 following reposting. On 24 May 1918, he was appointed commanding officer of a medical unit and promoted to acting lieutenant colonel. He was awarded a bar to his Military Cross (i.e. awarded the MC for a second time) on 13 September 1918.\n\nCapt. William Hilgrove Leslie McCarthy, M.C., M.D., R.A.M.C., Spec. Res. \nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer, hearing that an Aid Post was filled with wounded who could not be evacuated by the normal route, owing to the enemy bombardment, led a party of stretcher-bearers through heavy shell fire and reorganised the evaluation. He dressed four wounded men in the open on the way up, and made several journeys during the day.\nOn 8 February 1919, McCarthy relinquished his commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps on account of ill health from wounds sustained during the First World War; he had been wounded three separate times. He was allowed to retain the rank of lieutenant colonel. In March 1919, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions in the final days of the war.\n\n Capt. (A./Lt.-Col.) William Hilgrove Leslie McCarthy, M.C., R.A.M.C. (Spec. Res.), attd. 19th Fd. Amb.  \nDuring the operations connected with the crossing of the Sambre, 4th to 8th November 1918, he exhibited marked gallantry and devotion to duty. He was in command of the advanced dressing station and maintained the closest touch with the front line troops, arranging for the immediate evacuation of casualties as they occurred. He worked continuously for three days and three nights, and his energy, able management and devotion to duty saved many lives.\nIn addition to medicine, McCarthy chose to study law and was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1920. From 1924 until he retired in 1950, he was medical officer of health for the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in London, England. He was additionally medical officer to Inner Temple and Middle Temple, and served as a deputy coroner in the counties of London and Middlesex.\nIn March 1934, McCarthy was appointed Coroner of the King's Household by King George V. He was re-appointed on the succession of King Edward VIII in July 1936, of George VI in March 1937, and of Queen Elizabeth II in August 1952. In the 1955 Birthday Honours, he was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). In August 1955, he stepped down as Coroner of the Queen's Household and was succeeded by Bentley Purchase.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, he rejoined the Royal Army Medical Corps on 26 January 1940 as a lieutenant. On 28 June 1941, having reached the rank of war substantive captain, he relinquished his commission and resumed the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1921, McCarthy  married Evelyn Marshall Porter.\nMcCarthy died on 16 September 1962 in Switzerland.\n\n\nReferences",

In Domesday, it is called Helle.\nThe village is about 11⁄2 miles or 21⁄2 km south of the market town of Wisbech, immediately to the south of the Wisbech by-pass. The county boundary with Norfolk is immediately to the north and north-east. The northern part of Elm village, at Elm Low Road, acts as a suburb of Wisbech. Most of the village straddles the B1101 road, which meanders its way between Wisbech and March.\nThe civil parish had a resident population of 3,295, as recorded during the 2001 United Kingdom census. The population including Coldham, Collett's Bridge, Friday Bridge and Ring's End was 3,962 at the 2011 Census.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nPrehistoric\nSituated in the Fens, much of the parish would have been undrained salt marsh and salt lagoon, with any higher areas, such as that around Wisbech, forming fen-islands. Mesolithic hunter-gatherers would have fished and hunted waterfowl from these islands. Later, farmers would have grazed their sheep and other livestock on the marsh pastures. Scatters of worked flints have been found at Coldham and other sites.\n\n\nRoman period\nThe area was occupied during the Roman period, with domestic finds scattered through the parish, concentrating along the Leam stream, which may have been canalised during the Roman period. Apart from agriculture, there is archaeological evidence of salt processing in the Elm area.\n\n\nMedieval period\nThe Great Hey or High Fen was common to the vills of Elm, Leverington, Newton, Wisbech, Outwell, Upwell and Tydd St Giles. Drainage and falling sea levels may have prompted the settlement of Elm by the medieval period. In the 13th century the parish was prosperous enough to fund the building of a significant church.\n\n\nModern period\nThe lower-lying parts of the parish were probably not fully drained and reclaimed until as recently as the 17th to 19th centuries. Later satellite settlements formed to the south of the parish at Friday Bridge and at Coldham, alongside the Leam, where land was better drained.\n\nElm, or Elme, once had a stop on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway, known as Elmbridge as it was just over the boundary in Norfolk near to a bridge that spanned the former Wisbech Canal. There were passenger stations serving the parish: Coldham for Pear Tree Hill, on the March–Wisbech line (1847), and Guyhirn on the March–Spalding line (1867).\nThe canal connected the River Nene at Wisbech to a junction with the Well Creek and the Old River Nene at Outwell, and passed along the northern edge of Elm.\nThe canal was abandoned, and finally filled in during the 1970s. Parts of it have been converted into a public green lane that starts at the post office, and terminates at the site of Collets Bridge. The tramway that ran alongside the canal was in turn closed to passengers from 1927. It discontinued as a line in 1966.\nBesides allotments and market-gardening, a number of apple, pear, and plum orchards have been planted on the better-drained soils close to the village centre in the north of the parish, while the lower-lying peat soils further out are cultivated as high grade arable land. The orchards (some of which have since been replaced by new housing developments) used to attract fruit pickers from London on working holidays. After the Second World War, many of these seasonal visitors would stay at a disused POW camp at Friday Bridge. Today the camp is used mainly by seasonal agricultural workers, including some from abroad.\n\nA stream, known as The Leam, once flowed from March to Wisbech, past the church, and through the village. This stream has now been drained away, and only survives today as a pond to the south of Elm, at Friday Bridge. In 2018, Elm parish council ordered the removal of bulrushes from the pond.\n\n\nCommunity facilities\nElm's facilities include a primary school, a post office, a local shop, butchers, hairdressers, garages, and two public houses - The Sportsman and the Elm Tree inn. A bus service stops in Elm, running between Wisbech and March. The nearest railway station is at March. National Cycle Network 63 from Wisbech to Burton on Trent, passes directly through the village.\n\n\nLandmarks\nThe parish church is a large needle-spired, stone building, mainly of Early English 13th-century origin, and is dedicated to All Saints. The church is a Grade I listed building.\nOther notable local buildings include the Grade II listed Elm House, that has been dated to 1630, and the Sportsman public house, two of nearly two dozen listed buildings in the parish.\n\n\nNotable people\nRev. Henry Jackson, Vicar of Wisbech St Mary. He died on 24 March 1863. He left £150 for the erection of a drinking fountain in Wisbech, £100 for a stained glass window in Wisbech church and £200 for a coloured window in Elm church.\nThomas Aveling (1824–1882), a pioneering agricultural engineer, was born in Elm on 11 September 1824 before moving to Hoo in Kent. He was the co-founder of Aveling and Porter which became the largest manufacturer of steam rollers in the world. Thomas Aveling died on 7 March 1882 and is buried in the churchyard at St Werburgh Church, Hoo.\n\n\nReferences\n\nPeterborough Profile\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Elm, Cambridgeshire at Wikimedia Commons\nElm Parish Council",
    "summary": "Elm is a village and civil parish in the Fenland District of Cambridgeshire, England. In Domesday, it is called Helle.\nThe village is about 11⁄2 miles or 21⁄2 km south of the market town of Wisbech, immediately to the south of the Wisbech by-pass. The county boundary with Norfolk is immediately to the north and north-east. The northern part of Elm village, at Elm Low Road, acts as a suburb of Wisbech. Most of the village straddles the B1101 road, which meanders its way between Wisbech and March.\nThe civil parish had a resident population of 3,295, as recorded during the 2001 United Kingdom census. The population including Coldham, Collett's Bridge, Friday Bridge and Ring's End was 3,962 at the 2011 Census.",

    "text": "Antonio Barbaro (1627-1678),son of Marc'Antonio, was a Venetian general and governor, a member of the patrician Barbaro family of Venice (now Italy), who held positions in Crete, Dalmatia and Rome. Barbaro lived at a time when Venice had a maritime empire in the Mediterranean. \nBarbaro served in Candia (now Heraklion), Crete during the long-lasting Siege of Candia. He was Captain of the Gulf from 1655 to 1656, and in 1667 he became Provveditore generale di Candia.\nBarbaro also served in the Balkans; from 1670 he became the provveditore generale of Venetian Dalmatia and Venetian Albania.   He was Provveditore general of Zara from 1670 to 1672. \nAntonio Barbaro was Podesta of Padua in 1672. In 1676 he served as a ambassador to Rome. He also served as Proveditor general of an army against the Uscocchi, Captain in the Battle of the Dardanelles, and conquered Zara.\n\n\nLegacy\nWhen Barbaro died in 1678, he left 30,000 ducats for the rebuilding of the church of Santa Maria Zobenigo, also known as the Santa Maria de Giglio, in Venice. This was done according precise specifications listed in an attachment to Barbaro's will, which also notes that the church is in a good position 'to speak directly to Ca' Morosini'. \nThe church was originally built around 900 by the Zubenigo family, who died out in 1124. It was rebuilt in a Baroque style by Giuseppe Sardi between 1678 and 1680.\nThe façade shows has bas-reliefs with plans for the cities Rome, Corfu, Padua, Candia,Spalatro, and Pavia; all places where Barbaro or his brothers held civil or military appointments. Another  series of bas-reliefs above the first portray  the six naval battles in which the brothers participated. These maps predate the official Venetian cartographic commission of Vincenzo Coronelli by almost a decade.\nA statue of Antonio Barbaro is in the middle of the façade. It was damaged by lighning in 1759. Statues of Antonio Barbaro's four brothers flank his, two on each side. . Other statues portray allegorical figures of Hunger, Honor, Virtue, and Wisdom.  All of the statues are probably the work of Josse de Corte.  The Barbaro coat of arms, as well as the four cardinal virtues are also depicted.\nThere are no Christian symbols on the  façade. John Ruskin condemned the façade as “a manifestation of insolent atheism”. and thought that the poverty of the last members of the Barbaro family was justice for the family having rebuilt the Church as a monument to themselves.\nBarbaro was praised by Gabriele d'Annunzio during his declaration in Zara in 1918.\n\n\nBibliography\nDecisione degli auditori nuovi alle sentenze di Venezia. 1693 maggio 28, Venezia Decisione di Antonio Barbaro, Benedetto Zorzi ed Alvise Gritti, auditori nuovi alle sentenze di Venezia sulla sentenza emessa da Alvise Priuli, capitano di Bergamo, a favore del marchese Gaspare Giacinto Martinengo fu Gherardo e contro la comunità di Calcinate, per l'elezione a canevaro, camparo e tesoriere del comune.\nMichaela Marangoni: Una famiglia veneziana nella storia: i Barbaro; atte del Convegno di Studi in Occasione del Quinto Centenario della Morte dell'Umanista Ermolao; Venezia, 4 - 6 novembre 1993.

    "summary": "Warsaw is one of the most important education centres of Poland. It is home to four major universities and over 62 smaller schools of higher education. The overall number of students of all grades of education in Warsaw is almost 500,000 (29.2% of the city population; 2002). The number of university students is over 255,000.\nThe University of Warsaw (Uniwersytet Warszawski, 55,000 students, 19 faculties) was established in 1816, when the partitions of Poland separated Warsaw from the oldest and most influential Polish academic center, in Kraków. Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika Warszawska, 31,000 students, 18 faculties) is the second academic school of technology in the country, and one of the largest in Central Europe, employing 2,000 professors. It was established in 1898 as the Nicolas II's Technical Institute, in 1915 changed the name at the present one. Other institutions for higher education:",

    "text": "Stanisław Piotrowicz Kiszka (Lithuanian: Stanislovas Kiška; died in 1513 or 1514) was a noble, diplomat and military commander from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He became the progenitor of the prominent Kiszka family. He was sent on frequent diplomatic missions to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Kingdom of Poland. He attempted to negotiate peace during the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars and supported a closer union between Poland and Lithuania. During the Second Muscovite–Lithuanian War (1500–03), he successfully defended Smolensk and became Grand Hetman of Lithuania (commander of the army) until Konstanty Ostrogski escaped Russian captivity in 1507. Kiszka helped to subdue the Glinski rebellion in 1508. Shortly before his death, Kiszka also became Grand Marshal of Lithuania.\n\n\nBiography\nKiszka's father Piotr Strumiłło died in 1486 and he inherited his positions. Kiszka started his political career as a stolnik (royal pantler) and starosta of Lida in 1488. His further career was related to the favor of Alexander Jagiellon who became Grand Duke in 1492 and marriage to the daughter of Petras Jonaitis Mantigirdaitis and the last heiress of the influential Mantigirdai family. During his first years, Grand Duke Alexander appointed 11 Grand Duke's marshals, among them Kiszka, which signified his desire to build an inner circle.\n\n\nDiplomatic career\nKiszka was sent on his first diplomatic mission in the spring of 1490. He presented a protest to Ivan III of Russia who harbored and protected Princes Vorotynsky and Belsky who had defected from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the reign of Alexander, Kiszka served as a diplomatic envoy to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Kingdom of Poland almost annually.\nThe first of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars ended in 1494 and resulted in substantial territorial losses for Lithuania. Alexander's marriage to Helena of Moscow, daughter of Ivan III of Russia, gave Moscow further pretexts to interfere in Lithuanian affairs. During that tense time, Kiszka was a member of delegations dealing with Russian matters in 1494, 1495, 1498, and 1500. In early 1494, Kiszka received Russian envoys who came to Poland to negotiate the marriage between Alexander and Helena. In early 1495, together with other members of the Lithuanian Council of Lords, he met and greeted Helena on her way to Vilnius. In 1498, hostilities with Russia resumed – Russian army attacked Mtsensk and other locations. In June 1498, Kiszka accompanied by Ivan Sapieha traveled to Moscow in an unsuccessful attempt to broker peace. The full Muscovite–Lithuanian War broke out in 1500 and Kiszka once again attempted to negotiate peace in March 1500.\nKiszka was also sent to diplomatic missions to Poland in 1492, 1495, and 1496. In August 1492, he represented Grand Duke Alexander at the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland where Alexander's brother John I Albert was elected as King.  In 1501, Kiszka supported the proposed Union of Mielnik which would have united Poland and Lithuania into a single state. The union was inspired by the continuing Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars, particularly the defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha, and Lithuanian desire to secure Polish military support against Russia. Kiszka also attended Sejms in Radom (1505) and Lublin (1506). After the death of Alexander, Lithuanian nobles elected his brother Sigismund as Grand Duke of Lithuania in September 1506. Together with Bishop Wojciech Radziwiłł and voivode Jan Zabrzeziński, Kiszka attended the Polish Sejm in Piotrków Trybunalski that elected Sigismund as King of Poland in December 1506. In general, Kiszka was a strong proponent of a closer union between Poland and Lithuania.\n\n\nMilitary career\nKiszka's first military experience was during the Polish–Ottoman War (1485–1503). In 1497, King John I Albert organized an invasion of Moldavia. Lithuanians refused to join the campaign but Grand Duke Alexander sent a small force of volunteers and hired men commanded by Kiszka. The Polish forces were ambushed and defeated in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest.\nIn 1499, Kiszka became regent of Smolensk and ordered improvements to Smolensk Kremlin. When the Muscovite–Lithuanian War resumed in 1500, Kiszka commanded a 500-men regiment in the Battle of Vedrosha. Lithuanians, commanded by Konstanty Ostrogski, suffered a great defeat, and many Lithuanian nobles, including Kiszka's brother-in-law, were killed. Kiszka then devoted his attention to preparing Smolensk for a Russian assault. For his successful command of the defense during almost the three-month Siege of Smolensk in 1502 he was promoted to the Grand Hetman. A six-year truce with Moscow was concluded in early 1503 and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost about a third of its territory.\nKiszka became entangled in a political conflict with royal favorite Michael Glinski and was temporarily removed from the Lithuanian Council of Lords in 1505. In August 1505, Kiszka scored a victory against the invading Crimean Khanate near Haradok. As Grand Hetman, he was supposed to command the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army in the Battle of Kletsk against the Crimean Khanate in August 1506 but was unable due to poor health. In summer 1507, Konstanty Ostrogski escaped from the Muscovites and was reinstated as the Grand Hetman. To compensate, Kiszka was appointed as starosta of Grodno in 1508. When the war with Moscow resumed in 1507, Kiszka organized the defense of Polotsk. During the Glinski rebellion, he defended Minsk and helped to drive out Glinski's forces. His last military commands were near Orsha (18 July 1508) and Vyazma.\nFor his loyal service, Kizska was appointed as Grand Marshal of Lithuania after the death of Mikalojus Kęsgaila in 1512.\n\n\nFamily\nKiszka was a son of Piotr Strumiłło, starosta of Drohiczyn and Lida, whose ancestors hailed from Mazovia. Kiszka married Anna, daughter of Jan Kuczuk, Grand Duke's marshal, but she died within a few years. Around 1490–1492, he married Sophia Anna, daughter of Petras Jonaitis Mantigirdaitis, Voivode of Trakai. The marriage to the last heiress of the influential Mantigirdai family provided a career boost and increased Kiszka's wealth. Kiszka owned large properties across the Grand Duchy, including  Ciechanowiec in present-day Poland, Nesvizh, Iwye, Kryvichy, Subotniki, Lakhva in present-day Belarus, Olyka in present-day Ukraine. His son Piotr was the 10th wealthiest noble in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania according to the 1528 military census. Kiszka was buried in Ciechanowiec.\nKiszka had three known children: \n\nBarbara Kiszka (from first marriage) who married Jerzy Radziwiłł in 1504\nPiotr Kiszka (died in 1534) who became Voivode of Polotsk and Elder of Samogitia\nAnna Kiszka (died in 1533) who married Stanislovas Kęsgaila and Jan Radziwiłł\n|\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Traralgon ( trəh-RAL-gən, locally  tə-RAL-gən) is a city located in the east of the Latrobe Valley in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia and the most populous city in the City of Latrobe and the region. The urban population of Traralgon at the 2021 census was 26,907. It is the largest and fastest growing city in the greater Latrobe Valley area, which has a population of 77,168 at the 2021 Census and is administered by the City of Latrobe.\n\n\nNaming\nThe origin of the name Traralgon is unconfirmed. The name was used for the pastoral lease of the Hobson brothers in 1844, centred on Traralgon Creek, and was alternatively rendered 'Tralgon' by Dr Edumund Hobson. The town was also spelt \"Taralgon\" in the earliest records of the Gippsland Times available in 1861. \nThe Gippsland Farmers' Journal wrote in 1889 that the town name was originally spelt 'Tarralgon' and that it was the Indigenous name for 'the river of little fish'. However, these words are not reflected in modern linguists' knowledge of Gunai/Kurnai language. Records of the language show that the words wun wun or wurn wurn mean 'river', the words dala or tarlo mean 'little', while the words kine or kain mean 'fish'. It might be possible to combine words into tarlo-kain, which sounds similar to 'Traralgon', but no such compound word was recorded. \nIn 1989, Don Macreadie wrote that Paweł Strzelecki named Traralgon after Taralga, the hometown of Charlie Tarra, but the statement lacks evidence.\n\n\nHistory\nTraralgon is situated on the traditional lands of the Indigenous Gunai/Kurnai nation, which includes the lands of the Braiakaulung clan of Bunjil Kraura, who lived to the north of Latrobe River (called Durt'yowan in Gunai language), as well as the clan of Woollum-Woollum, who lived on the hills to the south of the river and were more affiliated with the Brataualung people.\nGunai/Kurnai people manufactured stone tools, as long as 5,000 years ago, from silcrete quarries in the Haunted Hills, west of Morwell. Scarred trees and rock sites with axe-grinding grooves are also found in the local area. The Gippsland region was inhabited by the Gunai/Kurnai people for a period in excess of 20,000 years, according to evidence of occupation found at the New Guinea II cave near Buchan, Victoria. In other parts of Victoria evidence of Indigenous occupation has been found for many more thousands of years.\n\n\nExpeditions\nThe first non-Indigenous visitors to the area of Traralgon included the party of Count Paweł Strzelecki on their journey from the Snowy Mountains in April 1840, after Strzelecki had named Australia's highest peak as Mount Kosciuszko. Charley Tarra, a Burra Burra man from the NSW town of Taralga, was the Indigenous guide for the party, which included Strzelecki; the New South Wales men James MacArthur and James Riley; and their servants, Irish convict James Nolan and African convict John Rent.\nThe party crossed Latrobe River and travelled along Traralgon Creek to a heavily forested area, where the party was forced to abandon their horses and equipment. The location was commemorated by monument at Traralgon Creek, Koornalla, erected in 1927. The team's rations were reduced to a slice of bacon and a biscuit per day, but Tarra hunted for animals to end their hunger. They traversed the headwaters of Morwell River, before making a difficult journey across the heavily forested mountain range. They reached Anderson's run in Western Port in May 1840, then walked to Melbourne.\nTo honour the men, the mountain range was named the Strzelecki Ranges, part of the forest was named Tarra Valley, later merged into Tarra-Bulga National Park, and the river running from the valley to Port Albert was named Tarra River. Strzelecki named the region as Gipps' Land, later becoming Gippsland, in honour of his sponsor NSW Governor George Gipps.\nIn June 1840, a party consisting of Tarra, Riley, John Rutledge and Shoalhaven Indigenous man John Pigeon went on a second expedition to retrieve the lost horses and managed to retrieve one, by travelling through the mountains of West Gippsland, across a path that would roughly trace the present-day Princes Highway. A third expedition was made from Port Albert to Latrobe Valley in March 1841 that included William Brodribb, Alexander Kinghorne, Norman McLeod and Kirsopp with Tarra as their guide. In June 1841, a fourth expedition was made along the same route by William's brother Albert Brodribb, pastoralist Edward Hobson, Dr Edward Barker and four Boon wurrung men.\n\n\nPastoral leases\nThe area around Traralgon was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s. Due to the Latrobe Valley having relatively high rainfall, the land is very fertile, and farming was quickly established. As with much of central and western Gippsland, this was mainly dairy farming. In the Gippsland region between 1840 and 1860, the population of settlers grew from a few to 2,000 and the recorded Gunai population fell from 2,000 to a handful.\nThe first Europeans to take land in Traralgon were the brothers Dr Edmund Hobson and Edward Hobson who purchased a 19,000 acre pastoral lease in 1844, which they called Traralgon. In April 1844, Edward to a large mob of cattle out from their station near Arthur's Seat to Traralgon arriving two months later. Albert Brodribb and William Bennett started Hazelwood Station in 1844 and the following year James Rintoul had taken a run in Loy Yang and Thomas Gorringe had taken up a run at Maryvale.\n\n\nTownship established\nThe township was established in the early 1860s, the first Post Office opening on 1 January 1861. In 1877 the Gippsland railway line from Melbourne was completed with a railway station at Traralgon giving the town a major economic boost.\nTraralgon was part of the area administered by the Rosedale Roads Board, before the Shire of Traralgon was established in 1879. In the latter part of the 19th century the Shire grew strongly.\n\nIt was not until the 1930s however that Traralgon began to move away from a farming based economy. In 1939, Australian Paper Manufacturers established a paper mill at Maryvale, around 8 kilometres (5 mi) from Traralgon.\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited on 3 March 1954. The president of the Shire of Traralgon, Cr Clem Little met and welcomed the Queen, who was flown by the Royal Australian Air Force from Sale. She returned to Melbourne by train.\nIn 1961, Traralgon formed its own borough, the Borough of Traralgon following a decade of lobbying to separate the urban areas of Traralgon from the Shire. Traralgon was proclaimed a city in 1964.\nThe old town hall and mechanics institute were demolished in 1973.\nFurther development resulted from the expansion of the power generation industry following World War II, particularly through the now defunct State Electricity Commission of Victoria. This included large expansions at Yallourn and Hazelwood Power Stations and the construction of the massive Loy Yang Power Station in the 1970s and 1980s.\nAn Australian Securities & Investments Commission information processing centre was established in the early 1990s, at the time employing around 400 people.\nThe City of Traralgon and Shire of Traralgon continued a separate existence until they were amalgamated into the Shire of Latrobe in 1994.\nCompletion of the Loy Yang power stations, extensive voluntary departures from the electricity industry and privatisation of the Victorian electricity industry in the early 1990s had devastating effects on the economy of the Latrobe Valley. Traralgon, with a more diversified economy, suffered to a lesser extent than the neighbouring towns of Morwell and Moe both of which relied almost exclusively on the power stations for their livelihood.\nTraralgon grew strongly in the mid 2000s, with a figure of 2.7% making it the largest and fastest growing city in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\nHeritage listings\nTraralgon contains a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n161–165 Franklin Street: Traralgon Post Office and Court House\nQueens Parade: Traralgon Engine Shed and Turntable\nVictory Park, Mill Street: Azarole Hawthorn Tree\n\n\nGeography\nTraralgon is situated on expansive flat land in the Traralgon Creek valley catchment between the Great Dividing Range in the north and the Strzelecki Ranges in the south.  The Traralgon Creek runs through the city's centre and its green belt separates its eastern and western suburban areas.  The urban area is hemmed to the south east by the Loy Yang Open Cut.\n\n\nUrban Structure\n\nTraralgon is part of the Latrobe Valley tri-city urban area, a small area of industry and agricultural land separates it from neighbouring Morwell.  Traralgon together with adjacent Morwell forms an urban area with an estimated population of 41,984 as at June 2018. In the five years prior, the urban area had experienced a modest average annual growth in population of 0.5%. The Traralgon portion the combined Morwell area had a population of 27,958, also at June 2018. Greater Traralgon includes localities such as Traralgon, the suburb of Traralgon East and the relatively sparsely populated satellite localities of Hazelwood and Traralgon South to the south, and Tyers and Glengarry to the north.\nThe Traralgon central business district is centred around Seymour and Franklin Streets. An indoor shopping mall called Traralgon Centre Plaza was opened in 1985. Commercial and light industry sprawl along most of the eastern stretch of the Princes Highway. Notable heritage buildings include the Post Office and Courthouse erected in 1886 and Ryans Hotel erected in 1914, both in Franklin Street.\n\n\nClimate\nTraralgon experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb). Nights in Traralgon are about 2 °C colder than in Melbourne\n\nFrom 9 June 2021 Traralgon was one of the hardest-hit towns with 200 homes evacuated when an east coast low weather system caused widespread flash flooding across Gippsland.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy is primarily driven by the primary sector, natural resources and the secondary sector including coal mining, processing and fossil-fuel power generation for the National Electricity Market.  Along with electricity production, Traralgon benefits from the mining for oil and natural gas in the nearby Bass Strait fields.\nA significant forestry industry operates including logging of both plantation and natural forest timber, The largest paper mill in Australia is located nearby in Maryvale and provides local employment for over 2,000 people.\nThe local agriculture industry is involved in the production of wool and dairy products, as well as vegetable growing.\nThe tertiary sector of the economy is also important for employment with major government administration offices for the Australian Securities & Investments Commission, Department of Health & Human Services, Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning and Environment Protection Authority.\n\n\nGeothermal energy\nThe Gippsland Regional Aquatic Centre in Traralgon is the first public aquatic facility in Victoria to incorporate a deep-bore geothermal heating system. The system taps in to the aquifer below ground in Traralgon at a depth of more than 600 metres where the ground water is about 65 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nEducation\nTraralgon features a number of primary and secondary schools, including state, catholic and independent schools.\nThe local primary schools include Grey Street Primary School (formerly Traralgon Primary School), Kosciuszko Street Primary School, Liddiard Road Primary School, Stockdale Road Primary School, St Michaels Primary School, St Gabriels Primary School, Chairo Christian School (formerly Flinders Christian Community College]) and St Pauls Anglican Grammar School. St Paul's Anglican Grammar School and Chairo Christian School are also secondary schools. In addition Traralgon has the Latrobe Special Developmental School catering for students from 4.5 to 18 years of age with an intellectual and physical disability.\nThe local government secondary school, Traralgon College, has two campuses, the junior campus (years 7 & 8) located on Liddiard Rd in Traralgon's east, with the senior campus (years 9–12) on Grey St in Traralgon's west. There is also a Catholic secondary school, Lavalla Catholic College. Lavalla has two campuses in Traralgon's West end, and a third campus in Newborough. The junior campus, St Paul's, neighbours Traralgon College's senior campus on Grey St. The senior campus, Kildare, is located in Kosciuszko St. Chairo Christian School on Liddiard Rd is a P– 8 school.\nA number of Traralgon families also send their children to the three independent Anglican grammar schools in the region, two of which are about 40 minutes drive from Traralgon: St. Paul's Anglican Grammar School, which has a campus in Traralgon as well as Warragul, or Gippsland Grammar School in Sale.\nTAFE and University education is also available within the region. Traralgon is a 15-minute drive from Federation University Australia's Gippsland Campus, located in the neighbouring town of Churchill. Traralgon is also home to one of a number of campuses for the region's TAFE provider, TAFE Gippsland.\n\n\nSport\n\nAustralian rules football is popular.  There are two senior clubs, the Traralgon Maroons (which briefly competed in the Victorian Football League between 1996–1997) currently competing in the Gippsland Football League and Traralgon-Tyers United competing in the North Gippsland Football League. There is also a junior league, Traralgon and District Junior Football League, with most games played from the West End Sporting Complex.\nCricket is also popular, with a local league, the Traralgon and District Cricket Association (TDCA) operating.\nSoccer is represented by two clubs – Traralgon City and Traralgon Olympians – who both play in the Latrobe Valley Soccer League. The home grounds are Harold Preston Reserve and Harold Preston Park respectively.\nThere is a local basketball league, the Traralgon Basketball Association with a stadium at the Traralgon Sports Complex. The Traralgon Sports Stadium played host to preliminary round games of the Basketball competition during the 2006 Commonwealth Games which were held in Melbourne.\nThe local baseball team is the Traralgon Redsox.\nTraralgon has a horse racing club, the Latrobe Valley Racing Club, which schedules two race meetings a year including the Cup meeting in December.\nThe Traralgon Greyhound Racing Club holds regular greyhound racing meetings at Glenview Park.

He grew up in Nieuw-Vennep and studied Public administration at Leiden University between 1986 and 1992 (he did not complete his study). During his attending years at the university, and at the same time as the then crown prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, he became a member of the student fraternity LSV Minerva in 1987.\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 2000, Weerwind became deputy city manager of Leiderdorp and a year later he became city manager of Wormerland. On 1 december 2004, he was appointed mayor of the municipality of Niedorp, and from September 2009 until September 2015 he was mayor of Velsen. From September 2015 until January 2022 he was mayor of Almere.\nWhen Weerwind was Minister for Legal Protection, the Dutch government resumed adoptions of children from the Philippines, Hungary, Lesotho, Taiwan, Thailand and South Africa in 2022, after a nearly two-year-freeze on new international adoptions. Inspired by Italian laws against its Mafia, he introduced a bill in 2023 to limit communication for prisoners in the strictest facilities. Interactions with attorneys would be monitored under the legislation to allow for intervention in case of the exchange of external messages or the exertion of pressure on an attorney. Following further amendments by the House of Representatives, the Council of State advised that the bill would violate the constitution, and Weerwind subsequently toned down his proposal.\nWeerwind's term as minister ended on 2 July 2024, when the Schoof cabinet was sworn in.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWeerwind is married to Ilse Overzier.

It took place in Brazil from 5 to 14 January 2000. FIFA as football's international governing body selected Brazil as the host nation on 8 June 1999 as the bid was found to be the strongest among four candidates. The draw was made at the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro on 14 October 1999. All matches were played in either Rio de Janeiro's Estádio do Maracanã or São Paulo's Estádio do Morumbi.\nEight teams, two from South America, two from Europe and one each from North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania entered the tournament. The first Club World Cup match took place in São Paulo and saw Spanish club Real Madrid beat Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr 3–1; Real Madrid's Nicolas Anelka scored the first goal in Club World Cup history in the 21st minute. Later the same day, Corinthians goalkeeper Dida kept the first clean sheet in the tournament as his team beat Moroccan side Raja Casablanca 2–0.\nCorinthians and Vasco da Gama each won their respective groups to qualify for the final. In front of a crowd of 73,000, the final finished as a 0–0 draw after extra time. The title was decided by a penalty shoot-out which Corinthians won 4–3.\nAs winners, Corinthians received $6 million in prize money, while Vasco da Gama received $5 million. Necaxa beat Real Madrid in the match for third place to claim $4 million. Real Madrid received $3 million, and the other remaining teams were awarded $2.5 million.\n\n\nHost bids\nInitially, there were nine candidates to host the competition: China, Brazil, Mexico, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Tahiti, Turkey, the United States and Uruguay; of the nine, only Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay confirmed their interest to FIFA. On 7 June 1999, the FIFA Emergency Committee appointed Brazil as hosts of the competition during their meeting in Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\nQualified teams\n\nThe clubs that played in the tournament were:\n\n\nVenues\n\n\nSquads\nFor a list of the squads at the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, see 2000 FIFA Club World Championship squads.\n\n\nMatch officials\nEight referees were appointed from the six continental confederations, each along with an accompanying assistant referee.\n\n\nFormat\nMatches were played in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

The first of these was slated for Spain in 2001, with an expected 12 participants. By March of that year, group draws had even taken place. However, the second edition of the tournament was called off due to a range of factors involving partners and sponsorships, with the collapse of International Sport and Leisure, FIFA's marketing partner at the time, being the most significant. The event was then rescheduled for 2003, but it didn't come to fruition either. It wasn't until 2004 that FIFA was able to officially announce the second edition of the tournament.\nFrom the 2005 edition onwards, the competition has been held continuously but under a new format, featuring single-elimination tournament instead of a group stage plus final, and with a shorter duration, addressing scheduling concerns for national federations and continental confederations. While the two subsequent editions, 2005 and 2006, included only the six continental champions, from the 2007 edition onwards, the number of participants increased to seven – the seventh spot was typically reserved for the national champion of the host country. However, to prevent the recurrence of two clubs from the same country, as happened in 2000, FIFA introduced a mechanism: if the continental champion hailed from the host country, the national champion of that country would forfeit its spot, which would then go to the highest-ranked team from another country in the continental competition.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFIFA Club World Championship Brazil 2000, FIFA.com\nFIFA Technical Report\nFIFA Statistics\nTournament details at the Rec.Sports.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF)",

Wood published numerous collections of poetry as well as children's novels, fiction, and nonfiction. Major themes and influences in her work were the Native American cultures of the Southwestern United States.\nHer career, which spanned over five decades, included 28 publications of prose and poetry, and several photograph collections. Wood was a National Endowment for the Arts fellow, and a recipient of the Lee Bennett Hopkins Poetry Award.\n\n\nEarly life\nWood was born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey ,to an Irish Catholic family. She began work as a writer at 14 at the Beachcomber newspaper on Long Beach Island, NJ. She attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nCareer\nSource:\nWood moved to Colorado in 1958, where she lived until 1985 when she moved to New Mexico. After visiting Taos Pueblo in New Mexico in 1962, Wood became greatly influenced by the Puebloan peoples' culture and spiritual beliefs, which would come to inform her literary work. \"It was 180 degrees from what I knew growing up,\" she said. \"Nature was the center. I began to think in those terms–here was not just a 'religion' but a whole way of being and seeing.\"\nOriginally working as a writer, her first few books were collaborations with husband and photographer Myron Wood. Nancy and Myron founded their own publishing house for their first book, Central City: A Ballad of the West (1963). Her first work of poetry, Hollering Sun (1972), included Myron's photographs and was published by Simon and Schuster. Her second work of poetry was published by Doubleday in 1974, titled Many Winters: Prose and Poetry of the Pueblos. These and subsequent poetry works would be inspired by her time spent at the Taos Pueblo. Many Winters began a lasting collaboration with illustrator Frank Howell, who provided artwork and illustrations for Wood's poetry publications until his death in 1997. Nancy became a photographer in the mid-1970s and produced several nonfiction books with her writing and photographs: The Grass Roots People, Taos Pueblo, and When Buffalo Free the Mountains.\nWood published children's books including How the Tiny People Grew Tall: An Original Creation Tale (2005), and Mr. and Mrs. God in the Creation Kitchen (2006), inspired by Puebloan creation myths. Her novels include Thunderwoman (1999), which retells a Pueblo creation myth, and The Soledad Crucifixion (2012), which reflects Pueblo and Catholic history and culture in New Mexico. In 2007, Wood published Eye of the West, a retrospective of her photographic work, through the University of New Mexico Press, followed by The Soledad Crucifixion, which earned her a posthumous Zia Award from the university.\nWood received many honors throughout her career, including a National Endowment for the Arts literary fellowship, and a Lee Bennett Hopkins Poetry Award for her 1993 book, Spirit Walker.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWood was married three times: first to Oscar Dull, then Myron Wood, and John Brittingham. She had four children. In early 2013, Wood was diagnosed with terminal melanoma. She died at her home in Eldorado at Santa Fe, New Mexico on March 12, 2013.\n\n\nBibliography\nSource:\n\n\nPoetry\nHollering Sun, with photographs by Myron Wood, Simon & Schuster (New York, NY), 1972.\nMany Winters: Prose and Poetry of the Pueblos, illustrated by Frank Howell, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1974.\nWar Cry on a Prayer Feather: Prose and Poetry of the Ute Indians, Doubleday New York, NY), 1979.\nSpirit Walker, illustrated by Frank Howell, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1993.\nDancing Moons, illustrated by Frank Howell, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1995.\nShaman's Circle, illustrated by Frank Howell, Delacorte (New York, NY), 1996.\nSacred Fire: Poetry and Prose, illustrated by Frank Howell, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1998.\nWe Became as Mountains, Sherman Asher Press (Santa Fe, NM), 2008.\n\n\nNon-fiction and Anthologies\nCentral City: A Ballad of the West, with photographs by Myron Wood, Chaparral Press (Colorado Springs, CO), 1963.\nColorado: Big Mountain Country, with photographs by Myron Wood, Doubleday (New York, NY), 1969\nClearcut: The Deforestation of America, Sierra Club (San Francisco, CA), 1972\nIn This Proud Land: America, 1935–1943, New York Graphic Society (New York, NY), 1973.\nThe Grass Roots People: An American Requiem, with photographs by Nancy Wood, Harper & Row (New York, NY), 1978.\nWhen Buffalo Free the Mountains: The Survival of America's Ute Indians, with photographs by Nancy Wood, Doubleday (Garden City, NY), 1980.\nHeartland New Mexico: Photographs from the Farm Administration, 1935–1943, University of New Mexico Press (Albuquerque, NM), 1989.\nTaos Pueblo, with photographs by Nancy Wood, Knopf (New York, NY), 1989.\nThe Serpent’s Tongue: Prose, Poetry and Art of the New Mexico Pueblos, Dutton (New York, NY), 1997\nEye of the West, with photographs by Nancy Wood, University of New Mexico Press (Albuquerque, NM), 2007.\n\n\nFiction\nThe Last Five Dollar Baby, Harper & Row (New York, NY) 1972.\nThe Man Who Gave Thunder to the Earth: A Taos Way of Seeing and Understanding, Doubleday (Garden City, NY), 1976.\nThe King of Liberty Bend, Harper & Row (New York, NY), 1976.\nThunderwoman: A Mythic Novel of the Pueblos, illustrated by Richard Erdoes, Dutton (New York, NY), 1999.\nThe Soledad Crucifixion, University of New Mexico Press (Albuquerque, NM), 2012.\n\n\nChildren's Fiction\nLittle Wrangler, photographs by Myron Wood, Doubleday (Garden City, NY), 1966.\nThe Girl Who Loved Coyotes: Stories of the Southwest, illustrated by Diana Bryer, Morrow Junior Books (New York, NY), 1995.\nOld Coyote, illustrated by Max Grafe, Candlewick Press (Cambridge, MA), 2006.\nHow the Tiny People Grew Tall: An Original Creation Tale, illustrated by Rebecca Walsh, Candlewick Press (Cambridge, MA), 2005.\nMr. and Mrs. God in the Creation Kitchen, illustrated by Timothy Basil Ering, Candlewick Press (Cambridge, MA), 2006.\n\n\nAwards and honors\nCarter G.

    "text": "George Beare (2 October 1885 – 31 January 1970) was an English professional footballer who played for Blackpool, Everton and Cardiff City in the early years of the twentieth century.\n\n\nFootball career\nBeare was born in Shirley Warren, Southampton, and played for his local team before being spotted by Southern League club Southampton in 1906. He spent most of his time at the Saints playing in the reserves, and was described as \"a quick touch-line dribbler\". He made his Southern League debut in the final game of the 1906–07 season, replacing George Harris in a 2–1 victory over Bristol Rovers. For the following season, Southampton signed Welsh international John Lewis and Beare spent another season in the reserves before moving to Blackpool in 1908.\nHe spent two full seasons at Blackpool, who were then in the Second Division, before moving on to First Division Everton in autumn 1910.\nHe made his debut for Everton replacing England international Bert Freeman in a 3–1 defeat at Bradford City on 12 November 1910. Despite joining Everton part way through the season, his eight goals (from 26 appearances) made him the club's joint-top-scorer in the league (with Bill Lacey and Alex Young) for the 1910–11 season, as Everton finished fourth in the table.\nThe following season, 1911–12, he was part of the Everton team that reached the runners-up position in the table, finishing three points behind champions Blackburn Rovers, despite a team total of only 46 goals (three from Beare), the fifth-worst total in the league. In 1912–13, it soon became clear that Everton were struggling to build on the runners up position from he previous season, and they finished eleventh in the league. The lack of goals remained a problem, and despite Tommy Browell and Frank Bradshaw both getting double figures, the team as whole could only manage 48 in total, with Beare contributing seven.\nWhilst the 1912–13 season had been disappointing, 1913–14 was even worse for both Everton and Beare, as the club finished fifteenth in the table, winning only twelve games and avoiding relegation by just five points, with Beare failing to score. At the end of the season, Beare returned to the Southern League to join Cardiff City.\nCardiff ended the 1914–15 season third in the Southern League table, before league football was suspended during the First World War. On the cessation of hostilities, Cardiff spent one final season in the Southern League, finishing fourth, before being invited to join the Football League Second Division as the strongest team in Wales, with the remaining Southern League clubs forming the new Football League Third Division. In their inaugural season in the Football League, Cardiff finished runners-up in the Second Division table equal on points with champions Birmingham but with a far inferior goal average, but this was sufficient to gain promotion to the top flight. They also had a great run in the FA Cup reaching the semi-final stage, where they went out to Wolverhampton Wanderers after a replay. Beare played in all seven FA Cup matches, and scored the solitary goal in the first round victory over Sunderland.\nBeare returned to Second Division football with Bristol City in November 1921, but after Bristol City were relegated at the end of the 1921–22 season, he returned to Cardiff City in September 1922. He made no further appearances for Cardiff before playing out his career with Oswestry Town in the Shropshire League.\nLate in his career it was written about him: \"If he did not enjoy playing football, he would probably have been one of our leading music hall comedians as he is an expert card manipulator, a trick cyclist of no little repute and an excellent billiards player.\"\n\n\nHonours\nEverton\n\nFootball League runners-up: 1911–12\nCardiff City\n\nFootball League Second Division runners-up: 1920–21\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nEverton career details",

The spire is short, rather solid, shining, and white, longitudinally veined with tawny between the ribs, and spirally trilineate (marked with three lines).\nThere are 9 whorls: the 3 embryonic ones are milky white, round, and smooth. The succeeding whorls are plano-declivous, scarcely convex, short, and adorned with strong, smooth longitudinal ribs. They are separated by a rather thick suture, with a single marginal furrow below the suture, and grooved with minute lirae between the ribs.\nThe body whorl equals 2/3 of the total length, is elongated, inflated superiorly, depressed in the middle, then striated, ending in a somewhat recurved and acuminated siphonal canal. The aperture is elongated, exceeding half of the total length, very narrow, and oblique. The columella is flexuous, concave superiorly, and unisulcate (one-grooved) in the middle.\nThe labrum (outer lip) is thickened at the suture, flattened, obliquely declivous, with an acute margin, sinuous below the suture, and then produced. In the aperture, it is thickened and plicate in the middle. \n\n\nDistribution\nThis marine species occurs off Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia\n\n\nReferences\n\nChenu, J. C. (1842-1854).

    "text": "Stefon Meyers (né Zolesky) is a fictional character portrayed by Bill Hader on the American sketch-comedy television show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Created by Hader and writer John Mulaney, Stefon is based on people Hader and Mulaney encountered in their daily lives, including a club promoter and a barista. Stefon first appeared in the sketch \"Movie Pitch with Stefon\" on the November 1, 2008, episode hosted by Ben Affleck, later becoming a recurring character on Weekend Update from 2010 until 2013.\nStefon is described as a \"city correspondent\"; when asked about recommendations for events and destinations in New York City, Stefon suggests unusual nightclubs and parties with bizarre characters and themes. The character is also shown to be infatuated with the Weekend Update anchor, Seth Meyers, and in his final appearance as a recurring character, the two proclaimed their love for each other. Because lines for Weekend Update are read from cue cards, Mulaney constantly changed the script prior to the live broadcast to make Hader break character.\nWidely regarded as Hader's most memorable character on Saturday Night Live, Stefon has become a fan favorite and has made multiple guest appearances since Hader left the show; however, the character has also been criticized due to his stereotypical nature.\n\n\nDevelopment and production\nStefon was created by American sketch-comedy television show Saturday Night Live (SNL) cast member Bill Hader and writer John Mulaney. The character was inspired by people Hader and Mulaney had encountered in their daily lives; these include a club promoter who sent Mulaney an e-mail about a club that \"had everything\", including \"rooms full of broken glass\" as a highlight. His voice and mannerisms are based on those of a barista at a Chelsea, Manhattan, coffee shop Hader frequented. Mulaney took inspiration for Stefon's look from 2000s club fashion and the 2003 film Party Monster. He chose an Ed Hardy shirt because he assumed it would look like the fashion from the film.\nStefon was originally written for a sketch for the November 1, 2008, SNL episode hosted by Ben Affleck. In the sketch, Stefon and Affleck's character, David Zolesky, were pitching a film to a studio. It was well received, leading Hader and Mulaney to write a similar sketch featuring Stefon when Bradley Cooper hosted the show. The reception for the new sketch was more adverse when it played at dress rehearsal. This made them feel that the character was not working, with Mulaney remarking that there were too many individuals for a skit centered on a single character. Doug Abeles, the head writer of Saturday Night Live's satirical news segment Weekend Update, suggested that the character should be introduced as a correspondent on the feature instead. During production of the character's first appearance on Weekend Update, Mulaney assumed the character would be cut after rehearsal, but Stefon was positively received and was invited to reappear two shows later.\nHader and Mulaney together created the character's idiosyncratic manner, including his exuberant descriptions of fictional nightclubs. They wrote long scripts so SNL head writer and Weekend Update anchor Seth Meyers could pick which jokes to include. Mulaney said that the eventual format of Stefon's club recommendations was inspired by how the character proposed his ideas in the initial 2008 skit. Hader described his role in the writing process for the character as an \"editor\" and would pitch parts that included odd voices. Mulaney left SNL in 2012 but periodically returned to write the character's lines.\nAfter the dress rehearsal for Stefon's first appearance on Weekend Update, a line from the script had to be changed because it received no response. As the lines for Weekend Update are read from cue cards, Hader, who was unaware of the change during the show, broke character. Mulaney was amused by this and decided to continue to change the script before the live broadcast to make Hader laugh. To make sure Hader did not stumble on his lines, Mulaney would tell him the new jokes shortly before he entered the set. Mulaney characterized getting Hader to crack as a \"group effort\", adding that cast member Andy Samberg would stand near the camera, cross his hands, and look at Hader, tempting him to laugh. Hader also attributed his frequent corpsing as Stefon to the character's animated personality, which made him immerse himself in the role and lose his composure. Despite Stefon's popularity among fans, Hader felt pressure while portraying the role, as he often struggled to stay in character.\nDue to Hader leaving SNL at the end of the 2012–2013 season, he and Mulaney arranged plans for Stefon's final appearance. Hader had written notes the year prior for it to be a prerecorded sketch where Meyers interrupts Stefon's wedding with journalist Anderson Cooper, similar to the 1967 film The Graduate. The idea was not enthusiastically received by the staff, including SNL creator and producer Lorne Michaels, due to them believing that Stefon worked better as a live sketch. Meyers instead recommended that Stefon appear on Weekend Update as usual before the character flees, followed by the original skit for a sense of surprise. Another suggestion for Stefon's final appearance was for him to board a spaceship and return to his home planet with his boyfriend, but this was abandoned in favor of the initial idea. Rhys Thomas directed the taped sketch, which was filmed on Tuesday before the show.\n\n\nCharacter\nIntroduced as a \"city correspondent\", Stefon appears on Weekend Update to recommend unusual destinations for tourists travelling to New York. He starts the recommendations with the phrase \"New York's hottest club\" and continues with the description of the club, usually containing odd personalities such as \"leprechauns that look like Farrah Fawcett\", \"a doorman who always high-fives children of divorce\", or various types of midgets described as human objects, such as \"human DVRs\" or \"human piñatas\". Stefon wears long-sleeved Ed Hardy shirts and has an asymmetrical, highlighted haircut. In his appearances on Weekend Update, Stefon claims that his mother goes by the name Ms. Stefon, his father is English musician David Bowie, he lives in a trash can outside a RadioShack store at the corner of 23rd Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan, and he has a dog named Bark Ruffalo.\nStefon has a nervous and palpable personality and often touches his face. Tess Lynch, writing for Grantland, characterized Stefon's persona as intriguingly relatable. She noted his eagerness to suggest offbeat clubs, juxtaposed with an underlying apprehension. Stefon is shown to be infatuated with Meyers; he expresses disappointment when Meyers mentions his girlfriend and calls for the audience's pity. According to Mulaney, he thought it was reasonable that Stefon would be attracted to Meyers, so he and Hader created Stefon's romance one joke at a time. Hader also expressed that the character's sexuality did not matter to the sketch, stating, \"He was just bad at his job and did a lot of drugs, [...]. And then of course he would be into Seth [Meyers], and Seth wouldn't like him, so it was just organic that this relationship happened.\"\nIn the book Saturday Night Live and Philosophy: Deep Thoughts Through the Decades, Kati Sudnick and Erik Garrett mention Stefon as an example of the issues of a technocratic elite. They stated that \"[o]ur inability to understand most of Stefon's terms illustrates how the public is at the mercy of these experts. For example, when we hear from economic forecasters predicting an economic slump, we trust them even when we don't understand them.\" According to anthropologists Britt E. Halvorson and Joshua O. Reno in their book Imagining the Heartland: White Supremacy and the American Midwest, the character's absurdity highlights the divide between open-minded and narrow-minded perspectives. Additionally, they describe the sketch as fitting a form of homonationalism, which is characterized by the inclusion of queer subjects through racial and national differences.\n\n\nAppearances\n\n\nSaturday Night Live\nStefon debuted in a sketch in 2008 as the brother of Ben Affleck's more serious character, David Zolesky; the character was then introduced as a correspondent on Weekend Update the following season in 2010. Stefon returned during the season 35 finale of SNL, two episodes after his initial appearance, and the fourth episode of season 36 hosted by Emma Stone. Stefon appeared on Weekend Update again during an episode hosted by Paul Rudd in December 2010, where the character performed an altered version of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" as part of his appearance, and the next episode, where he performed \"O Christmas Tree\" with other recurring characters, David Paterson (Fred Armisen) and Snooki (Bobby Moynihan). The next year, Stefon showed up in an episode hosted by Russell Brand, when he recommended Valentine's Day destinations, as well as another episode presented by Tina Fey. Stefon made a short appearance in the season 36 finale of SNL, where he and Meyers sign off Weekend Update.\nOn the third episode of season 37, Stefon appeared with the character Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) from the eponymous film. He also made an appearance in the Katy Perry episode as well as its promos. Stefon made a short cameo appearance with singer-songwriter Paul Simon in the monologue of the 2012 episode hosted by Maya Rudolph, and in the Weekend Update segment of the Jonah Hill episode, Stefon kissed Meyers for the first time. The character made another appearance in the season 37 finale, the Bruno Mars episode of season 38, where he suggested Halloween-related activities in New York City, and in the episode hosted by Justin Timberlake.\nThe character made his last recurring appearance on Weekend Update at the end of season 38 because Hader was leaving SNL. Former Weekend Update co-anchor Amy Poehler made a guest appearance for a \"Really?!?\" segment with Meyers before Stefon emerged, expressing disapproval of Poehler. After Stefon's usual comment on \"New York's hottest club\", Meyers criticized his recommendations, making Stefon flee NBC Studios to get married. After Poehler advised Meyers to follow Stefon, Meyers pursued Stefon to the wedding at the Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue but found Stefon was marrying journalist Anderson Cooper. Seth enters the church, finds Stefon, and takes him back to Studio 8H, where they proclaim their love for each other. The guests at the wedding include many of the idiosyncratic people Stefon has mentioned during his Weekend Update segments. Ben Affleck made a cameo appearance, reprising his role as David Zolesky from Stefon's debut sketch. After Seth and Stefon return to the studio, characters from Weekend Update gather to congratulate them. The wedding segment is a reference to the 1967 film The Graduate.\nIn February 2014, Stefon returned to Weekend Update as a guest along with Amy Poehler to bid farewell to Meyers in his final Weekend Update as Meyers prepared to become the new host of Late Night. During Hader's first time hosting of SNL the same year, Stefon returned to Weekend Update, hosted by Colin Jost and Michael Che, to recommend New York clubs for tourists interested in autumn activities and ended the sketch by announcing his pregnancy. As part of the Weekend Update segment of the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special in 2015, Edward Norton portrayed Stefon but was confronted by the real Stefon portrayed by Hader and Meyers. On Hader's second time hosting in 2018, Stefon returned to Weekend Update for a St. Patrick's Day-themed segment of New York City recommendations. Stefon, who usually uses the term \"midget\" to describe his bizarre recommendations, did not use the term to avoid being insensitive; he consulted his attorney and \"conceptual piss artist\" Shy (John Mulaney) for a better term, ultimately using \"little people\".\nDuring an interview with The Guardian in 2022, Hader said SNL had suggested he reprise the role, but he declined due to the political climate at the time and fearing that the character could be seen as stereotypical. In an interview with The Independent the following year, Hader stated he was open to playing Stefon again, saying that he had not met anyone who was offended by the character.\n\n\nOutside Saturday Night Live\nIn December 2011, Hader (as Stefon) and Seth Meyers made an appearance at the benefit concert A Funny Affair for Autism, where Stefon gave club recommendations for Christmas. The pair also made an appearance on the 2012 edition of Night of Too Many Stars.\nWhen Late Night with Seth Meyers premiered on February 24, 2014, a Stefon matryoshka doll was unveiled as part of the decor of Meyers's desk.\n\n\nUnproduced movie\nParamount Pictures began discussions for a feature film featuring Stefon. The film was intended to be a mockumentary in which Stefon would visit New York hotspots as a correspondent for Weekend Update. Meyers had pitched that the movie would start with his character dead since he assumed he would not be starring in the film, and Mulaney wanted director Garry Marshall to portray SNL creator and producer Lorne Michaels. Hader and Mulaney later rejected the offer because, according to Hader, \"in [their] mind, it never worked as a sketch\".\n\n\nReception\n\nStefon has had a generally positive reception, with James Poniewozik of Time describing it as one of the best contemporary SNL skits. David Reddish of Queerty wrote that he loved Stefon \"in all his messy, gay glory\" and that \"even though Hader is straight, he made the character vulnerable and lovable\". David Sims of The A.V. Club and Daniel Holloway of Variety said Stefon was one of the few recurring characters they never grew tired of. Tess Lynch of Grantland and Laura Bennett of The New Republic said Meyers and Stefon's chemistry made the character stand out. According to Jordan Crucchiola of Wired, Stefon was \"too funny to let go of\", and Brian Welk of TheWrap said that although Stefon often covers his face with his hands due to Hader breaking, it has made the character \"forever endearing\". Stefon's final appearance as a recurring character on Weekend Update also received praise. Zack Sharf of IndieWire considered it \"one of the best sketches in recent SNL history\", while Erik Voss of Vulture said there was \"no better sendoff than a gay wedding between Stefon and Seth Meyers\".\nStefon has become a fan favorite and has been considered to be Hader's most memorable character on Saturday Night Live. During one of the character's earlier appearances, Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly observed that the character had quickly garnered widespread adoration. The character has been included in many lists of the best Saturday Night Live characters, ranking first in Rolling Stone's as well as TVLine's, second on MovieWeb's, and third on Entertainment Weekly's. Hader has frequently been approached by fans who claim to know someone who acts like Stefon. Due to the character's popularity, numerous online users have quoted him and written fan fiction about him.\nJoe Reid of Polygon thought that the character being written by Mulaney, who is a straight man, might be the reason why the gay community never embraced him. Joanna Campbell, the former executive director of Little People of America, has criticized the character's derogatory use of the term \"midget\". Hader has since expressed his regret for using the word.\n\n\nSee also\nList of recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches (introduced 2008–2009)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\nMiller, James Andrew; Shales, Tom (October 6, 2015).

    "summary": "Stefon Meyers (né Zolesky) is a fictional character portrayed by Bill Hader on the American sketch-comedy television show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Created by Hader and writer John Mulaney, Stefon is based on people Hader and Mulaney encountered in their daily lives, including a club promoter and a barista. Stefon first appeared in the sketch \"Movie Pitch with Stefon\" on the November 1, 2008, episode hosted by Ben Affleck, later becoming a recurring character on Weekend Update from 2010 until 2013.\nStefon is described as a \"city correspondent\"; when asked about recommendations for events and destinations in New York City, Stefon suggests unusual nightclubs and parties with bizarre characters and themes. The character is also shown to be infatuated with the Weekend Update anchor, Seth Meyers, and in his final appearance as a recurring character, the two proclaimed their love for each other. Because lines for Weekend Update are read from cue cards, Mulaney constantly changed the script prior to the live broadcast to make Hader break character.\nWidely regarded as Hader's most memorable character on Saturday Night Live, Stefon has become a fan favorite and has made multiple guest appearances since Hader left the show; however, the character has also been criticized due to his stereotypical nature.",

    "text": "Perrier ( PERR-ee-ay, also US:  -⁠AY; French: [pɛʁje]) is a French brand of bottled water marketed as coming from its source in Vergèze, located in the Gard department. Perrier was part of the Perrier Vittel Group SA, which became Nestlé Waters France after the acquisition of the company by Nestlé in 1992.\n\n\nOverview\nThe spring from which Perrier water is sourced is naturally carbonated, but the water and natural carbon dioxide gas are obtained independently. The water is then purified, and during bottling, the carbon dioxide gas is re-added so that the level of carbonation in bottled Perrier matches that of the Vergèze spring.\nIn 1990, Perrier removed the \"naturally sparkling\" claim from its bottles under pressure from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nSince at least 2019, Perrier water is no longer \"reinforced with gas from the source\" but \"with the addition of carbon dioxide\". According to the company, this change allows it to considerably reduce its total water consumption and reduce its ecological impact.\nIn 2024, it was revealed by Radio France and Le Monde that Perrier water, as well as a third of French mineral water brands, was no longer meeting the standards for mineral water due to undergoing prohibited purification techniques.\n\n\nHistory\nThe spring in Southern France from which Perrier is drawn was originally known as Les Bouillens (The Bubbles). It had been used as a spa since Roman times. According to the company, Hannibal and his army, having passed through Spain en route to his intended conquest of Rome   during 218 BC, decided to rest for a while at Les Bouillens, from which the men took water for refreshment. \nPerrier was first introduced to Britain during 1863. Local doctor Louis Perrier bought the spring in 1898 and operated a commercial spa there; he also bottled the water for sale. He later sold the spring to St John Harmsworth, a wealthy British visitor. Harmsworth was the younger brother of the newspaper magnates Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothermere. He had come to France to learn the language. Dr. Perrier showed him the spring, and he decided to buy it. He sold his share of the family newspapers to raise the money. Harmsworth closed the spa, as spas were becoming unfashionable. He renamed the spring Source Perrier and started bottling the water in distinctive green bottles.\n\nHarmsworth marketed the product in Britain at a time when Frenchness was seen as chic and aspirational to the middle classes. It was advertised as the Champagne of mineral water. Advertising in newspapers like the Daily Mail established the brand. For a time, 95% of sales were in Britain and the US.\nPerrier's reputation for purity suffered a blow in 1990 when a laboratory in North Carolina in the United States found benzene, a carcinogen, in several bottles. Perrier stated that it was an isolated incident of a worker having made a mistake in filtering and that the spring itself was unpolluted. The incident ultimately led to the worldwide withdrawal of the product, some 160 million bottles of Perrier.\nTwo years later in 1992, Perrier was bought by Nestlé, one of the world's leading food and drink companies. Nestlé had to contend with competition from the Agnelli family for ownership of the business.\nIn 2004, a crisis erupted when Nestlé announced a restructuring plan for Perrier. The following year, Perrier was ordered to halt restructuring due to a failure to consult adequately with staff.\nIn April 2024, following reports that products had been contaminated with germs of possible faecal origin, an estimated 2.9 million bottles of Perrier water were destroyed before reaching the market. This was followed by an announcement in June that year that one-litre bottles of Perrier Vert would be pulled from the French market after a majority of wells used to capture the water at the Vergèze manufacturing site had their use terminated, suspended or diverted to other product lines, following a product safety inspection at the manufacturing site on 30 May conducted by government agencies.\n\n\nBottling\nPerrier is available in 750 ml, 330 ml, and 200 ml glass bottles in Europe, as well as in 330 ml cans. In other markets, the 250 ml can is also available. Perrier bottles all have a distinctive 'teardrop' shape and are a signature green colour. In August 2001, the company introduced a new bottling format using polyethylene terephthalate to offer Perrier in plastic, a change that was researched for 11 years to determine which material would best help retain both the water's flavour and its purported \"50 million bubbles.\"\nIn 2013, Perrier celebrated its 150th anniversary by launching a limited edition series of bottles inspired by Andy Warhol.\nIn 2019, Perrier released Perrier ARTXTRA limited edition packaging featuring artwork of artist duo Dabsmyla  to help support the contemporary artist community.\n\n\nVarieties\nPerrier comes in several flavours: Natural, Lemon, and Lime have been on the market for many years, and in 2007, Citron Lemon-Lime and Pamplemousse Rose (Pink Grapefruit) flavours debuted in the United States. In 2015, a Green Apple flavour was launched in France as well as the US. In 2016, a Mint flavour (Saveur Menthe) was introduced in France.\nSince 2002, new varieties of Perrier have been introduced in France, for example, Eau de Perrier is less carbonated than the original, and comes in a blue bottle. Perrier Fluo comes in flavours such as ginger-cherry, peppermint, orange-lychee, raspberry, and ginger-lemon.\nIn 2017, Perrier introduced two new flavours, Perrier Strawberry and Perrier Watermelon, to their existing Lime, L’Orange, Pink Grapefruit, and Green Apple flavour.\n\n\nDistribution\nAs of January 2013, Perrier was available in 140 countries, and almost 1 billion bottles are sold every year.\n\n\nThe Perrier Awards\nFrom 1981 to 2005, the company sponsored an annual comedy award in the United Kingdom, the Perrier Comedy Award, also known as \"The Perriers\". It was described as a means of supporting young comedic talent at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, an arts festival touted as \"the world's largest\".  Initially for comedy reviews, by 1987 this included a standup comedian award. The award's sponsorship was taken over by various other advertisers starting in 2006 with commensurate renaming, and it eventually came to be called the Edinburgh Comedy Awards.\nThe Perrier Young Jazz Awards were set up by Perrier in 1998, though never attained the success and recognition of their longer running comedy equivalent. The awards ran for four years, releasing an album showcasing its winners each year, before being discontinued. The last year the awards ceremony ran was 2001.\n\n\nSee also\nApollinaris (water)\nBadoit\nEvian\nFarris\nGerolsteiner Brunnen\nAcqua Panna\nRamlösa\nSpa\nClearly Canadian\nVärska\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nFox, Barry (November 19, 1988), \"Secrets of the Source\", New Scientist, 120 (1639): 45–48, retrieved July 15, 2010\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2269992",
    "text": "The Cinema of Portugal started with the birth of the medium in the late 19th century. Cinema was introduced in Portugal in 1896 with the screening of foreign films and the first Portuguese film was Saída do Pessoal Operário da Fábrica Confiança, made in the same year. The first movie theater opened in 1904 and the first scripted Portuguese film was O Rapto de Uma Actriz (1907). The first all-talking sound film, A Severa, was made in 1931. Starting in 1933, with A Canção de Lisboa, the Golden Age would last the next two decades, with films such as O Pátio das Cantigas (1942) and A Menina da Rádio (1944). Aniki-Bóbó (1942), Manoel de Oliveira's first feature film, marked a milestone, with a realist style predating Italian neorealism by a few years. In the 1950s the industry stagnated. The early 1960s saw the birth of the Cinema Novo (literally \"New Cinema\") movement, showing realism in film, in the vein of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, with films like Dom Roberto (1962) and Os Verdes Anos (1963). The movement became particularly relevant after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. In 1989, João César Monteiro's Recordações da Casa Amarela won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and in 2009, João Salaviza's Arena won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Several other Portuguese films have been in competition for major film awards like the Palme d'Or and the Golden Bear. João Sete Sete (2006) was the first Portuguese animated feature film. Portuguese cinema is significantly supported by the State, with the government's Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual giving films financial support.\n\n\nSilent films\nPortuguese film history began on 18 June 1896, at the Real Colyseu da Rua da Palma nº 288, in Lisbon, when Edwin Rousby presented Robert William Paul's Animatograph, using a Teatrograph projector. This places the debut of film in Portugal around six months after the Lumière brothers' inaugural presentation in Paris.\n\n\nEarly days\nThe Portuguese audience was familiar with photographic projection, first from cycloramas, dioramas and stereoscopic views and, later, from the magic lantern, with the projection of transparent photographs through a glass plate then coloured. On 28 December 1894, the German photographer Carlos Eisenlohr opened his \"Imperial Exhibition\" at the galleries of the Avenida Palace Hotel. He presented a novelty to this already knowledgeable Lisbon audience: the live photograph – shown not through an Edison Kinetograph, as announced at the time, but by the Elektrotachyscop or Schnellseher, also called the Electro-Tachiscópio Eisenlohr, an invention by Ottomar Anschutz. The device projected images of actions, of a dog passing by or the galloping of a horse, contained in small disks that produced moving images of extremely short periods.\nIn the beginning of 1895, the tobacco shop Tabacaria Neves presented Edison's Kinetoscope (in fact, a copy of said invention, built in London by Robert William Paul, ordered by the Greek George Georgiades, who presented the machine in Lisbon). Unlike preceding inventions, the Kinestoscope allowed individual viewing and a film made up of 1,380 photographs enabling a 20-second projection of 20 seconds.\nThe machine that was used for movies at the Real Colyseu was not the Lumiére brothers' Cinematograph, but a competitor, the Theatrograph, by Robert W. Paul. The machine projected behind the screen, allowing life-size images to appear for about a minute. The first presentation of it was well-received and in the following months, many of the same machines swirled in the cinemas of Lisbon, vying for the favour of movie audiences.\nAt the Real Colyseu of the Rua da Palma of António Santos Júnior, on 18 June 1896, Edwin Rousby showed films by Robert William Paul's production house, for whom Rousby worked. About a minute in length each, these \"animated views\" were shot by operators who worked for the British producer: \"Parisian balls\", \"The Pont Neuf in Paris\", \"The Train\", \"The Serpentine Dance\", \"A Barber and Shoeshine Store in Washington\".\nRousby then met Manuel Maria da Costa Veiga, a photographer with electrical and mechanical skills, who assisted him in preparing his sessions. Costa Veiga himself began acting as an exhibitor, acquiring a projectoscope from Edison that same year and showing films in Lisbon venues.\nRobert W. Paul also sent his operator Henry Short to southern Europe, to record the animated views of landscapes for use by the English producing house. Short passed through Portugal, registering several views that, although destined to be shown in London, would be integrated into Rousby's program at his Portuguese sessions in 1897.\nHis success is overwhelming, and he prolonged his stays in Portugal and increased the sessions.  However, when Rousby proceeded with his tour to the Teatro-Circo Príncipe Real, in Porto, the animated photograph also gained a professional who would go on to found Portuguese cinema: Aurélio da Paz dos Reis.\n\nFrom July to August, Rousby presented his films at the Teatro do Príncipe Real (now the Teatro Sá da Bandeira), without achieving, however, the level of success in Lisbon.\n\n\nPioneers and the producing houses\nThree years after beginning his exhibition business, Costa Veiga purchased a movie camera and made first film, Aspectos da Praia de Cascais (\"Views of the Cascais beach\"), with images of King D. Carlos bathing in Cascais. He began recording official visits and other relevant national political events. He founded the first Portuguese production house, Portugal Film, headquartered close to his home in Algés.\nIn 1909, Portugália Film, made up of João Freire Correia and Manuel Cardoso, was established in Lisbon, financed by D. Nuno de Almada, and the \"Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal,\" Júlio Costa. Freire Correia, a photographer, bought a projector for the opening of the Salão Ideal ao Loreto in 1904, the first Portuguese cinema. He founded his production company five years later, for which he'd make several films, including Batalha de Flores (\"Battle of Flowers\") that garnered vast success. He was also the cinematographer of O Rapto de Uma Actriz (\"The kidnapping of an Actress\"), the first scripted Portuguese film, directed by Lino Ferreira in 1907.\nFreire Correia directed two documentaries of significant success in 1909: A Cavalaria Portuguesa (\"The Portuguese Cavalry\") and the O Terramoto de Benavente (\"The Earthquake of Benavente\"). The first already showed some technique of image capturing, displaying the prowess of Portuguese cavalry in such a way to create a sense of danger, however fictitious, to the audience. The earthquake was filmed in April, and shown two days later – a remarkable speed – and 22 copies were exported abroad. He would also be responsible for the production of two versions of Os Crimes de Diogo Alves (\"The Crimes of Diogo Alves\"), whose direction he entrusted first to Lino Ferreira in 1909 but that remained incomplete, and a second with João Tavares directing one in 1911.\nEarly notable attempts at sound films include the incomplete Grisette (1908) directed by Freire Correia used adaptations of the Gaumont method by which he attempted to synchronise image and sound. Portugália also produced the first film adaptation of a literary work: Carlota Ângela was based in the work of the same name by Camilo Castelo Branco and was directed by João Tavares, in 1912.\nJúlio Costa, partnering with João Almeida, acquired the Salão Ideal from Freire Correia and Nuno Almada in 1908 and started the Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal production and distribution house. Remodelled and appropriately refitted, the Salão Ideal presented a predecessor of the talkies, the \"Animatógrafo Falado\" (Spoken Animatograph), where a group of people read the script and produced sound in synch with the film's projection. The group was made up of volunteer firefighters of Ajuda, of which not only Júlio Costa but also António Silva, the actor of the Portuguese Golden Age comedies, were members.\nWhile waiting for the construction of his studio at Rua Marquês Ponte de Lima, Júlio Costa began filming \"views\". He begins filming features with Chantecler Atraiçoado (\"Chantecler Betrayed\") and then with Rainha depois de Morta (\"Queen After Dead\"), by Carlos Santos, the first Portuguese film with a historic motif. Júlio Costa's company pioneered grouping, production, distribution and exhibition, together for the first time. The company would halt activity after a suspicious fire.\nIn 1918, Lusitânia Film was founded, a production company with an ambitious outlook, led by Celestino Soares and Luís Reis Santos. They remodelled the old Portugália Film studio, in São Bento, and began filming documentaries. The same year, two short films are made outdoors by Costa Veigam, directed by the young Leitão de Barros: Malmequer (\"Daisy\") and Mal de Espanha (\"Evil From Spain\"). The shooting of O Homem dos Olhos Tortos (\"The Man with the Twisted Eyes\") began, the story based on a Reinaldo Ferreira police serial and directed by Leitão de Barros. However, due to financial pressures, the film was never completed. A well-organized conspiracy would close down the company that intended to film A Severa as its next production.\nAfter the closing of the \"cycle of Lisbon\", the first Porto production house was founded, which ensured for some years the continuous production of cinema in the country.\n\n\nForeign cinematographers\nAfter founding a production company bearing his name in 1910, the Porto exhibitor Nunes de Mattos, added Invicta Film to its corporate name two years later. The company filmed current events and documentaries, among them O Naufrágio do Silurian (\"The Sinking of the Silurian\"), of which 108 copies were shipped to Europe. In November 1917, de Mattos founded the second \"Invicta Film, Lda\", increasing the number of partners and equity. Henrique Alegria took over art direction and they acquired the Quinta da Prelada, in Porto, where the studios and laboratories of the producer were built.\nIn 1918 they left for Paris, and brought back a technical team from the Pathé studios led by Georges Pallu, a director who would author virtually all the feature films of the Porto producing house. Also in the team were André Lecointe, architect-decorator; Albert Durot, camera operator and Georges and Valentine Coutable – the couple who would be, respectively, the chief lab and chief editor. Durot would later be replaced by Maurice Laumann, also from Pathé.\nFor six years, Invicta Film produced several films and documentaries, enriching the Portuguese film landscape. In 1924, however, the company experienced severe financial distress, leading to the laying off all its personnel and continuing only lab work. They shut down in 1928.\nRino Lupo, another milestone of cinematography, showed up on the scene through Pallu, who approved his direction of Mulheres da Beira (\"Women from Beira\"), after a tale by Abel Botelho, with photography by Artur Costa de Macedo. Though the financial disagreements and the unfulfilment of deadlines forced his removal from the company, Lupo still directed Os Lobos (\"The Wolves\"), another pearl of the Portuguese silent cinema. He directed others, but without the quality of his earlier works.\nThree other companies are set up in the '20s to fill in the studios gap: Caldevilla Film, Fortuna Film and Pátria Film. These also follow the Portuguese pattern, hiring foreign technicians for their experience in Portuguese productions. Although the directors brought from French production houses were presented as recognised stars in their countries, in fact, they often built their careers without having the claimed background.\nRaul de Caldevilla founded in 1920 his Caldevilla Film, placing production in Lisbon, at Quinta das Conchas, in Lumiar. Frenchman Maurice Mariaud was the director chosen for the works Os Faroleiros (\"The Lighthouse Men\") and As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor (\"The Wards of the Dean\"), for the studio's only two productions. The company would shut down due to an acute financial disagreement among its partners.\nVirgínia de Castro e Almeida, a children's book writer, founded in Lisbon the studio Fortuna Film, and hires a French lawyer, Roger Lion, to direct productions based upon her books. Lion brought along his wife, actress Gil-Clary, Maxudian, and the cameramen Daniel Quintin and Marcel Bizot, and they shoot A Sereia de Pedra (\"The Stone Mermaid\") and Olhos da Alma (\"Eyes of the Soul\"), the latter shot in Nazaré, in what was its first screen register.\nHenrique Alegria left Invicta Film in 1922, to found Pátria Film with Raul Lopes Freire. They bought Quinta das Conchas, where Maurice Mariaud directs O Fado. This company too would cease to operate after shooting Aventuras de Agapito – Fotografia Comprometedora (\"Adventures of Agapito – Compromising Photograph\"), the fourth film directed by Roger Lion in Portugal.\n\n\nNew generation\nAt the end of the twenties, the \"young Turks\" begin the era of the cinema estates, with the return of Leitão de Barros and the emergence of young António Lopes Ribeiro (who would soon launch Manoel de Oliveira), Jorge Brum do Canto, Chianca de Garcia and Arthur Duarte. Their agenda was to move away from the previous productions, taking inspiration in the aesthetic designs of the French, German and Russian cinemas. Casts also follow this move, bringing to the screen the stars of the Revista, in contrast to the theatre world. Stars such as Eduardo Brazão, Brunilde Júdice, António Pinheiro or Pato Moniz fade, and a new school emerges with the presence of Vasco Santana, António Silva, Maria Matos, Ribeirinho or Maria Olguim.\nAt the same time, the state's relationship with cinema was also to change from the end of the '20s. The installed powers understood these young people dominated the cinema press and influenced the masses with their perspectives and wisely viewed the industry as a privileged means of propaganda for their new regime.\nAntónio Lopes Ribeiro launched his career benefiting from the 100 meters law. He films Uma Batida em Malpique (\"A huntin Malpique\") and Bailando ao Sol (\"Dancing in the Sun\") (1928), the latter with photography by Aníbal Contreiras. He later departed with Leitão de Barros in a visit to the main European studios, where he'll meet Dziga Vertov and Eisenstein.\nDe Barros, who screened at Lopes Ribeiro's home the 9,5 mm film he had made with his brother-in-law in Nazaré, was spurred by the trip and returned to filming with Nazaré, Praia de Pescadores (\"Nazaré, Beach of Fishermen\"). Again in Nazaré, de Barros films Maria do Mar (\"Mary of the Sea\"), the second ethnofiction in cinema history, and a milestone for up until then bleak Portuguese cinematography aesthetics. He also directed Lisboa, Crónica Anedótica (\"Lisbon, an Anecdotal Chronicle\") (1929), where in a series of multiple city scenes, he displays Chaby Pinheiro, repeat stars Adelina Abranches and Alves da Cunha, Nascimento Fernandes, and the unforgettable Vasco Santana and Beatriz Costa.\nInspired by Marcel l'Herbier, Jorge Brum do Canto opened with A Dança dos Paroxismos (\"The Dance of the Paroxisms\") in 1928, playing the main role with his own script. It opened only to a private audience in 1930, however, to only be seen again in 1984.\nManoel de Oliveira shot Douro, Faina Fluvial (\"Douro, River Works\"), with Lopes Ribeiro persuading him to take it to the V International Critics Congress, where it received the praise of Pirandello. But again it will be Leitão de Barros who leaves an imprint in movie history, with A Severa, based upon the work by Júlio Dantas, with the direction of the first Portuguese talkie. A new era of Portuguese cinema was about to begin.\n\n\nSound films\n\n\n1930s–1940s\n\nEstablished on June 3, 1932, Tobis Portuguesa would become one of the largest film production and lab processing companies in the country.  It would produce many of the major works in Portuguese cinema for three decades.\nWith the beginning of the Estado Novo right-wing dictatorship in 1933, a new genre of film started, based on the comedy and musical genres, famously the \"comédia à portuguesa\", with the focus on contemporary life and light matters, and the intention of taking the minds of the people from the difficult times faced.\n1942 saw the release of Aniki-Bóbó, the first full-length fictional film from Manoel de Oliveira, who would only return to fiction film-making twenty-one years later. It marked a milestone in Portuguese film not only because it differed from the tone most in vogue at the time, as it dealt with social issues, but also because it predated the first Italian neo-realism movies by a few years.\nThe Golden Age, as it is known, began that same year with the release of A Canção de Lisboa, and dominated the country for the next two decades. Other famous titles from this popular era are Aldeia da Roupa Branca (1938), O Pátio das Cantigas and O Pai Tirano (1941), O Costa do Castelo (1943), A Menina da Rádio (1944) and O Leão da Estrela (1947).\nDuring this period historic films also emerged as an important genre in the Portuguese industry, as a medium for the state party to develop its nationalist propaganda and conservative values, namely As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor (1935), Bocage (1936), Amor de Perdição (1943), Inês de Castro (1945), Camões (1946) and Frei Luís de Sousa (1950). A subgenre of these nationalist films were those related to the culture of Fado and the rise to popularity of Amália Rodrigues, the great name of Portuguese song. Some of those films were Capas Negras and Fado, História de Uma Cantadeira, both from 1947.\nCamões, directed by José Leitão de Barros, was an official selection at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946.\n\n\n1950s\n\nThe Fifties were mainly years of stagnation with the continuity of the same movies made in the earlier decades, government censorship and glorification of the colonial empire – see Chaimite (1953); although the first signs of the winds to come were being given by films like Saltimbancos (1951) and Nazaré (1952), both directed by Manuel Guimarães and inspired by the Italian neo-realism.\nIn 1958 opens the Portuguese Cinematheque with a retrospective of American movies that inspired the French filmmakers of the Nouvelle Vague, an event lauded by then new critics Alberto Seixas Santos e António Pedro Vasconcelos.\nIn 1959 Portuguese Rhapsody, directed by João Mendes, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n1960s–1970s\n\nThe new decade brought a new generation of films, led by Dom Roberto (1962), Os Verdes Anos and Pássaros de Asas Cortadas (1963). The new phase was named Cinema Novo or Novo Cinema (New Cinema), and it refers to Portuguese cinema made between 1963 and the revolution in 1974 by directors such as Fernando Lopes, Paulo Rocha or António da Cunha Telles, amongst others. Like other new waves of the period, the influence of Italian Neo-Realism and the burgeoning ideas of the Nouvelle Vague could be felt keenly.\nThe term Novo Cinema is now used to avoid confusion with the Brazilian movement of the same name. This movement gains particular relevance after the Carnation Revolution, pursuing certain experiences of the French New Wave, both in the field of visual anthropology and of political cinema. The generation of the seventies, taking advantage of the new liberties, explores realism and legend, politics and ethnography, until the late eighties, in conjunction with some directors of the liberated colonies, such as Flora Gomes. Portugal has a notable tradition in the field of docufiction and ethnofiction since Leitão de Barros, who was a contemporary of Robert Flaherty.\nFilms during this period also include Belarmino (1964), Domingo à Tarde (1965), Sete balas para Selma (1967) and O Cerco (1969). In 1973 The Vows, directed by António de Macedo, was in competition for the Grand Prix at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n1980s\n\nA Ilha dos Amores, directed by Paulo Rocha, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Other accolades from this period include, in 1985 Manoel de Oliveira winning an Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival; O Bobo, directed by José Álvaro Morais, winning the Golden Leopard at the 1987 Locarno International Film Festival; The Cannibals, directed by de Oliveira, in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival; and in 1989 Recordações da Casa Amarela, directed by João César Monteiro, winning the Silver Lion at the 46th Venice International Film Festival.\n\n\n1990s\n\nIn 1994 Maria de Medeiros won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 51st Venice International Film Festival for her work in Três Irmãos, directed by Teresa Villaverde. The Convent, directed by Manoel de Oliveira, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Po di Sangui, directed by Flora Gomes, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. In 1997 Genealogies of a Crime, directed by Raúl Ruiz, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. The Letter, directed by Manoel de Oliveira, was in competition for the Palme d'Or and it won the Jury Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Time Regained, directed by Raúl Ruiz, was also in competition for the Palme d'Or.\n\n\n2000s\n\nNotable accolades of this decade were I'm Going Home, directed by Manoel de Oliveira, in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival; The Uncertainty Principle, also directed by de Oliveira, was in competition for the same award the following year. In 2004 de Oliveira won an Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\nIn 2005, thirteen Portuguese feature films released, one an animation co-produced with Spain, Midsummer Dream. The most successful film of the year was O Crime do Padre Amaro, with more than 300,000 viewers and grossing more than 1.3 million euros. The following year, 22 feature films were released, five of them documentaries. The most successful film that year was Filme da Treta, with more than 270,000 viewers, grossing more than 1 million euros. In 2006 there were 19 feature films produced. In 2007, 15, in 2008, 21 and in 2009, 23. Colossal Youth, directed by Pedro Costa, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Three years later, Arena, directed by João Salaviza, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe first Portuguese animated feature film, João Sete Sete, premiered in 2006 on Cinanima.\n\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2010 Portugal produced 22 feature films. The next year, it produced 19, with the most commercially successful being Blood of My Blood by João Canijo with 20,953 views and a gross of €97,800. The share of native cinema at the Portuguese box office was 0.7%.\nOn the artistic side, one of the most successful films was Joaquim Sapinho's This Side of Resurrection, which premiered at the Visions programme at the Toronto International Film Festival with a US premiere at the Harvard Film Archive in Boston.\nAt the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, in 2012, Tabu, directed by Miguel Gomes, was in competition for the Golden Bear and Rafa, directed by João Salaviza, won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film. The Lines of Wellington was in competition for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. The highest grossing Portuguese film of the decade was O Pátio das Cantigas with a €3.1 million gross, followed by 7 Pecados Rurais with €1.676 million.\n\n\nFestivals\nMOTELx: Lisbon International Horror Film Festival\nLisbon & Estoril Film Festival\nIndieLisboa\nCurtas Vila do Conde - International Film Festival\nDocLisboa\nMonstra\nCaminhos do Cinema Português\nFantasporto\n\n\nSee also\nList of Portuguese films\nList of Portuguese film directors\nList of Portuguese film actors\nList of film festivals in Portugal\nSophia Awards\nCinemateca Portuguesa\nCinema of the world\nThe School of Reis\nMedia of Portugal\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n(in Portuguese) Cinema – bibliography by José de Matos-Cruz\n(in Portuguese) Silent film at Amor de Perdição.\nRibeiro, Félix O Cinema Português antes do Sonoro, Esboço Históriconema Português, Terra Livre, Lisbon, Portugal, 1978.\nRibeiro, Félix, Panorama do Cinema Português, Lisbon, Portugal.\nBandeira, José Gomes, Porto: 100 anos de cinema português, Câmara Municipal do Porto, Porto, Portugal, 1996.\nAntunes, João and Matos-Cruz, José de, Cinema Português 1896–1998, Lusomundo, Lisbon, Portugal, 1997.\nDuarte, Fernando, Primitivos do Cinema Português, ed.

    "summary": "The Cinema of Portugal started with the birth of the medium in the late 19th century. Cinema was introduced in Portugal in 1896 with the screening of foreign films and the first Portuguese film was Saída do Pessoal Operário da Fábrica Confiança, made in the same year. The first movie theater opened in 1904 and the first scripted Portuguese film was O Rapto de Uma Actriz (1907). The first all-talking sound film, A Severa, was made in 1931. Starting in 1933, with A Canção de Lisboa, the Golden Age would last the next two decades, with films such as O Pátio das Cantigas (1942) and A Menina da Rádio (1944). Aniki-Bóbó (1942), Manoel de Oliveira's first feature film, marked a milestone, with a realist style predating Italian neorealism by a few years. In the 1950s the industry stagnated. The early 1960s saw the birth of the Cinema Novo (literally \"New Cinema\") movement, showing realism in film, in the vein of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, with films like Dom Roberto (1962) and Os Verdes Anos (1963). The movement became particularly relevant after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. In 1989, João César Monteiro's Recordações da Casa Amarela won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and in 2009, João Salaviza's Arena won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Several other Portuguese films have been in competition for major film awards like the Palme d'Or and the Golden Bear. João Sete Sete (2006) was the first Portuguese animated feature film. Portuguese cinema is significantly supported by the State, with the government's Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual giving films financial support.",

The season began on October 5, 2025, and is set to conclude in December 2026.\nThe first activity of the season was the PBA season 50 draft on September 7. The Philippine Cup acts as the season-opening conference. This is then followed by the Commissioner's Cup and the season-ending Governors' Cup.\nThis is also be the first season of competition for the Titan Ultra Giant Risers, after Pureblends Corporation acquired the NorthPort Batang Pier franchise in October.\n\n\n50th anniversary events\nThe league's golden anniversary celebrations will continue into this season. The season logo in gold was unveiled on February 10. There will also be a reunion of its 50 Greatest Players for the opening ceremony, ten of which were added last season.\nThe league also play international games for the first time since the 2019 season. A selection of games will be held in the United Arab Emirates and in Bahrain throughout the season. Also planned are exhibition games against teams from Japan's B.League.\n\n\nSeason changes\nThe order of the league's three conferences was reverted to the traditional order for the first time since the 2022–23 PBA season. The Philippine Cup is the first conference of the season, after it was held as the last conference in each of the last two seasons. The Commissioner's Cup will be the second conference and the Governors' Cup will be the season-ending conference. The eighth-seed playoff game no longer be held, meaning that the final playoff berth always be determined by tiebreakers.\nDue to the third window of 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers in July 2026 and the 2026 Asian Games in September, the league plans to hold a mid-season pocket tournament which will feature two foreign teams.

    "text": "Kenvue Inc. is an American consumer health company. Formerly the Consumer Healthcare division of Johnson & Johnson, Kenvue owns well-known brands such as Aveeno, Band-Aid, Benadryl, Combantrin, Zyrtec, Johnson's, Listerine, Lactaid, Mylanta, Neutrogena, Trosyd, Calpol, Tylenol, and Visine. Kenvue is incorporated in Delaware and was originally headquartered in the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, New Jersey, before relocating to Summit, New Jersey.\nJohnson & Johnson announced in November 2021 that it would spin off its consumer health division as a separate company. The new company was named Kenvue in September 2022, and its initial public offering took place in May 2023, raising $3.8 billion in the largest U.S. IPO since 2021, with an initial valuation of about $41 billion. Johnson & Johnson initially retained more than 90% ownership before completing a full separation through a share exchange in July 2023. Kenvue was subsequently added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index.\nKenvue employed about 22,200 people in 2022 and was first led by CEO Thibaut Mongon. Following Mongon’s termination in 2025, Kirk Perry was named interim CEO. The company has also faced controversy, including a securities class action filed in 2023 alleging misleading disclosures regarding risks related to phenylephrine, which led to its stock trading below IPO levels.\nOn November 3, 2025, Kimberly-Clark announced that it was acquiring Kenvue for a total enterprise value of US$48.7 billion. The acquisition is expected to close around the second half of 2026.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nSpin-off and IPO\nOn November 12, 2021, Johnson & Johnson announced that it would spin off its consumer health division as a separate company, in an effort to streamline operations. The new company would assume well-known consumer brands such as Aveeno, Band-Aid, Neutrogena, and Tylenol, while Johnson & Johnson would focus on the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors. CEO Alex Gorsky said that the split was in response to \"a significant evolution in these markets, particularly on the consumer side\", and would enable faster expansion for both businesses.\nOther pharmaceutical companies that made similar moves around this time included Merck & Co., which sold its consumer health business to Bayer in 2014, and Pfizer, which merged its consumer health division with that of GSK plc in 2019. The November 2021 announcement also occurred the same week that General Electric and Toshiba each announced that they would split into multiple entities.\nThe New York Times noted that Johnson & Johnson had long benefited from a \"halo effect\", namely a lingering positive connotation ascribed to the company name stemming from its popular household brands such as Johnson's Baby, but that its reputation had declined as a result of various controversies in recent years; Johnson & Johnson was the subject of litigation over its role in the opioid epidemic in the United States, as well as over allegations that its talc-based baby powder contained asbestos and caused ovarian cancer for some consumers. The spin-off was seen as an effort to move past these controversies and assuage shareholder apprehension.\nThe Times also pointed out that, while the consumer health business operates many well-known brands, it was not nearly as lucrative as the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, taking $15 billion in revenue in 2021 compared to the latter's combined $77 billion, and commented that the popularity of the consumer brands \"does not do much to advance Johnson & Johnson's medical businesses, which are far more important to the company's finances\".\nOn February 23, 2022, the consumer health business was registered as a corporation in Delaware, under the provisional name JNTL, Inc. On September 28, 2022, Johnson & Johnson said that the new consumer health company would be called Kenvue, a combination of \"ken\", a Scottish English word for 'knowledge', and \"vue\", a homophone of \"view\" intended to evoke the concept of 'sight'. At the time, Kenvue's total number of employees in was about 22,000.\nIn January 2023, Kenvue filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering (IPO). Kenvue issued about 1.89 billion shares, of which about 170 million were to be offered at the IPO. This meant that after the IPO, Johnson & Johnson would retain almost 91 percent of the shares.\nThe IPO took place on May 4, 2023. Shares of Kenvue were priced at $22, implying an initial equity valuation for Kenvue of about $41 billion, and traded at $26.90 at the end of the first trading day. Raising about $3.8 billion in capital for Kenvue, it was the largest IPO since the IPO of Rivian on November 10, 2021. The IPO was seen as a useful gauge of broader investor confidence. Observers cited rising interest rates and predictions of a looming recession to explain the slowdown in the U.S. IPO market since 2022, and said that Kenvue was an \"idiosyncratic\" IPO candidate as it was well-established, with an extensive track record of profitable years under its parent company. \nOn July 24, 2023, Johnson & Johnson launched an exchange offer to split-off Kenvue allowing Johnson & Johnson shareholders can exchange all, some or none of their shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue. \nIn August 2023, Kenvue was added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index.\nIn March 2025, following the purchase of a stake in the company by activist investment firm Starboard, Jeffrey Smith, the CEO, took a seat on Kenvue’s board of directors. In July 2025, Thibaut Mongon, the first CEO of Kenvue, was terminated, and a review of the company’s strategy was begun.\n\n\nAcquisition by Kimberly-Clark\nIn November 2025, Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products giant whose brands include Kleenex and Huggies, agreed to spend about $40 billion to acquire Kenvue. In terms of sales, the two companies had been roughly equal - in 2024, Kimberly-Clark had revenue of about $20.1 billion, while Kenvue's revenue was about $15.5 billion. The cash-and-stock deal will result in Kimberly-Clark shareholders owning about 54 percent of the new, combined company, with Kenvue shareholders owning about 46 percent.\n\n\nBrands\nConsumer brands operated by Kenvue include: the following:\n\nAveeno\nBand-Aid\nBenadryl\nBenylin\nCalpol\nClean & Clear\nCombantrin\nImodium\nJohnson's Baby\nLe Petit Marseillais\nListerine\nLubriderm\nMotrin\nNeosporin\nNeutrogena\nNicorette\nPepcid\nRogaine\nSudafed\nTrosyd\nTylenol\nVisine\nZyrtec\nVania\n\n\nControversy\nA securities class action was initiated in the United States District Court of New Jersey by law firm Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP on 9 October 2023. The action alleged that Kenvue was in violation of federal securities laws - having made fraudulent and misleading statements, including omissions, about the company's internal control and financial reporting. This was specifically in relation to Kenvue's Registration Statement which is said not to have disclosed information pertaining to possible risks and potential litigation regarding phenylephrine, its uses and efficacy. As a result, investors were informed of the lawsuit and noted significant losses. Kenvue shares closed at 9.6% below the IPO price, at $19.87.\n\n\nReferences\nInformational notes\n\nCitations\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nBusiness data for Kenvue Inc.:",

    "text": "The Sumer–Elam war took place across present-day Iraq and Iran and is one of the earliest conflicts for which contemporaneous, anecdotal evidence exists, though details of this war are slight. Fought between the forces of Sumer and Elam, it began c. 2600 BC. The written sources on the conflict are the earliest mentioning Elam's existence.\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to later Sumerian sources such as the Sumerian King List (SKL), the Sumerians led by Enmebaragesi, King of Kish, invaded Elam and were victorious. However, Enmebaragesi's identity and dating have been subject to some debate among researchers, while the Sumerian sources are not necessarily reliable. For instance, the SKL claims that Enmebaragesi ruled for 900 years. Despite this, contemporaneous fragments of alabaster vessels with Enmebaragesi's name (found at Khafajah) lend credence to the belief that the king was a historical figure, supporting the later texts' claims on the war's occurrence. Furthermore, a votive inscription by \"Enna'il, son of A'anzu\" from the Early Dynastic Period (extant as a later copy) mentions that Kish conquered Elam.\nAssyriologist D. T. Potts stated that if the war did happen, King Enmebaragesi possibly led his invasion army from Kish in northern Babylonia along a path which later became the Royal Road, until attacking the Elamite center at or around Susa. This path's use by Sumerians has been confirmed for the Early Dynastic Period. Within a century, the Elamites under the Awan dynasty retaliated and invaded Sumer, toppling the First Dynasty of Ur. Over the next few centuries, the two peoples repeatedly went to war.\n\n\nSee also\nUmma–Lagash war\nMari–Ebla war\nConquests of Sargon of Akkad\nList of conflicts in Iraq\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\nSelz, Gebhard J.

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15027652",
    "text": "The geology of Kansas encompasses the geologic history and the presently exposed rock and soil. Rock that crops out in the US state of Kansas was formed during the Phanerozoic eon, which consists of three geologic eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Paleozoic rocks at the surface in Kansas are primarily from the Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian periods.\n\n\nPaleozoic Era\nThe oldest rocks at the surface in Kansas are Mississippian rocks that consist of limestones, shale, dolomite, chert, sandstones, and siltstones.  The Mississippian consisted of an environment similar to present. Fast-moving streams and rivers cut into the limestone bedrock, and in some places, create caverns and sinkholes.  Pennsylvanian rocks consist predominantly of alternating marine and non-marine shales and limestones with some sandstone, coal, chert, and conglomerate. The Pennsylvanian was a time when the region that is now eastern Kansas stayed nearly at sea level.  Between the transgression and regression of the seas, swamps, and bogs formed, depositing dead vegetation and later, after burial under younger sediments, this dead vegetation formed into coal.  Permian rocks predominantly consist of limestones, shales, and evaporites. The Permian in Kansas began as an environment consisting of warm, shallow seas. As the Permian progressed, the climate became very dry and the seas began to subside, creating bodies of water shut off from the open seas, in turn creating areas for the generation of dark shales and evaporite minerals such as halite and gypsum as the waters evaporated.  The end of the Permian marks the largest extinction period in Earth's history; over 90% of all life disappeared.\n\n\nMesozoic Era\nMesozoic rocks at the surface of Kansas consist predominantly of rocks from the Cretaceous. A relatively small outcrop of Jurassic sediments is exposed in the southwest corner of the state. Cretaceous age rocks consist of limestone, chalk, shale, and sandstone. The Cretaceous in Kansas was an open ocean or sea environment dominated by microscopic marine plants and animals that floated or swam near the surface of this ancient water body.  As these microscopic creatures died, they sank to the bottom, formed a soft, limy ooze, and would preserve any larger creatures that died and sank into it.\n\n\nCenozoic Era\nCenozoic rocks at the surface were formed during the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary periods. Paleogene to Neogene rocks in Kansas consist of river silt, sand, freshwater limestones, and some volcanic ash derived from eruptions in the western United States. Near the beginning of the Paleogene, the Rocky Mountains were formed, as were the streams and rivers heading eastward out from the mountains into Kansas. Over 60 million years of erosion, the Rocky Mountains created a wedge of material extending to the Flint Hills of eastern Kansas.  Quaternary rocks in Kansas consist of these: glacial drift; river silt, sand, and gravel; dune sand; and wind-blown silt.  The Quaternary Period in western Kansas was very similar to the Neogene, continual erosion of the Rocky Mountains deposited additional sediments.\n\n\nPhysiographic regions\n\nKansas has been divided into eleven different physiographic regions.\n\n\nOzark plateau\n\nMississippian limestones and cherts of the Ozark Plateau are exposed in extreme southeastern Kansas in Cherokee County. This area was part of the Tri-state district of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Galena was a center of lead and zinc mining in the area.\n\n\nCherokee lowlands\nThe Cherokee lowlands is a region of southeast Kansas immediately north and west of the Ozark plateau in Cherokee, Labette, Crawford and Bourbon Counties. The lowlands are developed on areas of gently rolling hills developed on the shale and sandstone of the Cherokee Group of the Pennsylvanian age. The Cherokee Group is noted for rich deposits of coal in Kansas and across the midwestern United States.\n\n\nOsage Cuestas\nThe Osage cuesta region underlies twenty counties in southeastern Kansas. The cuestas are a region of east to southeast facing escarpments (50 to 200 feet [15 to 61 m] high) formed on resistant limestone units which dip gently to the west and northwest. Areas between escarpments are underlain by shales. The cuesta region contains coal, black shale and some oil shales. Lamproite sills occur within the cuesta units of Woodson and Wilson counties. These unusual igneous rocks were intruded in the Cretaceous Period.\n\n\nChautauqua Hills\nThe Chautauqua Hills represent a narrow region in southeast Kansas of sandstone-capped ridges and rolling hills. The Pennsylvanian age sandstones were deposited in a large river valley. The sandstones are the Tonganoxie Sandstone Member of the Stranger Formation and the Ireland Sandstone Member of the Lawrence Formation. The hills occur in the western portions of Montgomery, Wilson and Woodson counties and the eastern edges of Chautauqua, Elk and Greenwood counties. The sandstones continue into northern Oklahoma.\n\n\nFlint Hills\n\nThe Flint Hills developed on the north–south exposure of Permian cherty limestones. The region extends from Marshall County in the north, to Cowley County and on into northern Oklahoma where they are known as the Osage Hills. The Permian limestones contain abundant weathering resistant chert (or flint) and the residuum and soils of the hilltops and the streambeds of the region contain abundant cherty gravels. Surface exposures of the rare igneous kimberlites occur in Riley and Marshall counties. The kimberlite diatremes are of Cretaceous age. No diamonds have been found in the Kansas kimberlite occurrences. Garnet crystals from the kimberlites have been reported in local stream gravels.\n\n\nRed Hills\n\nThe Red Hills cover a section of southern Kansas in Clark, Comanche, and Barber counties along the Oklahoma border. The Red Hills are named for their color derived from the Permian red beds which outcrop and underlie the region. The red color is produced by abundant iron oxides in the weathering sediments. The region is underlain by red shales, siltstones, and sandstones along with interbedded dolomites and gypsum evaporite layers. Massive gypsum deposits are mined near Sun City in northwestern Barber County. The Gyp Hills near Medicine Lodge were named for the gypsum of the Blaine Formation. The soluble gypsum, anhydrite and dolomite produce many caves in the area.  The Big Basin of Clark County is a 1.2-mile (2 km) diameter, 115-foot (35 m) deep, dissolution collapse feature that formed by the dissolution of salt beds in the subsurface.\n\n\nSmoky Hills\n\nThe Smoky Hills constitute a large area of north central Kansas. The area is underlain by Cretaceous sediments. Rocks outcropping in the area include the sandstones of the Dakota Formation, the Greenhorn Limestone, and the thick Niobrara Chalk. Stratigraphically the Dakota is overlain by the Greenhorn and that by the Niobrara. The Dakota outcrops in the eastern portion of the region as gently westward dipping resistant ridges. Although the sandstones are the most resistant and therefore most prominent the Dakota includes shales and clays. The formation contains abundant brown iron oxides and many concretions are found in the area. In the western portions of the area, the bedrock is fossiliferous chalk of the Niobrara Formation which includes the Smoky Hill Chalk member noted for abundant fish and marine reptile fossils.\n\n\nHigh Plains\n\nThe western third of Kansas is in the High Plains area. The highest point in Kansas, Mount Sunflower (4,039 feet (1,231 m)), is located in the High Plains physiographic region.  The tectonic uplift of the Rocky Mountains during the Cenozoic resulted in erosion and deposition of vast quantities of non-marine sediments eastward across the High Plains. The Ogallala Formation consists of a large wedge of unconsolidated sands and silts that is a significant aquifer under the plains. The Ogallala contains a sandstone layer cemented with opal. In the southwest corner of the state in Morton County rocks of Jurassic age outcrop along the Cimarron River. Loess deposits cover much of the High Plains in north and northwest Kansas.\n\n\nGlaciated Region\nThe northeast corner of the state, north of the Kansas River and east of the Big Blue River, is covered by glacial debris deposited during the Pre-Illinoian glaciations which occurred 600,000 years ago in the Pleistocene. The Pennsylvanian and Permian bedrock is buried under thick deposits of glacial debris, largely loess. A variety of glacial erratics were left by the melting glaciers. Many of these are of Sioux Quartzite carried south from the Sioux Falls, South Dakota area.\n\n\nWellington-McPherson Lowlands\nThe Wellington-McPherson Lowlands of south-central Kansas in Sumner, Sedgwick, Harvey and McPherson counties is underlain by fluvial sediments deposited in the ancestral Arkansas River valley during the Pleistocene Epoch one to two million years ago. The sediments consist largely of sands, silts, and gravel. These include the Equus Beds Aquifer sediments, named for the Pleistocene modern horse fossils they contain. Also under this area is the Permian Hutchinson salt bed which reaches a thickness of 400 feet (120 m). The area also contains inactive sand dunes.\n\n\nArkansas River Lowlands\nThe Arkansas River Lowlands follows the course of the Arkansas River through southwest and south-central Kansas. The broad floodplain contains large quantities of sand and silt carried from the Rocky Mountains by the river. A significant area of sand dunes occur on the south side of the plain formed by the prevailing winds from the glaciers to the north during the Pleistocene.\n\n\nSubsurface geology\n\nThe subsurface geology of Kansas consists of several sequences of sedimentary strata deposited on the Pre-Cambrian basement of the North American Craton.\nSeveral regional subsurface structures including five sedimentary basins exist under Kansas. These structures are important in controlling the vast deposits of petroleum and natural gas in the state. The Central Kansas Uplift is a broad arch in the rocks of west-central Kansas. The rock units within this arch have been major oil producers. The Anadarko Basin of southwest Kansas contains significant natural gas. The Sedgwick Basin, the Cherokee Basin and the Forest City Basin of south and east Kansas also produce petroleum and natural gas.\n\n\nProterozoic basement\n\nThe Nemaha uplift is a deep fault zone which runs diagonally across east Kansas and extends from just south of Omaha, Nebraska to Oklahoma City. This fault zone directly overlies a granite \"high\" in the Precambrian basement and is structurally active as the Humboldt Fault. Some fifty miles to the west the southernmost extension of the Proterozoic Midcontinent Rift System extends into northeastern Kansas.\nThe northern two-thirds of Kansas is underlain by a Proterozoic sequence known as the Central Plains Orogen. The igneous and metamorphic rocks of this orogenic zone are considered to be an extension of the 1.7 Ga fold belt exposed in Colorado and Wyoming. The southern approximately one-third of the state is underlain by the Southern granite-rhyolite province dating to 1.35 to 1.48 Ga.\n\n\nSee also\nWellington Formation, spanning Kansas to Oklahoma\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nKansas Geological Survey",

    "text": "Tukoroirangi \"Tuku\" Morgan (born 7 October 1957) is a New Zealand Māori politician and former broadcaster. \nMorgan has been a prominent political figure since the 1990s. Since 2022, he has served as the chair of Te Arataura, which is the executive board of Te Whakakitenga, the governing council of the Waikato Tainui tribal confederation. He previously chaired Te Arataura from 2006 until 2012 and is a former advisor to Kingi Tuheitia.\nMorgan was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1996 to 1999 for New Zealand First and Mauri Pacific. He was the president of the Maori Party from 2016 to 2017.\n\n\nEarly life and family\nBorn in Auckland on 7 October 1957, Morgan affiliates to the Tainui iwi confederation. He was raised under whāngai adoption by his grandparents at Waahi marae in Huntly. The household spoke te reo Māori as their first language and Morgan once stated the only time English was spoken was when he would read aloud from the newspaper to his grandfather. His grandparents were close to the kingitanga and did not have formal employment; the only income the family received was a family benefit.\nMorgan was educated at St Stephen's School, Bombay from 1970 to 1971, and Huntly College from 1971 to 1976. He then gained a Diploma of Teaching from Epsom Teachers' College and taught English and Māori studies at Huntly College from 1980 to 1982, then at Birkdale College (1982). In the 1980s, Morgan attended a Māori land protest where he was convicted of obstructing a police officer and ordered to do community service.\nMorgan married Carolyn Brown (Ngāti Porou), whom he met at teachers' college. They share three children. Morgan's brother-in-law is Tau Henare (their wives are sisters).\n\n\nBroadcasting career\nIn 1984, Morgan was hired as one of the first reporters on Te Karere, New Zealand's first Māori-language news programme which was broadcast by Television New Zealand. He then moved to rival broadcaster TV3 as a mainstream news reporter. He briefly worked outside of the media, as manager of the Tainui Health Authority, Raukura Hauora o Tainui.\nLater, he was involved in the establishment of the short-lived Aotearoa Television Network, New Zealand's first Māori-language broadcaster, which began operations in 1996. Morgan was the network's head of sport, youth and current affairs programmes and also a news presenter. \n\n\nMember of Parliament\n\nMorgan was elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as the New Zealand First MP for Te Tai Hauāuru. New Zealand First captured all five Māori electorates in the 1996 election (including Te Tai Hauāuru). Morgan and the other four Māori electorate MPs became known as the Tight Five. \nAfter the election, New Zealand First formed a coalition government with the National Party. Morgan had reportedly preferred New Zealand First to work with Labour. He was not given a ministerial role in the government and was appointed a member of the Māori affairs and the health committee. He had been expected to be the government's nominee to chair the Māori affairs committee, but withdrew his nomination because of a controversy early in the term.\nIn February 1997, it emerged that two weeks before the general election, Morgan had spent $4,000 of Aotearoa Television funds on clothes including an $89 pair of Hugo Boss underpants, among other alleged financial misuse by the company's directors. Morgan stated the spending was from a clothing budget for on-air presenters; however, he was no longer in an on-air role with the network at the time the spending was made. The expenditure was controversial because the Māori affairs minister, Morgan's brother-in-law Tau Henare, had announced $4 million of new government funding for the network the month prior (the provision of which was later withdrawn). In a special debate in Parliament on 18 February, calls were made for Morgan to resign from Parliament, including by Alliance MP Sandra Lee who criticised Morgan for \"endanger[ing] the aspirations of Māori.\" Morgan refused to resign. In his maiden speech, delivered on 25 February 1997, he addressed the controversy, saying he \"would never be caught with his pants down again.\"\nMorgan sponsored two member's bills which were debated in Parliament. He inherited the Taonga Maori Protection Bill from Henare in 1996 and it was debated in 1998. The bill proposed establishing a national trust for the purposes of protecting and repatriating taonga. The bill was considered and endorsed by the Māori affairs committee and approved for continuation by Parliament in a 111-7 vote on 1 September 1999. The bill was adopted by the subsequent Labour government after the 1999 election and eventually discharged in 2004. Morgan also promoted the Smoke-free Environments (Enhanced Protection) Amendment Bill in July 1999, which was transferred to Steve Chadwick after the election.\nThe coalition government broke down in August 1998. Morgan resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, becoming an independent MP. He later joined the newly formed Mauri Pacific. In the 1999 election, Morgan was ranked second on Mauri Pacific's party list. He contested the Te Tai Hauāuru seat again, but was not returned to Parliament. He then returned to television and film production and also opened an art shop on Ponsonby Road.\n\n\nLife after parliament\nMorgan was chair of Te Arataura, the Waikato-Tainui executive board, from 2003 to 2004, when he was removed from office because of a criminal conviction for obstructing police during a protest march in the 1980s. He returned after a rule change in 2006 and held that role until 2012. He was also appointed to a two-year term as a director of Auckland Council Property, a council-controlled organisation of the Auckland Council from 2010.\nIn 2015 he became the Māori Party's co-chair of the Hauraki-Waikato electorate. In July 2016 he was elected as president of the Māori Party. As president, he set the party's goal of winning all seven Māori electorates at the 2017 general election. In the event, the party lost all seven electorates to Labour and was not eligible to return to Parliament. Morgan resigned in December 2017 and called for the party's co-leaders to follow suit.\nIn August 2018, he published an open letter to the Māori King Tūheitia Paki, whose advisor he had previously been, detailing a number of criticisms of Paki's behaving, including his continued support and employment of Rangi Whakaruru as chief of staff. He rejoined the Te Arataura board in 2021 and regained the chair in 2022.\n\n\nReferences",

He also organized climbing and cultural events. In 1981 he founded The International Festival of Mountaineering Films (Czech: Mezinárodní horolezecký filmový festival) in Teplice nad Metují. He also wrote several books.\n\n\nLife and climbing career\nŠmíd started climbing in the Ostaš climbing area and continued in Adršpach-Teplice Rocks, where he climbed a number of famous first ascents. In the High Tatras, Slovakia, he completed 230 ascents (80 of which were in winter and 25 first ascents, including a solo ascent of the Poslední dostih route on Veľká Javorová veža in 1976). In Scotland he completed the first winter ascent of the Glover's Chimney route on Ben Nevis in 1981. He also completed several solo climbs in Caucasus. He tried to make his solo climbs a secret as they were not approved of by the Socialist Party officials who lead the country at that time. When the solo ascents were revealed, it was very difficult to settle the disagreement. Still, Šmíd received an honor for his sport activities despite the solo climbing controversy.\nMiroslav Šmíd climbed in various mountain areas and made a number of important ascents: the Alps (first ascent in the north face of Eiger in winter in 1978), the Dolomites (north face of Cima Grande in 1975), Norway (Trollryggen in winter 1976), Caucasus (solo winter ascent of Donguz Orun 1983), Pamir Mountains (solo ascent of Peak Korzhenevskaya in 1977 and first ascent in 1979), Fann Mountains, Andes (first ascent of Yerupajá Sur, solo climb, 1980) Yosemite (solo ascent of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan 1978), Patagonia (Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre, 1990) and Alaska (Mount McKinley 1989, 1991 and 1993) He ascended Mount Kenya in Africa in 1986. He also participated in expeditions to the Himalayas (Lhotse Shar, Dhaulagiri 1984, Mount Everest 1987) He also undertook demanding solo ascents (e.g. Ama Dablam in 1986).\nŠmíd was allured by everything adventurous, and he also became a pioneer of mountain paragliding in Czechoslovakia. His well-known descent from Bzeduch Mountain in the Caucasus mountain range resulted in a broken pelvis after landing on a moraine.\nŠmíd died on 11 September 1993 while solo climbing on the Lost Arrow in Yosemite National Park. Apparently he fell just below the top while climbing unbelayed. All his equipment was found on the last ledge below the top. The body was found at the bottom of the gorge between the massifs and the spire by one of his friends. On the basis of a denture, the body was identified as Šmíd’s.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Miroslav Šmíd at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "The Less Deceived, first published in 1955, was Philip Larkin's first mature collection of poetry, having been preceded by the derivative North Ship (1945) from The Fortune Press and a privately printed collection, a small pamphlet titled XX Poems, which Larkin mailed to literary critics and authors. Larkin was unaware that postal rates had gone up, and most recipients, when asked to pay the difference for delivery of a pamphlet by a little-known writer, turned them away; only around 100 copies were printed.\nDespite this setback, 13 of the 20 poems, together with 16 new poems, were finally published to much acclaim in 1955 as The Less Deceived, which was selected as a book of the year by the Times Literary Supplement and immediately went through several impressions. Put out by The Marvell Press, a small operation run by George Hartley and his wife Jean Hartley in Hessle, East Yorkshire, the book through the depth of its appeal, the formal skill of its verse, and its consistent striking of Larkin's distinctive tone gained wide readership. By the end of 1955 The Less Deceived was recognized as one of the outstanding collections of the year.\n\n\nHistory\nThe first poem in it, chronologically, to be written was \"Going,\" of February 1946. It is about death, and, according to Andrew Motion, is the kind of poem for which Larkin \"is so often regarded as an unrelievedly pessimistic poet\" Its concluding lines, \"What is under my hands, / That I cannot feel? /  What loads my hands down?\", presage the helplessness, the dread of the atrophying of emotion, the despair, and the magnetic terror of death in the poems that follow. These are Larkin's most persistent themes. Throughout the collection, the feeling of diminishment and loss is pervasive, whether in the visit of a cyclist to a church in the volume's best known poem, \"Church Going,\" or in the alienation of the speaker looking at a photograph of a young lady, or in the man in \"Toads\" beaten by work into an imprisonment he then wills, or even in the \"I\" who \"starts to be happy\" when light strikes on the \"foreheads\" of houses. \"Beneath it all,\" ends the poem \"Wants,\" \"desire of oblivion runs.\" This desire for death simultaneously horrifies and allures.\n\nPhilip Larkin said on more than one occasion that his discovery of Thomas Hardy's poetry was a turning point in the writing of his own poetry:I don't think Hardy, as a poet, is a poet for young people. I know it sounds ridiculous to say I wasn't young at twenty-five or twenty-six, but at least I was beginning to find out what life was about, and that's precisely what I found in Hardy. In other words, I'm saying that what I like about him primarily is his temperament and the way he sees life. He's not a transcendental writer, he's not a Yeats, he's not an Eliot; his subjects are men, the life of men, time and the passing of time, love and the fading of love…\nWhen I came to Hardy it was with the sense of relief that I didn't have to try and jack myself up to a concept of poetry that lay outside my own life — this is perhaps what I felt Yeats was trying to make me do. One could simply relapse back into one's own life and write from it. Hardy taught one to feel rather than to write — of course one has to use one's own language and one's own jargon and one's own situations — and he taught one as well to have confidence in what one felt. I have come, I think, to admire him even more than I did then.\n\n\nPoems\nLines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album\nWedding-Wind\nPlaces, Loved Ones\nComing\nReasons for Attendance\nDry-Point\nNext, Please\nGoing\nWants\nMaiden Name\nBorn Yesterday\nWhatever Happened?\nNo Road\nWires\nChurch Going\nAge\nMyxomatosis\nToads\nPoetry of Departures\nTriple Time\nSpring\nDeceptions\nI Remember, I Remember\nAbsences\nLatest Face\nIf, My Darling\nSkin\nArrivals, Departures\nAt Grass\n\n\nSee also\nList of poems by Philip Larkin\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=76238843",
    "text": "Alhambra Springs is or was a group of natural springs in the hills of Contra Costa County, California, United States. The six spring vents were located on a hillside south of Martinez, above Alhambra Creek in the vicinity of Briones Regional Park. In the 20th century, Alhambra Springs was a popular locally bottled water in Northern California. The springs are no longer commercialized, but Alhambra remains a brand name, and as of 2008 there was still a \"trickle\" of water at Alhambra Springs.\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to a 1907 account, a drive from Oakland of an hour and a half or a train ride on the Southern Pacific Railroad would deliver you to the vicinity of the springs, which were \"situated at the head of the picturesque Alhambra Valley...and the property of which they form a part consists of one hundred and ninety acres of beautifully wooded country diversified by hills and ferny cañons.\" Alhambra Springs are in the vicinity of what is now Briones Regional Park.\nThe Smith family had opened the Alhambra Springs Resort in the 1890s. In 1895 the springs were advertised \"for rent\", and in 1897 they were for sale, at which time there were six rental cottages on the 109-acre (44 ha) property. Bottling of the water for sale began around 1898. During this period, a \"shrewd businessman\" named Loron M. Lasell ran a general store and a hardware store in Martinez, and he \"allowed customers from his general store to shop on credit. A generous year often went by before he attempted collecting on past due accounts. If you couldn't pay in cash you could pay with an acre or two of land.\" According to his grandson, between 1894 and 1921 Lasell acquired almost 300 acres \"from Elam Smith, F. M. Smith, John Zurfluh, Gertrude Upham...including that property known as Alhambra Springs.\"  \n\nLasell, who also claimed to be a skilled dowser, soon established Alhambra Springs Water Company. The founding date was said to be 1902, per a radio jingle that ran for many years: \"Alhambra water is good for you since 1902\". Around 1905 Lasell ran a two-inch-diameter galvanized steel pipe 8 miles (13 km) from the spring to a bottling plant in town with easy access to the railroad and nearby docks. At one time the company ran up to 33 delivery trucks, and had distribution centers in San Francisco and Oakland.  Alhambra water was shipped throughout California, as well as to Arizona, Mexico, and the Hawaiian Islands. At one point Lasell was offered a Coca-Cola distributorship, but turned it down because Alhambra had its own line of \"carbonated root beer, ginger ale, and creme soda\". The business was profitable enough that Lasell was able to expand supply by purchasing Big Bear Mountain Springs in the Oakland Hills. In the 1940s a five-gallon water bottle was sold for 50 cents. The Lasell brothers sold out in the 1950s, to either the National Ice Company of San Francisco in 1951, or Foremost-McKesson in 1952. In 1956, a catastrophic fire at the bottling plant on Marina Vista in Martinez destroyed the old building.\n\nAccording Ernest Lasell in 1976, \"The business has been sold several times since then and still maintains the name Alhambra Water although they do not use water from Alhambra Springs.\" The Alhambra brand was advertised up until the 1980s with commercials that featured \"a smiling Alhambra water deliveryman, with a 5-gallon jug slung over his shoulder, striding up a walkway of a suburban home singing, 'Me and Alhambra water makin' friends.'\" Alhambra brand water is still delivered as of 2024. \nThe springs property remained in the hands of five Lasell cousins as of 1976. By 1990 a newspaper account had it that \"the area now is in the midst of development.\" In 2008 the 83-acre (34 ha) property where the springs emerge was being listed for sale for $2.5 million. At that time a \"stream of water\" still \"trickled from a roadside spot\".\n\n\nLegacy\nA mural of the history of Martinez created in 2011 included an image of the Alhambra Springs bottling plant.\nVintage glass Alhambra Springs water bottles are, like many old bottles, a collector's item.\n\n\nWater profile\n\nA 1907 article about California springs written by regional boosters claimed that Alhambra water had a \"natural supply of bicarbonates, which adds agreeably to its pleasant taste, and it is sold both in its natural state and also charged with additional carbonic-acid gas. The minerals in the water have a soothing effect upon the lining of the digestive organs, and it is a valuable remedy for rheumatism and disorders of the stomach.\"\nIn 1915, U.S. government geologist Gerald A. Waring classified Alhambra as one of the \"saline springs\" of California, writing that they were \"small saline and sulphated springs whose waters have been bottled for medicinal use...the principal springs contain large amounts of sodium and chlorine...Of the three principal springs on the [Alhambra] property, one which is known as No. 1, fills a housed-in pool six feet square and a foot deep, on the eastern bank of the ravine; its water tastes strongly saline and sulphated...A fourth spring has a flow of a little over half a gallon a minute and is designated in the table of analyses as 'Alhambra'...the water of Spring No. 2 is less strongly mineralized than that of the others and is characterized chiefly by secondary alkahnity...The rocks near Alhambra Springs are of the same character as those at Ferndale Springs half a mile to the northwest, which have been described among the carbonated springs...\"\nA 1916 report had it that the bottled water from the specific spring called Alhambra \"contains the salts of Sodium, Magnesium and traces of Iron and Aluminum.\" California geologists reported in 1921 that \"A group of 6 more or less mineralized springs are situated in a narrow cañon 6 miles south of Martinez in section 2, T. 1N., R. 3W. Three of the springs have been developed, but of these only two are utilized. The principal spring, known as No. 1, fills a housed-in pool 6 feet square on the eastern bank of the ravine. It is strongly saline, as shown in the analysis below. No. 2 spring rises in a cement-covered joint on the western edge of the stream channel several hundred yards south of No. 1. The waters of No. 2 are less strongly mineralized.\"\n\n\nAdditional images\n\n\nSee also\nContra Costa County § History\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nLindstrom, Monty; Griffin, Robert (1970).

    "text": "Meneval (30 March 1973 – after 1995) was an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Bred in Kentucky and sent to race in Ireland as a yearling and showed considerable promise when finishing second on his only start as a two-year-old in 1975. In the following year he was undefeated in four starts, winning the Ballysax Stakes, Nijinsky Stakes and Gallinule Stakes in spring and then returning after a lengthy break to record his biggest victory in the Irish St. Leger. As a four-year-old he won the Hardwicke Stakes but failed to live up to expectations that he would become a leading contender for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He failed to reproduce his European form when campaigned in the United States in 1978. He later stood as a breeding stallion in the United States and Ireland but had little success as a sire of winners.\n\n\nBackground\nMeneval was a \"strong, very good-looking\" bay horse with a small white star bred in Kentucky by Mrs G M Humphrey. As a yearling he was put up for auction at Keeneland and bought for $170,000 by representatives of Mrs George Getty II. He was sent to Europe and entered training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle.\nHis sire Le Fabuleux was a successful French racehorse who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1964 and went on to sire several good winners including Dauphin Fabuleux and Effervescing. Meneval's dam Nalee won the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and came from an outstanding family, being a daughter of Levee and a full-sister to Shuvee.\n\n\nRacing career\n\n\n1975: two-year-old season\nMeneval made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse in October in which he started at odds of 33/1 and finished second to his stablemate Semenenko. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 92 p (the \"p\" indicating that he was likely to make significant improvement) and commented that he was \"sure to win races\".\n\n\n1976: three-year-old season\nMeneval was ridden in all four of his races as a three-year-old by Lester Piggott and won easily on each occasion. On his seasonal debut he recorded his first win when he started at odds of 1/4 for the Saval Beg Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh in April and came home four lengths clear of his rivals. In May the colt again started 1/4 favourite for the Nijinsky Stakes over the same distance at Leopardstown and defeated the Beresford Stakes winner Whistling Deer by a length. Meneval was then moved up in distance for the Group 2 Gallinule Stakes over one and half miles at the Curragh on 29 May and justified odds of 1/3 as he beat the British-trained Lost Chord by a length and a half. The O'Brien stable was badly affected by a \"virus infection\" is the summer of 1976 and Meneval was off the track for well over three months.\nOn 18 September Meneval returned in the Irish St. Leger over one and three quarter miles at the Curragh and started the 5/6 favourite in an eleven-runner field. The best fancied of his opponents were Lost Chord, the Queen's Vase winner General Ironside and the improving handicapper Red Invader. Piggott restrained the favourite in the early stages as General Ironside built up a clear lead. Meneval overtook the leader in the straight, drew right away from the field and \"hacked up\" by eight lengths from General Ironside with the filly Countess Eileen three lengths back in third.\nAt the end of the season Timeform gave him a rating of 128, sven pounds behind their Horse of the Year Youth but only a pound behind their best stayer Sagaro.\n\n\n1977: four-year-old season\nMeneval remained in training as a four-year-old with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as his main objective. On his first appearance of the year he sustained his first defeat for over eighteen months when he finished fifth of the seven runners behind his stablemate Alleged (a 33/1 outsider) in the Royal Whip Stakes at the Curragh. In June Meneval raced outside Ireland for the first time when he was sent to Royal Ascot and started 2/1 favourite for the Hardwicke Stakes. Ridden as usual by Piggott he has held up towards the rear before finishing strongly and won by one and a half lengths from the French filly Ranimer (winner of the Sun Chariot Stakes), with Quiet Fling the same distance away in third. In July he was sent to France and finished fifth to Exceller in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud with Piggott reporting that the colt needed softer ground to show his best form. In the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot in September he was held up by Piggott for a late run but was never able to get on terms with the leader Orange Bay and was beaten four lengths into second place. The race had been intended to prepare the horse for the Arc, but he missed the French race and did not run again in 1977.\nTimeform gave Meneval a rating of 129 for the 1977 season, four pounds behind Sagaro and Balmerino who were there top-rated older males. In the inaugural International Classification he was given a rating of 87 making him the highest-rated older horse trained in Ireland.\n\n\n1978: five-year-old season\nIn 1978 Meneval was sent to race in the United States where he competed in the colours of J R Fluor and was trained by Stephen A. DiMauro. His North American career was a complete failure as he failed to win or place in any of his eight races.\n\n\nStud record\nAt the end of his racing career Meneval was retired to become a breeding stallion in the United States. He was sent to Ireland in the late 1980s where he was used as a National Hunt sire. He sired numerous minor jump race winners but no top-class performers.\n\n\nPedigree\n\n\nReferences",

In the 1960s he travelled the world, occasionally sleeping rough due to a shortage of money. He settled for a while in Canada, where he worked in electronics retail in British Columbia. He married a New Zealand-born woman in Canada, where he had a number of children.\n\n\nNew Zealand\nBhatnagar migrated to New Zealand with his family from Canada in 1980. The same year he opened his first home audio store in central Auckland, and it quickly grew into the Sound Plus chain. In 1991, he purchased the Noel Leeming chain, in receivership at that time, for around $3 million with his business associate, Greg Lancaster, from Smiths City. In 1993, Noel Leeming was listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of about $26 million and in 1995 the company was the subject of a failed $56 million takeover bid by Skellerup. The following year, Noel Leeming merged with competitor Bond & Bond to form Pacific Retail. In 1998, Bhatnagar stepped down as chairman and an executive director of Pacific Retail, and he divested his interests in the company in 1999.\nIn 1993, Bhatnagar was involved in setting up Burger King in New Zealand, but sold his 50 percent interest two years later.

During this period, Ozegna was under the jurisdiction of the Counts of Biandrate di San Giorgio, who governed the area through enfeoffment by the Marquises of Monferrato between 1244 and 1366. The castle was built in the second half of the 14th century. The inhabitants of Ozegna, seeking protection, pledged their loyalty to the Counts of Biandrate, who agreed to their act of devotion on the condition that they construct a fortified structure for the counts' use within the perimeter of the pre-existing ricetto. However, the castle's intended quadrangular design remained incomplete, with the southern and western sides unfinished.\nIn 1433, the partially built castle fell to Savoyard troops led by Teobaldo d’Avanchy, who later received its fief by the House of Savoy.\n\n\nDescription\nThe castle features an L-shaped layout with three quadrangular towers on the northern side and a rounded tower on the southern side.

    "text": "The Last Wave (also released in the United States as Black Rain) is a 1977 Australian mystery drama film directed and co-written by Peter Weir, starring Richard Chamberlain, Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil (billed as “Gulpilil”). It is about a white solicitor in Sydney whose seemingly normal life is disrupted after he takes on a murder case and discovers that he shares a strange, mystical connection with the small group of local Aboriginal people accused of the crime.\nReleased by United Artists on December 13, 1977, it received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for seven AFI Awards, including Best Direction, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor for Chamberlain. It is considered one of the major works of the Australian New Wave.\n\n\nPlot\nThe film opens with a montage of scenes of daily life in Australia in the 1970s— a rural school in the desert with children playing, the main street of an Outback town, a traffic jam in the city— all being affected by unusually adverse weather conditions that suddenly appear. These include heavy rainfall followed by unusually large chunks of hail breaking through the windows of the school injuring students, a frog infestation, and other anomalies. Only the local Aboriginal people seem to recognise the cosmological significance of these weather phenomena.\nDuring one of these freak rainstorms in Sydney, an altercation occurs among a group of Aboriginal people in a pub, which results in a mysterious drowning death. At the coroner's inquest, the death is ruled a homicide and four of the Aboriginal men are accused of murder. Through the Australian Legal Aid system, a lawyer named David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is procured for their defence. Due to internal politics and the eschatological divide between the European settlers and Indigenous people, the circumstances by which he was contacted and retained are unusual in that his law practice is corporate taxation and not criminal defence. He is reluctant at first but is intrigued by the challenge and takes on the case. Soon his professional and personal life begin to unravel.\nBurton starts having bizarre dreams involving running water and  drowned corpses. In another, he is visited in his home by one of the incarcerated Aboriginals, named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), whom he had never met. When later introduced to the four accused men, he recognises Lee and begins to sense an otherworldly connection to him and to the increasingly strange weather phenomena besetting the city. His dreams intensify along with his obsession with the murder case. He comes to suspect that the murder was an Aboriginal tribal execution in which a curse is put on the victim simply by pointing a bone at him. Lee refuses to admit that he is tribal or reveal anything about the murder, but tells Burton that his dreams have meaning because he is Mulkurul; descended from a race of spirits who came from the rising sun bringing sacred objects with them. After meeting with the shaman of Lee's tribe and learning more about Aboriginal practices and the concept of Dreamtime as a parallel world of existence, Burton comes to believe that his dreams and the strange heavy rain bode as signs of a coming apocalypse. After another intense dream, Burton senses danger. He persuades his wife to leave the city with their children right before a torrential storm causes a flooding disaster.\nIn the chaos of the flood, Lee manages to escape from prison to find Burton and take him down through subterranean tunnels under the city which lead to a sacred Aboriginal ritual site. Lee shows him the entrance to another ancient chamber nearby that is strangely familiar to him; Burton is sent off to find the answers that he seeks. In the chamber, Burton sees a painting on the ceiling depicting the arrival of European explorers from South America and a calendrical prophecy of a cataclysmic oceanic disaster. He finds a collection of ancient relics, a decayed corpse of a man wearing medieval Western garments, and a stone mask. After close inspection, he realises this bears a face identical to his own. He collects as many relics as he can carry but is suddenly confronted by the tribe's shaman shouting and lunging at him. They struggle and Burton kills the shaman with one of the stone relics. \nHe tries to find his way back to the surface through the sewer tunnels, but he loses the relics along the way. He finally emerges through a drain pipe; exhausted, he collapses on the beach and stares at the horizon. Then we see the look of both shock and acceptance on his face as the screen is filled by footage of a surreal towering ocean wave. It remains unclear whether this is reality or Burton's final apocalyptic premonition.\n\n\nCast\nRichard Chamberlain as David Burton\nOlivia Hamnett as Annie Burton\nDavid Gulpilil as Chris Lee\nFred Parslow as Reverend Burton\nVivean Gray as Dr Whitburn\nNandjiwarra Amagula as Charlie\nWalter Amagula as Gerry Lee\nRoy Bara as Larry\nCedrick Lalara as Lindsey\nMorris Lalara as Jacko\nPeter Carroll as Michael Zeadler\nAthol Compton as Billy Corman\nHedley Cullen as Judge\nMichael Duffield as Andrew Potter\nWallas Eaton as Morgue Doctor\nJo England as Babysitter\nJohn Frawley as Policeman\n\n\nProduction\nIn an interview on the Criterion Collection DVD release, director Peter Weir explains that the film explores the question, \"What if someone with a very pragmatic approach to life experienced a premonition?\" \nFinance was provided by the Australian Film Commission ($120,000), the South Australian Film Corporation ($120,000), Janus Films (US$50,000) and United Artists ($350,000).

    "text": "John West Wells (July 15, 1907 – January 12, 1994) was an American paleontologist, biologist and geologist who focused his research on corals.\nHe was notable for, among other things, proving that the rotational period of the Earth undergoes periodic changes. The National Academies of Science said that Wells \"made an indelible mark on the world of paleontology.\" The Independent called Wells \"the leading authority on modern and fossil corals, a noteworthy contributor on coral reefs and atolls\". Wells was Professor of Geology, Ohio State University, Professor of Geology, Cornell University, President, Paleontological Society, a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\nEarly life\nWells was bom July 15, 1907, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He went to school in Homer, New York, 20 miles northeast of Ithaca. He took his B.S. degree at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in chemistry. However he soon became fascinated by geology, under the guidance of Ransom E. Sommers and Henry Leighton.\n\n\nEarly career\nWells became an instructor of geology at the University of Texas from 1929 to 1931, whilst studying for his M.A. from Cornell University in 1930, with a special interest in paleontology. He took his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1933 under Gilbert D. Harris.\nDuring 1933–1934, Wells was a National Research Council Fellow, studying paleontology at the British Museum (Natural History), in London, the French National Museum of Natural History (Paris), and the Natural History Museum of Berlin. Upon his return to the U.S., Wells worked with T. Wayland Vaughan in Washington, D.C. from 1935 to 1937, and \"looked for a job.\" Together they revised a volume on Scleractinia (1943). Wells taught at the State Normal School at Fredonia, New York (now SUNY) from 1937 to 1938, and then was a Professor in Geology at Ohio State University from 1938 to 1948. At Ohio State University, he would begin researching the history of geology. Wells served in the military in France and Germany during 1944–45 in the Office of Strategic Services, and later assisted with studies assessing war damage and in the recovery of coral literature from bombed or burning buildings in Germany. His work with OSS assessed the state of universities and museums in France and Germany, following the war.\n\n\nLater career\nWells returned to Cornell in 1948 as professor of geology. He served as department chairman from 1962 to 1965. In 1946 he began working with the U.S. Geological Survey. He was involved in research into various Pacific islands, including field work in the resurvey of Bikini Atoll (1947) and was attached to the Pacific Science Board's Arno Atoll Expedition (1950). He would continue to identify, describe, and analyze the Recent and Tertiary corals from these and other expeditions even in his retirement. Many of his publications were the direct result of this Pacific island work.\nDuring 1954, Wells was granted a Fulbright lecturing position at the University of Queensland, spending many months studying corals of the Great Barrier Reef. During this period he established a productive working relationship with Dorothy Hill of the University of Queensland, who was the leading Australian expert on reef geology. Wells and Dorothy Hill would jointly prepare nine sections on the Coelenterata for the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology published in 1956. Wells would also prepare sections on Scleractinia for the Treatise.\nWells' most widely read paper appeared in November 1962 and was published in Nature. Astronomers and geophysicists paid attention to his “Coral Growth and Geochronometry” paper, which demonstrated their theory that the Earth's rotation was slowing down. His research indicated that there were more days in the Devonian year (400) compared with those of the modern age (365), by comparing counts of daily growth lines in corals. Wells' paper generated a great amount of research on the incremental growth of skeletal material in several groups of invertebrates. \nJ. B. S. Haldane described Wells' work in an article published in the New York Times, Professor Wells of Cornell University also has this quality. He collects ancient and modern coral. Those which grow in seas where the temperature varies much with the seasons often show annual growth rings like trees. Wells found that some also show daily ridges of growth, which can be counted with a good hand lens costing perhaps $10. Modern corals show about 365 ridges a year….Silurian corals show about 400 rings a year. As the year has probably changed little, therefore the days have been getting longer. (They are getting longer, as we know, from records of ancient eclipses, among other evidence. This is thought to be due to the braking action of the tides, both in the sea and in the earth, which is not quite rigid.) Ask anyone who does not know the answer how much the apparatus cost which proved that the number of days in the year has increased by 35 in 350 million years and he will probably guess at $10 million or so.\nWells would retire from Cornell in 1973, and become Emeritus Professor. In 1975 he travelled to the Charles Darwin Research Station in the Galapagos Islands and helped identify six new species of azooxanthellate corals.\nJohn Wells' long-standing interests and research into local and cultural history, especially that of upstate New York, were able to flourish in retirement. In 1958, he published The Cayuga Bridge, a story of New York local history. The summer home on Cayuga Lake, that Wells and his wife established in 1948, would host students, colleagues, and other friends from around the world, for decades. Wells had an important collection of early works on American and European geology.\n\n\nSelected publications\nWells, J.W.

    "text": "\"Laughing\" Sam Carey, possibly also Laughing Dick Carey, was one of the least known American Old West outlaws who was a member of the loosely knit Hole-in-the-Wall Gang during the latter part of the 19th century. Both of the above names are listed in many outlaw accounts from the day.\n\n\nBackground\nAlthough Sam Carey is mentioned often in recorded exploits of the gangs operating out of the Hole-in-the-Wall pass, located in Johnson County, Wyoming, very little is known about him. Historian Roy O'Dell has done extended research into Carey's identity. In addition to his work, authors James D. Horan and Paul Sann mentioned Laughing Sam Carey in their book, Pictorial History of the Wild West. In a New York World article, dated March 15, 1903, Carey is mentioned as being one of the most celebrated inhabitants of the Hole-in-the-Wall hideout, and is described as Wyoming's most dangerous desperado.\nAs a boy, it is believed that Carey acted as a messenger and camp servant to Butch Cassidy and his gang. As a teenager he rode with a gang led by the little-known outlaw Otto Chenoworth. In the 1923 book History of Natrona County Wyoming, the short-lived career of the Chenoworth Gang was documented. He and his gang were less than successful, with the gang breaking up and Chenoworth being committed to a sanitarium in South Dakota, from which he was later released to his mother. Carey returned to the Hole-in-the-Wall after the gang's breakup. \nCarey then rode, off and on, with a number of the gangs considered part of the Hole in the Wall Gang, to include Cassidy's Wild Bunch and Black Jack Ketchum's gang. Carey was well known in his own time, and often associated with stories of the outlaw exploits originating from the Hole-in-the-Wall. However, by 1903, almost all of the gang members best known to operate from there were either dead or in prison, with Carey never being captured to anyone's knowledge. Eventually, beginning after 1903, he simply faded from history. His whereabouts after the downfall of the Hole in the Wall Gang are not known, nor is the date or year of his death.\n\n\nSee also\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nHole in the Wall\nBoardman, Mark (2019-05-15).

Under the terms of the dyarchy constitution, the Legislative Council of Burma was advisory to the British colonial governor, and had some direct authority over education, local government, public health, agriculture and forests. The Nationalist Party received the most votes, but was unable to form a government as the British authorities favoured the Independent Party, who formed a government led by Joseph Augustus Maung Gyi.\n\n\nElectoral system\nThe Legislative Council had 103 members, of which 80 were elected; 58 \"non-communal\" seats elected by a common roll, and 24 \"communal\" seats reserved for ethnic minorities (eight for Indians, five for Karens, one European and one Anglo-Indian) and business groups  (two for the Burma Chamber of Commerce, and one each for the Burmese Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Indian Chamber of Commerce, the Rangoon Trades Association and Rangoon University). A further 21 seats were appointed by the Governor (a maximum of 14 of which could be government officials) and there were also two ex officio members, the two members of the Executive Council of the Governor.\n\n\nCampaign\nThe Burmese branch of the Swaraj Party led by Toke Gyi put forward 20 candidates. The Independent Party had 85 candidates, whilst there were 49 Nationalist Party candidates running.\n\n\nResults\nThe Swaraj Party performed poorly, with Toke Gyi defeated in his constituency. Voter turnout was just 16%, although this marked an increase on the turnout of 6.9% in the 1922 elections. This was put down to the success of elected politicians in amending controversial laws during their period in office, as well as an increase in the number of political parties.\n\n\nReferences",

Part of this, according to Greenwald, is because main songwriter Kimberley Rew only contributed two songs to the album. Greenwald felt that there are some fine moments, however, such as Vince de la Cruz's \"Sun Street\" and Katrina Leskanich's \"Tears for Me.\" He added that Rew's two songs, \"Is That It\" and \"Lovely Lindsay,\" are \"mini-masterpieces\", and that they \"eventually push the group and this album somewhere near the goal line.\" In his artist biography on AllMusic, Bruce Eder wrote that Waves was a good enough album but no improvement upon the Katrina and the Waves album. He also felt that the band's work lost its edge between the two albums.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nPersonnel\nKatrina and the Waves\nKatrina Leskanich – vocals, rhythm guitar\nKimberley Rew – lead guitar, vocals\nVince de la Cruz – bass, rhythm guitar, lead guitar (7), vocals\nAlex Cooper – drums, vocals\nAdditional musicians\nNick Glennie-Smith – keyboards\nJohn \"Irish\" Earle – brass\nDave Land – brass\nRichard Edwards – brass\nEamon Fitzpatrick – brass arrangements\nTechnical\nKatrina and the Waves – producer\nPat Collier – producer\nScott Litt – producer\nRichard Sullivan – second engineer\nBob Ludwig – mastering\nStylorouge – sleeve artwork\nTerry Day – hand colouring\nSimon Fowler – photography\n\n\nCharts\n\nSingles \n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nReferences",

It is set in a 230-acre estate, one mile from Ascot Racecourse, and comprises six polo fields, an arena, clubhouse and a polo school. The club is also home to The Arena Gold Cup, the most prestigious winter season tournament and The Arena Polo Masters, currently the highest goal game played in the winter.\nEstablished in 1985, by music mogul Bryan Morrison, the club’s founding member and patron was H.R.H. The Prince of Wales with both the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry as players.\n\n\nFlagship tournaments\n\n\nPrince of Wales Trophy\nHeld under the patronage of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, this tournament first played in 1986 and is one of the four major tournaments in the English polo season attracting the world’s best teams and players.\nThe 17–22 goal tournament final is played at the end of May each year with three separate enclosures for spectators to enjoy everything from a picnic at the polo to a hospitality and dining package.\n\n\nThe Arena Gold Cup\nThe Royal Berkshire was the first club in Europe to build an area and has held The Arena Gold Cup, the most prestigious winter polo fixture, attracting international players. The tournament began in 1996 after Bryan Morrison discovered indoor Polo whilst on a business trip in Chicago.\n\n\nThe Polo Festival\nFirst Played in 1995 The Polo Festival is an event involving local businesses as well as a 10-goal, 2-goal and ladies game. It was conceived as a tournament at multiple levels offering polo across the entire spectrum for the wider enjoyment. With the support of sponsorship partners, this annual festival is one of the most popular tournaments at the Royal Berkshire, with attendance in the thousands.\n\n\nHistory\nOriginally the site of the Windsor Forest Stud, the estate was bought by music mogul Bryan Morrison in 1985. The 230-acre estate currently comprises 6 polo fields, an arena, and clubhouse less than one mile from Ascot Racecourse. Morrison, managed or published Pink Floyd, George Michael, The Bee Gees, The Pretty Things, Fairport Convention, Incredible String Band, The Jam and Tyrannosaurus Rex, among many other major bands, and had a vision to bring the music industry into a new era.\nMorrison’s vision was to convert the run down site into a premier polo club that would break down the ‘stuffy’ polo establishment. Following major earthworks, the first chukkas were played in 1986, an amazingly short timescale for such an undertaking and one that was considered unachievable within the polo world at the time.\nThe founding member of this new club was H.RH. The Prince of Wales who, despite retiring from polo in 2005, bestows the Prince of Wales Trophy to the club, one of the most coveted trophies in polo and a tournament played annually at the Royal Berkshire to this day.\nBryan is also known as 'the godfather of arena polo' being the first club owner in Europe to build an arena to allow polo to be played in the winter. This came about whilst on a business trip to Chicago, Bryan saw a sign for polo which he followed to find an indoor game being played at The Armory. Upon his return, he ordered the construction of a similar arena at the club, starting the winter polo season in the UK as it currently exists. In memory of this the Bryan Morrison arena International Trophy is played for each winter. Bryan set up the original rules committee for UK arena polo. Arena polo is now the fastest growing version of the sport within the UK.\nThe club now is undertaking an extensive expansion programme which will bring the addition of two further polo fields.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "11 West 54th Street (also 9 West 54th Street and the James J. Goodwin Residence) is a commercial building in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It is along 54th Street's northern sidewalk between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. The four-and-a-half-story building was designed by McKim, Mead & White in the Georgian Revival style and was constructed between 1896 and 1898 as a private residence. It is one of five consecutive townhouses erected along the same city block during the 1890s, the others being 5, 7, 13 and 15 West 54th Street.\nThe building is designed as a double house, with a larger unit at 11 West 54th Street to the west, as well as a smaller unit at 9 West 54th Street to the east. The facade is made of rusticated blocks of limestone on the first story, as well as Flemish bond brick on the upper stories. Businessman James Junius Goodwin—a cousin and business partner of J. P. Morgan—and his wife Josephine lived at the main unit at number 11 with his family and rented number 9.\nThe house initially served as the second residence for James Goodwin, who lived primarily in Connecticut. James Goodwin died in 1915, and Josephine continued to live in the house until 1939, after which it was used briefly by the Inter-America House and the Museum of Modern Art The house was sold to Parsonage Point Realty Company in 1944 and leased to the Rhodes Preparatory School, which bought the building in 1949. The house was then sold in 1979 to the United States Trust Company, which renovated the structure. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the house as an official landmark in 1981, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as part of the 5–15 West 54th Street Residences historic district.\n\n\nSite\n11 West 54th Street is in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It is along the northern sidewalk of 54th Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, with an alternate address of 9 West 54th Street. The land lot is rectangular and covers 5,000 square feet (460 m2), with a frontage of 50 feet (15 m) on 54th Street and a depth of 100.42 feet (30.61 m). The building is the center of five consecutive townhouses erected along the same city block, with 5 West 54th Street and 7 West 54th Street to its east, as well as 13 and 15 West 54th Street to its west. The five townhouses are adjoined by the Rockefeller Apartments to the west, The Peninsula New York and the St. Regis New York hotels to the northeast, the University Club of New York and 689 Fifth Avenue to the east, the William H. Moore House and Saint Thomas Church to the southeast, and the Museum of Modern Art to the south.\nFifth Avenue between 42nd Street and Central Park South (59th Street) was relatively undeveloped through the late 19th century. The surrounding area was once part of the common lands of the city of New York. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 established Manhattan's street grid with lots measuring 100 feet (30 m) deep and 25 feet (7.6 m) wide. Upscale residences were constructed around Fifth Avenue following the American Civil War. The two-block stretch of West and East 54th Street from Madison Avenue to Sixth Avenue, bisected by Fifth Avenue, was developed with the houses of prominent figures such as William Henry Moore, John R. Platt, and John D. Rockefeller Sr. The sites of the five houses at 5–15 West 54th Street, along with the University Club, were formerly occupied by St. Luke's Hospital, which moved out during 1896.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe houses at 5–15 West 54th Street, all developed in the late 1890s for wealthy clients, were designed as a cohesive grouping, unlike other residences in the neighborhood. According to The New York Times, the houses form the sole remaining \"real strip of mansions\" in Midtown Manhattan. The houses at 5, 7, 9–11, and 13 and 15 West 54th Street all had different architects. The double unit at 9 and 11 West 54th Street was designed by McKim, Mead & White in the Georgian Revival style. 11 West 54th Street was partly modeled on the third Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. The ornamental steelwork was manufactured by the Prince & Kinkel Iron Works. Russell Sturgis, writing for Architectural Record in 1900, described the house as two structures with their \"facades forced into one\". Sturgis considered the facade of number 9 as being \"subordinate\" to number 11, even though the details of both units otherwise harmonized with each other.\n\n\nFacade\nThe building is four and a half stories tall and five bays wide. The basement and first floor are clad with rusticated blocks of limestone, while the three upper floors are clad with brick. The building was designed with number 11 as the main residence, taking up the westernmost three bays, and number 9 as a secondary residence, taking up the easternmost two bays. Nevertheless, the entire facade was designed to be largely symmetrical. Along the street facade, the house is set behind an iron railing and a depressed areaway.\nFrom the ground level, a low stoop with four steps leads to the entrance to number 11, at the center of the facade. In front of the main entrance is a portico supported by two fluted columns designed in the Ionic style. The columns are topped by Scamozzi-style capitals, which support a carved panel with a cartouche at its center. A cornice with modillions runs above the portico. Under the portico is a pair of wood-and-glass doors inside a stone doorway frame topped by a keystone. The rightmost bay also has an entrance, which leads to number 9 and is simpler in design than the main entrance. The rightmost entrance lacks a portico and has fluted pilasters rather than a simple doorway frame, but it contains similar modillioned cornice and double wood-and-glass doors to the main entrance. The other three ground-story bays consist of recessed six-over-six windows with stone voussoirs and paneled keystones. Above the first floor is a band course with fret designs.\n\nThe second story has five windows with six-over-nine panes. Above each second-story window is a lintel and modillioned stone cornice supported by foliated brackets. In front of each second-story window is a balcony with an iron railing. The center window (corresponding to the portico) and the rightmost window (corresponding to the secondary entrance) have larger balconies than the three other bays. These balconies are designed as oblong rhombuses with rosettes in their centers. The third and fourth floors each have five windows with six-over-six panes, above which are splayed stone lintels. On the third floor, the center window has a balcony similar to those on the second floor, while the other windows have simple limestone sills. Below the fourth floor is a stone string course that doubles as the sill for the fourth-story windows. Above the fourth floor is a modillioned cornice, above which is a stone balustrade. The attic has a slate mansard roof with five dormer windows that contain hip roofs. The mansard roof also has three brick chimneys.\n\n\nInterior\nThe building contains about 22,500 square feet (2,090 m2) spread across two units. According to a real estate listing, the house had 11 master bedrooms, 11 staff bedrooms, 12 fireplaces, skylighted staircases, and a wood-paneled entrance foyer. The stairs had carved acorns, the entrance and stair landings had decorative pillars, and the ceiling had plaster moldings. When the house was built, number 9 was designed in what was then considered a Federal Revival or Classical Revival design. Number 9 had a variety of furniture, ranging from 19th century designs to contemporary Herter Brothers furniture, as well as an Oriental rug and potted plants. Two staircases, both topped by skylights made of stained glass, ascend throughout the building. There is also a dumbwaiter and elevator.\nOriginally, the first floor of number 9 had the reception hall in the front and a dining room in the rear. The first floor of number 11 had a vestibule and a study in the front, a stair hall in the center, and a kitchen and servants' dining room in the rear. The second floor of number 9 had a living room in the front and a library in the rear, while the second floor of number 11 had a living room in the front, a hall and reception room in the center, and an octagonal dining room in the rear. Number 11 had a walk-in safe for silver next to the dining room, with a wood-paneled closet door concealing the steel entrance into the safe. Number 11's second floor had a high ceiling and a fireplace, as well as large mirrors and fireplace mantels. In both units, the second floor's large windows were designed to face MoMA's rear garden. In both residential units, the third floor contained numerous bedrooms.\nBoth units were internally connected on the second floor in 1943. After an early 1980s renovation, the reception hall was clad in wood paneling while the second floor dining room was restored. The United States Trust Company, the occupant at the time of the 1980s renovation, reproduced many of the original decorations and added a rear annex. After the US Trust renovation, the house's interior had marble fireplace mantels, gilded bronze lights, and walls with red paper or green silk damask.  At the rear of the house, a tellers' station was installed in a former servants' area. A 17-foot-deep (5.2 m) bank vault with a security booth and bulletproof windows was constructed. By the 21st century, the interiors were decorated in the neo-Georgian style.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nResidence\n\nIn 1896, with the relocation of St. Luke's Hospital from Midtown to Morningside Heights, Manhattan, the hospital's former site on the northern side of 54th Street west of Fifth Avenue became available for development. The University Club, whose construction commenced the same year, was the first structure to be built on the former hospital plot. In February 1896, Josephine Goodwin, wife of James Junius Goodwin, acquired a plot on 54th Street about 225 feet (69 m) west of Fifth Avenue. James J. Goodwin was a prominent Connecticut businessman and railroad director who had a business partnership with his cousin, financier J. P. Morgan. McKim, Mead & White was commissioned to design a house on the site. The architects filed plans for the house with the New York City Department of Buildings in July 1896, with the house projected to cost $90,000, although the building was classified in blueprints as being a pair of residences. The Goodwin house was the first of the five structures at 5–15 West 54th Street to be developed.\nThe house was completed in 1898. Initially, James and Josephine Goodwin occupied the main unit at number 11 and leased out the secondary unit at number 9. The Goodwins maintained a house in Hartford, Connecticut, where James spent most of his time. James was also a member of several clubs in New York, including the Union Club, Century Association, and Metropolitan Club. James died in 1915 and left all of his estate to Josephine and their three sons. After James's death, Josephine continued to live at 11 West 54th Street. The surrounding neighborhood rapidly became a commercial zone after World War I, and many neighboring townhouses were converted to commercial use, but the Goodwin family retained the house. Their son Walter lived at the house briefly from 1921 to 1922. The Goodwin residence was used for events as well. In 1924, the dean of Lincoln Cathedral in England hosted a lecture to raise money to repair the damaged church, and in 1932, the house hosted a lecture on the importance of Christian missionary work in Japan.\nNumber 9 was leased to a variety of residents. One of the families that occupied the house was Mr. and Mrs. Elijah P. Smith. By 1915, it was the home of William S. Bryant, who oversaw the execution of Charles Becker, a policeman found guilty of murdering gambler Herman Rosenthal. In 1921, Josephine Goodwin leased the house to Francis de Ruyter Wissman and his wife. Bulletins of New York City social life indicated that the Wissmans were active in social life and that they were still residents of 9 West 54th Street in 1930. Josephine Goodwin died in 1939 and left most of the estate to her three sons. The windows had been boarded up by 1940.\n\n\nLater use\n\nThe house was acquired in 1941 by the Inter-America House, a Latin American cultural organization. The organization used the house for events such as a reception for the Mexican consul general, an event honoring Latin American Red Cross workers, and an event honoring Latin American women on a goodwill tour of the United States. In November 1943, MoMA opened a photography annex on the first floor of number 9 and the second floor of both units. A hole was cut in the second-floor wall to connect the units. At the time, Philip Goodwin was still recorded as the owner. The next year, the Parsonage Point Realty Company bought the house. The Rhodes Preparatory School leased both units for ten years in November 1944 and moved into the house. The school outright purchased the building in 1949. Many of the original decorative details were removed by the school.\nThe Rhodes School sold the house in 1979 to the United States Trust Company, a bank, for use as its own headquarters. The bank had considered moving its headquarters into several other structures, including buildings on wide avenues as well as new structures, before deciding upon the Goodwin mansion for its architecture. The bank hired Haines Lundberg Waehler to restore 9–11 West 54th Street largely to its original design. US Trust spent $5 million to ensure as much of the original detail as possible would be preserved or adapted to the bank's use. Materials were refurbished or replaced largely to the original specifications, and the bank invited James Goodwin's grandson Sage Goodwin to ask him about his childhood recollections of the house's design. Bank consultant David G. De Long said that original drawings were also used to restore the space. The architects even used scraps of original wallpaper to recreate the original wall designs and textures. A small annex in the rear was built for bank tellers.\nThe New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the five houses at 5–15 West 54th Street as city landmarks, including the Goodwin residence, on February 3, 1981. The Committee for the Preservation of West 54th and West 55th Streets had pushed for the landmark designation. At the time, the five houses were in various states of preservation: although 9–11 West 54th Street was being restored, the twin houses at 13 and 15 West 54th Street had been proposed for demolition. The New York Landmarks Conservancy granted the US Trust Company its 1981 Chairman's Award for preserving the house in the renovation. On January 4, 1990, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Residences at 5–15 West 54th Street historic district. US Trust expanded its space into 13 and 15 West 54th Street, demolishing a wall separating the two pairs of residences, in the late 20th century.\nDuring the 2000s, US Trust became part of Charles Schwab and subsequently Bank of America. In 2009, Bank of America sold the building for $29.4 million. The buyers, DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners and J.D. Carlisle, left it vacant, as they wanted to assemble other land lots nearby. The owners placed the property for sale in 2015. 11 West 54th Street and an adjacent office building at 10 West 55th Street was sold for $75 million in 2019 to the Wilf family, whose offices were at the adjacent 13 and 15 West 54th Street. Family member Orin Wilf, who led Skyline Partners, said at the time that he was unsure what he planned to do with the building. The Wilf family obtained a $91 million mortgage on the houses soon afterward. In June 2025, the Wilf family sold the house to Interlaken Capital for $38 million.\n\n\nSee also\nList of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\"11 West 54th Street Residence\" (PDF).

It is along 54th Street's northern sidewalk between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. The four-and-a-half-story building was designed by McKim, Mead & White in the Georgian Revival style and was constructed between 1896 and 1898 as a private residence. It is one of five consecutive townhouses erected along the same city block during the 1890s, the others being 5, 7, 13 and 15 West 54th Street.\nThe building is designed as a double house, with a larger unit at 11 West 54th Street to the west, as well as a smaller unit at 9 West 54th Street to the east. The facade is made of rusticated blocks of limestone on the first story, as well as Flemish bond brick on the upper stories. Businessman James Junius Goodwin—a cousin and business partner of J. P. Morgan—and his wife Josephine lived at the main unit at number 11 with his family and rented number 9.\nThe house initially served as the second residence for James Goodwin, who lived primarily in Connecticut.

    "text": "Myosotis pottsiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, endemic to the North Island of New Zealand. Lucy Moore described Myosotis petiolata var. pottsiana in 1961. Plants of this species of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes with ebracteate inflorescences and white corollas with exserted stamens.\n\n\nTaxonomy and etymology\nMyosotis pottsiana (L.B.Moore) Meudt, Prebble, R.J.Stanley & Thorsen is in the plant family Boraginaceae.  The species was originally described by Lucy Moore as a variety of M. pansa, Myosotis petiolata var. pottsiana in 1961. It was raised to species rank by Heidi Meudt, Jessica Prebble, Rebecca Stanley, and Michael Thorsen in 2013.\nThe lectotype specimen of Myosotis petiolata var. pottsiana was collected by Anthony Druce in 1956, and the holotype is lodged at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research (CHR 87624).\nMyosotis pottsiana was discovered by Norman Potts and Marc Heginbotham around 1952, and the variety and now species epithet honours Potts, who also collected and cultivated it.\nMyosotis pottsiana is morphologically and genetically most similar to M. pansa and M. petiolata. These three species are allopatric in their geographic distributions, and can be distinguished from one another by a suite of characters that includes corolla diameter (M. pottsiana: 5.3–9.8 mm; M. petiolata: 4.2–10.5 mm; and M. pansa: 7.6–14.3 mm).\n\n\nPhylogeny\nTwo individuals of Myosotis pottsiana have been included in phylogenetic analyses of standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA regions).\nIn addition, several individuals of Myosotis pottsiana were included in two different studies that phylogenetically analysed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) of the informal M. petiolata species group. In these analyses, Myosotis pottsiana was genetically differentiated from M. pansa and M. petiolata.\n\n\nDescription\nMyosotis pottsiana plants are rosettes. The rosette leaves have petioles that are 14–57 mm long. The rosette leaf blades are 7–51 mm long by 5–32 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.2–2.0: 1), usually narrowly obovate, obovate, broadly obovate, widest at or above the middle, with an obtuse and mucronate apex. Both surfaces of the leaf are uniformly and densely covered in straight, appressed, antrorse (forward-facing) hairs. Each rosette has multiple ascending, branched ebracteate (or sometimes partially bracteate) inflorescences that are up to 430 mm long. The cauline leaves are similar to the rosette leaves, but become smaller. The flowers are 6–73 per inflorescence, and each is borne on a short pedicel without a bract (or sometimes lowest flowers with a bract). The calyx is 2–4 mm long at flowering and 3–5 mm long at fruiting, lobed to half to three-quarters of its length, and densely covered in straight to curved, appressed to patent, antrorse hairs. The corolla is white and 7–15 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, petals that are narrowly ovate, ovate, obovate or broadly obovate, and small yellow scales alternating with the petals. The anthers are fully exserted. The four smooth, shiny, usually medium to dark brown nutlets are 1.3–1.8 mm long by 0.9–1.2 mm wide and ovoid to broadly ovoid in shape.\nThe pollen of Myosotis pottsiana is unknown.\nThe chromosome number of M. pottsiana is 2n = 44.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nAlthough once thought to be extinct, Myosotis pottsiana is known from a handful of populations in Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand from 40 to 300  m ASL, on vertical rock walls, steep river banks and forest bluffs.\n\n\nConservation status\nMyosotis pottsiana is listed as Threatened - Nationally Critical in the most recent assessment (2017-2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants. The qualifiers \"EF\" (Extreme fluctuations) and \"Sp\" (Sparse) are also attached to the assessment.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nMyosotis pottsiana occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

It soon became the leading forum for Shiki's Nippon school of haiku. The following year, the magazine's headquarters moved to Tokyo, and its editorship was taken over by Takahama Kyoshi. At the same time, the magazine's scope was expanded to include tanka and haibun as well as haiku, and Shiki began publishing essays in his shaseibun (\"sketch from life\") prose style. It had established itself as Japan's leading haiku magazine by this time, and the first Tokyo edition sold out on its first day.\nFollowing Shiki's death in 1902, the magazine's focus shifted to the fiction of modernist writers such as Natsume Sōseki, but in 1912, Kyoshi once again began including haiku.\nIn 1916, Kyoshi initiated the \"Kitchen Miscellanies\" column in Hototogisu to promote the writings of women haiku poets such as Hisajo Sugita.\nWhen Kyoshi died in 1959, editorship passed to his son Toshio.

    "text": "Euglossa mixta is a species of orchid bee native to Central America and South America, it is a member of the genus Euglossa a group of brilliant green and blue bees specialized in pollinating certain species of orchids.\n\n\nDescription\nE. mixta are varying shades of glossy metallic blue or deep violet with a refractive sheen transitioning to purple, red and finally orange at the tip of the abdomen. E. mixta can grow to a length of about 1.5 cm (0.59 in).\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe native range of E. mixta extends northwards and westwards from Southern Brazil all the way to the isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico. With records from South America being scattered while records from further north in Central America seem to indicate a more dense population of this species, especially between Nicaragua and Panama. Though this distribution may be affected by extensive sampling in Costa Rica.\nE. mixta lives in tropical forest habitats at elevations from near sea level to at least 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level. Euglossine bees tend to depend on intact forest habitats, possibly due to a higher abundance of orchids in these forests.\n\n\nEcology\nSpecies of this genus are known to pollinate orchids and tamarillo plants, as well as a number of other flowering plants. Euglossine bees are of great ecological importance to a number of orchids for which they are the sole pollinators. Information is needed on which species of orchid in particular is visited by E. mixta. There exists anecdotal and photographic evidence of bee visiting Spathiphyllum cochlearispathum which may be for the purpose of gathering pollen, protein, or scents. They are generally solitary bees and in order to attract a mate, males gather a collection of various scents creating a sort of perfume which they store in a pit on their hind legs then releases this fragrance and fanning their wings to disperse it.\n\n\nReproduction\nFemales construct a nest of wax about the size of a peach which vaguely resembles a mantis egg case. Male Euglossini bees lack a stinger, while females of this tribe possess a stinger and can be aggressive around a nest, though being solitary they rarely present a threat otherwise.\n\n\nPollination and ecological importance\nSome of the orchids that have been observed to be pollinated by E. mixta are in genera Mormodes and Kefersteinia. Other species of orchids, may simply provide scents as E. mixta has been observed to rub itself on petals and sepals but not access the pollen. \n\n\nNomenclature and etymology\nThe genus name Euglossa is Latin for \"well glossed\" in reference to the bright metallic coloration of these bees. The species name mixta is Latin for \"mixed\" referring to the spectrum of colors, this name was described by Friese in 1899, originally as a subspecies E. variabilis mixta.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe taxonomy of bees in the genus Euglossa is highly complicated as there are many similarities and groups of species which are genetically closely related. \nWithin the family Apidae, the subtribe of the orchid bees, Euglossini, contains 240 species described to science. Euglossini can be understood to be split into two generic groups or super genera. Euglossa being genetically distinct from the lineage of the other four genera Eufriesea, Eulaema, Aglae, Exaerete. The genus Euglossa (Latreille, 1802) is made up of six sub-genera with a total of around 100 described species, there is much debate as two the exact makeup of these six sub-genera. Based on genetic analysis Euglossa mixta appears to be most closely related to E. sapphirina within the species group typified by E. analis. \n\n\nReferences",

In some versions Windwagon Smith comes sweeping into town with his wind-powered Conestoga wagon complete and working. Other tellings have him inventing the wagon in town, building the craft, and gathering eager passengers, only to have his craft crash or his passengers abandon ship from sea sickness.   \nBy 1850 Westport and nearby Kansas City had displaced Independence, Missouri, as the main outfitting and starting point for traders, trappers, and emigrants heading west on the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails.  \n\n\nHistorical accounts\nContemporary news accounts have at least three real-life inventors of land-sailing, wind-powered wagons in that era. According to the December 1846 issue of the Independence Expositor newspaper, the first was a man named William Thomas. In 1853 Thomas showed a prototype with oversized wheels to the U.S. Army at Fort Leavenworth and formed an Overland Navigation Company. A second account involves Andy Dawson of Oskaloosa. According to Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, a third account involves Oskaloosa sawmill owner Samuel Peppard, who is said to have invented a sailing wagon in 1860 with at least partial success, according to the magazine's description of its arrival in Fort Kearny, Nebraska—250 miles from his starting point.\n\n\nRetellings\nWilbur Lang Schramm's short story \"Windwagon Smith\" won the 1942 O.

During his tenure as Secretary for Privatisation, the Greek Privatisation Programme raised approx. $10bn in proceeds in six years (1993–1999), approximately eight times the proceeds they raised from 1977 to 1992. For this achievement the Financial Times named Paraskevas 'Super Salesman' and praised him for his 'unflappable' style of closing deals.\nParaskevas is currently the Managing Partner of Elias Paraskevas Attorneys 1933, an international law firm with offices in Athens and London,  and the Président Délégué of the firm's Monaco consulting arm, Paraskevas S.A.M.

The Legal 500 Guide (2015) referred to him as 'a legal genius with extremely advanced business and legal sense'.\n\n\nPersonal life\nParaskevas established the Elias Paraskevas Foundation. His donations through this foundation include the Elias Paraskevas floor at the new academic building of the London School of Economics, which was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II.\nHe is also a keen collector of modern artworks by Greek sculptors and painters. The 'Paraskevas Collection' is considered unique and is often quoted in art scholarship discussing modern sculpture in Greece.\nHe often speaks at international conferences. In June 2010, at the eve of the Greek government debt crisis, in an IIF event in Vienna, Austria, Paraskevas stated publicly to George Papandreou, then Prime Minister of Greece, in front of an audience of 400 bankers, lawyers and regulators, that most members of the audience did not expect the Greek government to pay off its debt.  In response, Papandreou affirmed that Greece would pay off its debt; however, the Greek PSI proved Papandreou wrong 18 months later.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Ruth Fowler Edwards, Lady Edwards (December 1930 – October 2013) was a British geneticist and the long-time wife and collaborator of Robert G. (Bob) Edwards, the \"father\" of in vitro fertilization.\n\n\nLife\nRuth was descended from a line of distinguished scientists. According to Martin Johnson, She was the granddaughter of Ernest Rutherford, who himself won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1908, ‘for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances’ (Eve and Chadwick, 1938). Her father was Sir Ralph Fowler FRS (1889–1944; Milne, 1945), who was Plummer Professor of Mathematical Physics in Cambridge from 1932 to 1944.Her mother, Eileen Mary Rutherford, was the only daughter of physicist Lord Ernest Rutherford and they had four children, with Ruth as the youngest. Her mother died of a blood clot a week after Ruth's birth. \n\n\nUniversity years\nHaving developed an interest in biological sciences, Ruth Fowler studied genetics in the early 1950s at the University of Edinburgh and while there, she met the physiologist Bob Edwards in a statistics class in 1952 while she was working on her Ph.D. in genetics, after completing a biology degree there. Edwards was also doing work on his Ph.D. but was having problems so the two students teamed up, solved the problem and both completed their doctorates. After graduation, they left for California for post-doctoral assignments. They studied there a year before returning to the U.K.\nThey married in 1956 and went on to have 5 daughters: Caroline, Jenny, Sarah, and twins Anna and Meg.\n\n\nCareer\nFowler and Edwards worked together on controlled ovulation induction in the mouse. In their first joint paper, published in 1957, they showed that superovulation of adults was possible. Fowler later worked on the effects of progesterone and oestrogen on pregnancy and embryonic mortality in the mouse; the differences in ovarian output between natural conditions and superovulation; growth and genetics of the early human embryo developing in culture; uterine fluid composition and embryo implantation in the rabbit; steroidogenesis in human granulosa cells and follicular growth; glycoprotein composition and cell-to-cell interactions in the cumulus-oocyte complex.\nFowler continued to work and publish into the 1980s.\n\nAn obituary was published by Simon Fishel, Edwards' student, in RBM Online, a journal created by Edwards with the support of Fowler. In 2014, Fishel described her contributions in her obituary: She was a remarkable woman who had that rare capacity to juggle three, indeed four, of the most difficult and all too often competing roles in our complex lives: successful mother, wife and scientist whose highly significant work spanned more than three decades. And for that “elite fourth” role, provided sustenance at both the intellectual and family level to a great, Nobel Laureate husband!” It was fitting therefore that when Edwards was too ill to receive the Nobel Prize in person, these words were spoken, “In the absence of this year's Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, I ask Professor Edwards' wife and long-term scientific companion, Dr. Ruth Fowler Edwards, to come forward and receive his Prize from the hands of His Majesty the King.\n\n\nSelected publications\nDr. Ruth Fowler Edwards often published her work using her maiden name R.E.

    "text": "Precordial thump is a medical procedure used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia under certain conditions. The procedure has a very low success rate, but may be used in those with witnessed, monitored onset of one of the \"shockable\" cardiac rhythms if a defibrillator is not immediately available. It should not delay cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, nor should it be used in those with unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n\nProcedure\nIn a precordial thump, a provider strikes at the middle of a person's sternum with the ulnar aspect of the fist. The intent is to interrupt a potentially life-threatening rhythm. The thump is thought to produce an electrical depolarization of 2 to 5 joules.\n\n\nEffectiveness\nThe precordial thump may only be effective if administered within seconds of the onset of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. It is not helpful for treating ventricular fibrillation if too much time has passed. It also has very low effectiveness for treating ventricular arrhythmia (possibly even making it worse), and ventricular tachycardia, especially when compared to CPR and defibrillation as alternatives.\nHistorically, it was recommended as the initial action to take when addressing such witnessed and monitored cardiac arrests in a hospital setting. More recently, European guidelines recommend it should no longer be routinely used with available evidence suggesting it does not improve survival to hospital discharge. However, American guidelines continue advocating its use by healthcare professionals.\n\n\nAdverse effects and appearance\nThere are concerns that the precordial thump can result in worsening of a person's heart rhythm more often than it improves it.\nThe use of the precordial thump technique has sometimes been shown in famous movies and television, such as in The Good Doctor Season 2 episode 5 in which it is performed by Dr. Brown, and The Resident Season 1 episode 2 in which it is performed by Conrad Hawkins, usually in passing without any explanation.  Untrained laypersons have been known to attempt it, and sometimes cause additional injury to the person as the blow must be carefully aimed. If applied incorrectly it may cause further injury, for instance inducing cardiac arrest by blunt trauma, or breaking the tip of the sternum, risking fatal damage to the liver or other abdominal organs.\nAt one time, the technique was also taught as part of standard CPR training with the requirement that it must be administered within 60 seconds of the onset of symptoms.  That time restriction, combined with a number of injuries caused by improper technique, resulted in the procedure being removed from CPR training.\n\n\nHistory\nJames E. Pennington and Bernard Lown at Harvard University are credited with formalizing this technique in the medical literature. They published their report in the New England Journal of Medicine in the early 1970s. Richard S. Crampton and George Craddock, at the University of Virginia helped to promote the paramedic use of chest thump through a curious accident. In 1970, the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad (VA) was transporting a patient with an unstable cardiac rhythm in what was then called a Mobile Coronary Care Unit. When the vehicle inadvertently hit a speed bump in a shopping center parking lot, the patient's normal heart rhythm was restored. Further research confirmed that chest thumping patients with life-threatening arrhythmias could save lives.\n\n\nFist pacing\nPercussion pacing or fist pacing was proposed as a method of delivering mechanical pacing to someone in cardiac arrest. There is little evidence to support its use. In 1920, German physician Eduard Schott originally described percussion pacing, and a 2007 BJA article describes good benefit to this technique.\n\n\nReferences",

She believed that by planting trees in desert areas, one could halt the spread of the desert, make topsoil and provide food for both people and livestock. She also hoped to create microclimates that would make rain more likely. \n\n\nBiography\nShe was born around 1925 in New Zealand, the daughter of farmers. When travel became easier after the Second World War she set off on a traditional grand tour. Her love of trees began in Corsica where she worked for a logging company for five years.\nIn Hampshire, England, she called upon the tree expert Richard St. Barbe Baker in 1960, and learned about his idea that green wall agriculture could tame the desert. Campbell-Purdie went to a desert in Tiznit, Morocco, in 1964, and created an oasis with 2,000 trees that she planted. After Algerian Independence, Campbell-Purdie travelled to Algeria, where she was given a 100 hectare plot which had once been a French military dump covered in sheet metal and which received much of the town's waste water. Campbell-Purdie successfully planted 1,000 seedlings and one year later, 800 were still alive. Within four years, some were 12 feet high and she found grain growing among them. The Algerian government subsequently offered help and Campbell-Purdie ended up planting 130,000 trees in and around Bou Saada, Algeria under the aegis of the Algerian Red Crescent.\nCampbell-Purdie formed the Bou Saada Trust to raise funds to support her \"war against the Sahara.\" Her successes inspired the Algerian government to plant a 12-meter-wide wall of trees from border-to-border across that country.\nShe left Algeria in 1970, when her health broke down. She appeared as herself on the television game show \"To Tell the Truth\" in 1973.  \nCampbell-Purdie died in Athens, Greece, on 20 January 1985, aged 59.\n\n\nPublication\nCampbell-Purdie, Wendy, Fenner Brockway, Iris Murdoch, and John Boyd Orr Boyd-Orr. \"Woman against the desert.\" (1967).\n\n\nReferences",

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Nantwich.\n\n\nHistory\nIt is believed that there has been a church or chapel on or near the present site for nearly 700 years. The first record of a rector goes back to 1379. The first church on the site would have been a wooden building. The existing records start in 1572. In 1827 the decision was taken that \"due to decay it [the church] was unsuitable for public worship\". The present church was built in 1827–28 to a design by George Latham. The chancel was lengthened, and a transept was added in 1884. Further alterations were made in 1905.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nExterior\nThe church is built in brick with a slate roof.  Its plan consists of a west tower, a nave and a chancel. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner considered that the church is \"entirely Georgian\" in style and that this style was maintained in the 1884 additions.\n\n\nInterior\nThe chancel has oak panelling with carvings of sunflowers.  The reredos contains representations of the Agnus Dei and Alpha and Omega signs.  The right hand chancel window is to a design of Burne-Jones and was made by Morris and Company. In the church is a parish chest dated 1684 and a number of wall memorials dating from the 19th century. The two-manual organ was built by Hill in 1884 and in 1890 it was moved from the west gallery to the south of the chancel. There is a ring of eight bells.  Six of these were cast by Gillett & Johnston in 1920 and the other two in 1982 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.\n\n\nExternal features\nThe churchyard contains the war graves of three soldiers and an airman of World War I, and three soldiers of World War II. It also contains the local war memorial.\n\n\nSee also\n\nListed buildings in Wistaston\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=12398400",
    "text": "Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata, also known as the dotted humming frog, is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, swamps, and intermittent freshwater marshes.\n\n\nDescription\nChiasmocleis ventrimaculata is a small nocturnal frog of a snout–vent size of approximately 2 cm. C. ventrimaculata lacks webbing on the hind foot. It has a narrow and pointed head and a slender body.\nThese frogs prefer to remain underground during the day and emerge after dusk alongside their spider hosts and forage the surrounding areas. These frogs do not appear to be territorial. Often several frogs, ranging from 1 to 4, can be seen emerging from a tarantula's burrow.\nAs tadpoles, they are typically around 17 mm in length and have a body length of 7 mm. Their bodies are flattened and are about twice as wide as they are deep. They are widest at the eyes. These are large and widely separated. The snout when viewed from the dorsal position is broad and bluntly rounded and just rounded in the lateral view. The tadpole has no nostrils. These tadpoles have small mouths that are terminal. Their upper lips are large, fleshy and cover the oral cavity. They also lack horny mouthparts. These tadpoles are nearly uniform pale brown with additional pigmentation.\nThese frogs will cautiously exit the burrow at dusk to begin their foraging. The feeding habits of the frogs is that of a modified sit-and-wait forage mode. This means that they will sit and wait for food to arrive, similar to ambush predators. These frogs were observed to stay within a range of 5 cm from the entrance of the burrow and at the end of their foraging period rapidly dart back into the burrow.\n\n\nHabitat and distribution\nC. ventrimaculata lives among leaf litter and other vegetation close to the ground. During mating seasons, they are known to reproduce at temporary ponds of rainwater. Unfortunately, little is currently known about their habits during the dry season.\nC. ventrimaculata's native geographic distribution is quite disjointed. Most species are found in the western Amazon region (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and western Brazil).\n\n\nConservation status\n\n\nHabitat loss\nThe Amazon is the center of intense degradation because of human occupancy, deforestation, and mining. As a result, there are large parts of the habitat that are at risk.\n\n\nConservation efforts\nChiasmocleis ventrimaculata and Chiasmocleis species in general are not listed as threatened by the IUCN and most of the species are listed as Least concern.\n\n\nSpeciation, and phylogeny\n\n\nClose relatives\nC. ventrimaculata has several close relatives: Chiasmocleis albopunctata; C. anatipes; C. antenori; C. avilapiresae; C. bassleri; C. carvalhoi; C. devriesi; C. haddadi; C. hudsoni; C. magnova; C. papachibe; C. royi; C. shudikarensis; C. supercilialba; C. tridactyla.\n\n\nSubspecies\nChiasmocleis jimi is considered a junior synonym of Chiasmocleis hudsoni.\n\n\nDiet\nThe diet of Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata is mostly ant based. They are also known to feed on mites.\n\n\nReproduction and life cycle\nThe eggs are deposited into large temporary ponds which form because of the rainy season. Their clutch size is typically around 400 eggs per clutch. These eggs will hatch 36 hours after fertilization. Immediately after hatching, the frogs will remain motionless in a vertical position with their head up under the water. After 24 hours, they shift their position from a vertical to a diagonal of 45 degrees, still remaining motionless. After 48 hours, they begin to move. The froglets will leave the water after 3 weeks.\nThese tadpoles can be observed at different depths in shallow water (about 60 cm deep) and form big, nearly motionless aggregations, in which each individual is positioned in the same direction. The main diet of these tadpoles seems to be detritus from decomposing litter and insects.\n\n\nMating\nChiasmocleis ventrimaculata prefers breeding in temporary ponds in the forest. During the mating season, there is a change in the frog's behavior. Instead of being nocturnal, these frogs become active both during the day and at night. The males will begin to chorus, or sing, during this period of time as well.\nThese frogs are explosive breeders. During the rainy season, these frogs are found in groups of hundreds of individuals. After the first substantial rainfall (above 60 mm), males will begin to appear in nearby ponds of water and start to call. These choruses will first begin on land within leaf litter, and later from floating leaves and twigs. The females will reach the ponds by nightfall and these choruses will go on for the next day and night. On the third morning, the frogs will leave the pond which has been filled with clutches of eggs. There is a preliminary calculated sex ratio of 12 males to 1 female. In general, reproductive activities were highest at the beginning of the rainy season and decrease rapidly after November.\n\n\nMate searching behavior\nMales will make calls during the breeding season that consist of a series of short pulses (7–8 per second). The frequency range for these calls falls within 5.120–6.960 Hz. These males will move so that their vocal sacs are elevated so that females will be able to hear their calls.\nMating occurs during most of the day but particularly from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am. The females that are attracted to the males will move into the water towards the males, and the males will then jump into the water to perform amplexus. The males do not vocalize during amplexus, and this lasts up to 30 minutes.\n\n\nParental care\nChiasmocleis ventrimaculata will lay their eggs on the surface of ponds. Because of the explosive nature of their mating season, thousands of eggs can be deposited in one season onto these ponds. After hatching, the tadpoles will prefer the shores of the waters and tend to aggregate there as a way to defend against aquatic predators.\n\n\nSocial behavior\nThe frogs do not appear to care about living in groups and are not territorial. They have been seen living together with multiple frogs within one spider burrow. However, frogs do show high fidelity to the specific burrow which they originally selected and are never seen switching burrows. Even after the tarantulas leave the burrow because of the burrows becoming too inhospitable for the spiders to live in, Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata have been recorded to still live there.\n\n\nMutualisms\n\n\nCommensal relationship\nThis frog is primarily known for its mutualistic relationship with a burrowing tarantula originally thought to be Xenesthis immanis. However, further research suggests that this species of spider would not be found in the regions of Peru where the original research was conducted, and the tarantula may rather be some species of Pamphobeteus.\nWhether or not the relationship is mutualistic or commensal still dominates conversations surrounding this species. It is clear the dotted humming frog greatly benefits from this relationship, as the tarantula provides the frog protection from predators, a stable food source due to the frog's ability to feed off the remnants of the spider's prey, and shelter to protect from climate variations. On the other hand, the frog's foraging protects the tarantula's eggs from ants. The relationship between this specific frog and Xenesthis immanis appears to be a special one as these tarantulas attack similar frog species, therefore showing the dotted humming frog must have a special feature attractive to tarantulas. This mutualism between microhylids and large spiders also occurs in other parts of the world.\nTarantulas emerge from their burrows and dotted humming frogs closely follow, and although the tarantula would be expected to attack, they do not.\nIt has been hypothesized that the tarantulas might benefit from this relationship due to the fact these frogs are ant specialists, which can help them protect female spider's eggs from predation, increasing the fitness of female spiders who have these frogs in their burrows. Alternative suggestions include the skin of these frogs containing antimicrobial chemicals which help keep the spider eggs healthy and that because these frogs can attract predators, tarantulas with frogs in their burrows have access to more food because they can then eat these predators.\nThe tarantulas have been recorded attacking similar frog species to C. ventrimaculata, but have been never recorded attacking C. ventrimaculata by mistake. The movements of the frog do not stimulate the host tarantulas to attack and there is an unknown chemical present in the frog's skin that acts as a cue to the tarantulas that this species is not prey. The spiders did attempt to catch and eat five species of frogs from the families Bufonidae, Hylidae, and Leptodactylidae. It is noted that the frogs will remain more active in areas with some vegetation while the spiders used the open area.\n\n\nEnemies\n\n\nPredators\nAs tadpoles, Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata are often preyed upon by freshwater crustacean species such as Dilocarcinus and Goyazana. They have also been seen being eaten by odonate  larvae. In addition, turtle species such as Phrynops gibbus and Podocnemis unifilis are also known to feed on tadpoles. Spider species are known to prey on adult frogs and fish like Hoplias malabaricus, Synbranchus marmoratus also feed on frogs and tadpoles alike. Caimans have also been seen preying on these frogs. There are a wide variety of bird species, including capped herons, sunbitterns and double-toothed kites, which have also been seen feeding on the frogs and their young as well, although snake species appear to be the main predator of these frogs. Even certain species of bats, suspected to be Trachops cirrhosus, have been seen trying to feed on frogs during mass mating calls.\n\n\nProtective coloration and behavior\nChiasmocleis ventrimaculata have cryptic camouflage which allows them to resemble fallen leaves. In addition, when threatened these frogs will make a short leap and land with their legs stretched backwards in a stiff-legged posture. This behavior has been seen to last up to 4 minutes.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Data related to Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata at Wikispecies\n Media related to Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata at Wikimedia Commons",

Banks of issue are thus a more recent creation than transfer or giro banks, which create money in accounts on a ledger, the oldest recorded being the Taula de canvi de Barcelona established in 1401.\nIn many countries and particularly during the 19th century, several banks were authorized to issue notes that had simultaneous status as legal tender. The authorization, often referred to as the issuance privilege, was generally granted by the government on a bank-specific basis and for a limited period of time. During the 20th century, the role of bank of issue has been increasingly assumed by central banks in their respective territorial jurisdictions. In the 21st century, \"bank of issue\" and \"central bank\" have become essentially synonymous except in a few special cases such as Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\n\n19th century\n\nSeveral European countries went through periods during which multiple banks of issue coexisted and had their banknotes simultaneously recognized as legal tender. Such experiences do not count as free banking, however, because banks typically needed to receive a specific issuance privilege from the government to be able to issue notes. Some banks incorporated that privilege into their name and brand identity, for example the Privileged Austrian National Bank (est. 1816), Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly (est. 1882), or Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia (est. 1884).\nIn Great Britain, country banks that issued banknotes multiplied in the 18th century, even though the Bank of England had a monopoly on note issuance in London and its immediate surroundings. The Bank Charter Act 1844 established a nationwide note-issuance monopoly for the Bank of England in England and Wales, but not in Scotland or Ireland.\nIn France, the Bank of France's note issuance was originally focused on Paris and its region, and several other note-issuing banks known as banques départementales were established in the early 19th century in commercial hubs such as Bordeaux, Marseille or Rouen. The banques départementales were wiped out in the financial crisis associated with the French Revolution of 1848, which resulted in the widening of the Bank of France's note-issuance monopoly to the entire country. Following the Treaty of Turin (1860), the Bank of Savoy briefly found itself a second bank of issue in France, and the Pereire brothers attempted to take advantage of this situation to compete with the Bank of France, but their bid failed in 1864 and played a role in the subsequent demise of their main financial venture the Crédit Mobilier.\nIn the German Confederation, the first banks of issue were chartered by individual states in the Vormärz period. Not including Austria, there were nine such Notenbanken by 1851. These were not the only issuers of paper money, however, since most German states (with the only exceptions of Lippe and the Hanseatic cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck) also issued government notes without the intermediation of a bank. By 1870, the number of banks of issue had grown to 31 in the territories that would soon become the German Reich.\nBanks of issue were similarly chartered by individual Italian states. In the early decades following Italian unification, the National Bank of the Kingdom of Italy coexisted with five other banks of issue inherited from that pre-unification history, namely the Banca Nazionale Toscana, Banca Toscana di Credito, Banca Romana, Banco di Napoli, and Banco di Sicilia. In 1893, following the Banca Romana scandal, the Bank of Italy was formed by merger to become the country's dominant bank of issue, but the Banco di Napoli and Banco di Sicilia both remained separate and retained an issuance role until 1926.\nIn Japan, multiple banks of issue coexisted during a brief period under the leadership of statesman Ōkubo Toshimichi in the early Meiji era, starting with the First National Bank or Dai-Ichi Bank established in 1873 by Shibusawa Eiichi. Around 150 such national banks were created by the late 1870s, some of which survive (often following mergers). In the 1880s, however, Ōkubo's successor Matsukata Masayoshi led the establishment of the Bank of Japan and the subsequent phasing out of the national banks' note-issuance privilege, a process which was completed in the 1890s.\n19th-century banks of issue in Europe were most often private-sector entities, albeit typically under hands-on government oversight. That was the case of most mid-century German private banks of issue except the Bank of Bremen and Frankfurter Bank, which were comparatively independent, and the Bank of Prussia, which had the Prussian government as a minority shareholder. In the Russian Empire, government-owned banks of issue in Saint Petersburg - successively the Assignation Bank, State Commercial Bank and State Bank - coexisted with the Bank of Finland and, for a brief period between 1828 and 1841, the Bank Polski.\nMost 19th-century banks in the United States until 1863 were banks of issue, even though the term is infrequent in U.S. financial historiography because of the ubiquity of the practice. The U.S. is also special in having established a viable system of government notes (i.e. paper money directly issued by the government) with the National Bank Act of 1863, in contrast with most other countries where government notes (as opposed to banknotes issued by banks) was typically associated with monetary instability, as had been the case with French assignats in the 1790s. In the Ottoman Empire, nonconvertible government notes known as kaime coexisted at times with the higher-quality banknotes of the Imperial Ottoman Bank.\n\n\nColonial and quasi-colonial banks of issue\n\nIn European colonial empires as well as the Japanese colonial empire, dedicated banks of issue were established to provide currency (and also often credit) in the overseas territories without interfering with monetary and financial stability at home. Prominent colonial banks of issue included the Bank of Java (est. 1828), Banque de l'Algérie (est. 1851), Banco Nacional Ultramarino (est. 1864), Banque de l'Indochine (est. 1875), Bank of Taiwan (est. 1899), Banque du Congo Belge (est. 1909), Bank of Chōsen (est. 1911), and Banco de Angola (est. 1926). Depending on available communication technologies and on specific situations, the head office of these banks was either in the home country or in the colony itself, occasionally moving in one or the other direction: for example, the seat of the Banque de l'Algérie was relocated from Algiers to Paris in 1900, and that of the Bank of Chōsen from Seoul (then named Keijō) to Tokyo in 1926.\nOther banks of issue were established for nominally sovereign countries but under foreign control (in some cases even including headquarters abroad) that was associated with quasi-colonial relations. These included the National Bank of Haiti (est. 1881 in Paris), Imperial Bank of Persia (est. 1889 in London), National Bank of Egypt (est. 1898 in Cairo), State Bank of Morocco (est. 1907 in Tangier), National bank of Albania (est. 1925 in Rome), as well as multiple banks in Qing China and the Beiyang government such as the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank (est. 1889), Russo-Chinese Bank (est. 1895), Banque Sino-Belge (est. 1902), or Banque Industrielle de Chine (est. 1913). Japan's Dai-Ichi Bank played a similar role in the Korean Empire in the years preceding \nannexation in 1910. The Imperial Ottoman Bank (est. 1863 in Constantinople) was foreign-owned but with such autonomy that it would never neatly fit the description of a quasi-colonial bank. The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, established in 1866 simultaneously in British Hong Kong and the Shanghai International Settlement, combined the features of colonial and quasi-colonial banks of issue, as did the Banque de l'Indochine through its operations in China from 1898 onwards.\nIn languages other than English, some of these colonial banks or currency boards have had \"bank of issue\" in their name. These include the Bank of Issue in Poland during World War II (German: Emissionsbank in Polen), and several monetary authorities in the French-speaking world branded Institut d'Émission. Among the latter, the Paris-based Institut d'Émission d'Outre-Mer and Institut d'Émission des Départements d'Outre-Mer are still in activity, even though only the former remains a bank of issue (issuing the CFP franc).\n\n\nGeneralisation of central banking\nBy the end of the 19th century, central banks had established a monopoly on money issuance in only a subset of the world's sovereign countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Austria-Hungary and Belgium. Other countries such as Germany and Italy were well on their way towards that model, with banks of issue other than the central bank losing their residual issuance role in 1926 and 1935 respectively. By contrast, central banks did not exist at all in large parts of the world. In Latin America, the only central bank existing until World War I was the Central Bank of Uruguay established in 1896; the Brussels International Financial Conference of 1920 played a seminal role in the general adoption of the central banking paradigm in Latin America, as it did in the newly independent countries of central and eastern Europe with the support of the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations. Later in the century, decolonization led to the gradual replacement of colonial banks of issue by national central banks. \nIn Hong Kong, a system of multiple banks of issue survives, with Bank of China, HSBC and Standard Chartered authorized to issue their own banknotes even though monetary policy is entrusted to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Similar systems are in place for the issuance of the banknotes of Scotland (with Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland) and banknotes of Northern Ireland (with Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, and Ulster Bank), both under the authority of the Bank of England.\n\n\nSee also\nMoney creation\nCounterfeit money\nHistory of money\n\n\nReferences\n\n Data related to Bank of issue at Wikidata",

During the early years of the World Bank, which was founded in 1945, Colombia served as a main strategic partner when the focus of the institution shifted from the reconstruction of Europe to assisting the development in poor countries. The subsequent cooperation between the World Bank and the country has led to a variety of different projects being implemented. As of November 2018 there has been to a total of over 280 projects, of which 20 are presently active, in an array of sectors such as assistance of the central government, the sub-national government and social protection. The current active commitment amount is US$2.3 billion.\nThe self-proclaimed mission of the World Bank is to reduce the share of the global population that is living in extreme poverty and to increase the income of the poorest 40 percent in every country. In Colombia the percentage of people living on less than US$1.90, which is the international poverty line as defined by the World Bank, has decreased from 16.5 percent in 1996 (earliest data available) to 4.5 percent in 2016. This indicates progress with regard to the first goal. While the GDP per capita increased from US$4,862.07 in 1996 to US$7,531.98 in 2016 (measured in constant 2010 US$), the GINI coefficient decreased from 56.9 to 50.8 during that same timeframe. This is signalling an advancement concerning the second goal. However, inequality remains among the highest in South America.\n\n\nSelected Projects\nThere has been a variety of notable projects that were executed in cooperation between the World Bank and Colombia. A number of these are related to education, which is a significant part of the agenda of the World Bank. Furthermore, support is provided for the construction of an important and prestigious infrastructure project - the Bogotá Metro - that is expected to start in 2019.\n\n\nEducation\nThe World Bank has executed a variety of projects that were designed to improve the accessibility of education. In 2002 the \"Higher Education - Improving Access\" project was approved. The program was designed to increase both the equity in access and the quality of tertiary education. This was done through the means of student-aid which was meant to encourage students to participate in a doctoral program. Furthermore, close monitoring of the labor market should provide information to the institutions that will help them in offering an education which equips students with skills that are actually being demanded.\n\nIn 2008 the \"Second Adaptable Program Lending\" (APL) was ratified which encompasses two phases, namely the \"Second Student Loan Support Project (APL Phase 1)\" and the \"Colombia Rural Education Project (APL Phase 2)\". The first phase had the goal of increasing enrolment and graduation rates in tertiary education by facilitating access for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Funding for tertiary education was expanded and the sources from which to receive funding have been diversified. The second phase was specifically designed to offer access to education in a number of rural municipalities.\nThe \"Access and Quality in Higher Education Project - PACES\" has been approved in 2017. It consists of three different components that are designed to improve the quality of tertiary education and increase enrolment of students from socio-economic disadvantaged backgrounds. The three components are: i) an increased availability of loans; ii) an improvement in the quality of educational institutions; and iii) an improvement in the governmental agencies responsible for education.\nIn total the commitment amount by the World Bank to this extract of educational projects was $US 660 million. Generally, the effort that the World Bank has been putting not only into these three exemplary projects, but into a large number of others in addition to that, has improved the access to and the quality of education and is expected to keep doing so in the future.\n\n\nBogotá Metro\n\nThe World Bank is attempting to support the construction of the metro in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia. Assistance is going to be provided in two phases. The first phase is concerned with the technical part of undertaking the construction process. A second phase will be oriented towards the integration of the new metro into the public transportation system of Bogotá and in conducting research in different areas such as pollution, security and safety. Furthermore, the Bogota metro company will receive help in building a functioning institutional structure.\nThe first in a series of envisioned programmes that are designed for this purpose was approved in 2018 and has a commitment amount of $US 70 million. This infrastructure project is the largest being implemented in Colombia and is important for an increased accessibility to the city, the urban development and it will generally higher the quality of public transportation.\n\n\nStrategic Partnership\n\n\nIBRD and IDA\nIn the fiscal year of 2018 Colombia was the number ten top borrower country of the IBRD with a total of US$702 million in commitments.\nAs of November 2018 there is a total of 286 projects, of which 251 have been closed, 11 have been dropped, 20 are active and 4 are in the pipeline.\n\n\nIFC\nAs of June 30, 2018 Colombia is placed on rank eight on the list of IFC's largest country exposures with a total of US$1343 million in the committed portfolio making up 2.35% of the global portfolio.\n\n\nMIGA\nIn March 2018 MIGA announced the support for a variety of projects that are being implemented through a state-owned enterprise by providing a credit guarantee for foreign direct investment amounting to a total of US$95 million. It is the first time ever that MIGA is offering a guarantee for a loan that is given to a state-owned enterprise.\n\n\nICSID\nColombia has signed the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other states on May 18, 1993.\nOf the fifty-seven newly registered cases at the ICSID in the fiscal year of 2018, the instrument invoked as a basis of consent was the U.S. - Colombia Free Trade Agreement in 2% of the cases and the Canada - Colombia Free Trade Agreement in 3% of the cases.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Planing is a manufacturing process of material removal in which the workpiece reciprocates against a stationary cutting tool producing a plane or sculpted surface.  Planing is analogous to shaping.  The main difference between these two processes is that in shaping the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece.  Planing motion is the opposite of shaping. Both planing and shaping are rapidly being replaced by milling.\nThe mechanism used for this process is known as a planer. The size of the planer is determined by the largest workpiece that can be machined on it. The cutting tools are usually carbide tipped or made of high speed steel and resemble those used in facing and turning.\n\n\nProcess\nIn shaping, the tool is brought into position with the workpiece. The tool then repeatedly moves in a straight line while the workpiece is incrementally fed into the line of motion of the tool, this produces a flat, smooth, and sculpted surface. For shaped pieces the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece. The tools are usually tilted or lifted after each stroke. This is done hydraulically or manually in order to prevent the tool surface from chipping when the workpiece travels back across.\n\n\nWorkpiece geometry\nPlaning can be used to produce flat surfaces, as well as  cross-sections with grooves and notches, are produced along the length of workpiece. Shaping is basically the same as planing, except the workpiece is usually smaller, and it is the tool that moves and not the workpiece.\nPlaning can be used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping. Shaping is used not only for flat surfaces, but also for external or internal surfaces (either horizontal or inclined). Curved and irregular surfaces can also be produced by using special attachments\n\n\nSetup and equipment\nFlat, angular, and contoured surfaces are made by horizontal shapers. Concerning shaping, the device that holds the piece being worked on has a very heavy movable jaw to withstand cutting forces. The size of the planer needed is determined by the workpiece.  Depending on the size of the workpiece many clamps and supporting devices may be used to hold it on the planer.\n\n\nTypical tools and geometry produced\nThe tools for shaping/planing are usually made of high speed steel or carbide tipped. Except for some slight angle difference, cutting tools resemble those used in facing and turning.  Some advantages of using single-point cutting tools over multipoint tools is that they are more easily sharpened and fabricated. Internal shapes can be made by using a special extension tool.  \n\n\nMaterial properties\nAlthough the most common material to be planed or shaped is wood, there are planers and shaping machines capable of processing anything from metal pieces to plastic objects.\n\n\nFurther reading\nTodd, Robert H and Allen, Dell K.

The Project counts with local communities and was started in the community of Moitas Venda in Portugal.\n\n\nGoals\nThe main goal of WirelessPT is to build a large scale free wireless Wi-Fi network that is decentralized and owned by those who run it and to support local communication. The project is governed by its own agreement which was inspired in the Pico peering Agreement where participants agree upon a network that is free from discrimination and upholds net neutrality. Among other communities like guifi.net and freifunk, WirelessPT has and shares similarities.\nAmong several goals the project includes:\n\nDevelopment of mesh networks for communities built by the ordinary citizen\nFoster free access to communication technologies\nEstablish wireless connectivity with other communities and regions\nSharing and developing technological communication resources with and for their communities\nPromote, educate and provide technical information on wireless networks to communities environment about the importance of online privacy, security and democracy.\n\n\nTechnology\nLike many other free community-driven networks, Wirelesspt uses mesh technology to bring up ad hoc networks by interconnecting multiple Wireless LANs using mobile ad hoc network technology and a special routing software. \nIf one of these routers fail, this special software automatically calculates a new path to the final destination. This software is called mvwrt firmware. It is based on OpenWrt and other free software such as LEDE and was specifically designed for the needs and challenges of the project.\nThere are many different developed versions of the firmware depending on the hardware and protocols that local communities decide to use. Having previously tested olsr, WirelessPT decided to work with Ad Hoc and the B.A.T.M.A.N. routing protocol as the firmware base routing protocol.\n\n\nHistory\nFounded in January 2011 in Portugal after 2 years of planning the project was first started by its founder with a setup of 9 nodes and 5 gateways in 3 weeks to cover an area of 6 square kilometres using ddwrt firmware.\nIn 2013 the project developed its own firmware and expanded their nodes count as well as coverage until today and became a registered national trademark in 2016 after participating in the Battlemesh v9 event.\nThe project is currently active and stable also because it very easy to install the wireless kit specifically created for non-tech-savvy users and with the use of the self-managed and auto configured firmware on off-the-shelf wireless routers a node is fully functional without human interaction soon as the firmware is uploaded to a node.\nDuring its development of the project, it also created one of the best sources of dyi wireless documentation that can be found online offering solutions for small to large projects.\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website also available on the Tor hidden service network]\nVideo clip on youtube that explains the project\nFirmware Information (Translation bar provided on the wiki)\nPortuguese mesh network\nWireless presentation at University of Minho\nPresentation Wireless Battle Mesh v9 2016 at INESC TEC\nSupporter on making regulation work community networks\nPico Peering Agreement\nWireless Networking in the developing world.

In 1807, he co-founded the Bell School, the first school for African Americans in Washington, D.C.\n\n\nEarly life\nBell was born into slavery in Virginia. His wife, Sophia Browning, purchased his freedom while she was also enslaved. Bell worked as a carpenter in Washington, D.C., and used his wages to purchase his wife's freedom.\n\n\nEducation advocacy\nBell could not read or write. He believed that education should be accessible for African Americans and became an activist in this area. Bell co-founded and built a one-story school house with Nicholas Franklin and Moses Liverpool, two free African American men who were also formerly enslaved. Their school, the Bell School, was located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The original Bell School closed after few years due to a lack of funding. The school is considered Washington D.C.'s first school for African Americans.\nBell co-founded the Resolute Beneficial Society, a society that supported health, education, and burial needs of Washington, D.C.'s Black community. The society successfully re-opened the Bell School in 1818.\n\n\nDeath\nBell died in Washington, D.C., in 1843.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "A die is a specialized machine tool used in manufacturing industries to cut and/or form material to a desired shape or profile. Stamping dies are used with a press, as opposed to drawing dies (used in the manufacture of wire) and casting dies (used in molding) which are not. Like molds, dies are generally customized to the item they are used to create.\nProducts made with dies range from simple paper clips to complex pieces used in advanced technology. Continuous-feed laser cutting may displace the analogous die-based process in the automotive industry, among others.\n\n\nDie stamping\n\nBlanking and piercing are two die cutting operations, and bending is an example of a die forming operation.\n\n\nDie forming\nForming operations work by deforming materials like sheet metal or plastic using force (compression, tension, or both) and rely on the material's mechanical properties. Forming dies are typically made by tool and die makers and put into production after mounting into a press.\n\n\nDifferences between materials\nFor the vacuum forming of plastic sheet only a single form is used, typically to form transparent plastic containers (called blister packs) for merchandise. Vacuum forming is considered a simple molding thermoforming process but uses the same principles as die forming.\nFor the forming of sheet metal, such as automobile body parts, two parts may be used: one, called the punch, performs the stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation, while another part that is called the die block securely clamps the workpiece and provides a similar stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation. The workpiece may pass through several stages using different tools or operations to obtain the final form. In the case of an automotive component, there will usually be a shearing operation after the main forming is done. Additional crimping or rolling operations may be performed to ensure that all sharp edges are hidden and/or to add rigidity to the panel.\n\n\nDie components\nThe main components of a die set (including press mounting) are as follows. Because nomenclature varies between sources, alternate names are in parentheses:\n\nDie shoes (holders) – the set of flat, parallel plates that serve as the foundation for mounting die components.\nGuide pins (pillars) – together with guide bushings, the pins align the die shoes precisely during each press stroke.\nDie set (plates). Placement can be inverted depending on the operation, such as use of a knock-out:\nDie block – the lower (bottom) half of the die set. Machined to conform to the desired shape of the workpiece being formed or cut.\nPunch plate – the upper (top) half of the die set. Holds and supports the different punches in place.\nPunch – male portion of the die which punches through the sheet metal and into the corresponding (female) section of the die block. More specifically:\nBlanking punch – performs a dual-purpose operation where either a profiled slug, called the blank, is cut out and used for further working, or where a finished piece is cut free from the sheet metal.\nPierce punch – cuts a desired shape (circular, polygonal, etc.) out of the workpiece. The slug is discarded.\nStripper plate (pad) – spring-loaded plate that separates (i.e., strips) the workpiece from the withdrawing punch after each press stroke.\nPilot – This will help to place the sheet accurately for the next stage of operation.\nStock guide – ensures that the material being worked on always goes in the same position, within the die, as the last one.\nSetting (stop) block – This part is used to control the depth that the punch goes into the die.\nShank – installs the punch plate to the press. It should be aligned and situated at the center of gravity of the plate.\n\n\nProcess\nBlanking: A blanking die produces a flat piece of material by cutting the desired shape in one operation. The finished part is referred to as a blank. Generally a blanking die may only cut the outside contour of a part, often used for parts with no internal features.Three benefits to die blanking are:\nAccuracy. A properly sharpened die, with the correct amount of clearance between the punch and die, will produce a part that holds close dimensional tolerances in relationship to the part's edges.\nAppearance. Since the part is blanked in one operation, the finish edges of the part produces a uniform appearance as opposed to varying degrees of burnishing from multiple operations.\nFlatness. Due to the even compression of the blanking process, the result is a flat part that may retain a specific level of flatness for additional manufacturing operations.\nBroaching: The process of removing material through the use of multiple cutting teeth, with each tooth cutting behind the other. A broaching die is often used to remove material from parts that are too thick for shaving.\nBulging: A bulging die expands the closed end of tube through the use of two types of bulging dies. Similar to the way a chef's hat bulges out at the top from the cylindrical band around the chef's head.\nBulging fluid dies: Uses water or oil as a vehicle to expand the part.\nBulging rubber dies: Uses a rubber pad or block under pressure to move the wall of a workpiece.\nCoining: is similar to forming with the main difference being that a coining die may form completely different features on either face of the blank, these features being transferred from the face of the punch or die respectively. The coining die and punch flow the metal by squeezing the blank within a confined area, instead of bending the blank. For example, an Olympic medal that was formed from a coining die may have a flat surface on the back and a raised feature on the front. If the medal was formed (or embossed), the surface on the back would be the reverse image of the front.\nCompound operations: Compound dies perform multiple operations on the part. The compound operation is the act of implementing more than one operation during the press cycle.\nCompound die: A type of die that has the die block (matrix) mounted on a punch plate with perforators in the upper die with the inner punch mounted in the lower die set. An inverted type of blanking dies that punches upwards, leaving the part sitting on the lower punch (after being shed from the upper matrix on the press return stroke) instead of blanking the part through. A compound die allows the cutting of internal and external part features on a single press stroke.\nCurling: The curling operation is used to roll the material into a curved shape. A door hinge is an example of a part created by a curling die.\nCut off: Cut off dies are used to cut off excess material from a finished end of a part or to cut off a predetermined length of material strip for additional operations.\nDrawing: The drawing operation is very similar to the forming operation except that the drawing operation undergoes severe plastic deformation and the material of the part extends around the sides. A metal cup with a detailed feature at the bottom is an example of the difference between formed and drawn. The bottom of the cup was formed while the sides were drawn.\nExtruding: Extruding is the act of severely deforming blanks of metal called slugs into finished parts such as an aluminum I-beam. Extrusion dies use extremely high pressure from the punch to squeeze the metal out into the desired form. The difference between cold forming and extrusion is extruded parts do not take shape of the punch.\nForming: Forming dies to bend the blank along a curved surface. An example of a part that has been formed would be the positive end(+) of a AA battery.\nCold forming (cold heading): Cold forming is similar to extruding in that it squeezes the blank material but cold forming uses the punch and the die to create the desired form, extruding does not.\n\nRoll forming: a continuous bending operation in which sheet or strip metal is gradually formed in tandem sets of rollers until the desired cross-sectional configuration is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing parts with long lengths or in large quantities.\nHorning: A horning die provides an arbor or horn in which the parts are placed for secondary operations.\nHydroforming: Forming of tubular part from simpler tubes with high water pressure.\nPancake die: A Pancake die is a simple type of manufacturing die that performs blanking and/or piercing. While many dies perform complex procedures simultaneously, a pancake die may only perform one simple procedure with the finished product being removed by hand.\nPiercing: The piercing operation is used to pierce holes in stampings.\nTransfer die: Transfer dies provide different stations for operations to be performed. A common practice is to move the material through the die so it is progressively modified at each station until the final operation ejects a finished part.\nProgressive die: The sheet metal is fed through as a coil strip, and a different operation (such as punching, blanking, and notching) is performed at the same station of the machine with each stroke of a series of punches.\nPunching:\nShaving: The shaving operation removes a small amount of material from the edges of the part to improve the edges finish or part accuracy. (Compare to Trimming).\nSide cam die: Side cams transform vertical motion from the press ram into horizontal or angular motion.\nSub press operation: Sub-press dies blank and/or form small watch, clock, and instrument parts.\nSwaging: Swaging (necking) is the process of \"necking down\" a feature on a part. Swaging is the opposite of bulging as it reduces the size of the part. The end of a shell casing that captures the bullet is an example of swaging.\nTrimming: Trimming dies cut away excess or unwanted irregular features from a part, they are usually the last operation performed.\nPillar set: Pillar set are used for alignment of dies in press movement.\n\n\nSteel-rule die\nSteel-rule die, also known as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer materials, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of hardened steel strips, known as steel rule. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, they are not as robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.\n\n\nRotary die\nIn the broadest sense, a rotary die is a cylindrical shaped die that may be used in any manufacturing field. However, it most commonly refers to cylindrical shaped dies used to process soft materials, such as paper or cardboard. Two rules are used, cutting and creasing rules. This is for corrugated boards whose thickness is more than 2 mm. Rotary dies are faster than flat dies.\nThe term also refers to dies used in the roll forming process.\n\n\nWire pulling\n\nWire-making dies have a hole through the middle of them. A wire or rod of steel, copper, other metals, or alloy enters into one side and is lubricated and reduced in size. The leading tip of the wire is usually pointed in the process. The tip of the wire is then guided into the die and rolled onto a block on the opposite side. The block provides the power to pull the wire through the die.\nThe die is divided into several different sections. First is an entrance angle that guides the wire into the die. Next is the approach angle, which brings the wire to the nib, which facilitates the reduction. Next is the bearing and the back relief. Lubrication is added at the entrance angle. The lube can be in powdered soap form. If the lubricant is soap, the friction of the drawing of wire heats the soap to liquid form and coats the wire. The wire should never actually come in contact with the die. A thin coat of lubricant should prevent the metal to metal contact.\nFor pulling a substantial rod down to a fine wire a series of several dies is used to obtain progressive reduction of diameter in stages.\nStandard wire gauges used to refer to the number of dies through which the wire had been pulled. Thus, a higher-numbered wire gauge meant a thinner wire. Typical telephone wires were 22-gauge, while main power cables might be 3- or 4-gauge.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nDegarmo, E. Paul; Black, J T.; Kohser, Ronald A.

The school is operated by the Newark Public Schools and is located at 279 Chancellor Avenue. The school is accredited until July 2031 and has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since April 2024.\nAs of the 2023–24 school year, the school had an enrollment of 621 students and 43.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.3:1. There were 425 students (68.4% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 58 (9.3% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\n\n\nHistory\nWest Side High School opened on September 14, 1925, in a building designed to provide students with classrooms, an auditorium, gyms, and other facilities, serving 520 boys and 809 girls.\nThe school had been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools until 2011, when the school's accreditation status was removed.\nFrom 2014 to 2018, the West Side campus hosted two separate high school programs that operated independently but shared a facility and athletic programs:\n\nNewark Early College High School, which prepares students in grades 7–12 to complete up to 60 college-level credits during their high school career\nNewark Vocational High School prepares students in grades 9-12 for college and career options.\n\n\nAwards, recognition and rankings\nThe school was the 326th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 268th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 319th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 313th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 313th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.\nWest Side High School has received national attention for its community-based educational approach and commitment to student support. In recognition of these efforts, the Ellen DeGeneres Show awarded the school two $50,000 grants through the \"One Million Acts of Good\" campaign, highlighting Principal Akbar Cook's work to address the needs of students beyond academics.\nIn May 2019, Oprah Winfrey made a surprise visit to the school and announced a $500,000 gift to support the Lights On initiative, a program designed to provide students with a safe and supportive environment during evenings and weekends.\n\n\nAthletics\nThe West Side High School Roughriders compete in the Super Essex Conference, which is comprised of public and private high schools in Essex County and was established following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). Prior to the 2009 realignment, the team had been in the Skyline Division of the Northern Hills Conference, which included schools in Essex, Morris and Passaic counties. With 728 students in grades 10–12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Group II for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 486 to 758 students in that grade range. The football team competes in the Freedom White division of the North Jersey Super Football Conference, which includes 112 schools competing in 20 divisions, making it the nation's biggest football-only high school sports league. The school was classified by the NJSIAA as Group III North for football for 2024–2026, which included schools with 700 to 884 students.\nThe boys' cross country team won the Group IV state championship in 1949, 1950 (as co-champion with Asbury Park High School), 1951, 1953 and 1954.\nThe boys' track team won the Group III indoor relay state championship in 1988\nThe boys track team won the Group II spring / outdoor track state championship in 1988 and the Group IV title in 1989.\nThe 1993 girls' basketball team won the Group III state championship with a 60–50 defeat in the tournament final of Egg Harbor Township High School, the state's top-ranked team and the group's defending champion. Entering the Tournament of Champions as the fourth-seeded team, West Side defeated number five seed Haddonfield Memorial High School by a score of 44–39 in the quarterfinals and top-seeded St. Rose High School by 48–38 in the semis before falling to second-seed St. John Vianney High School in the finals by a score of 57–43 to finish the season with a 30–4 record.\nThe football team won the 2007 North II Group III state sectional championship with a 20–0 win against South Plainfield High School in a game played at Giants Stadium, earning the team its first ever sectional title. Since 2009, the football team plays their home games at Untermann Field, which is shared with other public schools in Newark, following the closure and demolition of Newark Schools Stadium, which was constructed in 1925 and closed in 2006.\nThe boys basketball team won the Group II state championship in 2016 and 2017, defeating Camden High School in the tournament final both years. Down by 17 points at halftime, the 2016 team scored two foul shots with less than two seconds remaining in the game to defeat Camden 85–53 in the Group II championship game. The team won its second consecutive Group II title with a 51–49 win in the championship game. The team advanced to the Tournament of Champions both seasons, coming into the 2016 ToC seeded fourth and falling 71–62 to fifth-seeded Teaneck High School in the quarterfinals; the 2017 team was the fifth seed, again falling in the quarterfinals to Teaneck, this time in overtime by a score of 70–62 to finish the season with a record of 25–7.\n\n\nAdministration\nThe school's principal is Akbar Cook.

Horsethief Basin Lake is located 6.5 miles southeast of Crown King on Crown King Rd/Forest 259 Rd.\n\n\nHistory\nAn estimated US$2,000,000 in gold was taken from the Crowned King Mine alone; the mines have been closed since the 1950s and for the past half-century tourism has been the only reliable source of income in the area, despite the fact that the unpaved, mountainous access roads are rocky, rough and slow to drive.\nThe first recorded gold claim in Crown King was \"Buckeye\" and was filed by Rod McKinnon on July 1, 1875. Over the next 40 years, more than 15 mines or claims were made in the area. At its height, the town had 500 buildings, including several company stores and boarding houses, two Chinese restaurants and a post office. The town was electrified by 1897 and had one telephone at that time.\nWhile an active mining town, Crown King was served by the Bradshaw Mountain Railroad. Rail service to the area began in 1904 upon completion of \"Murphy's Impossible Railroad\" – a series of switchbacks and trestles that ascended the mountain terrain between Cleator and Crown King. The railroad began in Mayer, Arizona, connecting with Murphy's Prescott and Eastern Railroad and extended for 28 miles amid the rocky terrain.\nCrown King was the terminus (1904–1926) of the railroad, built by Frank M. Murphy to serve the mines of the southern Bradshaw Mountains. However, these mines were never very productive, and the BMRR was a financial failure. The line was abandoned in 1926. Much of the road to Crown King uses the old railroad bed.\n\nOf the buildings still standing and in use in Crown King, the Crown King Saloon has maintained its place as the center of activity in town. The Saloon was originally constructed and operated in the nearby mining town of Oro Belle (now also a ghost town). In 1910, it was disassembled and brought to Crown King piece by piece after the mine at Oro Belle had played out. The building was home to a brothel and bar in both towns and now serves the public as a hotel, cafe, and bar. The town has a cemetery nearby.\nThe red one-room schoolhouse was built in 1917 and still serves a small number of K–8 students. High school students typically leave town to attend class 14 miles away in Mayer.\nThe post office was established on July 29, 1888, and was discontinued on May 15, 1954. It has since reopened inside the Crown King General Store.\n\n\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Crown King has a Mediterranean climate, classified as Csb on climate maps. It is atypical of this type because its dry season only covers the first half of summer and is followed by heavy monsoonal thunderstorms in July and August.\nAn exposed location relative to moist southerly airflows from the Gulf of California gives Crown King among the highest precipitation in Arizona – in fact it holds the official state record for the most precipitation in one calendar month with 16.95 inches (430.5 mm) in August 1951, and the station has thrice approached this record with 16.21 inches (411.7 mm) in December 1967 (including 87.3 inches or 2.22 metres of snow), 16.63 inches (422.4 mm) in February 1980 and 16.75 inches (425.4 mm) in January 1993. The wettest days have been April 17, 1917, with 7.65 inches (194.3 mm) and December 31, 1948, with 7.10 inches (180.3 mm). The wettest calendar year has been 1978 with 56.42 inches (1,433.1 mm) and the driest 1960 with 14.31 inches (363.5 mm).\nSnowfall can be heavy, with 87.3 inches (2.22 m) falling in January 1949, although in general snow cover is minimal due to relatively warm days in winter.\n\n\nEducation\nThe Crown King Elementary School District has one school, Crown King Elementary School, a K-8 school. The facility is in a one room schoolhouse. The school began operations in 1906, and a permanent school facility opened in 1916. Circa 2019 enrollment varied between one and around twelve students at a time.\nThe community does not have a high school, and the Crown King district area is not within a high school district. Scott Craven of The Arizona Republic stated that the condition of roads and distances make traveling to a high school from Crown King difficult, and that the distance to the closest high school was one hour travel time. According to Craven, as of 2005 some families have the mothers rent apartments in Chino Valley or Prescott so students could attend high school in those communities. Craven stated that some other families choose to have the high school-aged children live with other family members. Lily Altavena of The Arizona Republic stated in 2019 that several area students went to a private institution, Orme School in the Mayer, Arizona area; this school closed in 2025.\nYavapai County Free Library District operates the Crown King Public Library, in the back of the school building.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBruce M.

    "text": "Grace Vernon Drake-Brockman (née Bussell; 23 September 1860 – 7 October 1935), commonly referred to as Grace Bussell, was a woman from Western Australia. In 1876, as a 16-year-old, she was involved with Sam Isaacs in the rescue of SS Georgette, for which she was awarded the Royal Humane Society's Silver Medal.\n\n\nBiography\nBussell was born to the well-known and prosperous Bussell family.  At age 7, she discovered Wallcliffe cave.\nLauded by the press at the time of the rescue (in which Aboriginal stockman Sam Isaacs was also involved), she became known as 'The Grace Darling of the West', (after an Englishwoman who had rescued people in similar circumstances). She was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Humane Society, and also a gold watch and chain from the British Government.\nAccording to an account in the local Inquirer and Commercial News,\n\nthe boat swamped, they were all in the water, and in the greatest danger, when, on the top of the steep cliff appeared a young lady on horseback. Those who were present have told me that they did not think that a horse could come down that cliff, but down that dangerous place this young lady rode at speed; there were lives to be saved, and, with the same fearless and chivalrous bravery that urged Grace Darling to peril her life for fellow creations, and gave her a name in all English history thereafter, Grace Bussell rode down that cliff, urged her horse into boiling surf, and out beyond the second line of roaring breakers, till she reached the boat where the women and children were in such peril. Her horse stumbled over the rope and she was nearly lost, but managed to get alongside the boat, and then with as many women and children clinging to her and the horse as possible, she made for the shore and landed them. A man was left on the boat, and he could not get to shore till Miss Bussell sent her black servant on horseback to aid him. So furious was the surf that it took four hours to land 50 people, and every boat engaged was capsized.\nAccording to an account by Isaacs' friend, as recounted by the friend's grandson:\n\nshe went into the water only once. She rode her horse into the water and Sam had to tell her to be careful; that if she rode her horse in the way she was going, she would kill people or trample them under and drown them. He told her to turn her horse around and swim back. There was a woman and a child who grabbed the horse's tail and the horse towed them ashore. But Sam went in and out several times. By the time he got back with Grace, one man had got ashore and he'd got a rope lifeline from the ships mast and fastened it to the shore and soon there were three or four men ashore. It was a great feat for a girl of 16 but she was later given credit for almost the entire rescue.\nShe married Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman (1857–1917) in 1880; he served as Surveyor General of Western Australia from 1915 to 1917. They had three daughters and four sons, including Edmund (1884–1949), Geoffrey (1885–1977), and Deborah (1887–1965).\nShe died aged 75 in Guildford, Western Australia.\n\n\nLegacy\nBussell is commemorated by several places named in her honour. One of these is the coastal hamlet of Gracetown, Western Australia, north of Margaret River. Another is the Western Australian wheatbelt town of Lake Grace. Both of these were named after her by her husband. Additionally, Bussell Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Cook is named after her.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\nStewart, Athol Frederick Ferguson (1946). Australia's Grace Darling.

At night it reduces power to 46 watts, to protect other stations on 600 AM from interference.  WFRM uses a non-directional antenna, with its transmitter on Radio Tower Road at Dutch Hill Road in Coudersport. Programming is also heard on FM translator W243EB at 96.5 MHz.\n\n\nHistory\nWFRM first signed on the air in May 1953. It was originally a daytimer, required to go off the air at sunset to avoid interference to other stations on 600 AM.\nIn the summer of 1953, the Smethport Centennial Celebration was the first \"special event\" covered by WFRM, the new radio station in Coudersport just constructed by the Farm & Home Broadcasting Company.  Broadcast lines were installed and temporary broadcast facilities were put in place in Smethport to cover many of the Centennial activities. Pete and Bill, the stars of the morning show, were photographed in the derby hats that everyone in Smethport was wearing as part of the celebration. That photo is still on the wall at WFRM's current studio location at 9 South Main Street in downtown Coudersport.\nWhen the McKean County Fair came along again, radio was a big part. Gert Curley, who was widely known as \"Betty Bradford\" brought her popular WESB interview show to the fairgrounds. WFRM also came to the Fair. A large tent along the midway was filled with country music entertainers from McKean, Potter and surrounding counties. Crowds loved it.\nOne of the early disc jockeys on WFRM was afternoon host Danny Neaverth, who worked at the station between 1957 and 1959, becoming better known as the morning man at legendary Buffalo radio station 1520 WKBW.\nEncouraged by the enthusiastic reception from folks in Smethport, WFRM decided to put a local office and studio in Smethport. It was located on the second floor of the Auto Parts store on West Main Street. Bob and Lois Johnson became the nucleus of the staff in Smethport and an effort was made to expand the service to this part of the WFRM Coverage area. Russ Wells was the announcer, and Bob Morrison was the engineer. An hour each day was broadcast over the radio from this studio. These daily broadcasts continued for about three years. Meanwhile, the Johnsons had relocated to Kane, and joined the staff that was building the new radio station facility there.\nWFRM was joined by an FM sister, 96.7 WFRM-FM, on September 18, 1985.  WFRM-FM in 2008 received approval by the FCC to be licensed to Portville, New York.  It was sold to Colonial Radio Group, owners of WLMI, switching to a Christian radio format.  600 WFRM was sold to L-Com (Lent Communications, a company controlled by David Lent), owner of Port Allegany-based WHKS.  Lent had worked from the time of his graduation from Coudersport area Jr. Sr. High School in 1973 up until former co-workers James (Jim) Linn and Theresa Blewett constructed WHKS-FM in Port Allegany, Pennsylvania in July 1990.  Linn & Blewett sold L-Com Inc. (licensee of WHKS) to Lent in 1993.

It is now in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan.\n\n\nDescription\nIt shows Francis of Assisi (with his stigmata visible) collecting blood pouring from the side of Christ in a cup, with the column, the ropes and the stick with the vinegar-soaked sponge from the Flagellation and Passion of Christ. Christ himself holds a cross, from which hang other Instruments of the Passion (crown of thorns, whip, nails). The subject is a rare one in painting, mainly appearing in works from the Veneto such as Giovanni Bellini's The Blood of the Redeemer (National Gallery, London) and Carpaccio's Christ between Four Angels (Udine). With St Francis as an active character, Crivelli's treatment of the theme differs from the ideas of Giacomo della Marca and thus represents a highly rare and personal idea provided by an unknown commissioner.\nProbably for private devotion by a Franciscan friar and only 20 cm by 16.3 cm in size, the painting's commissioner is unknown. Traces of a hinge on the canvas support suggest it once had a lid, whilst a recent restoration has revealed the artist's signature from beneath later overpainting - its use of the title \"MILES\" means it post-dates 1490, when the artist was granted that title by Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Celtic Folkweave is a studio album by Mick Hanly and Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, released in 1974 by Polydor Records. Considered a seminal album in the traditional Irish music genre, the musicians involved in the recording would go on to found some of the most innovative and important groups to perform traditional Irish music.\nRecorded in Ireland in 1974, Celtic Folkweave consists of Irish, Scottish, and English ballads, sung in Irish (Gaeilge), Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), and English. The album is a clear precursor for Ó Domhnaill's subsequent work with The Bothy Band and Nightnoise. The album includes the first extant recording of Ó Domhnaill's trademark \"Fionnghuala\", here titled \"An Bothán A Bha'ig Fionnghuala\". Other tracks are drawn from the repertoire of Rannafast (Donegal) songs collected and sung by Ó Domhnaill's aunt Nellí Ní Dhomhnaill. \"The Hag at the Churn\", \"An Bothán A Bhaigh Fionnghuala\", \"The Banks of Claudy\", and \"The Heathery Hills of Yarrow\" would all later be recorded by The Bothy Band, with Ó Domhnaill's sister Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill on vocals. \"Bríd Óg Ní Mháille\" was later recorded by Nightnoise. From 1973 to 1974, Hanly and Ó Domhnaill toured under the name Monroe, although that name does not appear on the album cover.\n\n\nBackground\nDuring the 1970s, Mícheál Ó Domhnaill was involved in some of the \"most innovative projects and groups in Celtic music.\" After his first group, Skara Brae, disbanded in 1972, Ó Domhnaill travelled to Scotland where he collected Gaelic songs on the Islands of Lewis and Skye as part of his work with the School of Scottish studies. When he returned to Ireland, he collected and recorded songs in Donegal, many of which he found through his Aunt Neilli Ni Domhnaill, who possessed a large collection of local songs.\nIn 1973, while playing the club circuit in Ireland and still a student at University College Dublin, Ó Domhnaill met Mick Hanly, a Limerick-born singer, guitarist, and dulcimer player, and soon the two formed a duo called Monroe. Playing a mixture of Irish, English, and Scottish ballads, many sung in Irish (Gaeilge) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), Monroe's music centered around acoustic guitars, dulcimer, and voices—\"Hanly's brusque tones complementing Mícheál's lower-key vocals.\" As Monroe, Hanly and Ó Domhnaill toured Brittany often, meeting with other local and visiting Irish musicians. During this time, Brittany was enjoying a major folk revival, with artists like Alan Stivell, Tri Yann, and Sonnerien Du just emerging onto the scene. In 1974, Hanly and Ó Domhnaill recorded a single, \"The Hills of Greenmore\", and toured with the group Planxty as their supporting act. After enlisting the help of some of the members of Planxty—Liam O'Flynn, Dónal Lunny, and Matt Molloy—Hanly and Ó Domhnaill signed a deal with Polydor Records and recorded the album, Celtic Folkweave.\n\n\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Dónal Lunny, one of the pioneers of the Irish folk music revival in the 1970s. A key member of three of traditional music's most influential groups—Planxty, The Bothy Band, and Moving Hearts—Lunny would remain at the forefront of the traditional Irish music movement for the next thirty-five years. The album was recorded at Eamon Andrews studios in Dublin. Hanly and Ó Domhnaill were supported in the studio by Liam O'Flynn on uileann pipes and whistle, Dónal Lunny on bodhrán, Matt Molloy on flute, Tommy Peoples on fiddle, Declan McNeils on bass, and Mícheál's sister Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill on harpsichord.\n\n\nArtwork and packaging\nThe album sleeve artwork was designed by Des O'Meara & Partners Ltd. and shows three connected spiral patterns (triskelion) against a black background with \"Celtic Folkweave\" in white stylized lettering highlighted with gold outline (some copies have red outline). The term \"folkweave\" refers to a type of fabric with a loose weave. The back cover contains two photos of Mick Hanly and Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, an annotated song listing, and the album credits.\n\n\nComposition\nThe album contains eleven songs of Irish, Scottish, and English ballads, sung in Irish (Gaeilge), Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), and English. There are two pieces of puirt à beul, or mouth music, sung in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, five songs sung in Irish and English, two Breton tunes, one Irish dance tune, and a contemporary song in English. The album opens with \"Bíodh Orm Anocht\", a strange song containing nonsense rhymes sung in a mixture of Donegal and Scottish Gaelic. \"The Bold Princess Royal\" is a song about a ship that is attacked by pirates while on a voyage from London to Newfoundland, and manages to outrun them. \"The Banks of Claudy\" is a song Ó Dhomhnaill received from Nellí Ní Dhomhnaill, about a woman who resigns herself to a lonesome existence after her sailor leaves, pining after him during his absence. When he returns, he disguises himself and courts her to see if she is still faithful to him. She resists his overtures, and he finally reveals his true identity. \"Éirigh's Cuir Ort Do Chuid Éadaigh\" is a common tune from Rannafast, County Donegal, for which there are various sets of lyrics. The title is Irish Gaelic for \"Get Up and Get Dressed\". The first side of the album concludes with \"A Bothán A Bha'ig Fionnghuala\", an example of Scottish puirt à beul. During their live performances, this was one of their most popular songs. The song features pipes and two bodhráns.\nThe second side of the album opens with \"The Heathery Hills of Yarrow\", another song from Nellí Ní Dhomhnaill of Rannafast, County Donegal. It tells the story of a ploughboy who falls in love with a girl of high station and is slain by her brother and eight other knights. The ploughboy's sister ties his body to her back with her long hair and carries him home for burial. The spirited \"Breton Dances\" is a typical piece from the Breton Islands. \"The Hiring Fair at Hamiltonsbaw\" is a song about the injustice of a farmer who mistreats one of his hired servants. \"Bríd Óg Ní Mháille\" is a love song from Rannafast, County Donegal, about unrequited love. \"The Glasgow Barber\" is a song about a poor Irishman who arrives in Glasgow and decides to get a fashionable haircut. On seeing the result, he thinks he looks like an ass. The final song of the album, \"(No Love is Sorrow) Songbird\", is a contemporary song written by the British band Pentangle, who recorded it on their 1972 album, Solomon's Seal.\n\n\nReception\nWriting in The Green Man Review, John O'Regan called Celtic Folkweave a \"seminal\" album, often looked upon as \"a predecessor to The Bothy Band.\" O'Regan praised the mixture of Irish, Scottish, and English ballads:\n\nCeltic Folkweave includes some fine examples of the Mícheál Ó Domhnaill style and approach. Versions of 'The Banks of Claudy' and 'Heathery Hills of Yarrow' and the winsome 'Brid Og Ni Mhaille' show his sonorous voice in good stead. The Scots Gaelic mouth music of 'An Bothan a Bhaig Fhionnghuala' later became 'Fionnghuala' on the second Bothy Band album Old Hag You Have Killed Me issued in 1976. This album has now become an acid folk collector's 'holy grail'.\nOn the Ceol Álainn web site, dedicated to rare recordings of traditional Irish music, Dragut Reis called Celtic Folkweave an \"excellent album\" and a precursor to Ó Dhomhnaill's work with The Bothy Band and Nightnoise. Reis found the production \"adequate\", but not up to the standard of the material he would produce a year later for The Bothy Band.\n\n\nAftermath\nAll of the musicians on Celtic Folkweave would go on to make notable contributions to the Irish and Celtic music genres, with Molloy, Lunny, Ní Dhomhnaill, Ó Domhnaill, and Peoples ending up in The Bothy Band, one of the most influential bands playing Irish traditional music in the 1970s. A number of the album's songs would end up being recorded by The Bothy Band, including \"The Hag at the Churn\", \"An Bothán A Bhaigh Fionnghuala\", \"The Banks of Claudy\", and \"The Heathery Hills of Yarrow\". Mícheál Ó Domhnaill would also go on to form partnerships with Kevin Burke and Billy Oskay. Mícheál and his sister Tríona would also go on to found the group Nightnoise, which enjoyed International success and inspired a generation of Irish musicians.\nCeltic Folkweave was never reissued in either LP or CD format. The master tapes of the recording may have been destroyed in a fire at one of the vinyl pressing plants of Polydor Ireland in 1982. Copies of the original vinyl album Celtic Folkweave are considered rare collector's items.\nAfter the break-up of Monroe, Hanly returned to tour Brittany for two years and on his return recorded two Folk albums for the newly formed Mulligan Record label, A Kiss In the Morning Early and As I Went Over Blackwater, subsequent to which he toured extensively in Europe with ex Planxty member Andy Irvine.   In 1983 he replaced Christy Moore as lead vocalist in the folk-rock band, Moving Hearts. After 14 months he left the band to concentrate on song writing. He signed a Publishing deal with Beann Eadair Music and a record deal with Ringsend Road records. He recorded three albums with Ringsend Road...All I Remember, Warts and All, and Happy Like This. \nNone of these records were commercially successful, but the All I Remember album included the songs My Love is In America and Past the Point of Rescue. My Love is in America became a successful radio hit for Dolores Keane and Past the Point of Rescue became a major hit for American Country star Hal Ketchum, reaching No 2 in the Billboard Country charts and received a BMI Two Million radio plays award. The song was also a hit in Norway for the Hellbillies and a hit in Ireland for Mary Black. \nHe continues to record and write. His latest album for Celtic Collections, Homeland was released in 2016.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nPersonnel\nMusic\nMick Hanly (listed as Michael Hanly) – guitar, dulcimer, vocals\nMícheál Ó Domhnaill (listed as Mícheál O'Donnell) – guitar, vocals\nLiam O'Flynn (listed as Liam Óg Ó Floinn) – uileann pipes, whistle\nDónal Lunny (listed as Donal Lunney) – bodhrán\nMatt Molloy – flute\nTommy Peoples – fiddle\nDeclan McNeils– bass\nTríona Ní Dhomhnaill – harpsichord\nProduction\nDónal Lunny – producer\nPat Morley – engineer\nMarcus Connaughton – sleeve notes\nDes O'Meara & Partners Ltd. – sleeve design\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMick Hanly official website\nMícheál Ó Domhnaill official website",

    "text": "Paul Adrian Christie (born 1953) is an Australian rock bassist and vocalist. He was a member of various groups including Kevin Borich Express (1978–79), Mondo Rock (1980–82) and the Party Boys (1982–90, 1992, 1998–99). As a member of Mondo Rock he performed on the tracks, \"State of the Heart\", \"Cool World\", \"Summer of '81\", \"Chemistry\", \"No Time\", \"The Queen and Me\" and \"In Another Love\".\n\n\nBiography\nPaul Adrian Christie was born in 1953 and grew up in Brisbane. By 1976 he was a member of a group, Feet First, followed by Silverwing, Bobby Warren & Co & Loose Booty before joining hard rockers, Kevin Borich Express, in May 1978 in Sydney. He replaced Bob Jackson on bass guitar alongside Kevin Borich on lead guitar and lead vocals and John Annas on drums.\nThe group toured the United States, where they added the American keyboardist, Tim Schafer (ex-Gary Wright Band) and recorded tracks at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. While in LA they performed two shows at Starwood Theatre with a set list, \"'Going Somewhere', 'Celebration', 'KB's Boogie', 'Going Down Town', 'No Turning Back' and 'New City Lights'.\" This line-up issued a studio album, No Turning Back, in March 1979, with Tom Serfert producing. In the following month Christie and Schafer both left.\nIn April 1980 Christie joined Mondo Rock in Melbourne on bass guitar with James Black (ex-Rum Jungle, Russell Morris Band) on keyboards and guitar; Gil Matthews (ex-Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs) on drums; Eric McCusker (ex-the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band) on guitar; and Ross Wilson (ex-Daddy Cool) on lead vocals and harmonica. As a member of that group he performed on the albums, Chemistry (July 1981) and Nuovo Mondo (July 1982).\nThe albums provided the singles, \"State of the Heart\" (October 1980), \"Cool World\" (March 1981), \"Chemistry\" (July), \"Summer of '81\" (October), \"No Time\" (June 1982), \"The Queen and Me\" (September) and \"In Another Love\" (March 1983). He co-wrote the tracks, \"Chemistry\" from the album of that name, and, \"Domination\", from Nuovo Mondo (and B-side of \"The Queen and Me\"). By September 1982 Christie had left that group.\nChristie then founded an Australian rock ensemble, the Party Boys, in November 1982 in Sydney. The initial line-up was former bandmate Borich on guitar, Graham \"Buzz\" Bidstrup, (ex-the Angels) on drums, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel, Sherbet) on guitar and James Reyne (on loan from Australian Crawl) on lead vocals. From his memoirs:\n'Upon leaving Mondo Rock in late 1982 I returned to Sydney and took a  break on the northern beaches. I thought about options for the future and devised the concept of The Party Boys. Australian Crawl singer James Reyne & I had become friends whilst I was living in Melbourne. We shared a common belief that as musicians, we were not receiving the best financial returns based on the success experienced in our respective bands. This was the way the music business was structured coming out of the ‘70’s into the early ‘80’s.\"\n\"I believed a line-up of musicians from a number of known bands performing together for an interim period, managed and coordinated by myself, would succeed, for the benefit of the musicians. In October of 1982 I approached the manager of Moby Dick Surfers Club, Graham Chatfield and proposed two concert dates for Nov 14th & 21st 1982. He accepted and booked the yet unrehearsed band. James was in Sydney filming Return to Eden, he had available time. I called guitarist Ian Moss (Cold Chisel) who was unavailable however his housemate Harvey James (Ariel, Sherbet) was and agreed to participate. I had worked with The Angels fleetingly and become friends with drummer Graham Bidstrup, he joined along with Kevin Borich who had employed me as bass player from 1977-1979 in the Kevin Borich Express.\"\n\"The Nov 14th date was wildly successful, the band then performed at The Astra Hotel Bondi, The National Hotel Brisbane, The Manly Vale Hotel then Moby’s again on the 21st. A live album Live at Several 21st's was recorded by Keith Walker of 2JJJ at Manly Vale.\" Released by EMI Records it received gold record certification. The band went through several incarnations over the next decade.\nChristie was a founding partner of Almost Famous [1], a corporate team building and events company. He has participated in reformations of Mondo Rock. In 2006 with the line-up of Christie, Black, McCusker and Wilson, they performed on the 2006 Countdown Spectacular concert series playing a medley of \"Cool World\" and \"Summer of '81\" and a full version of \"Come Said the Boy\". In June 2014 they reunited to perform Chemistry live at a series of gigs at Australian state capitals. The line-up was Christie, Black, Mathews, McCusker, and Wilson. They released a compilation album, Besto Mondo, in August 2015.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "USS Bergen (APA-150) was a Haskell-class attack transport in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was scrapped in 1973.\n\n\nHistory\nBergen (APA 150) was laid down on 25 October 1944 at Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co. under a Maritime Commission contract (MCV hull 815); launched on 5 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Donald Campbell; delivered to the Navy on 22 December 1944; and commissioned on 23 December 1944 at Astoria, Oregon.\n\n\nWorld War II\nAfter fitting out at Astoria and loading landing craft at San Francisco, California, Bergen reported at San Pedro, Los Angeles, in mid January 1945 for shakedown training. Shakedown and amphibious warfare training occupied her until 12 February. On the 13th, she began post shakedown availability at Terminal Island, California. The attack transport completed repairs on 23 February and, the next day, got underway for San Francisco. Between 25 February and 2 March, she loaded cargo, fuel, and provisions and took passengers on board. On 2 March, Bergen stood out of San Francisco Bay. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 8 March, disembarked her passengers, and began unloading cargo. On the 25th, the ship moved to Honolulu and started loading cargo. On the 27th and 28th, officers and men of various U.S. Army units came on board.\nBergen put to sea on 29 March and set course for the Mariana Islands. En route, she suffered an engineering casualty that forced her to stop at Eniwetok from 6 to 9 April for repairs. She returned to sea on the 9th and arrived at Tanapag harbor, Saipan, on the 12th. After the troops went ashore, Bergen unloaded cargo and began taking hospital patients on board for evacuation to Hawaii. On 15 April, she cleared Tanapag and set course for Oahu. The attack transport entered Pearl Harbor on 25 April, disembarked the patients, and began repairs to her main propulsion plant. She completed repairs on 15 May, but remained in the Hawaiian Islands until the end of the month conducting trials and amphibious exercises. After embarking passengers, Bergen stood out of Honolulu on 30 May on her way back to the U.S. West Coast.\nThe attack transport moored at San Francisco on 5 June, and her passengers left the ship that same day. Bergen remained at San Francisco until 21 June when she got underway for Seattle, Washington. The ship stopped at Seattle between 24 and 27 June to load cargo. On the latter day, she headed back to Hawaii. She entered Honolulu on Independence Day 1945, and her passengers reported ashore. The attack transport unloaded cargo to make room for another cargo and new passengers. On 11 July, the ship set out for the western Pacific Ocean. After fueling and provisioning at Eniwetok, she arrived in Ulithi Atoll on 23 July. Bergen stayed there until 8 August when she exited the lagoon on her way to the Ryukyu Islands.\nHer convoy reached the Hagushi anchorage off Okinawa on 12 August, and the attack transport dropped anchor to begin disembarking troops and unloading cargo. She witnessed several air raids over the next three days—the last three of the war. After the end to hostilities on 15 August, Bergen rode peacefully at anchor. On 26 August, she shifted berths to the Buckner Bay anchorage and, on the 30th, began loading cargo. The ship began embarking troops on 1 September and got underway for Korea on the 5th. Three days later, she entered port at Jinsen, Korea. She spent five days at Jinsen disembarking occupation troops and unloading their supplies and equipment.\nOn 13 September, Bergen stood out of Jinsen to return to Okinawa. She arrived at her destination on the 15th. Soon thereafter, the attack transport began embarking elements of the 7th Marines. On 26 September, she departed Okinawa and headed for northern China. The ship reached Taku, China, early in the morning of 30 September. She discharged both cargo and troops by 5 October and got underway for the Philippines. Bergen entered Manila Bay on 13 October and began taking on homeward-bound veterans there and at Subic Bay. She stood out of Subic Bay on 31 October and shaped a course for the United States. The attack transport arrived in San Francisco on 20 November, disembarked her passengers, and began much needed boiler repairs at Hunters Point, California. Bergen put to sea again on 7 December bound for the Philippines. On the 22nd, her destination was changed from Samar to Manila. She arrived there on the 29th and began embarking naval officers and enlisted men for passage back to the United States. On 3 January 1946, the ship moved to Subic Bay, took on more passengers, and then shaped a course for home.\n\n\nDecommissioning and fate\nBergen entered Port Hueneme, California, on 24 January and dropped off most of her passengers. The remainder disembarked at San Pedro, Los Angeles, later that same day. She arrived in San Francisco on 29 January and began preparations for the long voyage to the U.S. East Coast. Bergen stood out of San Francisco Bay on 11 February. Her voyage took her through the Panama Canal, and she entered port at Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 March. The attack transport was decommissioned at Norfolk on 24 April 1946. Two days later, Bergen was returned to the United States Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946. She was berthed with the Maritime Commission's National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia, until the spring of 1973. On 9 April 1973, she was sold to the Union Minerals & Alloys Corp., New York City, for scrapping.\n\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

    "text": "Coloman of Galicia  (Hungarian: Kálmán; Ukrainian: Коломан; 1208 – 1241) was the ruler—from 1214 prince, and from 1215 or 1216 to 1221, the king—of Galicia, and the duke of Slavonia from 1226 to his death. He was the second son of Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania. His father and Leszek the White, Duke of Poland, concluded an agreement about the marriage of Coloman and Leszek's daughter, Salomea, and the division of Galicia, allotting its western regions to Leszek, the remaining lands to Coloman. The Hungarian and Polish armies occupied the principality in late 1214. Andrew II appointed a Hungarian nobleman, Benedict the Bald, to administer it on Coloman's behalf. Coloman was crowned the first king of Galicia with the pope's authorization in early 1216.\nAfter the Hungarian troops occupied the western Galician territories, Leszek made an alliance with Mstislav Mstislavich, Prince of Novgorod. Mstislav invaded Galicia, forcing Coloman and his supporters to flee to Hungary, most probably in early 1219. Mstislav supported his son-in-law, Daniel Romanovich—who had claimed Galicia since 1205—to invade Polish territories, which brought about a reconciliation between Andrew II and Leszek. The Hungarians and Poles again occupied Galicia and restored it to Coloman in the autumn of 1219. Mstislav and his Cuman allies defeated the Hungarians near Galicia and captured Coloman and Salomea in August 1221. To secure their release, Andrew II renounced Galicia and arranged a marriage alliance between his youngest son, Andrew, and Mstislav's daughter.\nColoman returned to Hungary in late 1221 or 1222. He settled in Szepes (now Spiš in Slovakia) where he had held large estates since the late 1210s. Andrew II made him duke of Slavonia, with jurisdiction also in Croatia and Dalmatia, in 1226. He cooperated with his eldest brother, Béla, in revising their father's donations already during Andrew II's lifetime.\n\n\nEarly life\nColoman was the second son of Andrew II of Hungary and his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. Andrew's father (Coloman's grandfather), Béla III of Hungary, was the first king of Hungary to conquer the Principality of Galicia in 1188. Béla granted Galicia to the teenager Andrew, but Andrew was unpopular, especially because his troops did not respect the Galicians' Orthodox faith. The Galicians expelled him in 1189 or 1190, but he did not abandon his claim to Galicia. After Roman Mstislavich, who had united the principalities of Volhynia and Galicia under his rule, died fighting against the Poles in 1205, Andrew launched a military campaign against Galicia in almost each year. He adopted the title of \"King of Galicia and Lodomeria\" in token of his claim to both principalities. Initially, he supported Roman Mstislavich's minor sons, Daniel and Vasilko Romanovich, against Vladimir Igorevich and his brothers, who also claimed Galicia.\nColoman was born in 1208. According to historians Márta Font and Gábor Barabás, he was named most probably for Coloman of Stockerau, an Irish pilgrim who had been martyred in Austria in 1012. Coloman's mother showed blatant favoritism towards her German kinsmen and courtiers, which outraged the native lords. She was murdered by a group of Hungarian noblemen in September 1213, shortly after her husband departed for a new military campaign against Galicia. Andrew returned to Hungary, but only after appointing a Galician boyar (or nobleman), Vladislav Kormilichich, to lead the Hungarian army to Galicia. Kormilichich took control of the principality on Andrew's behalf. Leszek the White, Duke of Poland, granted asylum to Daniel and Vasilko Romanovich and made an alliance with princes Alexandr Vsevolodovich of Vladimir and Mstislav Yaroslavich of Peresopnytsia. They invaded Galicia and routed Kormilichich, but they could not capture the capital of the principality.\nIn a letter to Pope Innocent III, Andrew stated that Galician boyars had proposed him to grant Galicia to Coloman. According to the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle, Leszek the White was the first to suggest the same idea, also proposing his daughter, Salomea, to Coloman. Andrew and Leszek had a meeting in Szepes in the autumn of 1214. They reached a compromise, which included the marriage of Coloman and Salomea and the cession of two western Galician towns, Przemyśl and Lubaczów, to Leszek. The Hungarian and Polish armies invaded the principality and put an end to Vladislav Kormilichich's rule before the end of the year.\n\n[Andrew II] marched against [Leszek the White] whom [Daniel Romanovich] was visiting at that time. [Thereupon Leszek] sent his envoy Lestič and the boyar Pakoslav [to Andrew] with the [following] message: \"It is not proper for a boyar to reign in [Halych]; marry my daughter to your son [Coloman] and let him rule in [Halych]. [Andrew] liked Pakoslav's [advice]. He held council with [Leszek] in [Szepes] and took [Leszek's] daughter for his son.\n\n\nGalicia\n\nColoman was installed in Galicia soon after the fall of Kormilichich. Since Coloman was a minor, Benedict the Bald was appointed to administer the principality. Another Hungarian nobleman, Demetrius Aba, was made the master of the stewards in Coloman's court before 1216. Kormilichich's former ally, Sudislav, was one of the leading Galician boyars who supported Coloman.\nAndrew sent a letter to Pope Innocent, requesting him to authorize John, Archbishop of Esztergom to anoint Coloman as king. In his next letter, Andrew thanked the pope for giving consent to Coloman's coronation, but also informed him that a riot had broken out against Coloman and the rebels laid siege to Galicia. Andrew urged Innocent to send a legate and a golden crown to Coloman to strengthen the legitimacy of his rule. Pope Honorius III mentioned in a letter in 1222 that the Archbishop of Esztergom had crowned Coloman \"with the blessing of the Holy See\", but the circumstances of the ceremony are unknown. Historians Font, Barabás and Karol Hollý inferred from the correspondence that Coloman was most probably crowned twice: first (in late 1214 or early 1215) with a provisional crown in Hungary, later (probably in early 1216) with the crown sent by the pope. Other historians—including Tibor Almási, Nataša Procházková and Đura Hardi—conclude that Coloman was first anointed, and he was only once crowned, in early 1216.\nThe relationship between Andrew and Leszek the White had meanwhile become tense. Leszek granted Vladimir-in-Vohynia, which was the most prestigious princely seat in Volhynia, to Daniel and Vasilko Romanovich. He also failed to support Coloman during the siege of Galicia. The Hungarian army invaded western Galicia and captured Przemyśl and Lubaczów in late 1215 or early 1216. Leszek approached Mstislav Mstislavich, Prince of Novgorod, seeking his assistance against the Hungarians. The reconstruction of the ensuing events is difficult, because their dating is uncertain. Mstislav invaded Galicia between 1215 and 1219—most probably in early 1219, according to Font and Barabás—and forced Coloman, Benedict the Bald and Sudislav to flee to Hungary.\nMstislav gave his daughter, Anna, in marriage to Daniel Romanovich who soon occupied the lands between the rivers Wieprz and Bug from Leszek. Outraged by Daniel's attack, Leszek made a new alliance with Andrew II. Their united forces defeated Mstislav's army in three battles in October 1219. Mstislav and Daniel were forced to abandon Galicia and Coloman returned to the principality. Andrew most probably made Sudislav's son-in-law, Philnius, the commander of the Hungarian army in Galicia around this time, according to Font and Barabás.\nMstislav hired Cumans and again invaded Galicia in late 1220 or early 1221, but could not capture the capital. Mstislav's fiasco encouraged Philnius to join Leszek's campaign against Volhynia, leaving Coloman and Salomea in the newly fortified Church of the Virgin Mary in Galicia. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Hungarian army, Mstislav and the Cumans laid siege to Galicia in August 1221. Philnius hurried back from his campaign, but Mstislav defeated his army and he could only flee with the help of a Galician boyar, Zhiroslav on 14 August. Coloman's retainers tried to resist in the fortified church, but the lack of water forced them to surrender. The Polish chronicler, Jan Długosz, wrote that Coloman and Salomea were imprisoned in the fortress of Torchesk.\nInternal strifes in Hungary prevented Coloman's father from launching a military expedition against Mstislav. Andrew entered into negotiations with Mstislav and they reached a compromise in late 1221 or early 1222. According to the agreement, Coloman was to renounce the title of King of Galicia, but Mstislav agreed to give his daughter, Maria, in marriage to Coloman's younger brother, Andrew, to whom Coloman's royal title would be transferred.\n\n[Princes] Mstislav and [ Volodimir ] went from Kiev to [Halych] against the King's son, and the men of [Halych] came out against them and [Czechs] and [Poles], Moravians and Hungarians, and the forces came together. And God helped Mstislav, and he entered the town of [Halych] and they took with their hands the King's son and his wife, and he took peace with the King, and let go his son, and himself took his seat in [Halych] and [Volodimir] in Kiev.\n\n\nKingdom of Hungary\n\n\nSzepes\nAfter his release in late 1221 or early 1222, Coloman returned to Hungary. His father soon approached Pope Honorius III, asking him to invalidate his agreement with Mstislav. The pope only cancelled the provision about the transfer of Coloman's royal title to his younger brother, because the pope preserved the right to decide about coronations. Coloman styled himself \"King of Galicia\" till the end of his life, although he never returned to Galicia. He and his wife settled in Szepes, near the Hungarian-Galician border. Font and Barabás say that Coloman had received estates in the region already in the late 1210s. A late source (a 1279 letter of Elizabeth the Cuman) mentioned that Coloman had held Szepes till the end of his life.\nColoman's activities in Szepes are poorly documented. He granted privileges to the \"guest settlers\" in Szepesolaszi (now Spišské Vlachy in Slovakia). He made donations to the Cistercian monastery which was established in the 1220s in Szepes. Coloman also supported the establishment of the Premonstratensian provostry at Jászó (now Jasov in Slovakia). According to a scholarly theory, the tower of the Szepes Castle was built on Coloman's order.\n\n\nSlavonia\nAndrew II entrusted Coloman with the government of Slavonia, Croatia and Dalmatia in 1226. The three provinces had been administered by Coloman's elder brother, Béla, who was appointed to administer Translyvania. Coloman's jurisdiction also included counties located in Hungary proper, such as Baranya, Pozsega, Somogy, Valkó, Varasd and Zala.\nIn the summer of 1226, Coloman visited Dalmatia where he was ceremoniously received in the towns. He made donations to the Bishopric of Trogir and confirmed his mother's grant to the Hájszentlőrinc Chapter. His following extant diplomas were issued in 1229. Estates located in Szepes were the subjects of both diplomas, implying that Coloman had mostly stayed in Szepes from 1226 to 1229, according to Font and Barabás.\nColoman supported Béla's attempts to revise their father's grants already during Andrew II's lifetime. The two brothers jointly confirmed a grant made by a previous ban of Croatia in 1231. Coloman ignored the privileges of the Knights Templar and wanted to collect taxes on their estates. The pope appointed Bartholomew le Gros, the bishop of Pécs, to arbitrate in the dispute together with the abbot of Pécsvárad Abbey and the provost of Pécs Chapter, but also forbade them to excommunicate Coloman without his special authorization. The three prelates persuaded Coloman to confirm the knights' privileges on 31 July 1231, but a full reconciliation was reached only after lengthy negotiations in 1239.\nColoman granted liberties to the German, Saxon, Hungarian and Slavic \"guest settlers\" of Vukovar in 1239. He also confirmed the right of the \"guest settlers\" of Varaždin to elect their judges and put their obligations in writing.\nColoman initiated the merger of the Archbishopric of Split and the Bishopric of Zagreb, but Pope Gregory IX reminded him in 1240, that the two dioceses could not be united without the consent of the archbishop of Kalocsa and the chapters of their sees.\nIn 1231, Coloman granted privileges to Vukovar (Hungarian: Valkóvár). Coloman, similarly to his brother, opposed his father's third marriage with Beatrice d'Este and following the death of King Andrew II (21 September 1235) they accused their young stepmother of adultery.\nPope Gregory IX persuaded him to pursue the heretics in his provinces and in the adjacent territories; therefore he invaded and occupied Bosnia and Zachlumia but he could not wind up the Bosnian Church. He supported the establishment of the Diocese of Bosnia and he granted Đakovo (Hungarian: Diakóvár) to its bishop. When he was informed that the Mongols invaded the kingdom, he joined his brother's troops. However, their troops were defeated at the Battle of Mohi (11 April 1241). Coloman suffered serious wounds and died of his injuries a few weeks after the battle. \n\n\nTitles\nColoman was styled \"by the Grace of God, king of the Ruthenians, and by his glorious father's generosity, duke of Dalmatia and Croatia\" in his first extant charter in 1226. Göncöl, Archbishop of Split, referred to Coloman as \"king and duke of Slavonia\" in 1229. The first document mentioning Coloman's rule in \"whole Slavonia\" was issued by the Zagreb Chapter in 1230. He was consequently styled as \"king, and duke of whole Slavonia\" from the late 1230s.\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\nMarek, Miroslav. \"Genealogy of Danylo's family\".

    "title": "Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab world",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=29145699",
    "text": "The tradition of women's literary circles in the Arab world dates back to the pre-Islamic period when the eminent literary figure, Al-Khansa, would stand in the 'Ukaz market in Mecca, reciting her poetry and airing her views on the scholarship of others. From this, a culture of literary criticism emerged among Arab women, and under the Umayyad dynasty, Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn established the first literary salon in her home. The tradition was revived during the late nineteenth century, as a result of sweeping social, political and economic change within the Ottoman Empire and Europe's increasing political and cultural influence in the region. The initial pioneers of the Arab salon were women from wealthy families in the region of Syria and Egypt, who returned influenced by interaction with European women during their time spent studying abroad and frequenting Parisian salons, or studying in schools run by European or American missionaries. The salon evenings, run by women but attended by both men and women, provided a unique opportunity to have discussions about social, political and literary trends of the day. Though the tradition died out somewhat after the Second World War, it has left a lasting legacy on literary culture and women's issues throughout the Arab world.\n\n\nBackground to the nineteenth-century literary societies\n\n\nWomen and education\nThe educational reforms of the nineteenth century, a period of sweeping social, economic and political transition, resulted from various undercurrents occurring at different levels within the realms of the Ottoman Empire from the Mashreq (Greater Syria) to the Maghreb (North Africa). These trends were largely attributable to the increased European presence in the region and their secular ideas of modernity.\nAt a societal level, the arrival of Christian missionaries supported by the European and American governments led to the creation of a formal system of education for girls, who had until this period received little or no education. Initially, this took the form of private institutions attracting wealthy and mostly Christian families. However, as these schools became more socially acceptable and affordable, the idea trickled down to the middle classes before finally reaching out to the poor. Thus, a new norm was becoming increasingly prevalent; the idea that girls should receive an education so as to afford them better marriage prospects, and more importantly, to provide them with adequate means in which to educate their children. At this point in time, the range of subjects offered to women was limited. However women seized these opportunities to learn, and showed admirable drive and determination. By the middle of the century, a sense of \"...awareness and obligation for intellectual and social consciousness, especially the appreciation of women's plight, and the struggle for a voice in society became visible and public.\" A notable example of the contribution of Western missionaries to increasing educational opportunities for women was the work of Daniel and Abby Maria Bliss, an American couple who moved to Beirut in 1866 and subsequently set up the Syrian Protestant College (which later became the American University of Beirut). In 1905, a nursing programme that accepted applications from women was established, and in 1924, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences opened its doors to female students.\nThe rumblings of reform taking place within Ottoman society reached the Sultanate, and were eventually echoed at an institutional level. The Ottoman regime, in order to counteract the threat of political and religious influence from the Christian missionary schools and due to the realisation that the empire could not hope to survive without learning the modern natural sciences, began to implement its own reforms (tanzimat). According to the Arab historian, Eugene Rogan, the reforms introduced by the Sultanate had little effect on the subjects of the empire. However, by the 1850s and 1860s, the fruits of reform were visible in the daily life.\nThe third (and arguably the most important) current that led to the existence and improvement of women's education in the nineteenth and early twentieth century was due to European colonialism and its legacy. Napoleon's short-lived occupation of Egypt (1798–1801) was relatively unsuccessful by French standards. However, their revolutionary ideas and imports in the field of technology and education were to prove more durable in Egypt and the rest of North Africa. Under the leadership of Muhammad 'Ali, an admirer of French innovation and technology, interactions and exchanges between Egypt and France in the cultural, academic and scientific fields increased during his reign Indeed, it was not just male students who spent time abroad. Notable Arab hostesses or salonnières such as Mayy Ziyadah spent time in France, and the Egyptian feminist and occasional hostess of salon evenings, Huda Sha`arawi, used to grant scholarships to writers enabling them to study in Europe at her own expense. Ideas of educational reform and feminism were also occurring elsewhere in the Arab world, with the Syrian writer and scholar, Butrus al-Bustani (1819–1883) in Lebanon among the first to advocate women’s right to education in 1847. Two decades later in Tunisia, the reformist, Ahmed Kheireddine, stressed the importance of women's education in the running of households and raising children. This was a small, but crucial step in the emancipation of women in society. Later in Egypt, after the British had occupied Egypt of Egypt they also contributed to the reform of women's education. In his work entitled, Modern Egypt, Lord Cromer, who had served for almost thirty years as High Commissioner of Egypt, \"...by confining the sphere of women's interest to a very limited horizon, cramps the intellect and withers the mental development of one-half of the population in Moslem countries.\".\nThe European powers at that time aimed to establish an Arab elite class that supports their colonization policies in the Arab World. Therefore, education was made more accessible for those who were ready to detach from their cultural roots and embrace that of the colonial powers. This strategy was common in almost all the places that colonialism existed. Arab people still hold the perception that their leaders, whose families gained power from that time, are puppets to the western powers and that feeling may have stemmed from that period of time. Therefore, many Arabs believe that colonialism had a very bad effect on the political, cultural, social, and economic life of the vast majority of the Arab people.\nBy 1924, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the American University of Beirut began accepting applications from women, the norm that \"Knowledge rather than ignorance preserves women's dignity and morality\" had been firmly established. In the face of confinement and exclusion from the formal education system, middle-class women overcame their exclusion and marginalisation from society, holding informal literary or study circles in their family homes. Moreover, women such as Mayy Ziyadah and Mary 'Ajami went on to pursue higher education in Europe, returning to set up well-known salons and contributing immeasurably to literary circles, print and production in the Arab world.\n\n\nWomen and the public sphere\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century, the idea of the harem continued to linger in many Arab societies. Women of the urban middle and upper classes were confined to the domestic sphere, and the vast majority remained unseen and unheard in public life. Necessity afforded female members of the lower and rural classes slightly more 'freedom', as they were needed to work the land in order to support their families. Women's issues began to emerge from the background - albeit slowly - in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with the likes of Qāsim Amin (1863–1908) calling the seclusion of women an 'injustice' and advocating partial empowerment of women. However, the majority of prominent feminist writers were men, and the presence of women activists in the public sphere was virtually non-existent. The salon and its male participants, many of whom were well-known intellectuals, provided them with a means in which to express their ideas and opinions in private, whilst accessing the male-dominant public sphere through their lively discussions and debates. In her thesis entitled 'Arab Women Going Public: Mayy Ziyadah and her Literary Salon in a Comparative Context', Boutheina Khaldi remarks that women of the salons overcame the obstacle of gender inequality \"by bringing public men into their private salons and hence creating a public sphere from the very heart of the private one.\" The essays and letters produced by hostesses and participants of the salons on the topics discussed also had a considerable impact on society at the time, and in particular, the nurturing of the Arab Renaissance and women's emancipation. The publication of letters by is interpreted by Jürgen Habermas in his writing on the public sphere as bridging the gap between the private sphere in which women gathered, and the public sphere that they sought to shape and conquer.\n\n\nWomen and the Arab cultural renaissance\nThe Arab Renaissance (al-Nahda or Arabic: النهضة) was an endeavour to reach a compromise between contemporary practices similar to those in Europe and a shared Arab heritage, in the hope of shaping a new vision for an Arab society in transition. The relationship between women's literary salons and the Arab Awakening, as it was also referred to, is of paramount importance. Not only were meetings of literary figures an integral part of the Renaissance, but from the beginning of the Arab Renaissance in the nineteenth century, women came to realise the strong bonds between the literary-cultural, social and political, and that the literary movement was key to liberating the 'collective consciousness' from the traditional norms that had stunted their progress. Men also began to acknowledge the importance of women's emancipation to national liberation and development at this time, and there is no doubt that increased interactions between male and female intellectuals within literary circles made an invaluable contribution. One of the first men to write about the liberation of women was Qāsim Amin, an influential literary figure at the turn of the twentieth century, argued for the emancipation of women for the sake of the Arab Renaissance, as did al-Tahtawi. Both of these men frequented Mayy Ziyadah's salon in Cairo. Thus women's desire for emancipation and men's nationalist dreams became the keystone in the advancement of society.\nIn 1847, two great literary figures of the Arab cultural renaissance, Butrus Al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji, founded the first literary society, Jam'iyyat al-Adab wal-'Ulum (The Literary and Scientific Society). Its members were exclusively Syrian Christians and Europeans living and working in diplomatic and missionary circles. However, ten years later, al-Jam'iyya al-'Ilmiyya al-Suriyya (The Syrian Scientific Society) was established, and attracted Western-educated Muslims and Druze as well as Christians. In 1917, the Tunisian literary figure, Hassan Hosni Abdel-Wahab wrote about the urgent need for educated Muslim young women to take charge of the future and to 'awaken the nationalist spirit', as without this, 'life would turn to nihilism and its consequences'. Only a few years later in the 1920s, Manwia Al-Wartani and Habiba al-Minshari, became the leaders of a dynamic women's movement in Tunisia. Like these Tunisian pioneers, women of the upper and middle classes across the increasingly imagined Arab world began to reap the benefits of education, and many of them began to focus on writing and joined their male counterparts in contributing to the Arab Renaissance.\nOne woman of particular significance to the awareness of the Arab Renaissance amongst women was Princess Nāzīl Fadīl (c.1884-1914). Her salon seems to have had an effect on its male guests, who were usually prominent members of the nationalist cause.\nThe tradition of women's printing and press, an integral part of middle-class circles and the Renaissance, was also intertwined with the literary salon. Many hostesses produced letters and essays on issues discussed in salons, such as equality, women's rights and nationalism. In Palestine, for example, the press became a partisan for the women, who used it as a transmitter and a publicist for their activities. The Lebanese journalist, Hind Nawfal published the first monthly journal, al-Fatah in 1892 in Egypt, encouraging women to think of journalism as a respectable occupation. Other journals, many published by Lebanese women in Egypt, followed suit: Anis al-Jalis, al-'A'ilah, al-Mar'ah, al-Zahrah, Fatat al-Sharq, al-A'mal al-Yadawiyyah and al-'Arous (The Bride) which was published by Mary 'Ajami. It is worth noting that this publication did not focus solely on women's issues, but also those related to the Renaissance and nationalism. Whilst the environment in which these female literary figures were operating in was becoming more and more conducive to women's issues, the road to equality and liberation was by no means free from obstacles, and many women published articles under pseudonyms.\n\n\nThe salon\n\n\nTerminology\nThe French word, salon, which was first uttered in seventeenth century France comes from the Italian word sala; and was used to define a large reception hall or reception room in a private residence. Later, it was used when referring to social gatherings in nineteenth century France. The word found its way to Egypt with the Napoleonic expedition, and was one of many traces of the French-Egyptian encounter (1798-1801) and its legacy. Whilst the word salon itself was a European import, there were various words in Arabic that were used to describe various kinds of social gatherings in the Arab world. According to the academic and expert, Boutheina Khaldi, the terms nadwah or nadi or muntada \"...were used traditionally to indicate the call on people to gather for a purpose.\" The word majlis, however, such as the majlis of the first hostess of an Arab salon - Sukaynah bint al-Husayn - has the specific meaning of assembly, a gathering that might have a more regular or permanent nature in terms of time and place.\" Khaldi goes on to say that the frequenters of the more modern Arab salons were obviously aware of these, and often used both the French and the Arab words to refer to the gatherings, implying the synthesis of both Arab and European influences in the salon culture.\n\n\nThe first salon\nThe history of the literary salon in the Arab world, of which little is known, dates back far longer than one would expect. Sukayna bint Husayn (735 / 743), began running her salon centuries during the Umayyad dynasty, well before the idea was first introduced to seventeenth century Europe. She was a highly regarded woman of great intelligence, and an expert in fashion and literature. She was the first woman to open her house to male and female guests, and organised evenings of music, literary criticism, and poetry.\n\n\nEuropean influences\nMany of the Arab women who founded literary salons received at least part of their education in Europe or in European missionary schools, and were thus exposed to certain aspects of European culture, including the salon tradition. In this regard, the great impact of the colonial powers and the imposition of their culture and values on the region cannot be underestimated. However, that is by no means to say that the Arab women's literary salon was a passive imitation or export of European ideas. Rather, those men and women who travelled to Europe or who were well-read in European literature selected elements of the European tradition and fused them with the traditional Arab salons of old, which was typical of the Arab Renaissance. Moreover, in 1890, one of the French salonnières, Eugénie Le Brun, chose to hold a salon evening in Cairo in an effort to learn more about women's circles in Egypt, and to encourage the revival of the tradition. \nOne of the salons said to have had an influence is Madame de Rambouillet's salon, which opened in 1618 and was held at the Hôtel de Rambouillet in Paris. It was the first and most famous salon in French history. Rambouillet made sure to distinguish her salon from an Academy, and emphasised entertainment as well as enlightenment. Like the later literary salons in the Arab world, the gatherings bore witness to the mingling of the literary elite, with male intellectuals and middle-class women. In a similar fashion to the salons in Cairo, topics such as religion, philosophy and history would be discussed, but it is noted that Rambouillet \"...made sure the treatment of the subject was not heavy-handed.\" Mayy Ziyadah admired the French \"salonnières\", and made sure to write copious materials on the well-known French hostess, habituée and prominent woman of aristocratic Parisian society, Madame de Sévigné, who was herself influenced by her time spent at the Hôtel de Rambouillet. The great Egyptian nationalist and writer, Tāhā Husayn, who began attending Ziyadah's salon after she requested Ahmad Lutfi al-Sayyid bring him along on a Tuesday evening, comments on the fusion of Arab and European influences that created the salons of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: \"Mayy revives by this salon a long-established Arab practice, just as she transfers to Egypt a long-established European practice, ancient and modern.\"\n\n\nAn evening spent in the salon\nUnlike salon sessions in England, which sometimes took place during the day or over several days the salons in cities such as Cairo, Jerusalem and Aleppo were usually held in the evening or at night in the family homes of salonnières. One of the less well-known salons in Beirut, for example, was convened on three consecutive full-moon nights each month, where male and female guests stayed awake until dawn, enjoying the entertainment and lively literary discussions. It was the norm for salonnières to invite participants, and with notable exceptions such as Mayy Ziyadah who invited guests from different social standings in order to give young writers the opportunity to show off their talents to a discerning audience, the majority of salons were a space for male and female members of the educated middle class elite. Within the confines of the salon, the free-flow of conversation and reciprocity was encouraged, and a sense of equality was fostered. The salon evenings were also regarded as arbiters of music and literature, as well as places were social and political ideas were aired and discussed, and where guests could embrace new trends and fashions exported from Europe. There was something unique about these salon sessions, according to the historian Keith Watenpaugh, who lends a description of a salon evening:\n\"...soirées were unrelated men and women circulated with one another freely, and where Christians and Muslims, who shared a similar educational background, drank and smoked cigarettes—rather than sharing a nargileh (hookah pipe)—together while they sat in straight back chairs around high tables...\"\nThe tone and topics of discussion were usually at the discretion of the salonnières or hostesses, who administered the conversation. Of course, every salon was slightly different, but most evenings offered a mix of serious and lighthearted conversation, with musical entertainment in some cases. As the conversation flowed, it was not uncommon for guests to colour their conversations with personal anecdotes or local gossip. Indeed, it was thought to be a necessary talent of a successful hostess to encourage such digressions. As these salons were conducted during the Arab Awakening, which advocated a synthesis of tradition and modernity, the use of fushā (classical Arabic) was emphasised. Unfortunately, specific topics of conversation in the literary salons have remained somewhat of a mystery over the years. However, in Yatanaqashun (They Discuss), a fictional portrayal of a salon session held in her house in which the subject of 'equality' was discussed at length, Mayy Ziyadah gives a good indication of the content, atmosphere and interactions between male and female participants in her salon.\nAntun Sha`arawi also encapsulates the opulent evenings spent in a Syrian salon with his vivid description:\n\"Wearing either all black or all white dresses ordered from Paris, Marrash hosted the mixed evening get-togethers in which literary topics as varied as the Mu'allaqat, a cycle of seven pre-Islamic poems or the work of Rabelais were discussed. Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and 'araq flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph.\"\n\n\nMen who visited the salon\n\nA number of notable men, famous for their ideas and writing frequented the literary salons and contributed to the discussions. Some of them developed friendships with the female hostesses and asked them for their advice and opinions on their work. Among those who visited the salons was the advocate of women's rights and writer, Qāsim Amin; the Islamic reformists, al-Imām Muhammad 'Abduh and Rifā'ah Rāfi' al-Tahtāwī; leader of the Egyptian Wafd Party, Sa'd Zaghlul; Lutfī al-Sayyid; the literary critic and journalist, 'Abbas Mahmũd al-'Aqqād; the Syrian poet, Khalil Mutrān; the journalist Muhammad Husayn Haykal; the poet Ahmad Shawqī; the Egyptian Prime Minister Boutros Ghālī and the Egyptian nationalist and writer, Tāhā Husayn. Several of these men published articles and books on women's rights; including Rifā'ah Rāfi' al-Tahtāwi and Qāsim Amin, who is said to have found the inspiration for his seminal works, Tahrir al-Mar'ah (The Liberation of Women) and al-Mar'ah al-Jadidah (The New Woman) in Princess Nāzlī al-Fādil's salon.\n\n\nNotable literary salons and societies\n\n\nMarrash's Salon (Aleppo)\nMaryana Marrash's salon, the first salon in the nineteenth-century revival movement, was run from the house she shared with her husband in Aleppo. The habitual gathering offered a private realm in which male and female guests could mingle, network, and discuss the fashionable topics of the time. Marrash would often entertain her guests by singing and playing the piano. Regulars at the salon included prominent literary figures and politicians, such as Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi, Qustaki al-Himsi, Rizqallah Hassun, Kamil al-Ghazzi and Victor Khayyat.\n\n\nPrincess Nāzlī Fādil's Salon (Cairo)\nNāzlī Fādil was one of the first women to revive the tradition of the literary salon and contributed immeasurably to the cause of women's emancipation in the Arab world. She began to invite guests to her Cairo salon towards the end of the nineteenth century, although the absence of female participants in her salon evenings should be noted. Like Maryana Marrash, Fādil added to the ambience in her salon by playing the piano, while one of her male guests sang and her Tunisian maid danced. The men who frequented her salon were prominent in Egyptian and Arab society; including statesmen, diplomats, journalists, and literary figures. Among the regular visitors to her salon was the renowned Islamic Reformist thinker, Sheikh Mohammed 'Abduh, as well as Qāsim Amin, Boutros Ghali and Saad Zaghloul, to name but a few.\n\n\nThe Dawn of Syria (Beirut)\nIn 1880, the Lebanese writer Maryam Nimr Makariyus established the Dawn of Syria literary society in Beirut.\n\n\nThe Association of the Arab Women Awakening (Beirut)\nThis literary society was founded by Muslim women in Beirut in 1914.\n\n\nKaty Antonius' Salon (Jerusalem)\nKaty Antonius ran what has been described as 'the focal point of Jerusalem social life' from the home in Sheikh Jarrah she shared with her husband, Arab nationalist George Antonius,  during the Mandate period. The salon provided local journalists, officials, officers, politicians and European diplomats with an opportunity to network and discuss literary, social and political issues. Her parties were described as 'elaborate affairs' with 'evening dress, Syrian food, and drink, and dancing on the marble floor.' From time to time Antonius invited the boys from her orphanage to her salon evenings, as well as an array of famous guests.\n\n\nMayy Ziyadah's Salon (Cairo)\nShortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Mayy Ziyadah began to host well-known men and women from intellectual, literary and political circles across the Arab world. Meetings were held at her family home, the first salon in Cairo in which men and women met together in the same room. In terms of etiquette, Ziyadah maintained a 'tactful correspondence' with guests of her salon, who were expected to inform her of their attendance through letters as a matter of courtesy. She and her guests also published letters they wrote from conversations in the salon.\nA Syrian Christian journalist, Salim Sarkis, a typical representative of the educated middle class clientele who used to frequent the gatherings, attended Ziyadah's salon, which was held on Tuesday evenings for twenty-three years, 1913–1936. The influence of Ziyadah's time spent in the salons of France is obvious, with Sarkis comparing her to notable French \"salonnières\". The journalist gives the reader a rare insight into the atmosphere of the salon in the following description:\n\nIn the evening of every Tuesday the house of Mr Ilyas Ziyadah, the owner of Al-Mahrusah newspaper, turns into a luxurious house in Paris, and his daughter Mayy, the Syrian young woman who is still in her twenties, into Madame de Staël, Madame Récamier, A'ishah Al-Ba'uniyyah, Walladah bint Al-Mustakfi and Wardah Al-Yaziji. Mayy Ziyadah's salon turns into an 'Ukaz fair [an annual fair in pre-Islamic Mecca, where the likes of Al-Khansa and other literary greats recited poetry] where literary, philosophic and scientific ideas propagate.\nThe salon evenings ended after her mother's death in 1932, as social pressure would not permit an unmarried woman to enjoy the company of men without members of her family present. A eulogy by Syrian poet Khalil Mutran mourned Ziyadah's death and the passing of her salon:\n\nOh Mayy! The house was deserted, where is your salon which visitors frequented? / The best elite of the East and West in nobility and erudition seek protection under your boundless wing...\n\n\nHuda Sha'arawi's Salon (Cairo / Beirut)\nSha`arawi's salon only met sporadically, but was well-attended by many famous political figures and intellectuals; including Ahmad Shawqi, Gabriel Taqlā and Muhammad Husayn Haykal. She loved music, and would often play the piano long into the night whilst in her salon. Sha`arawi used to award a literary prize every year, and would also encourage young writers from her salon by sending them to study in Europe at her own expense.\n\n\nThe Women's Literary Club (Damascus)\nThe Damascus Women's Literary Club was founded by Mary Ajami around 1920, and was aimed at strengthening the bonds between women. It held public meetings, giving its members a platform on which to air their views on literary and political issues. Occasionally they discussed politics, but they were mainly interested in reviving classical Arabic literature and familiarising themselves with modern Western thought. According to Joseph T. Zeidan, those who frequented the salon were treated to the melodic tones of Mary’s sister’s piano playing, as well as the insightful and witty comments of Mary herself, who was \".. highly praised for her ability to run the intellectual discourse and was acknowledged as a ‘skilled talker’\".\n\n\nSukaynah's Salon (Damascus)\nThurayya Al-Hafez, a school teacher and popular feminist, launched a salon evening in her house in Damascus in 1953. The salon was named after Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn, the first Arab woman to host a salon. It was open to both men and women, though only the latter were in charge of running the proceedings. Its objectives included \"...raising literary and artistic standards, creating strong bonds and cooperation among its members, publishing their works, translating Western literary works into Arabic, and translating Arabic literature into foreign languages. It continued to run until 1963, when its founder moved to Egypt.\n\n\nPioneering women behind the salons\nMaryana Marrash (1849-1919) was the first Arab woman in the nineteenth century to revive the tradition of the literary salon in the Arab world, with the salon she ran in her family home in Aleppo.\nZaynab Fawwāz (?1860-1914), who founded a salon in Damascus.\nPrincess Nazli Fadil (c.1884−1914)\nHuda Sha'arawi (1879–1947) became one of the most famous feminists in the Arab world. In 1914, she formed al-Ittihād al-Nisā'i al-Tahdhĩbĩ (Women's Refinement Union), where Egyptian and European came together to discuss new ideas. This led to the establishment of the Jami'yyat al-Ruqiyy a;-Adabiyyah li al-Sayyyidāt al-Misriyyāt (Egyptian Ladies Literary Improvement Society). In the 1920s, Sha`arawi began to hold regular meetings for women at her home, and from this, the Egyptian Feminist Union was born. She launched a fortnightly journal, L'Égyptienne in 1925, in order to publicise the cause.\nMay Ziyadah (1886−1941) is the best known of the women associated with the literary salons and as a leading figure in literary circles throughout the Arab world.\nMary 'Ajami (1888−1965) founded the Damascus Women's Literary Club in 1920.\nKaty Antonius (née Nimr, d. 1984), born to Egyptian-Lebanese parents, experienced a privileged upbringing and education in Alexandria as the daughter of a prominent Egyptian publisher and landowner. In 1927, she married the intellectual and Arab nationalist, George Antonius. She was a fashionable socialite known for her wit, humour, kindness, and charm; as well as her infamous parties and salon evenings. As well as her salon, Antonius established a boys' orphanage in Old Jerusalem called Dar al-Awlad.\nThuraya Al-Hafez (1911-2000) 'launched her own literary and political salon in Damascus, which was open to both genders. The salon was convened in her own house and was named after Sukayna bint al-Hussein, the great-granddaughter of Muhammad, who presided over the first literary salon in Muslim history'. The salon was launched in 1953.\nSalma Sayegh (1889 – 1953), Lebanese novelist\n\n\nModern-day salons\nIn the 1960s, women and their ideas started to become part of the mainstream culture, and thus the important role of women-run salons declined in its importance. That said, The Women's Literary Club, which was founded by Mary 'Ajami in 1922, continues to run in Damascus, and was attended regularly by the novelist Ulfat Idilbi until her death in 2007.\nIn 2010, a new weekly salon evening for young male and female writers and literary enthusiasts was launched in the basement of a hotel in Damascus. The popular event held on Monday evenings, named Bayt al-Qasid (House of Poetry), was an opportunity for new voices rather than established poets or writers, and attracted both Syrians and foreigners.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "The tradition of women's literary circles in the Arab world dates back to the pre-Islamic period when the eminent literary figure, Al-Khansa, would stand in the 'Ukaz market in Mecca, reciting her poetry and airing her views on the scholarship of others. From this, a culture of literary criticism emerged among Arab women, and under the Umayyad dynasty, Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn established the first literary salon in her home. The tradition was revived during the late nineteenth century, as a result of sweeping social, political and economic change within the Ottoman Empire and Europe's increasing political and cultural influence in the region. The initial pioneers of the Arab salon were women from wealthy families in the region of Syria and Egypt, who returned influenced by interaction with European women during their time spent studying abroad and frequenting Parisian salons, or studying in schools run by European or American missionaries. The salon evenings, run by women but attended by both men and women, provided a unique opportunity to have discussions about social, political and literary trends of the day. Though the tradition died out somewhat after the Second World War, it has left a lasting legacy on literary culture and women's issues throughout the Arab world.",

    "title": "Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=78136329",
    "text": "Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located in Henderson County, North Carolina encompassing 215 square miles (137,600 acres). It was established on August 19, 2019, by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), Treasury after reviewing the petition submitted by Mark Williams, the executive director of Agribusiness Henderson County, and Barbara Walker, the county extension support specialist for North Carolina Cooperative Extension, on behalf of local vineyards and winery operators, proposing the viticultural area named \"Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County.\"\nThe AVA has 14 commercial vineyards cultivating approximately 70 acres (28 ha) and two wineries. Several existing vineyards are planning to expand by a total of 55 acres (22 ha) in the next 5 years. According to the petition, the distinguishing features of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA are its climate and topography—specifically its elevation.\n\n\nHistory\nThe term \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" was first used by Colonel Joseph Pratt, who was the\nchief of the North Carolina Geological and Economic Survey from 1906 to 1923. In 1910, Pratt proposed creating a scenic road and chain of tourist hotels atop or adjacent to the summit of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Pratt named the project the \"Crest of the Blue Ridge Highway.\" Several small sections of the road were built, but the start of World War I interrupted the work, and completion was put on hold. In the end, the project was never completed, but the\nterm \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" survived and remains in widespread, present-day\nuse to describe areas of the Southern Appalachians, especially in North Carolina.\n\n\nName Evidence\nThe Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA straddles the ridge line that forms the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The ridge line forming the crest of the Blue Ridge is marked\nand labeled on eight of the nine U.S.G.S. topographic maps used to form the\nboundary of the AVA. Because the entire crest covers a multi-state region that is significantly larger than the AVA, the petitioners added \"Henderson County\" in order to identify the\nlocation of the AVA more specifically. TTB did not require the addition of \"North Carolina\" to the proposed name because TTB is not aware of the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains running through any other county named Henderson County.\nThe petition included examples of current use of the term \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" to describe the region. Henderson County is also often promoted as the Crest of the Blue Ridge Agricultural Area for its variety of commercial agricultural products. For example, the Henderson County Tourism Development Authority's \"Cheers Trail\" publication, which advertises commercial breweries, cideries, and wineries in the county, notes that all the producers on the trail are \"located in Henderson County in the Crest of the Blue Ridge Agricultural Area.\" The county also promotes its apple orchards with its Crest of the Blue Ridge Orchard Trail guide. Agribusiness Henderson County, a local non-profit agriculture and agri-tourism advocate, promotes the county's farm businesses through its Southern Mountain Fresh brand, which states, \"Enjoy the freshness of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains and sustain our local heritage.\"  Finally, two wineries with vineyards within the AVA use the term \"Crest of the Blue Ridge\" to describe their locations. Burntshirt Vineyards’ website states that its vineyards occupy \"...a unique position with two vineyards on both sides of the Eastern Continental Divide on the Crest of the Blue Ridge.\"  St. Paul Mountain Vineyards’ website describes its vineyards as being \"on the crest of the Blue Ridge in Edneyville.\"\n\n\nTerroir\nCrest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA straddles the ridge line that forms the\ncrest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. To the east and south of the AVA are the low, rolling hills of the Inner Piedmont region. To the west of the AVA are the rugged mountains of the Pisgah National Forest. To the north are the Asheville Basin, which is marked by the wide valley of the French Broad River, and the rugged highlands that surround the basin. The distinguishing features of the AVA are its elevation and climate.\n\n\nTopography\nThe petition describes the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA as straddling two\nphysiographic provinces—the Blue Ridge Escarpment and the Blue Ridge Plateau, which are separated by the Eastern Continental Divide, also known as the Crest of the Blue Ridge. To the north of the AVA are two distinct geomorphic regions: The Asheville Basin and a region of higher mountains known informally as the \"northern highlands,\" which includes\nthe Black Mountain range and Mount Mitchell, the highest point east of the\nMississippi River. The petition included information about the minimum, maximum, and\nmean elevations of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA and each of the surrounding regions. Elevation plays a major role in determining the temperatures, length of growing season, and precipitation within the AVA. In general, areas at high elevations have cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons than regions at low elevations. Regions at intermediate elevations, such as Crest of the Blue Ridge, generally have warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons than neighboring regions in higher elevations, and they have cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons than adjacent lower elevations.\n\n\nClimate\nThe petition for the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA included information on several different climate aspects of the AVA and surrounding regions, including average growing season temperatures, average length of growing season, growing degree day zones, and\nprecipitation amounts for the AVA and the surrounding regions.\nThe climate data is based on data generated by the Precipitation-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) Climate Group at Oregon State University.  The petition included information on the average growing season temperatures of the AVA and the surrounding regions. The petition states that a professor at Southern Oregon University used the average growing season temperatures of major wine producing areas of the world to create four major \"Climate/Maturity Groupings.\"  The information was intended to help vineyard owners determine what varietals would ripen the best in their region. Using this system, the petitioners calculated the average growing season temperatures of the AVA and the surrounding regions, as well as the percentage of land within each region that fell into each of the climate/maturity groupings. The majority of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA has average annual growing season temperatures that are in the \"Warm\" grouping. No portion of the AVA falls into the \"Cool\" or \"Intermediate\" groupings. The Ashville Basin region north of the AVA has a larger percentage of land within the \"Warm\" grouping and also has some land that can be classified in the slightly cooler \"Intermediate\" grouping. The highlands region north of the  AVA and the region to the west are both primarily within the \"Intermediate\" grouping, while the regions to the south and east are mainly within the \"Hot\" grouping. According to the\npetition, regions in the \"Warm\" grouping are well-suited for growing grape varietals such as Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon, which are among the most commonly grown\ngrape varietals within Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County.\nThe petition also included data on the length of the growing season within the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA and the surrounding regions. The petition stated that according to a vineyard site study conducted by the Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technologies and Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, regions\nwith growing seasons shorter than 160 days are generally unsuitable for vineyards because the grapes will not have sufficient time to ripen. Locations with growing seasons of 170 to 180 days are considered \"satisfactory,\" while sites with growing seasons of 180 to 190\ndays are considered \"good.\" Vineyard locations with growing seasons of over 190 days are considered \"not limited by growing season\" and are generally the most desirable sites.\nMost of the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA is classified as Region III with GDD accumulation between 3,001 and 3,500 per the Winkler index. The data supports the petition's assertion that the AVA has a long, warm growing season that is cooler than the regions to the south and east of the Asheville Basin and warmer than the region to the west and the northern highlands region. The petition states that the two primary GDD zones found within the AVA are suitable for growing both cooler-climate grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc as well as warmer-climate grapes such as Sauvignon Blanc and Syrah.\nFinally, the petition included information on the mean annual, growing season, and winter\nprecipitation amounts for the AVA and the surrounding regions for the period from 1980 to 2010. According to the petition, within the region, air moving inland from the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico drops its moisture along the mountainous elevations of the Blue Ridge Escarpment and the Eastern Continental Divide. As a result, precipitation amounts decrease as one moves from southeast to northwest through the region. Sufficient annual precipitation amounts are important to prevent vines from experiencing excessive heat and water stress. The data demonstrates that the Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA generally has higher mean annual precipitation amounts than the regions to the north and lower mean annual precipitation amounts than the regions to the east and south, which are within the Blue Ridge Escarpment. Although the data also suggests that the region to the west of the AVA also has higher annual precipitation amounts. The petition shows that the higher rainfall amounts are actually in the region to the southwest of the AVA, where moist air from the Gulf of Mexico encounters high elevations, rather than in the region due west which is in the rain shadow of the Eastern Continental Divide.\nThe petition states the importance to consider the timing of the rainfall. During the growing season, excessive rainfall can cause excess vine and leaf growth, promote fungal disease, and attract insects, while too little rainfall can stress the vines and lead to reduced photosynthesis, cell desiccation, and potential death of the vines. The petition cites a study that found that the recommended growing season precipitation amount for\nvineyards in North Carolina is between 24 and 30 inches (610–762 mm). The data demonstrates that the mean minimum growing season precipitation amount within the AVA meets the minimum recommended amount. The mean growing season amount slightly exceeds the recommended precipitation amount.\nIn summary, the evidence provided in the petition indicates that the elevation and climate of  Crest of the Blue Ridge Henderson County AVA distinguish it from the surrounding regions in each direction. The AVA has elevations that are generally higher than those of the regions to the south and east and in the Asheville Basin to the north, and lower than those of the northern highlands region and the region to the west. The AVA also has a moderate climate that slightly differs from the climate in the Asheville Basin to the north, is cooler than the\nregions to the south and east and warmer than the region to the west and the northern highlands. Finally, annual precipitation amounts in the AVA are generally lower than amounts\nin the regions to the south, west, and east and higher amounts than the highlands and Asheville Basin regions to the north.\n\n\nViticulture\nThe Blue Ridge Henderson County region has a long history of cider and apple production with an emerging viticulture industry. The region cultivates approximately 78% vinifera grapes along with some hybrid grapes and native North American varieties. The leading vinifera varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Merlot, Riesling, and Grüner Veltliner. Vidal Blanc and Traminette are the main hybrids; Norton is the leading American variety. Vintages produced by local vineyards have earned high honors at the NC Fine Wines Competition which is renowned for being the most stringent of all statewide competitions in the nation.\n\n\nSee also\nNorth Carolina Wine\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nCrest of the Blue Ridge Wine Country\nNC Wine Regions - NC Wingrowers Association\nNC Fine Wine Competition\nTTB AVA Map",

The first two were written by Rex Rienits but this one was written by Phillip Grenville Mann, an Australian who had worked in London and replaced Rienits as drama editor at the ABC. Mann was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying: \"I hope that any factions in it are not dubbed 'goodies' and 'baddies'. \"When men of principle disagree it does not necessarily follow that they become either heroes or scoundrels. Tragedy – and drama – can sometimes be found in men who act with absolute integrity and in direct conflict with the needs and desires of the people.\"\nDesigner Phil Hickie spent four months designing 17 sets, plus the costumes and props. More than 200 gallons of paint were used.\nThe series aired in June.\n\n\nReception\nNan Musgrove of The Australian Women's Weekly said she \"thought \"The Patriots\" was a wonderful story that could have had added excitement if it had been played at a quicker pace. I wish it had been done in five one-hour episodes.\" She noted the wide public interest the series attracted.\nStephen Vagg of Filmink argued:\n\nThe Patriots doesn’t really have enough material for 300 minutes. The conflict between Darling and Wentworth is really solid, and focusing on the Sudds case would have made a fantastic 90 minute play... But stretched over ten episodes, there’s a lot of padding. Undramatic padding too, with a lot of scenes consisting of characters standing around being indignant about what they are reading in the paper. It even skips some stuff that happened in real life which was cool, such as Wardell meeting a violent death at the hands of escaped convicts.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Patriots at IMDb",

The cartoons he directed in the DePatie–Freleng era were in Friz Freleng's unit.\n\n\nSummary\nBunny outlaws Bunny and Claude are chased by the Sheriff as he attempts to disguise himself as a big carrot to catch the duo.\n\n\nPlot\nWanted carrot thieves and lovers Bunny and Claude are introduced through the aptly-titled song, \"The Ballad of Bunny and Claude\", revealing themselves to rob carrots from anywhere in Oklahoma around U.S. Route 66, be it general stores, carrot patches, even blowing up safes or other buildings to get the carrots stored within, all while being pursued by the local sheriff who intends to catch them, arrest them, and lock them up for the rest of their lives. The duo are also shown to be armed with revolvers and Thompson submachine guns to carry out their crimes.\nAfter robbing the local store of carrots, Bunny and Claude run into the sheriff. However, unaware of their identities at first, the sheriff apologizes for bumping into them and offers to help load their carrots into their car, allowing them to make a clean getaway. When the store owner comes out and reveals to the sheriff that he just let Bunny and Claude escape, he soon is in hot pursuit of them as they continue their rampage. However, they turn around and ram his cruiser, totaling it, before retreating to their flophouse to count their haul. The sheriff soon catches up, but some clever moves and trap doors allow Bunny and Claude to temporarily foil the sheriff and escape to continue their crimes.\nAfter managing to turn a literal roadblock of a giant wooden toy block into smaller ones that spell out \"The sheriff is a fink\" and Bunny forces the sheriff to carry his cruiser and pursue on foot after blowing out his tires with her Thompson SMG, the sheriff decides to hide in a carrot patch disguised as a giant carrot to ambush and arrest Bunny and Claude that way. When the duo show up to collect the carrots, they pull up the sheriff, and he has them dead to rights as he prepares to cuff them. However, when they comment on his disguise in amazement, he decides to show it off for them, but the moment he turns to show them the backside of it, Claude boots him back into the hole he emerged from and stuns him, allowing them to escape, forcing the sheriff to once more pursue them in his cruiser over the horizon with his siren wailing.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n[1] on IMDb",

    "text": "Ralph McPherran Kiner (October 27, 1922 – February 6, 2014) was an American Major League Baseball player and broadcaster. An outfielder, Kiner played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, and Cleveland Indians from 1946 through 1955.\nFollowing his retirement, Kiner served from 1956 through 1960 as general manager of the Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. He also served as an announcer for the New York Mets from the team's inception until his death. Though injuries forced his retirement from active play after 10 seasons, Kiner led all of his National League contemporaries in home runs between 1946 and 1952. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.\nAfter Kiner's death, baseball writer Marty Noble called him \"one of baseball's genuine and most charming gentlemen.\"\n\n\nEarly life\nKiner was born in Santa Rita, New Mexico, to Beatrice (née Grayson) and Ralph Macklin Kiner. His father died when Ralph was four and his mother took a job in Alhambra, California, where Kiner was subsequently raised. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch and Scotch-Irish descent, with German-Jewish ancestry through his maternal grandmother. Kiner graduated from Alhambra High School in Alhambra, California.\n\n\nWorld War II Service\nKiner served as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II.\nKiner was inducted into the Navy during the spring of 1943. As a cadet, he attended St. Mary's Pre-Flight School in California and earned his pilot's wings and commission at Corpus Christi, Texas, in December 1944. Kiner flew PBM Mariner flying boats on submarine patrols from Naval Air Station (NAS) Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii, accumulating 1,200 flying hours. Kiner enlisted the day after Pearl Harbor.\n\n\nPlaying career (1946–1955)\nKiner made his major league debut on April 12, 1946, with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He finished the season with 23 home runs, but 109 strikeouts. After the season, the Pirates convinced future Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg not to retire. Greenberg gave Kiner hours of instruction, and in 1947, Kiner led the major leagues with 51 home runs while striking out fewer than 100 times.\nMany of Kiner's homers were hit into a shortened left-field and left-center-field porch at Forbes Field (originally built for Greenberg and known in the press as \"Greenberg Gardens\"); the porch was retained for Kiner and redubbed \"Kiner's Korner\". Kiner would later use \"Kiner's Korner\" as the title of his post-game TV show in New York.\nIn 1949, Kiner topped his 1947 total with 54 home runs, falling just two short of Hack Wilson's then-National League record. It was the highest total in the major leagues from 1939 to 1960, and the highest National League total from 1931 to 1997. It made Kiner the first National League player with two 50 plus home run seasons. Kiner also matched his peak of 127 RBIs. From 1947 to 1951, Kiner topped 40 home runs and 100 RBIs each season. Through 2011 he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-HR, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard and Ryan Braun.\nKiner's string of seasons leading the league in home runs reached seven in 1952, when he hit 37. This also was the last of a record six consecutive seasons in which he led Major League Baseball in home runs, all under the guidance of manager Billy Meyer and Pirate great Honus Wagner. He was selected to participate in the All-Star Game in six straight seasons, 1948 to 1953.\nThe equally famous \"Home run hitters drive Cadillacs and singles hitters drive Fords,\" frequently misattributed to Kiner himself, was, by his own account, actually coined by teammate Fritz Ostermueller.  Footage of Kiner hitting a home run in Forbes Field can be seen in the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield.\nOn June 4, 1953, Kiner was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a ten-player trade.  The Pirates traded Kiner, Joe Garagiola, George Metkovich, and Howie Pollet to the Cubs in exchange for Bob Addis, Toby Atwell, George Freese, Gene Hermanski, Bob Schultz, Preston Ward, and $150,000.  This was largely due to continued salary disputes with Pirates general manager Branch Rickey, who reportedly told Kiner, \"We finished last with you, we can finish last without you.\"\nKiner played the rest of 1953 and all of 1954 with the Cubs, finishing his career with the Cleveland Indians in 1955. A back injury forced him to retire at the age of 32, finishing his career with 369 home runs, 1,015 runs batted in and a .279 lifetime batting average. He hit better than .300 three times, with a career best .313 with the Pirates in 1947.\n\n\nBroadcasting career (1961–2013)\n\nIn 1961, Kiner entered the broadcast booth for the Chicago White Sox. The following year, Kiner, Lindsey Nelson, and Bob Murphy began broadcasting the games of the expansion New York Mets on WOR-TV in New York City. The trio rotated announcing duties. Kiner also hosted a post-game show known as \"Kiner's Korner\" on WOR-TV. Nationally, he helped call the Mets' appearance in the 1969 and 1973 World Series for NBC Radio. He won a local Emmy Award for his broadcasting work.\nKiner was known for his occasional malapropisms, usually connected with getting people's names wrong, such as calling broadcasting partner Tim McCarver as \"Tim MacArthur\" and calling Gary Carter \"Gary Cooper\". He even once called himself \"Ralph Korner\".\nDespite a bout with Bell's palsy, which left him with slightly slurred speech, Kiner continued broadcasting for 53 seasons. Kiner's tenure with the Mets was the third-longest for an active broadcaster with a single team as of his final season. He is the third longest-tenured broadcaster in baseball history, trailing only Los Angeles Dodgers announcers Vin Scully (1950–2016) and Jaime Jarrín (1959–2022). His traditional home run call—\"It is gone, goodbye,\" was a signature phrase in baseball.\nAs illness reduced his appearances, Kiner featured less frequently on SportsNet New York (SNY) and WPIX, which currently televise Mets games. During these visits (usually once a week), regular announcers Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, and Ron Darling would welcome Kiner as he shared stories of the Golden Age of baseball, as well as the contemporary game. During his final season in 2013, he was the oldest active announcer in Major League Baseball.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nKiner is the second cousin twice removed of MLB infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa, through their common ancestor Mary McPherran Kiner of Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, who was Kiner’s great-grandmother and Kiner-Falefa’s great-great-great-grandmother.\nPartly because Hollywood megastar Bing Crosby was part-owner of the Pirates, Kiner was often closely linked with celebrities such as Crosby's colleague Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, but even more to publicized romances, dates, or photos with leading ladies, such as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, and Janet Leigh. He was Taylor's date to the premiere of Twelve O'Clock High in 1949 and began dating Leigh when Angels in the Outfield was being filmed at Forbes Field.\nKiner was married four times; his first spouse was 1950s tennis star Nancy Chaffee from 1951 to 1968. They had three children together: Michael, Scott, and Kathryn.\nKiner was also married to Barbara (née George) Kiner from 1969 to 1980, and to DiAnn Kiner from 1982 until her death in 2004.\nIn his 80s, Kiner married, then divorced, Ann Benisch.\n\n\nDeath\nRalph Kiner died from natural causes in Rancho Mirage, California, on February 6, 2014, at the age of 91. Upon his death, New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon said, \"Ralph Kiner was one of the most beloved people in Mets history - an original Met and extraordinary gentleman.\" At the time of his death, Kiner had been battling Bell's palsy, and the effects of a stroke that he had suffered a decade prior that forced him to reduce his broadcast schedule to a handful of games a season.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nKiner was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975. Kiner had garnered 273 votes by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, one more than the minimum required for election. It was in his final year of eligibility (his 13th, as no vote was held in 1963 and 1965), and it was the closest call possible for any player elected by the BBWAA (any further votes would be before the Veterans Committee if he was not elected). Kiner was also the only player voted in that year. He attended every Hall of Fame ceremony from the time he was inducted until his death.\n\nKiner was elected to the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1984.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates retired his uniform number 4 on September 19, 1987. He was inducted into the Pirates Hall of Fame in 2022 as part of the inaugural class.\nIn 1999, The Sporting News placed Kiner at number 90 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Baseball Players\". That same year, he was one of the 100 finalists for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team that year.\nThe Mets honored him with an on-field ceremony on \"Ralph Kiner Night\" at Shea Stadium on Saturday, July 14, 2007. On that night, fans were given photos of Kiner. Franchise icon Tom Seaver gave a commemorative speech recalling Kiner's legacy. Other guests of note were Yogi Berra, Bob Feller, and broadcaster Ernie Harwell. To honor his tenure, the Mets announced that the home broadcast booth at future home Citi Field would be named for Kiner (the booth at Shea had previously been named for him in 2002). As a present from the Mets, Kiner received a cruise of his choice.\nIn 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Kiner as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.\nIn 2014, the Mets \"retired\" Kiner's broadcast microphone and added a logo featuring his name, dates and a vintage broadcast microphone to the left-field wall at Citi Field. They also wore patches with the logo for the season. The logo was later moved from the wall to the stadium's top tier alongside the franchise's other non-player honorees.\n\n\nSee also\nMajor League Baseball titles leaders\nList of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders\nList of Major League Baseball annual runs batted in leaders\nList of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career home run leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career OPS leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career on-base percentage leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career slugging percentage leaders\nList of Major League Baseball home run records\nList of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBroadwater, Robert P.

The succession was unchallenged, and Said took possession of the capital, Rustaq.\nHis brothers Saif and Sultan bin Ahmad called on Sheikh Sakar of the Shemal tribal group to help them gain the throne. \nSheikh Sakar took the towns of Hamra, Shargah, Rams and Khor Fakan. Said fought back, but was unable to regain these towns. \nHowever, Saif and Sultan felt it was too dangerous for them to stay in Oman. Saif sailed for East Africa, intending to set himself up as a ruler there. He died there soon after. Sultan escaped to Gwadar on the Makran coast of Balochistan.\n\n\nDeposition\nThe Imam was increasingly unpopular. Around the end of 1785 a group of notables elected his brother, Qais bin Ahmad Al Busaidi, Imam. This revolt soon collapsed.\nLater one of Said‘s sons was held prisoner in Fort Al Jalali for a period by the governor of Muscat. Another son, Hamad bin Said, came to negotiate with the governor. \nHamad and his followers managed to gain control of forts al-Jalali and al-Mirani, and thus of Muscat.\nThis happened in 1786. One by one the other fortresses in Oman submitted to Hamad, until Said no longer had any temporal power.\nHamad took the title of Sheikh and established his court in Muscat. Said bin Ahmad remained in Rustaq and retained the title of Imam, but this was purely a symbolic religious title that carried no power.\n\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nSources",

His career culminated with the command of the Internal Troops of the Soviet Union, becoming their last commander, and the first commander of their successor organization, the Internal Troops of Russia.\nSavvin's career with the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) began when he joined the Internal Troops in 1956, subsequently graduating with honours from the Ministry's military school, and rising through the ranks commanding platoons, companies and then battalions. He was transferred to the far north in 1969, serving at Murmansk in staff roles that took him from chief of staff and then commander of regiments, and then divisions, at first in the Arctic and then in Siberia. He eventually became head of the Internal Affairs Directorate for Siberia, and then the North-West and the Baltic States, before being appointed commander of the MVD's entire internal forces in September 1991. He saw out the dissolution of the Soviet Union in this post, and the reformation of the former Soviet organization as the Internal Troops of Russia in January 1992. He held the position until his retirement in 1993, and subsequently settled in Saint Petersburg, where he died in 2020.\n\n\nEarly life and service\nSavvin was born into a peasant family on 30 April 1939 in Dobrino, Liskinsky District, in Voronezh Oblast, then part of the Russian SFSR, in the Soviet Union. His father was killed in 1941 while fighting at the front during the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. After sitting seven years of his schooling, he worked for a time on a collective farm, completing his studies with evening classes.\nSavvin joined the Internal Troops of the Soviet Union, part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), in 1956. He studied at the S. M. Kirov Ordzhonikidze Military School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, graduating with honours in 1959. He was first assigned to command a platoon in Riga, and then a company.  He became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1961, and enrolled as a student in the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in 1964. After graduating, again with honours, in 1967, he was appointed to command a battalion in Leningrad.\n\n\nStaff and senior posts\n\nIn 1969 Savvin was moved to the Arctic north of the Soviet Union, becoming chief of staff of the 590th escort regiment of the 44th escort division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, based in Murmansk. He became commander of the regiment in 1972, and then in 1975 chief of staff of the MVD's escort division in Siberia. Promoted to polkovnik in 1979 he became chief of staff of the Ministry's Internal Affairs Directorate for Western Siberia, and in 1984 became head of the directorate. He had been promoted to general major in 1983, and in 1987 he transferred to head the Internal Affairs Directorate for the North-West and the Baltic States. While in this post he was promoted to general lieutenant in 1988.\nOn 21 September 1991 Savvin was appointed commander of the MVD's entire internal forces. He held the position during the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, and the reconstitution of the former Soviet forces as the Internal Troops of Russia on 23 January 1992. As such he became the last head of the Soviet Internal Troops, and the first head of the Russian Internal Troops. He remained in command until 23 December 1992. He retired from military service on 24 August 1993, having been promoted to general-polkovnik in 1991. In retirement he settled in Saint Petersburg, and helped to organize assistance for the families of deceased military personnel.\n\n\nDeath and awards\nSavvin died in Saint Petersburg on 24 February 2020 at the age of 80. General of the Army Viktor Zolotov, commander of the National Guard of Russia, the successor organization of the Internal Troops, offered his condolences, saying \"Vasily Nesterovich was a courageous, strong-willed man, a real Russian officer who devoted his life to serving the Fatherland and strengthening the national security of the state. He always coped with the tasks with honour, in the most difficult emergency situations he showed a strong-willed character and a willingness to help.\" Savvin was buried in Saint Petersburg's Serafimovskoe Cemetery on 28 February.\nOver his career he had been awarded the Order of the Red Star and the Order \"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\" Third Class, as well as various medals.\n\n\nReferences",

The 337 metres (1,106 ft) high mountain. is an obstacle to the trade winds leading to a very high humidity resulting in an abundance of plant- and animal life.  \nOver 1,100 plant species have identified as well as 101 mammals and 70 reptiles.

    "text": "2014 Forest Hills Drive is the third studio album by American rapper J. Cole, released on December 9, 2014, by ByStorm Entertainment, Columbia Records, Dreamville Records and Roc Nation.\nRecording sessions took place over the whole year, while the production on the album was primarily handled by Cole himself, along with several others such as Illmind, Vinylz, Phonix Beats and Willie B. It was announced three weeks before its release and had very little marketing, with no singles or promotion taking place prior to its release. The album was supported by four singles: \"Apparently\", \"Wet Dreamz\", \"No Role Modelz\" and \"Love Yourz\".\n2014 Forest Hills Drive received generally positive reviews from critics who admired its ambitious concept, production and lyrics. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 353,000 copies in its first week. As of September 2015, the album has sold one million copies in the United States. The album was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2024.\nThe album won Album of the Year at the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards, and Top Rap Album at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards. It was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards. The single \"Apparently\" was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards. The 10-year anniversary edition of the album was released in December 2024.\n\n\nBackground\nThe album's title is the address of a home in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where Cole lived from his early youth, until 2003. Cole lived at the property with his mother, his brother and his stepfather, and was the location where Cole wrote some of his earliest songs, and decided to pursue a career as a musician.\nIn 2014, Cole bought the house, and was the first home he had purchased. The album's title is used to recount Cole's upbringing, and the transition from leaving North Carolina to New York; it battles with the transitions that were taken in order to find his success and fame within the music industry. Cole soon put the home up for an \"extremely cheap\" renting price, in the hope that any struggling residents could use it to progress their lives, without having to worry about frequent moving, an experience Cole underwent due to frequent financial struggles.\n\n\nRecording and production\nOn August 15, 2014, Cole released the song \"Be Free\", as a response to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In an interview with NPR's Microphone Check radio show, Cole revealed that the song was recorded the same week he recorded the song \"Intro\" from 2014 Forest Hills Drive, but was never intended for the album. In September 2014, during an interview with HipHopDX, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's manager Steve Lobel revealed Krayzie Bone and Bizzy Bone recorded a track with Cole for the album, though the song never made the album's final cut. The production on the album was primarily handled by J. Cole, along with its guest productions, including Dreamville's in-house producer Ron Gilmore, DJ Dahi, Illmind, Willie B, Phonix Beats, Vinylz and Pop Wansel, with additional production provided by Cardiak and CritaCal, among others. During production, Cole had envisioned 2014 Forest Hills Drive to be released as a double album.\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nOn November 16, 2014, Cole released a video trailer, where he announced he will be releasing his third album, titled 2014 Forest Hills Drive on December 9. The video also featured footage regarding the making-of the album. Additionally, the album's name sake was revealed to be the address of Cole's childhood home in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Cole held a listening session at the home on 2014 Forest Hills Drive where he invited a select group of fans to hear the album. On February 13, 2015, Cole announced he would further promote the album with a tour called Forest Hills Drive. The tour was divided into three different acts. \"Act 1: Hometown\", \"Act 2: The Journey\" and \"Act 3: Hollywood\". Act 1 started on March 2, 2015, in Eugene, Oregon and ended on April 7, 2015, in Providence, Rhode Island, it featured Dreamville artists such as Bas, Cozz and Omen, who were also served as supporting acts on Act 2 and 3. Act 2 started on April 30, 2015, in Zürich, Switzerland and ended on May 18, 2015, in London, England, it featured Jhené Aiko and Pusha T. Act 3 was the longest leg of the tour, it started on July 12, 2015, in Seattle, Washington and ended on August 29, 2015, in Cole's hometown Fayetteville, North Carolina, and featured Big Sean, YG and Jeremih. Cole brought out Drake and Jay-Z to perform at the last show in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.5 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\nComplex critic Justin Charity praised it as Cole's most mature and well-edited album to date, crediting him for eschewing \"much of the whiplash and false bravado\" of his previous work. Erin Lowers of Exclaim! said, \"He shines without any features, standing strong in his delivery and carrying his story to the forefront of the 13-track project. While it may not be his Late Registration, he has definitely graduated into a class of his own.\" Andre Grant of HipHopDX stated, \"It is less artistic than it means to be, but it is truer than anything he's ever made. Its narrative, the tropes, and the strategies are completely overcome by the album's terrifying integrity..\" Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork said, \"2014 Forest Hills Drive is a decent album selling itself as great. It wraps itself in the garments of a classic, but you can see that the tailoring is off.\" Kellan Miller of XXL stated, \"With every quality drop from the self-proclaimed \"God\", his ceiling will continue to grow and so will fan expectations.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \"2014 Forest Hills Drive comes off as a great, experimental, and advancing mixtape, but it's insider to a fault, as slight as that fault might be.\" Jesal \"Jay Soul\" Padania of RapReviews said, \"He been afforded a rare amount of artistic freedom on 2014 Forest Hills Drive and there aren't even any singles, so it's great that he's more or less delivered. But whilst this definitely misses out on classic territory, that doesn't mean it isn't a bloody good album for the most part.\"\nMarshall Gu of PopMatters said, \"On 2014 Forest Hills Drive, we've still got the same ol' Cole, but with diminishing returns and without any friends to help him.\" David Turner of Rolling Stone said, \"He speaks some incisive truths about class, race (\"Fire Squad\") and relationships (\"Wet Dreamz\"), but those insights are too often undercut by crass humor. The production falls short, too, with dull beats to match his languid flow.\" Jason Gubbels of Spin said, \"Cole's keen sense of injustice registers throughout 2014 Forest Hills Drive, whether slagging white artists for artistic thievery or seething over national media outlets pigeonholing black genius into sports/pop either / ors.... But the absence of \"Be Free\" still detracts. Unless you're the type of moviegoer who sits patiently through the end titles, feel free to duck out of \"Note to Self\" a bit early and head over to SoundCloud.\" Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating in his review for Cuepoint, naming \"Wet Dreamz\" and \"Love Yourz\" as highlights while summing the album up as being \"full of the kind of good intentions the road to irrelevance is paved with\".\n\n\nRankings\n\n\nIndustry awards\n\n\nCommercial performance\n2014 Forest Hills Drive debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling a total of 371,000 copies, with 353,000 copies consisting of whole album sales and the remaining 17,000 copies determined based on individual song sales and streaming data. This is a tracking change that was implemented by Nielsen SoundScan and Billboard in December 2014. 2014 Forest Hills Drive became the best first week sales of J. Cole's career at the time, outpacing the first week sales of his second album Born Sinner (2013), by 74,000 copies (297,000 copies). In addition to the album's sales toppling early projections by over 100,000 copies, 2014 Forest Hills Drive also broke One Direction's record for most album streams on Spotify, being streamed over 15.7 million times in its first week, compared to One Direction's 11.5 million streams. Drake later broke this record with 17.3 million streams for his mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late. In its second week, the album sold 135,000 more copies. Cole became one of only six rappers to reach number one with their first three full-length studio albums, others being Drake, Rick Ross, Nelly, DMX and Snoop Dogg. As of December 2016, the album has sold 1,240,000 copies in the United States. On December 10, 2024, 2014 Forest Hills Drive was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales, streaming and track-sale equivalents of six million units in the United States.\nIn 2015, 2014 Forest Hills Drive was ranked as the eighth most popular album of the year on the Billboard 200.\n\n\nTrack listing\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\nNotes\n\n^[a]  signifies a co-producer\n^[b]  signifies an additional producer\n\"January 28th\" contains additional vocals by Kaye Fox\n\"A Tale of 2 Citiez\" contains additional background vocals by Kaye Fox, T.S.

    "text": "Dreadlocks, also known as dreads or locs, are a hairstyle made of rope-like strands of hair. Locs can form naturally in very curly hair, or they can be created with techniques like twisting, backcombing, or crochet.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word dreadlocks is usually understood to come from Jamaican Creole dread, \"member of the Rastafarian movement who wears his hair in dreadlocks\" (compare Nazirite), referring to their dread or awe of God.  An older name for dreadlocks was elflocks, from the notion that elves had twisted the locks in people's sleep.\nOther origins have been proposed. Some authors trace the term to the Mau Mau, a group of whom apparently coined it from British colonialists in 1959 as a reference to their dreadful hair.\nIn their 2014 book Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America, Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharps claimed that the name dredlocs originated in the time of the slave trade: when transported Africans disembarked from the slave ships after spending months confined in unhygienic conditions, whites would report that their undressed and matted kinky hair was \"dreadful\". According to them, it is due to these circumstances that many people wearing the style today drop the a in dreadlock to avoid negative implications.  \nThe word locs refers to locks of entangled hair. \nSeveral languages have names for these locks:\n\nJaṭā In Sanskrit.\nNdiagne and Ndjan in Wolof.\nMpesempese in Akan.\nDada in Yoruba.\nEzenwa and Elena in Igbo.\nGoscha in Hamer.\nMhotsi in Shona.\nNontombi in Nyaneka.\nRastas in Spanish.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nAfrica\nAccording to Sherrow in Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History, Locs  date back to ancient times in various cultures. In ancient Egypt, Egyptians wore locked hairstyles and wigs appeared on bas-reliefs, statuary and other artifacts. Mummified remains of Egyptians with locked wigs have also been recovered from archaeological sites. According to Maria Delongoria, braided hair was worn by people in the Sahara desert since 3000 BCE. Dreadlocks were also worn by followers of Abrahamic religions. For example, Ethiopian Coptic Bahatowie priests adopted dreadlocks as a hairstyle before the fifth century CE (400 or 500 CE). Locking hair was practiced by some ethnic groups in East, Central, West, and Southern Africa.\n\n\nMesoamerica\nPre-Columbian Aztec priests were described in Aztec codices (including the Durán Codex, the Codex Tudela and the Codex Mendoza) as wearing their hair untouched, allowing it to grow long and matted. Bernal Diaz del Castillo records: There were priests with long robes of black cloth... The hair of these priests was very long and so matted that it could not be separated or disentangled, and most of them had their ears scarified, and their hair was clotted with blood.\n\n\nEurope\n\nThe earliest known possible depictions of Locs in Europe date back as far as 1600–1500 BCE in the Minoan Civilization, centered in Crete (now part of Greece). Frescoes discovered on the Aegean island of Thera (modern Santorini, Greece) portray individuals with long braided hair or long dreadlocks. Another source describes the hair of the boys in the Akrotiri Boxer Fresco as long tresses, not dreadlocks. Tresses of hair are defined by Collins Dictionary as braided hair, braided plaits, or long loose curls of hair.\n\n\nNineteenth century\nIn Senegal, the Baye Fall, followers of the Mouride movement, a Sufi movement of Islam founded in 1887 CE by Shaykh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, are famous for growing dreadlocks and wearing multi-colored gowns.\nCheikh Ibra Fall, founder of the Baye Fall school of the Mouride Brotherhood, popularized the style by adding a mystic touch to it. This sect of Islam in Senegal, where Muslims wear ndjan (dreadlocks), aimed to Africanize Islam. Dreadlocks to this group of Islamic followers symbolize their religious orientation. Jamaican Rastas also reside in Senegal and have settled in areas near Baye Fall communities. Baye Fall and Jamaican Rastas have similar cultural beliefs regarding dreadlocks. Both groups wear knitted caps to cover their locs and wear locs for religious and spiritual purposes. Male members of the Baye Fall religion wear locs to detach from mainstream Western ideals.\n\n\nTwentieth century into present day\nIn the 1970s, Americans and Britons attended reggae concerts and were exposed to various aspects of Jamaican culture, including dreadlocks. Hippies related to the Rastafarian idea of rejecting capitalism and colonialism, symbolized by the name \"Babylon\". Rastafarians rejected Babylon in multiple ways, including by wearing their hair naturally in locs to defy Western standards of beauty. The 1960s was the height of the civil rights movement in the U.S., and some White Americans joined Black people in the fight against inequality and segregation and were inspired by Black culture. As a result, some White people joined the Rastafarian movement. Dreadlocks were not a common hairstyle in the United States, but by the 1970s, some White Americans were inspired by reggae music, the Rastafarian movement, and African-American hair culture and started wearing dreadlocks. According to authors Bronner and Dell Clark, the clothing styles worn by hippies in the 1960s and 1970s were copied from African-American culture. The word hippie comes from the African-American slang word hip. African-American dress and hairstyles such as braids (often decorated with beads), dreadlocks, and language were copied by hippies and developed into a new countercultural movement used by hippies.\nIn Europe in the 1970s, hundreds of Jamaicans and other Caribbean people immigrated to metropolitan centers of London, Birmingham, Paris, and Amsterdam. Communities of Jamaicans, Caribbeans, and Rastas emerged in these areas. Thus Europeans in these metropolitan cities were introduced to Black cultures from the Caribbean and Rastafarian practices and were inspired by Caribbean culture, leading some of them to adopt Black hair culture, music, and religion. However, the strongest influence of Rastafari religion is among Europe's Black population.\nWhen reggae music, which espoused Rastafarian ideals, gained popularity and mainstream acceptance in the 1970s, thanks to Bob Marley's music and cultural influence, dreadlocks (often called \"dreads\") became a notable fashion statement worldwide, and have been worn by prominent authors, actors, athletes, and rappers. Rastafari influenced its members worldwide to embrace dreadlocks. Black Rastas loc their hair to embrace their African heritage and accept African features as beautiful, such as dark skin tones, Afro-textured hair, and African facial features.\n\nHip Hop and rap artists such as Lauryn Hill, Lil Wayne, T-Pain, Snoop Dog, J-Cole, Wiz Khalifa, Chief Keef, Lil Jon, and other artists wear dreadlocks, which further popularized the hairstyle in the 1990s, early 2000s, and present day. Dreadlocks are a part of hip-hop fashion and reflect Black cultural music of liberation and identity. Many rappers and Afrobeat artists in Uganda wear locs, such as Navio, Delivad Julio, Fik Fameica, Vyper Ranking, Byaxy, Liam Voice, and other artists. From reggae music to hip hop, rap, and Afrobeat, Black artists in the African diaspora wear locs to display their Black identity and culture.\nYouth in Kenya who are fans of rap and hip hop music, and Kenyan rappers and musicians, wear locs to connect to the history of the Mau Mau freedom fighters who wore locs as symbols of anti-colonialism, and to Bob Marley, who was a Rasta. Hip hop and reggae fashion spread to Ghana and fused with traditional Ghanaian culture. Ghanaian musicians wear dreadlocks incorporating reggae symbols and hip hop clothes mixed with traditional Ghanaian textiles, such as wearing Ghanaian headwraps to hold their locs. Ghanaian women wear locs as a symbol of African beauty. The beauty industry in Ghana believe locs are a traditional African hair practice and market hair care products to promote natural African hairstyles such as afros and locs. The previous generations of Black artists have inspired younger contemporary Black actresses to loc their hair, such as Chloe Bailey, Halle Bailey, and R&B and Pop music singer Willow Smith. More Black actors in Hollywood are choosing to loc their hair to embrace their Black heritage.\nAlthough more Black women in Hollywood and the beauty and music industries are wearing locs, there has never been a Black Miss America winner with locs, possibly because the hairstyle has not been popular with many conservative standards of beauty. For example, model Adesuwa Aighewi locked her hair and was told she might not receive any casting calls because of her dreadlocks. Some Black women in modeling agencies are forced to straighten their hair. However, more Black women are resisting and choosing to wear Black hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in fashion shows and beauty pageants. For example, in 2007 Miss Universe Jamaica and Rastafarian, Zahra Redwood, was the first Black woman to break the barrier on a world pageant stage when she wore locs, paving the way and influencing other Black women to wear locs in beauty pageants. In 2015, Miss Jamaica World Sanneta Myrie was the first contestant to wear locs to the Miss World Pageant. In 2018, Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers of Britain was crowned Miss Universe wearing her locs and became the first Black British woman to win the competition with natural locs.\n\n\nBy culture\nLocks have been worn for various reasons in many cultures and ethnic groups around the world throughout history. Their use has also been raised in debates about cultural appropriation.\n\n\nAfrica\n\nThe practice of wearing braids and dreadlocks in Africa can be traced back to 3,000 BC in the Sahara Desert. It has been commonly thought that other cultures influenced the dreadlock tradition in Africa. The Kikuyu and Somali wear braided and locked hairstyles. Warriors among the Fulani, Wolof, and Serer in Mauritania, and Mandinka in Mali were known for centuries to have worn cornrows when young and dreadlocks when old.\nIn West Africa, the water spirit Mami Wata is said to have long locked hair. Mami Wata's spiritual powers of fertility and healing come from her dreadlocks. West African spiritual priests called Dada wear dreadlocks to venerate Mami Wata in her honor as spiritual consecrations. Some Ethiopian Christian monks and Bahatowie priests of the Ethiopian Coptic Church lock their hair for religious purposes. In Yorubaland, Aladura church prophets called woolii mat their hair into locs and wear long blue, red, white, or purple garments with caps and carry iron rods used as a staff. Prophets lock their hair in accordance with the Nazarene vow in the Christian bible. This is not to be confused with the Rastafari religion that was started in the 1930s. The Aladura church was founded in 1925 and syncretizes indigenous Yoruba beliefs about dreadlocks with Christianity. Moses Orimolade Tunolase was the founder of the first African Pentecostal movement started in 1925 in Nigeria. Tunolase wore dreadlocks and members of his church wear dreadlocks in his honor and for spiritual protection.\n\nThe Yoruba word Dada is given to children in Nigeria born with dreadlocks. Some Yoruba people believe children born with dreadlocks have innate spiritual powers, and cutting their hair might cause serious illness. Only the child's mother can touch their hair. \"Dada children are believed to be young gods, they are often offered at spiritual altars for chief priests to decide their fate. Some children end up becoming spiritual healers and serve at the shrine for the rest of their lives.\" If their hair is cut, it must be cut by a chief priest and placed in a pot of water with herbs, and the mixture is used to heal the child if they get sick. Among the Igbo, Dada children are said to be reincarnated Jujuists of great spiritual power because of their dreadlocks. Children born with dreadlocks are viewed as special. However, adults with dreadlocks are viewed negatively. Yoruba Dada children's dreadlocks are shaved at a river, and their hair is grown back \"tamed\" and have a hairstyle that conforms to societal standards. The child continues to be recognized as mysterious and special. It is believed that the hair of Dada children was braided in heaven before they were born and will bring good fortune and wealth to their parents. When the child is older, the hair is cut during a special ritual. In Yoruba mythology, the Orisha Yemoja gave birth to a Dada who is a deified king in Yoruba. However, dreadlocks are viewed in a negative light in Nigeria due to their stereotypical association with gangs and criminal activity; men with dreadlocks face profiling from Nigerian police.\n\nIn Ghana, among the Ashanti people, Okomfo priests are identified by their dreadlocks. They are not allowed to cut their hair and must allow it to mat and lock naturally. Locs are symbols of higher power reserved for priests. Other spiritual people in Southern Africa who wear dreadlocks are Sangomas. Sangomas wear red and white beaded dreadlocks to connect to ancestral spirits. Two African men were interviewed, explaining why they chose to wear dreadlocks. \"One – Mr. Ngqula – said he wore his dreadlocks to obey his ancestors' call, given through dreams, to become a 'sangoma' in accordance with his Xhosa culture. Another – Mr. Kamlana – said he was instructed to wear his dreadlocks by his ancestors and did so to overcome 'intwasa', a condition understood in African culture as an injunction from the ancestors to become a traditional healer, from which he had suffered since childhood.\" In Zimbabwe, there is a tradition of locking hair called mhotsi worn by spirit mediums called svikiro. The Rastafarian religion spread to Zimbabwe and influenced some women in Harare to wear locs because they believe in the Rastafari's pro-Black teachings and rejection of colonialism.\n\nMaasai warriors in Kenya are known for their long, thin, red dreadlocks, dyed with red root extracts or red ochre (red earth clay). The Himba women in Namibia are also known for their red-colored dreadlocks. Himba women use red earth clay mixed with butterfat and roll their hair with the mixture. They use natural moisturizers to maintain the health of their hair. Hamar women in Ethiopia wear red-colored locs made using red earth clay. In Angola, Mwila women create thick dreadlocks covered in herbs, crushed tree bark, dried cow dung, butter, and oil. The thick dreadlocks are dyed using oncula, an ochre of red crushed rock. In Southern, Eastern, and Northern Africa, Africans use red ochre as sunscreen and cover their dreadlocks and braids with ochre to hold their hair in styles and as a hair moisturizer by mixing it with fats. Red ochre has a spiritual meaning of fertility, and in Maasai culture, the color red symbolizes bravery and is used in ceremonies and dreadlock hair traditions.\nHistorians note that West and Central African people braid their hair to signify age, gender, rank, role in society, and ethnic affiliation. In many tribes, it is believed braided and locked hair provides spiritual protection, connects people to the spirit of the earth, bestows spiritual power, and enables people to communicate with the gods and spirits. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade saw Black Africans forcibly transported from Sub-Saharan Africa to North America and, upon their arrival in the New World, their heads would be shaved in an effort to erase their culture. Enslaved Africans spent months in slave ships and their hair matted into dreadlocks that European slave traders called \"dreadful.\"\n\n\nAfrican diaspora in The Americas and Europe\n\nIn the African diaspora, people loc their hair to have a connection to the spirit world and receive messages from spirits. It is believed locs of hair are antennas making the wearer receptive to spiritual messages. Other reasons people loc their hair are for fashion and to maintain the health of natural hair, also called kinky hair. In the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, the Black Power movement, Black is Beautiful movement, and the natural hair movement inspired many Black Americans to wear their hair natural in afros, braids, and locked hairstyles. The Black is Beautiful cultural movement spread to Black communities in Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s, Black people in Britain were aware of the civil rights movement and other cultural movements in Black America and the social and political changes occurring at the time. Rastafari culture in Europe influenced Afro-Britons to wear their hair in natural loc styles and afros as a way to fight against racism, Western standards of beauty, and to develop unity among Black people of diverse backgrounds. From the twentieth century to the present day, dreadlocks have been symbols of Black liberation and are worn by revolutionaries, activists, womanists, and radical artists in the diaspora. For example, Black American literary author Toni Morrison wore locs, and Alice Walker wears locs to reconnect with their African heritage.\nNatural Black hairstyles worn by Black women are seen as not feminine and unprofessional in some American businesses. Wearing locs in the diaspora signifies a person's racial identity and defiance of European standards of beauty, such as straight blond hair. Locs encourage Black people to embrace other aspects of their culture that are tied to Black hair, such as wearing African ornaments like cowrie shells, beads, and African headwraps that are sometimes worn with locs. Some Black Canadian women wear locs to connect to the global Black culture. Dreadlocks unite Black people in the diaspora because wearing locs has the same meaning in areas of the world where there are Black people: opposing Eurocentric standards of beauty and sharing a Black and African diaspora identity. For many Black women in the diaspora, locs are a fashion statement to express individuality and the beauty and versatility of Black hair. Locs are also a protective hairstyle to maintain the health of their hair by wearing kinky hair in natural locs or faux locs. To protect their natural hair from the elements during the changing seasons, Black women wear certain hairstyles to protect and retain the moisture in their hair. Black women wear soft locs as a protective hairstyle because they enclose natural hair inside them, protecting their natural hair from environmental damage. This protective soft loc style is created by \"wrapping hair around the natural hair or crocheting pre-made soft locs into cornrows.\" In the diaspora, Black men and women wear different styles of dreadlocks. Each style requires a different method of care. Freeform locs are formed organically by not combing the hair or manipulating the hair. There are also goddess locs, faux locs, sister locs, twisted locs, Rasta locs, crinkle locs, invisible locs, and other loc styles.\n\n\nAustralia\n\nSome Indigenous Australians of North West and North Central Australia, as well as the Gold Coast region of Eastern Australia, have historically worn their hair in a locked style, sometimes also having long beards that are fully or partially locked. Traditionally, some wear the dreadlocks loose, while others wrap the dreadlocks around their heads or bind them at the back of the head. In North Central Australia, the tradition is for the dreadlocks to be greased with fat and coated with red ochre, which assists in their formation. In 1931 in Warburton Range, Western Australia, a photograph was taken of an Aboriginal Australian man with dreadlocks.\nIn the 1970s, hippies from Australia's southern region moved to Kuranda, where they introduced the Rastafari movement as expressed in the reggae music of Peter Tosh and Bob Marley to the Buluwai people in the 1970s. Aboriginal Australians found parallels between the struggles of Black people in the Americas and their own racial struggles in Australia. Willie Brim, a Buluwai man born in the 1960s in Kuranda, identified with Tosh's and Marley's spiritually conscious music, and inspired particularly by Peter Tosh's album Bush Doctor, in 1978 he founded a reggae band called Mantaka after the area alongside the Barron River where he grew up. He combined his people's cultural traditions with the reggae guitar he had played since he was young, and his band's music reflects Buluwai culture and history. Now a leader of the Buluwai people and a cultural steward, Brim and his band send an \"Aboriginal message\" to the world. He and other Buluwai people wear dreadlocks as a native part of their culture and not as an influence from the Rastafari religion. Although Brim was inspired by reggae music, he is not a Rastafarian as he and his people have their own spirituality. Foreigners visiting Australia think the Buluwai people wearing dreadlocks were influenced by the Rastafarian movement, but the Buluwai say their ancestors wore dreadlocks before the movement began. Some Indigenous Australians wear an Australian Aboriginal flag (a symbol of unity and Indigenous identity in Australia) tied around their head to hold their dreadlocks.\n\n\nBuddhism\nWithin Tibetan Buddhism and other more esoteric forms of Buddhism, locks have occasionally been substituted for the more traditional shaved head. The most recognizable of these groups are known as the Ngagpas of Tibet. For Buddhists of these particular sects and degrees of initiation, their locked hair is not only a symbol of their vows but an embodiment of the particular powers they are sworn to carry. Hevajra Tantra 1.4.15 states that the practitioner of particular ceremonies \"should arrange his piled up hair\" as part of the ceremonial protocol. Archeologists found a statue of a male deity, Shiva, with dreadlocks in Stung Treng province in Cambodia. In a sect of tantric Buddhism, some initiates wear dreadlocks. The sect of tantric Buddhism in which initiates wear dreadlocks is called weikza and Passayana or Vajrayana Buddhism. This sect of Buddhism is practiced in Burma. The initiates spend years in the forest with this practice, and when they return to the temples, they should not shave their heads to reintegrate.\n\n\nHinduism\n\nThe practice of wearing a jaṭā (dreadlocks) is observed in modern-day Hinduism, most notably by sadhus who worship Shiva.The Kapalikas, first commonly referenced in the 6th century CE, were known to wear the jaṭā as a form of deity imitation of the deva Bhairava-Shiva. Shiva is often depicted with dreadlocks. According to Ralph Trueb, \"Shiva's dreadlocks represent the potent power of his mind that enables him to catch and bind the unruly and wild river goddess Ganga.\"\nIn a village in Pune, Savitha Uttam Thorat, some women hesitate to cut their long dreadlocks because it is believed it will cause misfortune or bring down divine wrath. Dreadlocks practiced by the women in this region of India are believed to be possessed by the goddess Yellamma. Cutting off the hair is believed to bring misfortune onto the woman, because having dreadlocks is considered to be a gift from the goddess Yellamma (also known as Renuka). Some of the women have long and heavy dreadlocks that put a lot of weight on their necks, causing pain and limited mobility. Some in local government and police in the Maharashtra region demand the women cut their hair, because the religious practice of Yellamma forbids women from washing and cutting their dreadlocks, causing health issues. These locks of hair dedicated to Yellamma are called jade, believed to be evidence of divine presence. However, in Southern India, people advocate for the end of the practice.\nThe goddess Angala Parameshvari in Indian mythology is said to have cataik-kari matted hair (dreadlocks). Women healers in India are identified by their locs of hair and are respected in spiritual rituals because they are believed to be connected to goddesses. A woman who has a jata is believed to derive her spiritual powers or shakti from her dreadlocks.\n\n\nRastafari\n\nRastafari movement dreadlocks are symbolic of the Lion of Judah, and were inspired by the Nazarites of the Bible. Jamaicans locked their hair after seeing images of Ethiopians with locs fighting Italian soldiers during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The afro is the preferred hairstyle worn by Ethiopians. During the Italian invasion, Ethiopians vowed not to cut their hair using the Biblical example of Samson, who got his strength from his seven locks of hair, until emperor Ras Tafari Makonnen (Haile Selassie) and Ethiopia were liberated and Selassie was returned from exile. Scholars also state another indirect Ethiopian influence for Rastas locking their hair are the Bahatowie priests in Ethiopia and their tradition of wearing dreadlocks for religious reasons since the 5th century AD. Another African influence for Rastas wearing locs was seeing photos of Mau Mau freedom fighters with locs in Kenya fighting against the British authorities in the 1950s. Dreadlocks to the Mau Mau freedom fighters were a symbol of anti-colonialism, and this symbolism of dreadlocks was an inspiration for Rastas to loc their hair in opposition to racism and promote an African identity. The branch of Rastafari that was inspired to loc their hair after the Mau Mau freedom fighters was the Nyabinghi Order, previously called Young Black Faith. Young Black Faith were considered a radical group of younger Rastafari members. Eventually, other Rastafari groups started locking their hair.\nIn the Rastafarian belief, people wear locs for a spiritual connection to the universe and the spirit of the earth. It is believed that by shaking their locs, they will bring down the destruction of Babylon. Babylon in the Rastafarian belief is systemic racism, colonialism, and any system of economic and social oppression of Black people. Locs are also worn to defy European standards of beauty and help to develop a sense of Black pride and acceptance of African features as beautiful. In another branch of Rastafari called Boboshanti Order of Rastafari, dreadlocks are worn to display a black person's identity and social protest against racism. The Bobo Ashanti are one of the strictest Mansions of Rastafari. They cover their locs with bright turbans and wear long robes and can usually be distinguished from other Rastafari members because of this. Other Rastas wear a Rastacap to tuck their locs under the cap.\nThe Bobo Ashanti (\"Bobo\" meaning \"black\" in Iyaric; and \"Ashanti\" in reference to the Ashanti people of Ghana, whom the Bobos claim are their ancestors), were founded by Emmanuel Charles Edwards in 1959 during the period known as the \"groundation\", where many protests took place calling for the repatriation of African descendants and slaves to Kingston. A Boboshanti branch spread to Ghana because of repatriated Jamaicans and other Black Rastas moving to Ghana. Prior to Rastas living in Ghana, Ghanaians and West Africans previously had their own beliefs about locked hair. Dreadlocks in West Africa are believed to bestow children born with locked hair with spiritual power, and that Dada children, that is, those born with dreadlocks, were given to their parents by water deities. Rastas and Ghanaians have similar beliefs about the spiritual significance of dreadlocks, such as not touching a person's or child's locs, maintaining clean locs, locs spiritual connections to spirits, and locs bestowing spiritual powers to the wearer.\n\n\nSports in the United States\nDreadlocks have become a popular hairstyle among professional athletes. However, some athletes are discriminated against and were forced to cut their dreadlocks. For example, in December 2018, a Black high school wrestler in New Jersey was forced to cut his dreadlocks 90 seconds before his match, sparking a civil rights case that led to the passage of the CROWN Act in 2019.\nIn professional American football, the number of players with dreadlocks has increased since Mike McKenzie, Al Harris and Ricky Williams first wore the style during the 1990s. In 2012, about 180 National Football League players wore dreadlocks. A significant number of these players are defensive backs, who are less likely to be tackled than offensive players. According to the NFL's rulebook, a player's hair is considered part of their \"uniform\", meaning the locks are fair game when attempting to bring them down.\nIn the NBA, there has been controversy over Brooklyn Nets guard Jeremy Lin, an Asian-American who garnered mild controversy over his choice of dreadlocks. Former NBA player Kenyon Martin accused Lin of appropriating African-American culture in a since-deleted social media post, after which Lin pointed out that Martin has multiple Chinese characters tattooed on his body.\nDavid Diamante, the American Boxing ring announcer of Italian American heritage, sports prominent dreadlocks.\n\n\nFormation and maintenance\nDreadlocks can be formed through several methods. Very curly hair forms single-strand knots that can naturally entangle into dreadlocks. For other types of hair various methods utilized to create dreadlocks include crochet hooks and backcombing. Dreadlocks should not be confused with matting, which occurs from the unintentional neglect and damage of any type of hair.\n\n\nHair discrimination\n\n\nUnited States\n\nOn 3 July 2019, California became the first US state to prohibit discrimination over natural hair. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the CROWN Act into law, banning employers and schools from discriminating against hairstyles such as dreadlocks, braids, afros, and twists. Likewise, later in 2019, Assembly Bill 07797 became law in New York state; it \"prohibits race discrimination based on natural hair or hairstyles\". Scholars call discrimination based on hair \"hairism\". Despite the passage of the CROWN Act, hairism continues, with some Black people being fired from work or not hired because of their dreadlocks. According to the CROWN 2023 Workplace Research Study, sixty-six percent of Black women change their hairstyle for job interviews, and twenty-five percent of Black women said they were denied a job because of their hairstyle. The CROWN Act was passed to challenge the idea that Black people must emulate other hairstyles to be accepted in public and educational spaces. As of 2023, 24 states have passed the CROWN Act. July 3 is recognized as National CROWN Day, also called Black Hair Independence Day.\nThe Perception Institute conducted a \"Good Hair Study\" using images of Black women wearing natural styles in locs, afros, twists, and other Black hairstyles. The Perception Institute is \"a consortium of researchers, advocates and strategists\" that uses psychological and emotional test studies to make participants aware of their racial biases. A Black-owned hair supply company, Shea Moisture, partnered with Perception Institute to conduct the study. The tests were done to reduce hair- and racially-based discrimination in education, civil justice, and law enforcement places. The study used an implicit-association test on 4,000 participants of all racial backgrounds and showed most of the participants had negative views about natural Black hairstyles. The study also showed Millennials were the most accepting of kinky hair texture on Black people. \"Noliwe Rooks, a Cornell University professor who writes about the intersection of beauty and race, says for some reason, natural Black hair just frightens some White people.\"\nIn September 2016, a lawsuit was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the company Catastrophe Management Solutions located in Mobile, Alabama. The court case ended with the decision that it was not a discriminatory practice for the company to refuse to hire an African American because they wore dreadlocks.\nIn some Texas public schools, dreadlocks are prohibited, especially for male students, because long braided hair is considered unmasculine according to Western standards of masculinity which define masculinity as \"short, tidy hair.\" Black and Native American boys are stereotyped and receive negative treatment and negative labeling for wearing dreadlocks, cornrows, and long braids. Non-white students are prohibited from practicing their traditional hairstyles that are a part of their culture.\nIn 2017, the United States Army lifted the ban on dreadlocks. In the army, Black women can now wear braids and locs under the condition that they are groomed, clean, and meet the length requirements. From slavery into the present day, the policing of Black women's hair continues to be controlled by some institutions and people. Even when Black women wear locs and they are clean and well-kept, some people do not consider locs to be feminine and professional because of the natural kinky texture of Black hair.\n\n\nPolice profiling in the United States\nAccording to a 2011 article from The New Republic, Black men who wear locs are racially profiled and watched more by the police and are believed to be \"thugs\" or involved in gangs and violent crimes than Black men who do not wear dreadlocks.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSome Black students in England are prohibited from wearing natural hairstyles such as dreadlocks, afros, braids and twists. Black students are suspended from school, are stereotyped, and receive negative treatment from teachers. In 2022 the Equality and Human Rights Commission issued guidance that such policies which had no exceptions on racial grounds were \"likely to be unlawful\".\n\n\nAfrica\nIn Midrand, north of Johannesburg in South Africa, a Black girl was kicked out of school for wearing her hair in a natural dreadlock style . Hair and dreadlock discrimination is experienced by people of color all over the world who do not conform to Western standards of beauty. At Pretoria High School for Girls in Gauteng province in South Africa, Black girls are discriminated against for wearing African hairstyles and are forced to straighten their hair.\nFour African countries approved the wearing of dreadlocks in their courts: Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. However, hairism continues despite the approval. Although locked hairstyles are a traditional practice on the African continent, some Africans disapprove of the hairstyle because of cultural taboos or pressure from Europeans in African schools and local African governments to conform to Eurocentric standards of beauty.\n\n\nGuinness Book of World Records\nOn 10 December 2010, the Guinness Book of World Records rested its \"longest dreadlocks\" category after investigating its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, with this official statement:\n\nFollowing a review of our guidelines for the longest dreadlock, we have taken expert advice and made the decision to rest this category. The reason for this is that it is difficult, and in many cases impossible, to measure the authenticity of the locks due to expert methods employed in the attachment of hair extensions/re-attachment of broken-off dreadlocks. Effectively the dreadlock can become an extension and therefore impossible to adjudicate accurately. It is for this reason Guinness World Records has decided to rest the category and will no longer be monitoring the category for longest dreadlock.\n\n\nSee also\nList of hairstyles\nProtective hairstyle\nBraids\nBox braids\nElflock\nCornrows\nFrench braid\nPolish plait\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nHaas; Toppe; Henz (2005). \"Hairstyles in the Arts of Greek and Roman Antiquity\".

    "text": "Alpheus Starkey Williams (September 20, 1810 – December 21, 1878) was a lawyer, judge, journalist, U.S. congressman, and a Union general in the American Civil War.\n\n\nEarly life\nWilliams was born in Deep River, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale University with a law degree in 1831. His father, who died when Williams was eight years old, had left him a sizable inheritance, which he used between 1832 and 1836 for extensive travel in the United States and Europe. Upon his return, he settled in Detroit, Michigan, which was a booming frontier town in 1836. He established himself as a lawyer and married the daughter of a prominent family, Jane Hereford Larned, with whom he produced five children, two of whom died as infants. Jane herself died young as well, in 1848, at the age of 30.\nWilliams had a variety of careers in Detroit. He was elected probate judge of Wayne County, Michigan; in 1842, president of the Bank of St. Clair; in 1843, the owner and editor of the Detroit Advertiser daily newspaper; from 1849 to 1853, postmaster of Detroit.\nWhen Williams arrived in Detroit in 1836, he joined a company in the Michigan Militia and maintained a connection to the military activities of the city for years. In 1847, he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 1st Michigan Infantry destined for the Mexican–American War, but it arrived too late to see any action. He also served as the president of the state's military board and in 1859 was a major in the Detroit Light Guard.\n\n\nCivil War\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Williams was involved in training the first army volunteers in Michigan. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on May 17, 1861. His first assignment after leaving the training camps was as a brigade commander in Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks's division of the Army of the Potomac, from October 1861 to March 1862. He then assumed division command in the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, as of March 13, 1862. This division was transferred to the Department of the Shenandoah from April to June of that year. Williams and Banks were sent to fight Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley and were thoroughly outmaneuvered, allowing Jackson to bottle them up in the Valley with his much smaller force.\nOn June 26, Williams's division was transferred to the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, for the Northern Virginia Campaign. In the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Banks's Corps was again up against Jackson, and was again defeated. The corps was at Bristoe Station and did not participate in the Second Battle of Bull Run.\nWilliams's division rejoined the Army of the Potomac as the 1st Division of the XII Corps and marched north in the Maryland Campaign to the Battle of Antietam. On the way, troops from the division found the famous Confederate \"lost dispatch,\" Special Order 191, that revealed Gen. Robert E. Lee's plan for the campaign and gave Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan key insights on how to defeat Lee's divided army. The division was heavily engaged at Sharpsburg, once again up against Jackson on the Confederate left flank. The corps commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield, was killed early at Antietam, and Williams assumed temporary command. The corps suffered 25% casualties in assaulting Jackson, and Brig. Gen. George S. Greene's division was forced to withdraw from its advanced position at the Dunker Church. George McClellan assigned Maj. Gen Henry Slocum permanent command of the XII Corps after the battle.\nWilliams's division missed the next major battle for the Army of the Potomac, the Battle of Fredericksburg, because it was engaged in defending the Potomac River in the Reserve. In the Battle of Chancellorsville, on May 2, 1863, Stonewall Jackson's corps executed a surprise flanking movement and smashed into the right flank of the Army of the Potomac, severely damaging the unsuspecting XI Corps. The neighboring division, under Williams, entrenched hastily and was able to stop the Confederate advance before it overran the entire army, but it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process.\nIn the Battle of Gettysburg, Williams's division arrived on the battlefield late in the afternoon of July 1, 1863, and occupied Benner's Hill, east of the town of Gettysburg. On July 2, the XII Corps took up positions on Culp's Hill, the right flank of the Union line. At this point, due to a command misunderstanding, Henry Slocum believed that he was in command of the \"Right Wing\" of the army, consisting of the XI and XII Corps. Therefore, Williams assumed temporary command of the XII Corps and controlled it for the rest of the battle. Brig. Gen. Thomas Ruger took command of Williams' division.\nOn the afternoon of July 2, a massive attack by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet on the Union's left flank caused army commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade to order Williams to transfer his entire corps to reinforce the left, in the vicinity of Little Round Top. Williams convinced Meade of the importance of Culp's Hill and managed to retain one brigade, under Greene, in their defensive positions. In an heroic defense, Greene and his brigade withstood the assault of Maj. Gen. Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson's Confederate division (the \"Stonewall Division\") throughout the night, until the remaining brigades of the XII Corps returned. Early on July 3, Williams launched an attack against the Confederates who had occupied some of the entrenchments on the hill and, after a seven-hour battle, regained his original line. Unfortunately for Williams, General Slocum was late in writing his official report of the battle, and Meade submitted his report for the army without acknowledging the critical contributions that Williams and XII Corps made to the Union defense.\n\nIn September 1863, the Union army in Tennessee was defeated at the Battle of Chickamauga and two corps were sent west to help them as they were besieged in Chattanooga—the XI and XII Corps. (They later were combined due to their small sizes into a new XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland.) Williams' division did not reach Chattanooga, but guarded railroads in eastern Tennessee. However, it did join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman as part of XX Corps in the Atlanta campaign and fought with distinction in a number of battles, particularly the Battle of Resaca. Williams was wounded in the arm at the Battle of New Hope Church on May 26, 1864. His division followed Sherman through his March to the Sea and the Carolinas campaign. In these campaigns Williams led XX Corps until, following the Battle of Bentonville, Joseph A. Mower was given command. Williams resumed leading his division. During this period, Williams received a brevet promotion to major general on January 12, 1865.\nWilliams held the distinction of being the longest-serving division commander in the Union army, having led his division continually from March 13, 1862 until the end of the war barring temporary absences and corps command. He led his division in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington D.C. in May 1865. Despite his seniority and long record of dependable service over three years, Williams was inexplicably never promoted—he remained at the rank of brigadier general despite commanding a division, which was supposed to be led by a major general, nor did he get permanent command of a corps.\n\n\nHorses\nThroughout much of the war, Williams had two horses – Yorkshire and Plug Ugly. Because Yorkshire was more showy, Williams often preferred the larger Plug Ugly for more grueling duty. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, a Confederate shell landed in the thick mud underneath Plug Ugly. The subsequent explosion sent both horse and rider into the air. Remarkably, Williams was uninjured, and the horse escaped with a few minor injuries. Plug Ugly eventually became too worn for further use, and in 1864, Williams sold him for $50. Williams learned that the horse died not long after the sale.\n\n\nPostbellum\nAfter the war, Williams served as a military administrator in southern Arkansas until he left the service on January 15, 1866. He returned to Michigan, but faced financial difficulties that forced him to take a post as the U.S. Minister at San Salvador, a position in which he served until 1869. He ran for governor of Michigan in 1870, but was not elected.\nWilliams was elected as a Democrat to the 45th United States Congress from Michigan's 1st congressional district, serving from March 4, 1875, to December 21, 1878. For part of his time in congress he served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia.\nWilliams suffered a stroke on December 21, 1878, and died in the U.S. Capitol Building. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.\n\n\nLegacy\nWilliams was a general who never received much public recognition. Despite fighting in important commands, he remained a brigadier general throughout most of the war. There were three reasons likely for the situation: first, he was not a West Point graduate, and the \"old boys network\" was as effective in the 19th century as it is today; second, during the formative months of the Army of the Potomac, Williams was stationed in the Shenandoah Valley, which denied him familiarity to the high command when reputations were being established; third, Williams was never comfortable mastering the common practice of promoting himself to the public with the help of friendly newspaper correspondents. Williams did, however, communicate well with his family, and the letters he wrote throughout the war were saved and published posthumously in 1959 as the well-regarded book, From the Cannon's Mouth: The Civil War Letters of General Alpheus S. Williams.\n\n\nHonors\nAn equestrian memorial to Williams by sculptor Henry Shrady stands in Belle Isle Park, in his home town of Detroit. Williams Avenue in the Gettysburg National Military Park is named for him.\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of American Civil War generals (Union)\nList of members of the United States Congress who died in office (1790–1899)\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBoileau, Lowell.

    "text": "Paul G. Fredricks (July 14, 1918 – July 4, 2010) was an American brass musician of the Big Bands Era of the 1930s and 1940s. He is known for his unique skills as a trumpeter and left his mark on a range of larger bands such as the orchestras of Alvino Rey, Charlie Spivak, Les Brown's Band of Renown, and Mel Torme's Mel-Tones, in the jazz music scene of the period surrounding World War II \n. He later ventured off with his own New Orleans-style Dixieland jazz band The Paul Fredricks Orchestra, later The Crescent City Stompers. He was featured in some Hollywood films including A. Edward Sutherland and RKO Pictures' Sing Your Worries Away (1942), starring Buddy Ebsen, Patsy Kelly and Bert Lahr.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nFredricks' grandparents were members of the German migration to the States in the 19th century. Raised near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he received his first trumpet as a gift from his parents at the age of nine. He developed his skills playing on his own and in several local bands as a young boy until he left home at 16 to pursue his dreams in New York City's music scene of the time.\nThroughout his eight decades as a professional musician, he cultivated a versatile career and recognized musical style. Fredricks began his professional music career in New York City at the age of 16 playing gigs at the Lincoln Hotel in New York City and the Rustic Cabin in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, a launch pad of Frank Sinatra. He continued playing with big bands before and after the war, during which he voluntarily entered to serve in the United States Army in the Asia-Pacific Arena. In the years surrounding the war, he toured across the country and was featured in shows in Hollywood, California; The Roseland Ballroom, The Paramount Theater and The Palladium/Academy of Music in New York. In 1941, after Alvino Rey's group played at New York's Paramount Theater, which led to greater exposure, they became one of the most popular acts in the country, recording top ten hits and making appearances in Hollywood films including A. Edward Sutherland and RKO Pictures' Sing Your Worries Away (1942), and others. Rey re-organized the orchestra, expanding the brass section including Paul Fredricks.\n\n\nWWII and Beyond\nFredricks served in the U.S. Army and toured the Asia-Pacific Arena serving his country in a number of roles. After the war, Fredricks was scouted by Charlie Spivak and played with his orchestra between 1946 and 1948. Paul retired from work with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra to start his own New Orlean's style jazz band The Paul Fredricks Orchestra, later The Crescent City Stompers, for which he led tours for many years to come.\n\n\nPersonal life\nFredricks met and married his wife of 57 years, Austrian beauty Theresa Elnicky. Although Spivak approached him to contribute to the brass section of his orchestra while he was still in the service, Fredricks completed his duty before Theresa joined him on tour in 1947. The couple toured together for years to come including with Spivak and his own band The Crescent City Stompers (formerly The Paul Fredricks Orchestra) Theresa herself turned down opportunities to pursue a Hollywood career in order to focus on her marriage and three children with a home base near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His granddaughter is a fashion model and humanitarian Kate Gibbs.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\nItalian Style Feature\nThe Big Band Almanac\nCrescent City Stompers on YouTube",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=78704204",
    "text": "The Barbudan independence movement is a political movement that seeks the independence of Barbuda from Antigua. Proponents state that Barbudan independence would allow Barbudans to exercise their right to self-determination, especially after the start of the Barbuda land crisis, while opponents state that this movement would set a precedent for other small islands in the region to secede, and would deprive Antigua of critical resources.\n\n\nOverview\nThe goal of the movement is to make Barbuda an independent state. Currently, Barbuda has a degree of autonomy under the Barbuda Council, that has certain local government functions protected by the Barbuda Local Government Act and the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda. As the constitution explicitly states that Barbuda is integral territory of the country, a constitutional amendment with a nationwide referendum would be required to permit independence. Throughout its history, the Barbudan independence movement has been an opposing force to the Labour Party, while the United Progressive Party is in favour of a form of Barbudan federalism, similar to the system in St. Kitts and Nevis. While the movement emerged relatively recently, Barbuda has sought separation from Antigua for hundreds of years, especially preceding the union of Antigua and Barbuda on 1 August 1860, when the Codrington family wished to have maintain near-total control of the island.\n\n\nEarly history\nThe Barbudan independence movement first emerged in the late 1960s during the time of the Antigua Constitutional Conference, which established the Associated State of Antigua, one of the West Indies Associated States. The West Indies Associated States were granted near full internal autonomy, and had the right to secede from the United Kingdom at any time, their intended purpose. In December 1967, a Barbudan delegation led by Sir McChesney George went to London to propose the establishment of a separate associated state. Because of similar and more violent events occurring in Anguilla at the time, the V. C. Bird government sent additional police attachments to the island; however, as he viewed his own forces as sufficient, he did not request British external aid. The Barbudan independence movement was supported by the socialist Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement.\n\n\nModern history\nOn 3 November 1981, two days after the independence of Antigua and Barbuda, a protest led by Sir Hilbourne Frank marched through the streets of Codrington, where he claimed that 75% of people on the island supported Barbudan secession. On 31 August 2020, a letter written by the secretary of the Barbuda Council Paul Nedd to cabinet secretary Konata Lee stated that the Barbuda Council wished to secede from Antigua. When the resolution was laid before the House of Representatives, it did not succeed due to both the United Progressive Party and the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party opposing it. The Labour Party prime minister Gaston Browne stated that the actions of the council were \"treasonous\". In order for Barbuda to secede, it would have required a nationwide constitutional referendum and approval from both houses of parliament. After the failure of the resolution, the Barbuda Council accused Antiguans of politicising the issue, and on 30 September it was said that the Cabinet never gave an official response. In 2024, Barbuda Council chairperson Devon Warner stated that all of the members of the Barbuda Council were still in support of secession. As of December 2024, all members of the Barbuda Council are a part of the pro-independence Barbuda People's Movement.\n\n\nSee also\nFederalism in Antigua and Barbuda\nBarbuda Local Government Act\nLocal government in Antigua and Barbuda\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "The Barbudan independence movement is a political movement that seeks the independence of Barbuda from Antigua. Proponents state that Barbudan independence would allow Barbudans to exercise their right to self-determination, especially after the start of the Barbuda land crisis, while opponents state that this movement would set a precedent for other small islands in the region to secede, and would deprive Antigua of critical resources.",

    "text": "David Sidney George Lewiston (11 May 1929 – 29 May 2017) was a London-born collector of the world's traditional music. He is best known for his recordings initially released on LP on the Explorer Series of Nonesuch Records beginning in 1967.\n\n\nBiography\nHe earned a graduate degree in 1953 from Trinity College of Music in London, where he studied piano, conducting, orchestration, harmony, and counterpoint. He later studied composition in New York City with Thomas de Hartmann, who had been a devotee of G. I. Gurdjieff. For more than a decade he served as one of the musicians at the Gurdjieff Foundation, New York. Finding it difficult to make a living as a musician he worked as a journalist for more than a decade but abandoned it to return to music, travelling widely to record traditional music.\nHis first recordings were made in Bali in 1966, and the initial album from these recordings, Music from the Morning of the World, was released in 1967. He has made extensive recordings of Tibetan Buddhist rituals, most notably of the chordal chanting of Gyuto Tantric University (one of the great colleges of the Gelugpa, the Established Church of Tibetan Buddhism), and the Drukpa Kagyu rituals of Khampagar Gompa, as well as music from many other countries, including Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala and Mexico, India, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Lahul, Himachal Pradesh in India's West Himalaya, Gilgit and Hunza in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province, Darjeeling and Sikkim in the East Himalaya, the Republic of Georgia, and Morocco.\nHis recordings of the '60s and '70s were made at a significant juncture, when lightweight portable recording equipment had matured sufficiently to allow excellent recordings to be made in remote places, and just before the traditional music of these places suffered the ravages of globalisation.\nHe lived in Maui, Hawaii, where he was working on archiving his recordings and other materials collected during his life's work.

    "text": "The Pan-European Institute (PEI) (Finnish Pan-Eurooppa Instituutti) is a Finnish research institute operating at Turku School of Economics (TSE), which is part of the University of Turku. PEI focuses on the research and observation of the economic and social development, particularly in the Baltic Sea region economies and in the EU’s eastern neighbouring countries.\n\n\nOrganisation\nIn terms of administration, PEI is part of the department of marketing and international business at Turku School of Economics. The institute employs about 10 researchers, most of whom work with project-based funding. The director of the unit is Professor Kari Liuhto from Turku School of Economics.\nThe operation of the Pan-European Institute is supported by an advisory body, which is composed of the chair and 10 members. In May 2020, the institute's advisory body consisted of:\nChair:\nJuhani Wihanto, CEO, Wihanto Group\nMembers:\n\nMatti Anttonen, Permanent State Secretary, Ministry for Foreign Affairs\nErik Helin, CEO, Spectra\nMikko Ketonen, chairman of the board (emeritus), TS-Yhtymä Oy\nUrpo Kivikari, professor (emeritus), Turku School of Economics\nHenrik Lax, MEP 2004-2009\nPaula Lehtomäki, secretary general, Nordic Council of Ministers\nMaarit Lindström, director, chief economist, Finnish Forest Industries Federation\nOlli Pohjanvirta, chairman of the board of directors, Nurminen Logistics\nAleksi Randell, director general, Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries\nSeppo Remes, professor of practice, Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology\n\n\nHistory\nPEI started its operations based on a private initiative and fund-raising in the autumn of 1987. At first, the unit operated under the name the Institute for East-West Trade.\nIn its research and education, the Institute for East-West Trade focused on the socialist economies in Europe and the Soviet Union of the time. Since the establishment of the unit, Baltic Sea region economies were also included among its key subjects of research and education. The first lectures on the topic were held in the academic year 1986–1987, when the unit also launched its research activities.\nSoon after the establishment of the Institute for East-West Trade, the European Institute was created. The merger of the two units began to seem sensible after the era of socialism was consigned to history in Europe. The Institute for East-West Trade and the European Institute merged into the Pan-European Institute at the end of the 1990s.\nIn 1987–2003, Professor Urpo Kivikari acted as the director of the unit. After Professor Kivikari retired, in autumn 2003 Professor Kari Liuhto was invited from Lappeenranta University of Technology to head the Pan-European Institute.\nIn 2015, the Pan-European Institute was awarded the Europe Award by the European Foundation (currently part of the Turku University Foundation).\nThe Pan-European Institute celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017 by organising a seminar called “Russian enigma – Decoding mysteries and turning them into business opportunities”.\n\n\nResearch\nDuring more than three decades, PEI has conducted dozens of commissioned studies, funded by, for example, the European Union, the Prime Minister's Office, the Finnish ministries and the Academy of Finland. In addition to research, experts of the Pan-European Institute have been involved in the development of the economic systems of several former Soviet republics. As an example, Professor Kari Liuhto's participated in designing the Strategy 2020 for the Russian Government.\nPEI has been engaged in close research cooperation with the Centrum Balticum Foundation since autumn 2011, when Professor Liuhto began as the foundation's part-time director.\nIn its research, the Pan-European Institute focuses on the following five themes:\n\nEconomic and business development in the Baltic Sea region economies (focusing on the development of the maritime cluster)\nEconomic relations between the EU and Russia\nFlow of foreign direct investments to and from Russia\nSocio-economic development in Europe and its neighbourhood\nBusiness development in the EU and in its eastern neighbouring countries.\nIn the following, some examples of PEI research projects:\n\nKAPPAS – Trade policy experts and know-how to Finland (2019–2022): The purpose of the project is to increase trade policy education in Finland, to organise business training related to the topic and to produce scientific research on the current state and future development of trade policy. The project is funded by the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers Foundation.\nECOPRODIGI (2017–2020): The aim of the project was to increase eco-efficiency of the maritime industry in the Baltic Sea region with the solutions provided by digitalisation. This EU-funded cooperation project involved 21 partners from five different Baltic Sea countries. PEI acted as the main coordinator of the project.\nDigiPro (2016–2018): During the project, proactive project management solutions were developed for business use. The stakeholders in the project were Turku School of Economics, Lappeenranta University of Technology and four Finnish SMEs.\nMNEmerge (2014–2016): This EU-funded project explored the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in addressing global development challenges. The project included field research in Brazil, Ghana and India. The project studied such matters as what kind of socio-economic impacts the activities of multinational enterprises have in developing countries and how cooperation between companies and decision-makers could be strengthened to promote responsible business.\nRussia's final energy frontier – Sustainability challenges of the Russian Far North (2014–2016): The project examined how energy policy is shaped in Russian Far North through interaction between internal factors, international companies and international politics. The project also examined what kind of a role the socio-economic development of local communities and the environmental responsibility play in the policy. The project was implemented in cooperation with the University of Helsinki and a Japanese research group.\nSmartComp (2012–2013): The EU-funded project analysed the current situation of the maritime cluster in the Baltic Sea region and its prospects in Latvia, Finland and Estonia.\nThe international dimension of the Russian innovation ecosystem (2011–2014): The main objective of the research project was to examine the use of international connections and networks and their impact on the Russian innovation system.\nWider Europe – Regional Security Report (2010–2011): The Pan-European Institute followed the security developments in Eastern Central Europe, South Caucasus and Central Asia. The reports were part of the Security and Development Research within the Wider Europe Initiative Security Cluster, which was funded by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the framework of development cooperation.\n\n\nTeaching and education\nThe research carried out by PEI creates foundations for the teaching and education provided by the unit at Turku School of Economics. PEI offers three courses with lectures, which are part of the teaching on offer in the subject of international business:\n\nBusiness in the Baltic Sea Region: The course discusses the development of the Baltic Sea economic area and the business environment of the region. The lectures are given in English.\nDoing Business in Wider Europe: The course explores business in a Wider Europe, or Europe and its neighbourhood. The course is in English.\nTrade Policy and International Business: This course taught in Finnish deals with the transformation of trade policy and its impacts on business activities\n\n\nActivating discussion in the Baltic Sea region\nSince 2004, PEI has been publishing a review focusing on the Baltic Sea region, called the “Baltic Rim Economies”. The distribution list covers tens of thousands of readers in over 80 countries. Some 3,000 experts have contributed articles to the magazine, including EU Commissioners (e.g. Jean-Claude Juncker, José Manuel Barroso), ministers, diplomats, mayors, businessmen, journalists and representatives of the world of research. The review can be subscribed free of charge. You can register on the review's distribution list on Baltic Rim Economies home page.\n\n\nReferences\n\nThe Pan-European Institute's website\nBaltic Rim Economies",

The area is also within the Kōyasan Chōishi-michi Tamagawa Prefectural Park (高野山町石道玉川峡県立自然公園).\n\n\nRoute\nThe Kōyasan chōishi-michi is claimed to be the route created by Kūkai when he first established Kongōbu-ji in 819 AD. The name of the route comes from a series of stone guideposts shaped in the form of a stupa with a height of three meters, located at distances of one chō apart, or approximately every 109 meters. A total of 216 of these stone guideposts were placed. Of these, 180 were on the 22 kilometer path from Jison-in to the Danjō Garan, and  a further 36 were erected on the  further four kilometres to Kūkai's mausoleum in Okunoin Cemetery. In addition, there are four additional markers, one for every 36 chō (corresponding to one ri).\n\n\nHistory\nThe guideposts were originally wooden, and had to be frequently replaced due to exposure to the elements. During the Kamakura period, a priest of Mount Kōya obtained donations from the Imperial Family and a number of leading warlords, and began replacing these wooden markers with granite five-tiered stupas over a 20 year period, with the project completed in 1285.  They are engraved with their number in the sequence from Danjō Garan, as well as the seed syllable of one of the divinities in the Taizōkai Mandala, for the first 180, or the Kongōkai Mandala, for the remainder, along with the name of the donor, the date, and the votive purpose of the donor.

It is named after the town of Kanaighat, which is also the only municipality in the Upazila.\n\n\nEtymology\nThere are two theories regarding the naming of Kanaighat. The word ghat in the Bengali language refers to a flight of steps leading down to a river. The Kanaighat Bazar, which the Kanaighat Upazila is named after, sits on the banks of the Surma River. The most popular theory is that there was a boatman (majhi) by the name of Kanai who lived here. Others suggest that it was named after Kanai Chowdhury of Mulagul, who was a powerful courtier in the Jaintia royal court.\n\n\nHistory\nKanaighat was formerly under the rule of the Jaintia Kingdom. The British conquered the Jaintia Kingdom on 16 March 1835, finally incorporating its lowland areas into the Sylhet District after 90 years. As a result, the Muslims of Sylhet found the opportunity to start settling in sparsely populated Kanaighat. In order to maintain peace and discipline, the British colonials established a thana (police stationa and administrative headquarters) atop the Jhorna Tila in Lakshipur Mauza of Mulagul Pargana in 1841. The headquarters was moved to Kanaighat Bazar/Sadar in 1880. Establishments of middle schools, madrasas and mosques from 1905 marked the start of an intellectual awakening in Kanaighat, which had a reputation of ignorance due to its long time in the Jaintia Kingdom.\nOn 23 March 1922, the Kanaighat Islamia Madrasa set to host their annual jalsa (presided by Ibrahim Ali Tashna) but the British Raj had outlawed it and declared Section 144 throughout Kanaighat. Tashna and his committee were not fussed by the ban and subsequently violated Section 144 by continuing the jalsa. J. E. Webster, the Commissioner of Surma Valley, sent a police force to the jalsa at 12pm, who began shooting at the masses. The armed British were able to conduct a swift victory, by shooting down six people dead and injuring 38 others. The six Kanaighatis killed were: Maulvi Abd as-Salam, Muhammad Musa Mia, Abdul Majid, Haji Azizur Rahman and Yasin Mia. The British established a thana (police station and administrative headquarters) in Kanaighat in 1932.\nThe Kanaighat Community Club was founded in 1961. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, the Pakistani Army teamed up with Razakars to do a mass killing in Maligram and Gouripur. A memorial was built in Momtazganj. On 4 September 1971, freedom fighter Khwaja Nizamuddin Bhuyan of Comilla fought against the Pakistan Army in Kanaighat for 10 hours. Martyred in Atgram Road, he was laid to rest at Mokimtila. Liaquat Ali Khan (Bir Uttom) of Bagerhat fought and was martyred in Kanaighat's Gouripur in November 1971. Kanaighat was liberated on 4 December 1971 following Pakistani surrender.\nOn 24 March 1983, the President of Bangladesh, H M Ershad, upgraded Kanaighat's thana status to an upazila as a part of his decentralisation programme. This improved the socio-economic conditions of Kanaighat. The Islamic Library and Public Welfare Association was founded in Mukiganj Bazar (Jhingabari UP) in 1988.The largest Social Organisation কানাইঘাট উপজেলা সমাজ কল্যাণ পরিষদ  Established at 2012 by Ahmed Masum\n\n\nGeography\n\nKanaighat is located at 25.0166°N 92.2472°E﻿ / 25.0166; 92.2472 and has a total area of 391.79 km2.

    "text": "Balloonfest '86 was a fundraising event in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, held on September 27, 1986, in which the local chapter of United Way set a world record by releasing almost 1.5 million balloons.\nThe event was intended to be a harmless publicity stunt. However, the released balloons drifted back over the city and Lake Erie and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. \nIn consequence, the organizers faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages, and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.\nThe event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.\n\n\nPreparations\n\nBalloonfest '86 was coordinated by a Los Angeles-based company headed by Treb Heining, Balloonart by Treb, which spent six months preparing for the event. A rectangular structure the size of a city block was set up to hold the balloons on the southwest quadrant of Cleveland's Public Square. It measured 250 by 150 feet (76 by 46 m), was three stories high and was covered with a one-piece net of woven mesh material. Inside, 2,500 volunteers, consisting largely of high school students, spent many hours filling the balloons with helium. One described the preparations as \"like an assembly line, non-stop.\" Volunteers received free T-shirts.\nUnited Way originally planned to release two million balloons, but eventually stopped at over 1.4 million. Children sold sponsorships to benefit United Way at the price of $1 ($2.87 in 2024) for every two balloons.\n\n\nLaunch\nOn Saturday, September 27, 1986, with a rainstorm approaching, organizers decided on an early release of the balloons at about 1:50 p.m. EDT. A crowd of over 100,000 gathered in downtown Cleveland for the event. Close to 1.5 million balloons rose up from Public Square, surrounding Terminal Tower and surpassing a world record set the previous year on the 30th anniversary of Disneyland.\n\n\nConsequences\nTypically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be almost fully deflated before it descends to Earth. However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain, which caused them to drop towards the ground while still inflated. The descending balloons clogged the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie, causing water pollution. Some people had misconceptions about the environmental impact of balloon releases, thinking that \"the balloons would reach an altitude where they popped and disintegrated.\"\nBurke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there. Traffic collisions were also reported \"as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle.\"\nTwo fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer (also reported as Skip Sullivan by some publications), who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the balloons landing in the lake. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake.  On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million, and later settled on undisclosed terms. Roger Rice, Search and Rescue Program Manager for Coast Guard District 9, said in a 2024 interview that \"Balloonfest did not have anything to do with the unfortunate deaths of both these men\". \nBalloons landing on a pasture in Geauga County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.\nThe fundraiser lost money due to cost overruns.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe 1988 edition of The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the event as a world record \"largest ever mass balloon release\", with 1,429,643 balloons launched. Guinness no longer measures balloon releases.\nBalloonfest '86 was the subject of the 2017 short documentary film Balloonfest. The editor of Cleveland newspaper The Plain Dealer notes that after its release, reporting on the Balloonfest became more negative.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nBalloonfest on Vimeo\n\"Cleveland Balloonfest '86\" on BBC\n\"The Doomed Cleveland Balloonfest of '86\" on YouTube\nThe Internet Lied To Us About BalloonFest 1986 on YouTube (May 25, 2024, documentary by Cleveland.com)\nOhio's 1986 Balloon Disaster on YouTube",

    "text": "The Battle of Megara was fought in 424 BC between Athens and Megara, an ally of Sparta. Whilst the Athenian forces were initially successful against the Peloponnesian garrison there, a hasty arrival of Spartan forces under Brasidas saw a stalemate and eventual victory of the oligarchic party within the city of Megara and the withdrawal of Athenian forces.\nMegara was in the country of Megarid, between central Greece and the Peloponnese. Megara, an ally of Sparta, consisted of farming villages, with flat plains and foothills, and hosted two harbors: Pagae (modern Alepochori-Corinthian Gulf) and Nisaia (Saronic Gulf), making it a prime focus of contention1.\n\n\nBackground\nAttica had been under siege by the Peloponnesian army led by the  Spartan king, Archidamus II. The area siege kept Athenians stuck in their city. However, with the Peloponnesian withdrawal, Athens began to attack. From as early as 431 BC, Megara was under consistent attack from Athens. During the first invasion, Athens brought 10,000 Athenians and numerous allies.\nAthens then set up a fort on Salamis, near Nisaia, and created shipping blockades. The blockades delayed imports of food and supplies to Megara. Megarians still had control of Pagae, but Megara was effectively isolated from the western food supplies. Unable to produce normal proportions of food, the situation in Megara began to become dire.\nUrged by the Megarian oligarchy in 429, the Peloponnesian fleet attacked the Athenian fort at Salamis. Unknown to the Peloponnesians, the attack was revealed to Athens by beacon lights. Athens dispatched a fleet from the Athenian port of Piraeus. The Peloponnesian attack was abandoned because the Megarian ships were in a state of disrepair.\nUnder the rule of the pro-Spartan and pro-Corinthian oligarchy, Megara lost the port city of Minoa to Athens in 427, was a contributing factor in more civil unrest. Megarian revolutions against the oligarchy began shortly after and Megara became democratic.\nThe oligarchy were exiled. Many exiles were permitted by Sparta to inhabit the Boeotian town of Plataea for a year2. Boeotia separated Megara and Athens with high mountains ranges in the north1. The Spartans were then able to prevent interactions between Megarian Democrats and Athenians on Minoa2.\nThe exiled Megarians in Plataea, began northern raids in Megarid and took Pagae. With oligarch sympathizers still in Megara, the oligarchs returned to Megara in 427\nBC, and democracy collapsed.\nIt is suspected that Athens prevented food supplies to gain control of Megara and prevent further invasions of Attica by the Peloponnesians. However, Athens' capture of Pylos in 425 detained the Peloponnesian army in Messenia, which lessened the importance of Megara to Athenians. Athens had also successfully trapped hundreds of Spartans on Sphacteria. The Spartans removed all military forces from Messina and arranged a truce. Ambassadors were sent to Athens without consulting Spartan allies. Athens had extensive demands, and Sparta requested a private discussion.\nSpartan allies were uneasy with the scenario. Megara had a distrust of the Spartans since the Revolution. Megarians feared that Sparta would turn over Nisaia to the Athenians. Meanwhile, within the walls of Megara, the Democrats planned to aid Athens in capturing the long walls of Nisaia. Athens then discredited the Spartan embassy because of its request for privacy and so the truce failed.\n\n\n'Battle' in practice\nDuring the night, Athenians and their allies approached Megara from Minoa and the road to Eleusis. The plan worked, and the Peloponnesian garrison was effectively isolated from the city. As morning came, Megarian Democrats pretended to be outraged by the captured walls. The Democrats encouraged Megarians to open the city gates and attack the Athenians and then decorated themselves with oil to be easily distinguished from other Megarians. At the crucial moment, the plot was uncovered by the Oligarchs, and the gate remained closed.\nAthens sensed the change of plan and attacked the Nisaia garrison. Spartans were taken as prisoners and the Peloponnesians were allowed to ransom themselves. The \nSpartan commander, Brasidas, appeared with an army larger than the Athenians. The two cavalries fought under the walls of Megara.\nThe oligarchs opened the gate to Brasidas and their allies. The Athenians declined to battle with the Peloponnesians. Over time, Brasidas and Athens both left the city. The Peloponnesian armies stayed. Rhetorically, Brasidas was able to employ the memory of Athenian hesitance in Megara to great effect during his remaining campaigns.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Goete, Hans Rupprecht.

Trouw received the European Newspaper Award in 2012. Cees van der Laan is the current editor-in-chief.\n\n\nHistory\nTrouw is a Dutch word meaning \"fidelity\", \"loyalty\", or \"allegiance\", and is cognate with the English adjective \"true\". The name was chosen to reflect allegiance and loyalty to God and country in spite of the German occupation of the Netherlands.\nTrouw was started during World War II by members of the Dutch Protestant resistance against the German occupation. Hundreds of people involved in the production and distribution of the newspaper were arrested and killed during the war. The newspaper was published irregularly during the war due to lack of paper. In 1944 the German forces tried to stop publication by rounding up and imprisoning some 23 of the couriers. They issued an ultimatum to the leaders of Trouw; however, the editors did not give in and all of the captured couriers were executed. Amongst the people that lost their life during the war due to their involvement with the newspaper was Trouw co-founder and resistance member Wim Speelman.\nAfter the war the paper became a daily, its allegiance to the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. By 1967, though, the paper's chief editor made it clear that Trouw was not to be considered a paper only for Christians: it wanted to be a paper for everyone. In the course of time the percentage of Trouw readers that belong to the Reformed churches shrank considerably: in 1965 69% of readers belonged to one of those churches, but by 1979 this had dropped to 48%, and by 1999 to 28%. In their own words, in 2005, they intended to \"remain a newspaper rooted in a Christian tradition and to be a source of contemplation and inspiration for everyone, churchgoer or not, who feels a need for moral and spiritual orientation.\"\nCirculation at the end of the 20th century was a little over 133,000. On 3 February 2005, Trouw changed its format from broadsheet to compact.\nCurrently, Trouw is a part of the De Persgroep Nederland, the name given to the former PCM group after the Belgian publishing house De Persgroep bought a majority stake in PCM in the summer of 2009.

    "text": "Path tracing is a rendering algorithm in computer graphics that simulates how light interacts with objects, voxels, and participating media to generate realistic (physically plausible) images.\nThis ray tracing technique uses the Monte Carlo method to accurately model global illumination, simulate different surface characteristics, and capture a wide range of effects observable in a camera system, such as optical properties of lenses (e.g., depth of field and bokeh) or the impact of shutter speed (e.g., motion blur and exposure). By incorporating physically accurate materials and light transport models, it can produce photorealistic results but requires significant computational power. Performance is often constrained by VRAM/RAM capacity and memory bandwidth, especially in complex scenes, necessitating denoising  techniques for practical use. Additionally, the Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) principle applies - inaccurate scene data, poor geometry, low-quality materials, or incorrect rendering settings can negatively impact the final output, regardless of rendering precision.\nDue to its accuracy, unbiased nature, and algorithmic simplicity, path tracing is commonly used to generate reference images when testing the quality of other rendering algorithms. Fundamentally, the algorithm works by integrating the light arriving at a point on an object’s surface, where this illuminance is then modified by a surface reflectance function (BRDF) to determine how much light contributes to the final image, as seen by the camera. This integration procedure is repeated for every pixel in the output image, ensuring detailed evaluation of each one. The number of samples per pixel (spp) determines the level of detail and quality of the final render, with more samples generally improving image clarity. Rendering performance is often measured in mega samples per second (Ms/sec), which reflects how many millions of samples can be processed per second, directly impacting rendering speed. Several variants of path tracing, such as bidirectional path tracing and Metropolis light transport, have been developed to improve efficiency in various types of scenes, reducing noise and speeding up convergence.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe rendering equation and its use in computer graphics was presented by James Kajiya in 1986.[1] Path tracing was introduced then as an algorithm to find a numerical solution to the integral of the rendering equation. A decade later, Lafortune suggested many refinements, including bidirectional path tracing.[2]\nMetropolis light transport, a method of perturbing previously found paths in order to increase performance for difficult scenes, was introduced in 1997 by Eric Veach and Leonidas J. Guibas.\nMore recently, CPUs and GPUs have become powerful enough to render images more quickly, causing more widespread interest in path tracing algorithms. Tim Purcell first presented a global illumination algorithm running on a GPU in 2002.[3] In February 2009, Austin Robison of Nvidia demonstrated the first commercial implementation of a path tracer running on a GPU,[4] and other implementations have followed, such as that of Vladimir Koylazov in August 2009.[5] This was aided by the maturing of GPGPU programming toolkits such as CUDA and OpenCL and GPU ray tracing SDKs such as OptiX.\nPath tracing has played an important role in the film industry. Earlier films had relied on scanline rendering to produce CG visual effects and animation. In 1998, Blue Sky Studios rendered the Academy Award-winning short film Bunny with their proprietary CGI Studio path tracing renderer, featuring soft shadows and indirect illumination effects. Sony Pictures Imageworks' Monster House was, in 2006, the first animated feature film to be rendered entirely in a path tracer, using the commercial Arnold renderer. Also, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been using its own optimized path tracer known as Hyperion ever since the production of Big Hero 6 in 2014.[6] Pixar Animation Studios has also adopted path tracing for its commercial RenderMan renderer.\n\n\nDescription\nKajiya's rendering equation adheres to three particular principles of optics; the Principle of Global Illumination, the Principle of Equivalence (reflected light is equivalent to emitted light), and the Principle of Direction (reflected light and scattered light have a direction).\nIn the real world, objects and surfaces are visible due to the fact that they are reflecting light. This reflected light then illuminates other objects in turn. From that simple observation, two principles follow.\nI. For a given indoor scene, every object in the room must contribute illumination to every other object.\nII. Second, there is no distinction to be made between illumination emitted from a light source and illumination reflected from a surface.\nInvented in 1984, a rather different method called radiosity was faithful to both principles. However, radiosity relates the total illuminance falling on a surface with a uniform luminance that leaves the surface. This forced all surfaces to be Lambertian, or \"perfectly diffuse\". While radiosity received a lot of attention at its introduction, perfectly diffuse surfaces do not exist in the real world. The realization that scattering from a surface depends on both incoming and outgoing directions is the key principle behind the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). This direction dependence was a focus of research resulting in the publication of important ideas throughout the 1990s, since accounting for direction always exacted a price of steep increases in calculation times on desktop computers. Principle III follows.\nIII. The illumination coming from surfaces must scatter in a particular direction that is some function of the incoming direction of the arriving illumination, and the outgoing direction being sampled.\nKajiya's equation is a complete summary of these three principles, and path tracing, which approximates a solution to the equation, remains faithful to them in its implementation. There are other principles of optics which are not the focus of Kajiya's equation, and therefore are often difficult or incorrectly simulated by the algorithm. Path tracing is confounded by optical phenomena not contained in the three principles. For example,\n\nBright, sharp caustics; radiance scales by the density of illuminance in space.\nSubsurface scattering; a violation of Principle III above.\nChromatic aberration, fluorescence, iridescence; light is a spectrum of frequencies.\n\n\nAlgorithm\nThe following pseudocode is a procedure for performing naive path tracing. The TracePath function calculates a single sample of a pixel, where only the Gathering Path is considered.\n\nAll the samples are then averaged to obtain the output color. Note this method of always sampling a random ray in the normal's hemisphere only works well for perfectly diffuse surfaces. For other materials, one generally has to use importance sampling, i.e. probabilistically select a new ray according to the BRDF's distribution. For instance, a perfectly specular (mirror) material would not work with the method above, as the probability of the new ray being the correct reflected ray – which is the only ray through which any radiance will be reflected – is zero. In these situations, one must divide the reflectance by the probability density function of the sampling scheme, as per Monte Carlo integration (in the naive case above, there is no particular sampling scheme, so the PDF turns out to be \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              2\n              π\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2\\pi }}}\n  \n).\nThere are other considerations to take into account to ensure conservation of energy. In particular, in the naive case, the reflectance of a diffuse BRDF must not exceed \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            π\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{\\pi }}}\n  \n or the object will reflect more light than it receives (this however depends on the sampling scheme used, and can be difficult to get right).\n\n\nBidirectional path tracing\nSampling the integral can be done by either of the following two distinct approaches:\n\nBackwards path tracing, where paths are generated starting from the camera and bouncing around the scene until they encounter a light source. This is referred to as \"backwards\" because starting paths from the camera and moving towards the light source is opposite the direction that the light is actually traveling. It still produces the same result because all optical systems are reversible.\nLight tracing (or forwards path tracing), where paths are generated starting from the light sources and bouncing around the scene until they encounter the camera.\nIn both cases, a technique called next event estimation can be used to reduce variance. This works by directly sampling an important feature (the camera in the case of light tracing, or a light source in the case of backwards path tracing) instead of waiting for a path to hit it by chance. This technique is usually effective, but becomes less useful when specular or near-specular BRDFs are present. For backwards path tracing, this creates high variance for caustic paths that interact with a diffuse surface, then bounce off a specular surface before hitting a light source. Next event estimation cannot be used to sample these paths directly from the diffuse surface, because the specular interaction is in the middle. Likewise, it cannot be used to sample paths from the specular surface because there is only one direction that the light can bounce. Light tracing has a similar issue when paths interact with a specular surface before hitting the camera. Because this situation is significantly more common, and noisy (or completely black) glass objects are very visually disruptive, backwards path tracing is the only method that is used for unidirectional path tracing in practice.\nBidirectional path tracing provides an algorithm that combines the two approaches and can produce lower variance than either method alone. For each sample, two paths are traced independently: one from the light source and one from the camera. This produces a set of possible sampling strategies, where every vertex of one path can be connected directly to every vertex of the other. The original light tracing and backwards path tracing algorithms are both special cases of these strategies. For light tracing, it is connecting the vertices of the camera path directly to the first vertex of the light path. For backwards path tracing, it is connecting the vertices of the light path to the first vertex of the camera path. In addition, there are several completely new sampling strategies, where intermediate vertices are connected. Weighting all of these sampling strategies using multiple importance sampling creates a new sampler that can converge faster than unidirectional path tracing, even though more work is required for each sample. This works particularly well for caustics or scenes that are lit primarily through indirect lighting.\n\n\nPerformance\n\nA path tracer continuously samples pixels of an image. The image starts to become recognizable after only a few samples per pixel, perhaps 100. However, for the image to \"converge\" and reduce noise to acceptable levels usually takes around 5000 samples for most images, and many more for pathological cases. Noise is particularly a problem for animations, giving them a normally unwanted \"film grain\" quality of random speckling.\nThe central performance bottleneck in path tracing is the complex geometrical calculation of casting a ray. Importance sampling is a technique which is motivated to cast fewer rays through the scene while still converging correctly to outgoing luminance on the surface point. This is done by casting more rays in directions in which the luminance would have been greater anyway. If the density of rays cast in certain directions matches the strength of contributions in those directions, the result is identical, but far fewer rays were actually cast. Importance sampling is used to match ray density to Lambert's cosine law, and also used to match BRDFs.\nMetropolis light transport can result in a lower-noise image with fewer samples. This algorithm was created in order to get faster convergence in scenes in which the light must pass through odd corridors or small holes in order to reach the part of the scene that the camera is viewing. It has also shown promise in correctly rendering pathological situations with caustics. Instead of generating random paths, new sampling paths are created as slight mutations of existing ones. In this sense, the algorithm \"remembers\" the successful paths from light sources to the camera.\n\n\nScattering distribution functions\n\nThe reflective properties (amount, direction, and color) of surfaces are modeled using BRDFs. The equivalent for transmitted light (light that goes through the object) are BSDFs. A path tracer can take full advantage of complex, carefully modeled or measured distribution functions, which controls the appearance (\"material\", \"texture\", or \"shading\" in computer graphics terms) of an object.\n\n\nSee also\nArnold (software)\nBlender (software) – 3D program that integrates Cycles, a path tracing GPU-accelerated rendering engine\nOctane Render\nPixar RenderMan\nLuxCoreRenderer\nVolumetric path tracing\n\n\nNotes\n\n^ Kajiya, J.

He lives and works in Berlin and New York.\n\n\nWork\nJankowski's work has been associated with New Gothic Art and compared with artists like Rirkrit Tiravanija, Gillian Wearing, and Pierre Huyghe. Using various media formats, the collaborative nature of his practice is paramount as each participant unwittingly contributes his or her own texture to the work.\nThe Hunt (1992), a performance video piece, is one of the artists earliest works. For one week the artist visited supermarkets and rather than select his goods as customary, he‘ hunted down’ his groceries, shooting each item with a children’s bow and arrow, accompanied by a friend with a video camera. For the 23-minute video Lycan Theorized (2006), Jankowski persuaded the cast and crew working in an actual straight-to-DVD werewolf movie (in which he had a bit part) to re-enact some of its most violent scenes while quoting the writings of various film theorists. The film Casting Jesus (2011) focuses on an audition to select an actor that best interprets the role of Jesus, judged by a jury of Vatican members.\nJankowski has also created a number of television interventions. His video installation Telemistica was included in the 1999 Venice Biennale, and shows five Italian television fortune-tellers responding to a phoned-in question about the artist's success or failure at the upcoming Biennale. The Holy Artwork (2001) is a collaboration with a televangelist pastor from Texas. In Discourse News, Senior Business Anchor Annika Pergament reports on Jankowski's definition of art from her newscaster’s desk at NY1.\nIn 2007, he presented The living sculptures, a project curated by Ferran Barenblit. Barcelona’s popular boulevard Las Ramblas is lined with street performers who mimic bronze sculptures by standing motionless, covered in metallic paint from head to toe, for the amusement – and spare change – of thousands of tourists. From the many, Jankowski selected three: personifications of Che Guevara, Julius Caesar, and the female figure in Salvador Dalí’s Anthropomorphic Chest of Drawers. Then, with the help of a foundry, the artist produced life-size bronze casts of the three figures – along with their soapbox plinths – and placed them at the same spots where he originally encountered them. The sculptures were installed later in London (Regent's Park), New York (Central Park) and other locations around the world.\nJankowski's installation Strip the Auctioneer (2009) consists of sculpture, photographs and a video connected to a live auction that was orchestrated by the artist in May 2009. The action takes place at Christie's auction house in Amsterdam and incorporates the auctioneer, Amo Verkade, as the desired possession. Verkade bids his garment piece by piece down to his hammer. He strips himself of his suit, baring and transforming those parcels of clothing into objects of desire.\n\n\nExhibitions\nJankowski's videos, films, and installations have been exhibited internationally in places such as Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis (2015); Sala de Arte Publico Siqueiros, Mexico City, Mexico (2012), Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome (2012), Nassauischer Kunstverein Wiesbaden (2009); Kunstmuseum Stuttgart (2008); Miami Art Museum, Miami (2007); List Visual Arts Center, Massachusetts (2005); Artpace, San Antonio (2001); and Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford (2000).

Roseman, was an American actor, who worked primarily during the silent film era.\n\n\nBiography\nThe son of a pharmacist, Roseman was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, christened Ernest Frederick Roseman. His father died of tuberculosis when he was seven years old so Edward and his two siblings, Jenny May and Henry, were raised in Terre Haute by his mother, Mary Lucinda. As a young adult, Roseman worked on a railroad before succumbing to the lure of vaudeville and traveling theater stock companies, including the Margaret Bird Stock Company and those founded by playwrights Lincoln J. Carter and Wright Lorimer.\nBetween 1913 and 1921, Roseman was a popular actor in silent films, appearing in about 50 motion pictures during that span. Following his success in the title role of the 1920 Fox Studios horror serial, Fantômas, Roseman usually was featured in a heavy role as a villain. Cast in a part which required him to play multiple personalities, Movie Weekly magazine referred to Roseman as \"The Master of Makeup.\" He was described as \"The Man of a Thousand Faces\" several years before Lon Chaney Sr. earned that moniker.\nAltogether, Roseman appeared in more than 60 silent films.

    "text": "The black-crowned antshrike  (Thamnophilus atrinucha) is a species of bird in subfamily Thamnophilinae of family Thamnophilidae, the \"typical antbirds\". It is found in every Central American country except El Salvador and in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.\n\n\nTaxonomy and systematics\nWhat is now the black-crowned antshrike was long included as a subspecies of Thamnophilus punctatus, which at that time was called the slaty antshrike. Following the results of a study published in 1997, the slaty antshrike was split into six species. The remnant T. punctatus was named the northern slaty antshrike and the new T. atrinucha was named the western slaty antshrike. By 2012 taxonomists determined that T. atrinucha was not closely related to other slaty antshrikes so its English name was changed to black-crowned antshrike and its position within a linear presentation of genus Thamnophilus was adjusted. The black-crowned and black-hooded antshrike (T. bridgesi) are sister species.\nThe black-crowned antshrike has two subspecies, the nominate T. a. atrinucha (Salvin & Godman, 1892) and T. a. gorgonae (Thayer & Bangs, 1905).\n\n\nDescription\nThe black-crowned antshrike is 14 to 15 cm (5.5 to 5.9 in) long and weighs 20 to 28.5 g (0.71 to 1.0 oz). Members of genus Thamnophilus are largish members of the antbird family; all have stout bills with a hook like those of true shrikes. This species exhibits significant sexual dimorphism. Adult males of the nominate subspecies have slaty gray upperparts with a gray forehead, a black crown and nape, a hidden white patch between their scapulars, and white-tipped black uppertail coverts. Their face is grizzled gray. Their wings are black with white tips on the coverts and white or gray edges on the flight feathers. Their tail is black with a white spot at the end of each feather. Their underparts, including the underside of their tail, are slaty gray. Adult females have brown to buffy brown upperparts. Their wings are fuscous-black with brown edges and white tips on the flight feathers. Their underparts are buffy brown to grayish brown. Both sexes have a brownish red to chocolate-brown iris and medium to dark gray legs and feet. Males have a dark gray bill and females light gray. Juveniles have dull cinnamon-brown upperparts and grayish white underparts. Males of subspecies T. a. gorgonae have more gray on their forehead and lighter gray underparts than the nominate. Females of gorgonae have a much darker crown, more rufous upperparts, and darker underparts than the nominate.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe nominate subspecies of the black-crowned antshrike has by far the larger range of the two. In Central America it is found on the Caribbean slope from southern Belize through Panama and on the Pacific slope in northwestern Costa Rica and in Panama from Coclé Province east. In South America it is found across northern Colombia including the Magdalena Valley and northwestern Venezuela as far as Trujillo state, and along the Pacific slope of Colombia and Ecuador into far northwestern Peru's Department of Tumbes. Subspecies T. a. gorgonae is found only on Gorgona Island of the southwestern coast of Colombia.\nThe black-crowned antshrike inhabits a variety of forested landscapes including primary and secondary semi-deciduous and evergreen forests. It favors the forest interior but does occur at its edges. It also favors the understorey to mid-storey but occurs all the way to the canopy. In elevation it ranges from sea level to 1,250 m (4,100 ft) in Central America, to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in Colombia, mostly below 1,100 m (3,600 ft) in Ecuador, and to 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in Venezuela. In Peru it occurs between 400 and 800 m (1,300 and 2,600 ft).\n\n\nBehavior\n\n\nMovement\nThe black-crowned antshrike is a year-round resident throughout its range.\n\n\nFeeding\nThe black-crowned antshrike feeds on a wide variety of insects and other arthropods, and has been observed capturing small lizards. It usually forages singly or in pairs and almost always joins mixed-species feeding flocks that pass through its territory. It usually forages in the understorey and mid-storey but has been observed feeding as high as 22 m (70 ft). It forages methodically, by gleaning prey while perched, with short upward sallies, while briefly hovering, by chasing in mid-air, and by flipping over leaves on the ground. It takes prey from live and dead leaves and palm fronds, branches, vines, spiderwebs, and moss. It sometimes follows the edges of army ant swarms in its territory.\n\n\nBreeding\nThe black-crowned antshrike's breeding season varies geographically and from year to year. The peak season generally is between April and July. The nest is a cup woven from fungal rhizomorphs, moss, and sometimes rootlets and spider silk, and is lined with rhizomorphs. It is suspended by the rim from a branch fork up to about 7 m (23 ft) above the ground but more commonly within \n2 m (7 ft) of it. The usual clutch size is two eggs and both parent incubate. The incubation period is 14 to 16 days and fledging occurs about 10 days after hatch. Both parents provision nestlings.\n\n\nVocalization\nThe black-crowned antshrike's most common song is \"a series of uh notes ending with a single erk at a higher pitch\". Both sexes sing, commonly in the morning but at any time of day. The song has been written as \"wur wur wur-wur-wur-wur'wur'wur'wur; AH\" and \"anhanhanhanhanhanhanhanhanhánh\". Its calls include \"a 1–4-note (usually 2) caw arr-arr and a bark-rattle: arr-grr'r'r'r\".\n\n\nStatus\nThe IUCN has assessed the black-crowned antshrike as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range, and though its population size is not known it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered fairly common to common across its range. \"This species appears resilient, maintaining populations in forests where other understory insectivores have declined or gone extinct [but] the reluctance of many forest-interior birds to cross non-forest matrix, including Western Slaty-Antshrikes, may increase their vulnerability to habitat loss.\"\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Experienced English Housekeeper is a cookery book by the English businesswoman Elizabeth Raffald (1733–1781). It was first published in 1769, and went through 13 authorised editions and at least 23 pirated ones.\nThe book contains some 900 recipes for: soups; main dishes including roast and boiled meats, boiled puddings, and fish; desserts, table decorations and \"little savory dishes\"; potted meats, drinks, wines, pickles, preserves and distilled essences. The recipes consist largely of direct instructions to the cook, and do not contain lists of ingredients. The book is illustrated with three fold-out copper plate engravings.\nThe book is noted for its practicality, departing from earlier practice in that it avoids plagiarism, consisting instead almost entirely of direct instructions based on Raffald's experience. It introduced the first known recipe for a wedding cake covered in marzipan and royal icing, and is an early use of barbecue. The book remains a reference for cookery writers.\n\n\nContext\nRaffald was born in Doncaster in 1733. Between 1748 and 1763 she was employed as a housekeeper by several families, including the Warburtons of Arley Hall in Cheshire, where she met her future husband, John Rafford, Arley Hall's head gardener. In 1763 the couple moved to Manchester, where Elizabeth opened a confectionery shop and John sold flowers and seeds at a market stall. They had 16 children, all girls. As well as her cookery book, she wrote a book on midwifery and ran a register office in Manchester to place domestic servants with prospective employers. In 1773, she sold the copyright to the book to her publisher for £1400, equivalent to about £225,000 in 2022.\nRaffald writes in her Preface that she not only worked as a housekeeper \"in great and worthy families\", but \"had the opportunity of travelling with them\". The bibliographer William Carew Hazlitt observes that in this way she \"widened her sphere of observation\". A 2005 article in Gastronomica described Raffald as \"the most celebrated English cookery writer of the eighteenth century after Hannah Glasse\".\n\n\nBook\n\n\nContents\n\nThe following page numbers refer to the 4th edition of 1775.\n\nPart I [Soups, meat, fish, pies and puddings]\n\nChapter 1: Soups.

Page 383 [Finis Page 397]\n\n\nApproach\n\nThe book begins without a table of contents, though the three parts are described on the title page. The front matter consists of a dedication \"To the Honourable Lady Elizabeth Warburton\", occupying two pages, a three-page Preface to the First Edition, and a fold-out plate of a suitable stove, complete with a \"Description of the Plate\" on the facing page. Plagiarism was combated in later editions (from as early as 1775) with the declaration at the foot of the title page \"N. B. No Book is genuine but what is signed by the Author\", and a matching handwritten signature in brownish-black ink bracketing the heading of Chapter 1.\nEach chapter begins with a section of \"Observations\" on the topic of the chapter; thus, Chapter 3 has three pages of \"Observations on Roasting and Boiling\". The observations are close to instructions, as \"when you boil mutton or beef, observe to dredge them well with flour before you put them into the kettle of cold water, keep it covered, and take off the scum\".\nThe rest of each chapter consists entirely of \"receipts\" (recipes). These are usually named as instructions like \"To roast a Pig\", \"To make Sauce for a Pig\". Occasionally there is a comment, as in \"A nice way to dress a Cold Fowl\".\nThe names of dishes are overwhelmingly in English, even when the dish is in fact foreign; thus \"To make Cream Cakes\" is the heading for the recipe for meringue, beginning \"Beat the whites of nine eggs to a stiff froth, then stir it gently with a spoon, for fear the froth should fall\".\nRaffald is however not afraid to use foreign words for new techniques, as \"to fricassee Lamb Stones\",  \"to barbecue a Pig\", \"Bouillie Beef\", \"Ducks a-la-mode\", \"To fricando Pigeons\", \"To ragoo Mushrooms\". In explanation of this, she writes in the Preface to the First Edition:\n\nAnd though I have given some of my dishes French names, as they are known only by those names, yet they will not be found very expensive, nor add compositions but as plain as the nature of the dish will admit of.\nThe recipes themselves are written entirely as directions, without lists of ingredients. They are generally terse, the reader being assumed to know how to beat eggs and to separate the white from the yolk, to boil starchy foods in milk without burning the pan, or to make a \"paste\" (pastry), all of which are required skills for this recipe for sago pudding:\n\n     A SAGO PUDDING another way.\nBoil two ounces of sago till it is quite thick in milk, beat six eggs, leaving out three of the whites, put to it half a pint of cream, two spoonfuls of sack, nutmeg and sugar to your taste; put a paste round your dish.\n\n\nIllustrations\nOfficial editions contained three engravings on pages that folded out, interspersed with the text. The first illustrated a stove; the other two, suggested table layouts for the first course and for the second course. Raffald explains in her Directions for a GRAND TABLE that:\n\nbeing desirous of rendering it easy for the future, have made it my study to set out the dinner in as elegant a manner as lies in my power, and in the modern taste; but finding I could not express myself to be understood by young house-keepers, in placing the dishes upon the table, obliged me to have two copper-plates; as I am very unwilling to leave even the weakest capacity in the dark, it being my greatest study to render my whole work both plain and easy.\nThe book, intended for \"a burgeoning middle class that required explanation and elucidation\", provided an accurate description of how to serve an elegant meal à la française, complete with two fold-out engravings of the layout of a table with 25 \"prettily-shaped\" and symmetrically-arranged serving-dishes \"laid in generous profusion on the table\", each annotated with the name of the appropriate recipe. It is not clear whether the term \"cover\" for the layout of such a \"Grand meal\" is an acknowledgement of the French couvert, as it may simply mean, with Hannah Glasse, \"a large table to cover\".\n\nThe layout for the second course contains the dishes (from top):\n\n\nInfluence\n\n\nContemporary\nThe Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal of 1770 listed the book, commenting only that \"The Reviewers are sorry to own, but their regard to truth obliges them to it, that there are subjects with which, alas! they are too little acquainted, to pretend to be judges of what the learned may publish concerning them.\"\nThe Experienced English Housekeeper was \"extremely successful\", going through 13 authorised editions and at least 23 pirated ones. To attempt to reduce the piracy, Raffald signed each copy on the first page of the main text in ink, and printed the message \"N.B. No Book is genuine but what is signed by the Author\" on the title page. Finally in 1773, she sold the copyright to her publisher for £1400, equivalent to about £225,000 in 2022.\nAs well as direct piracy, the book inspired other \"experienced housekeepers\" to try to profit by publishing books of culinary advice. In 1795, Sarah Martin published The New Experienced English Housekeeper, for the Use and Ease of Ladies' Housekeepers, Cooks, &c. written purely for her own practice. Similarly, Susanna Carter entitled her 1822 book The Experienced Cook and Housekeeper's Guide. It included 12 engravings \"for the arrangement of dinners of two courses\".\nAs an illustration of how familiar Raffald had made the idea of the experienced English housekeeper, The Critical Review, Or, Annals of Literature of 1812 wrote that \"The arranging of a dinner-table is attended in Iceland with little trouble, and would afford on scope for the display of the elegant abilities of an experienced English housekeeper. On the cloth was nothing but a plate, a knife and fork, a wine glass, and a bottle of claret, for each guest, except that in the middle stood a large and handsome glass-castor of sugar, with a magnificent silver top.\"\n\n\nFirsts\nThe Experienced English Housekeeper was the first book to contain a recipe for what became the classic wedding cake complete with marzipan and royal icing.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary of 1888 credited Raffald as one of the earliest sources in English to mention barbecue in cookery.\n\n\nOn modern cookery\nThe Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English noted in 1999 that Raffald distinguishes her work as purely from practice, unlike books of untried recipes copied from elsewhere, and that she apologises for \"the plainness of the style\" in her introductory letter. The Guide observes, however, that \"this is the essence of her lasting appeal, and her clarity and economy with words find an echo in the work of Eliza Acton a century later.\"\nThe cookery writer Sophie Grigson wrote in The Independent that her mother Jane made Raffald's Orange Custards \"every year when the Seville orange season was in full swing, a treat to look forward to.\"\nIn 2013, Raffald's former workplace, Arley Hall, brought some of her recipes including lamb pie, pea soup and rice pudding back to their tables. The general manager Steve Hamilton however said they would avoid Raffald's turtle and calf's foot pudding.\n\n\nPublication\nRaffald states in her Preface that she personally \"perused [every sheet] as it came from the press, having an opportunity of having it printed by a neighbour, whom I can rely on\". She writes that \"The whole work being now compleated to my wishes\", she must thank her friends and subscribers; she states that over 800 of them contributed, \"raising me so large a subscription, which far excells my expectations\". She was thus a self-publisher.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Experienced English Housekeeper at Archive.org\nExperienced English Housekeeper as a set of 23 audio podcasts on iTunes\nSeven different editions (Online Books, University of Pennsylvania)\n The Experienced English Housekeeper public domain audiobook at LibriVox",

Montegufoni stands on the ancient Via Volterrana, the road taken by Charlemagne and other emperors to reach Florence or Rome and which passes through Volterra and Siena.\n\n\nHistory\nThe castle's exact creation date is unknown, but the first structure was probably built there during the 10th or 11th centuries. The first Lords of Montegufoni were the Ormannis, a noble family who built the first castle. In 1135, the Florentines attacked the castle, attempting to raze it to the ground. \n\n\nAcciaioli family\n\nThe building was left in ruins until the 13th century, when it became the property of Gugliarello Acciaioli of the Acciaioli family. His descendants became enormously rich thanks to the bank they owned (Italian: Compagna di Ser Leone degli Acciaioli e de' suoi consorti) and towards the end of the 13th century, Montegufoni had been transformed into a complex comprising the central castle and seven smaller buildings, surrounded by walls: the so-called \"seven old villas of the ancestral castle of Montegufoni\", mentioned in an inscription in the castle.\n\nIn 1310, Niccolò Acciaiuoli was born at the castle, in a hall of the castle later transformed into a chapel. He later became Grand Seneschal of the Kingdom of Naples and a dear friend of Boccaccio and Petrarch. In 1348, the King of Naples, Louis of Taranto, banished from his kingdom following the conflict with the King of Hungary, took refuge with his prime minister in Montegufoni. He used to banquet with the Bishop Angelo Acciaiuoli in the Banquet Hall (today known as \"the Theatre\"), which overlooks the part of the castle today called \"Courtyard of the Dukes\".\nIn 1386, Donato Acciaioli, a man who held the titles of Duke of Athens, Senator of Rome and Gonfaloniere of the Republic of Florence, built the tower that still dominates the castle today. In 1396 Donato was banished from Florence, but his assets (including Montegufoni) were saved from confiscation by his brother the cardinal. Donato's three sons resided at the Court of Athens until one of them, Agnolo di Jacopo, returned to Montegufoni with his son (Duke Francesco) and his cousin (it was probably at that time that the name \"Court of the Dukes\" was born).\nIn 1546, another Donato restored the tower on the model of Arnolfo's Tower of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence and built the armory (today called the \"La Galleria\") and in this period Montegufoni became the meeting point of many Florentine artists. In 1612 Cosimo II de' Medici was invited to Montegufoni. Around 1650 Donato, with his wife Anna Maria Altoviti, restored the entire castle, giving it the appearance it still has today, connecting the seven buildings that until then had been separate. The castle continued to be one of the most famous meeting places of Florentine high society throughout the 17th century and also during the 18th, until the economic decline of the Acciaioli family, who sold it to the Baracchi family.\n\n\nSitwell family\nIn 1909 Sir George Sitwell, 4th Baronet, an eccentric Englishman, fell in love with the derelict castle at Montegufoni and decided to buy it in the name of his son Sir Osbert Sitwell, later the 5th Baronet. After becoming its owner, Sitwell began to enrich and embellish the castle. In 1921 he hired Italian futurist Gino Severini to decorate the castle, who created a series of masks and harlequins in one room called \"La Sala delle Maschere\" (The room of masks). Severini also painted an owl in other frescoes dotted around the castle, including a Commedia dell'Arte scene.\nDuring World War II, to avoid them being stolen or damaged, 261 works of art, including the Adoration of the Magi by Domenico Ghirlandaio, the Primavera by Sandro Botticelli and the Ognissanti Madonna by Giotto were hidden in Montegufoni, as in many other places scattered throughout the Tuscan countryside, thanks to the work of people such as Giovanni Poggi, an official of the Fine Arts and director of the Uffizi, and Cesare Fasola, but also of ordinary citizens.\nThe Sitwell family made the castle an important cultural centre, inviting artists, especially American and English. In 1966, Sir Osbert, who had become a famous British author, settled permanently at the castle, often living there with his partner, the novelist David Stuart Horner. Struck by Parkinson's disease, he died at the castle in 1969. In 1972, Sir Osbert's nephew, Sir Reresby Sitwell, 7th Baronet, sold the castle to Sergio Posarelli.\n\n\nCurrent use\nAfter acquiring the castle in 1972, Posarelli again restored it, turning Montegufoni Castle into a luxurious holiday destination. After Posarelli's death in 2013, the castle passed to his three children: Cosimo, Guido and Lisa Posarelli.\nThe castle, like many places in Tuscany, has been transformed, divided into apartments and is today used mainly for ceremonies and conferences.\nThe Castle's Church of San Lorenzo contains a fresco by Giovanni Domenico Ferretti, a Rococo painter of the Florentine school; a painted crucifix by Taddeo Gaddi; the Madonna and Child (Italian: Madonna col Bambino) from the workshop of Lippo di Benivieni, dating from the Trecento, is now preserved at the Museo di Arte Sacra in Montespertoli.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Castello di Montegufoni at Wikimedia Commons\nCastle of Montegufoni official website",

    "text": "Andrew Smith (died c. early 1800s) was a Maroon officer from Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town). His brother, Charles Samuels, was also an officer from Trelawny Town, and both officers reported to Colonel Montague James.\n\n\nSecond Maroon War\n\nAs the population of the Jamaican Maroon village of Trelawny Town grew in the second half of the eighteenth century, Andrew Smith set up a satellite village of his own in the rural Westmoreland Parish. \nWhen the Second Maroon War broke out between Trelawny Town and the colonial authorities, the militias destroyed Smith's village. As a result, Smith joined the Trelawny Maroons as they fought against the forces of Governor Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres. When General George Walpole eventually persuaded the Trelawny Maroons to lay down their arms on a promise that they would not be deported, Smith was one of the first to surrender. However, Balcarres exploited a clause in the treaty to claim that most of the maroons did not surrender in time, and ordered their deportation. \nSmith was one of a handful of Maroons to have met the deadline, and he was offered the opportunity to remain in Jamaica. However, he was so outraged by the governor's duplicity that he chose to go with the rest of the Trelawny Maroons into exile.\n\n\nNova Scotia\nThe authorities of the Colony of Jamaica decided to deport the Trelawny Maroons to Nova Scotia. While they were in detention, Smith curried favour with the colonial authorities by identifying a number of runaway slaves who had fought on the side of Trelawny Town. When they reached Nova Scotia, Smith was regarded by his fellow maroons as a traitor. However, most maroon officers remained loyal to the runaways who fought on their side, and hundreds of them gained their freedom as a result of the conflict.\nIn a letter to his half-brother Samuels from Nova Scotia in 1797, Smith complained that the Maroons hated him and that they wanted to kill him. Walpole reported that Smith did not get on with other Maroon officers such as Leonard Parkinson and James Palmer. However, most Maroon officers remained loyal to the runaways who fought on their side, and hundreds of them gained their freedom as a result of the conflict.\n\n\nSierra Leone\nOn the journey to Sierra Leone, Smith joined James in complaining about corruption in the distribution of provisions by another Maroon officer, Major Jarrett. On investigating the proceedings, superintendent George Ross found that James and Smith were correct, and he dismissed John Jarrett from his post.\nWhen the ship carrying the Trelawny Maroons arrived in Freetown, the British authorities asked them for help in putting down a rebellion by the Black Nova Scotians. The Trelawny Maroons, including Smith, agreed, and after they put down the revolt, the Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone received the best land and houses.\n\n\nEngland\nIt appears that Smith was unhappy with his position in Sierra Leone, and he shortly afterwards migrated to England. In 1805, two Maroons from Sierra Leone, John Thorp or Thorpe and Andrew Smith, were recorded as living in Clapham in London, and they had their teenaged sons baptised there. Thorpe became a lawyer, but there is no evidence what happened to Smith, who probably died in England shortly afterwards.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "\"Tamagotchi\" is a song by American singer Omar Apollo from his debut studio album Ivory (2022). It was released as the album's fifth single on March 23, 2022. The song was written by Apollo, Maye, and Najai Washington and produced by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo of The Neptunes. It is named after the Japanese toy of the same name. \n\n\nBackground\nIn April 2021, Apollo tweeted that he finished creating songs with Pharrell Williams. One of the tracks the two collaborated on was \"Tamagotchi\", which was announced on March 23, 2022.\n\n\nComposition\n\"Tamagotchi\" was written by Omar Apollo, Maria Alejandra Osorio, and Najai Washington. The song is a \"bass-heavy\" Latin-infused trap and R&B song with Spanish guitars and a plucked Samba cadence. It features Apollo rapping and singing in Spanish during the verses and in English during the hook and bridge. Towards the end of the track, Apollo utilizes pitch shifted vocals to distort his voice. With production by The Neptunes, Williams' signature four-beat producer tag can be heard at the beginning of the track.\nLyrically, Apollo sings about material wealth and \"living the fast life, yet constantly craving physical connection from that special somebody.\" The song is noted for having \"tongue in-cheek\" and forward lyrics about sexuality and queerness, with Apollo bragging about boys and girls lusting over him.    \nThe song features a sample of \"I Wanna Rock\" by Uncle Luke during its bridge section.\n\n\nCritical reception\n\"Tamagotchi\" received generally positive reviews by music critics. Sophie Williams of NME praised the production of the song saying that its \"bouncy melody is bolstered by pitch-shifted vocals and vivid Pharrell-assisted production.\" Tomás Mier of Rolling Stone commented on the production and lyrics of the song saying, \"With its bouncy Neptunes beat, flirty, bilingual lyrics, and effortlessly catchy chorus, “Tamagotchi” is a perfect example of the qualities that have made Apollo, one of the most exciting artists of his generation.\" Writers at Billboard placed the song at number 41 on its list of Best Songs of 2022 and claimed that the song's stylistic leap helped earn Apollo his Grammy nomination. Writers at GQ called the song a \"catchy\" single. Cora Jordan of Clash commended the song's ability to show Apollo's versatility calling it \"punchy and jam-packed\" and stating that it \"clearly shows his range in sound, stepping away from the slow and sultry tone that reflects much of the album and blending into an upbeat, hard-hitting flow.\" Larisha Paul of The Fader also applauded Apollo's departure from his signature sound, stating he “abandons his signature sleek indie pop” and instead “paints an airy, harmony-filled wonderland as captivating as any dreamy pop performance that preceded it.\" Jessica McKinney of Complex called the track a \"smooth single\" and an \"upbeat banger\".  \n\n\nYear-end lists\n\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Tamagotchi\" was directed by Jake Nava and released on April 8, 2022, the same day as the release of Ivory.\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences",

Klaine in 1886, at an investment of $15,000.  With the completion of the first floor of the three-story brick structure, he launched the New West Echo, a Republican newspaper.  The newspaper occupied the north half of the first floor of the hotel.  The hotel opened as the New West Hotel and operated as one of seven serving pioneers who needed to come to town for supplies or for cowboys and ruffians who literally wanted to \"get the heck out of Dodge.\"\nDespite several severe economic depressions and droughts in the late 19th century, Klaine continued to operate the Cimarron Hotel under several managers, until 1902. In that year, the New West Echo ceased publication and Klaine sold the hotel to the Luther family.  The name was changed to \"The Luther Inn.\"  The Luther family owned the hotel until 1947 when they sold the hotel to Else Bartlow, who had been the secretary at the hotel.  She changed the name to the \"Cimarron Hotel.\"  In 1977, the hotel was purchased by Kathleen Holt.\nIn the 1980s, the hotel underwent substantial renovations and became a restaurant, bed and breakfast lodging, and private home to the owner and her family.  The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  As of August 2007, a portion of the building was occupied by a quilt shop that also conducted quilting classes and seminars.

Frequently interrupting each programme is another programme, about \"Sad Man\", who seems to be quite happy. He demonstrates maths with songs, puppets, and games. \nSad Man has a puppet called \"Decimole\", as for him being a mole. Decimole is known for being very greedy around food and attacking people. There were forty episodes in four seasons.

    "text": "Trent Barrett (born 18 November 1977) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach who is currently the assistant coach of the Brisbane Broncos and a former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.\nHe was previously the head coach of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the National Rugby League (NRL). A former Australia international and New South Wales State of Origin representative five-eighth, he played during the 1990s and 2000s for the Illawarra Steelers before they formed a joint venture with St. George to create the St. George Illawarra Dragons, with whom he won the 2000 Dally M Medal. Barrett also had a two-season spell in the Super League with England's Wigan and was named in 2007's Super League Dream Team before finishing his career back in Australia with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After co-coaching the St George Illawarra under 20s side and coaching the Country New South Wales rugby league team for four seasons Barrett started coaching in the NRL with the Sea Eagles.\n\n\nBackground\nBarrett was born in Temora, New South Wales on 18 November 1977. He is a cousin of Australian rules footballers Luke Breust and Jake Barrett, NRL footballer Liam Martin and Australian water polo player Anthony Martin.\nWhile attending St Gregory's College, Campbelltown, he played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1995.\n\n\nPlaying career\n\n\n1990s\n\nBarrett started his professional career in the 1996 ARL season with the Illawarra Steelers.\nWithin two years he had been selected to play his first State of Origin match.\nBarrett was the stand-out player of the 1998 Illawarra Steelers season, top scoring with 18 tries and winning the BHP Medal as player of the year.\nHis first season at the new joint-venture of the St. George Illawarra Dragons was marred by controversy as the incessant media hype over an alleged feud with Anthony Mundine and whether by playing out of position at half-back was affecting his form. He played at halfback in St. George Illawarra's 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to Melbourne.\n\n\n2000s\nWith the shock departure of Mundine from St. George Illawarra in 2000, Barrett was allowed to move back to his original position of five-eighth and he received the Dally M Medal in 2000.\nAt the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour.\nHe scored 6 tries in 20 games in the 2002 NRL season.\nIn 2003, while Barrett was captain of St George Illawarra, Nathan Brown who was the coach at the time famously slapped Barrett across the face in a tense sideline spray alongside Lance Thompson. Brown admitted many years later it was one of the biggest regrets in his coaching career but said he had moved on from the incident.\nFollowing a Round 12, 2006 game against the Newcastle Knights, Barrett received a grade-five striking charge on Newcastle Knights' Brian Carney. The incident initially went unnoticed throughout the entire weekend but it is understood a Channel Nine producer picked up the incident. Barrett was suspended for six matches, ruling him out of Dally M Medal contention.\n\nBarrett had two years left on his St. George Illawarra Dragons contract, but a get-out clause enabled him to quit the club for a move to England. He signed a three-year deal with the Wigan Warriors on 4 May 2006, despite their position at the bottom of the Super League and the threat of relegation to National League Division 1.\nBarrett made his Wigan Warriors début in a 16–10 defeat against Warrington at the JJB Stadium on 9 February 2007. In October 2007, Barrett was named as the Rugby League Players' Player of the Year but missed out on the \"Man of Steel\" although he had been tipped to be named. James Roby of St Helens received the award.\n\nFollowing a release from the final year of his three-year contract with Wigan, Barrett signed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in June 2008, on a two-year deal, commencing in 2009.\nHe earned the five-eighth spot for the New South Wales team in the 2nd State of Origin match of 2009. In his Origin comeback, Barrett was charged following a reckless tackle on Queensland's Greg Inglis, and as a result was suspended for two club matches. It did not, however, deter him from playing in the third and final Origin match in which he set up several tries as New South Wales defeated Queensland in the dead rubber, Queensland having won the series with victory three weeks prior. Barrett announced his retirement on 22 July 2010.\n\n\nRepresentative games\n\"Club:\" Played 199 games for the Illawarra Steelers and the St George Illawarra Dragons\nCountry: Played for Country in City vs Country Origin\nState of Origin: Played 11 games in total for New South Wales\nInternational: Played 13 tests to date for Australia including the 2000 World Cup\n\n\nAwards\nDally M: Dally M Player of the Year in 2000\nSuper League Players' Player of the Year 2007\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn 5 April 2014, Barrett was announced as the new head coach of the Italian national rugby league team when previous coach Carlo Napolitano announced his departure after Italy's 2013 Rugby League World Cup campaign. He coached Italy in their World Cup Qualifying matches, while Paul Broadbent coached Italy in the minor European Championship competitions.\nIn 2016, Barrett became the head coach for Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In Barrett's first season as Manly coach the club finished 13th on the table and missed the finals. The following season, Barrett took Manly to a 6th-place finish on the table and qualified for the finals but were eliminated in controversial circumstances against Penrith in week one of the finals.\nIn 2018, Manly and Barrett suffered a horror year on and off the field with the club finishing second last and narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon. The club was also plagued with infighting and there were reported disagreements between Barrett and the Manly owners over lack of chairs and whose responsibility it was to provide them. Trent eventually supplied the chairs himself but the effort was too late to save the season.\nOn 22 October 2018, Manly announced that former two-time premiership-winning coach Des Hasler would be appointed as the new Manly head coach for 2019 despite the fact that Barrett still had 12 months remaining on his contract and was not officially terminated by the club.\nOn 6 August 2019, Barrett spoke to the media and said that in some way he deserved credit for Manly's form reversal in 2019 which saw the club go from finishing second last in 2018 to contenders the following season.  Barrett said \"I’d actually like to think I left them well-educated, A few of the boys I got there like Siro (Curtis Sironen) were coming out of reserve grade, No one else wanted Moses Suli. He’d been punted by the Wests Tigers and the Bulldogs, Tommy Turbo had only played five games when I started\".\nBarrett's comments were later slammed online by the daughter of Bob Fulton, Kirstie Fulton took to Facebook and wrote \"History will not be rewritten, no way. I sit back and watch and read people take credit for many things and it’s hard to digest at times because I know who has been and continues to be instrumental in driving a lot of the change behind the scenes but I won’t accept this at all. Is he kidding? His arrogance and ego nearly tore the place apart\".\nOn 16 August 2019, it was announced that Barrett would be returning to Penrith as assistant coach to Ivan Cleary beginning in 2020.\nOn 23 July 2020, it was announced that Barrett would be the head coach of Canterbury-Bankstown from 2021 onwards on a three-year deal.  Barrett began his head coaching role with an opening round defeat against Newcastle.  In round 2 & 3 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were kept scoreless by Penrith and Brisbane losing 28-0 and 24-0 respectively.  This was the first time in the club's history they had been held scoreless in consecutive games.\nIn round 4 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were defeated 38-0 by the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the traditional Good Friday game. Canterbury became only the second team in the NRL era to lose three straight games without scoring a point after Cronulla who achieved this in the 2014 NRL season. It was also the worst start to a season by any team since Glebe in the 1928 NSWRFL season who managed to only score 12 points in their first four matches.\nIn round 7 of the 2021 NRL season, Barrett earned his first win as Canterbury-Bankstown head coach after the club snapped a six-game losing streak to beat Cronulla-Sutherland 18–12.\nIn round 16 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were defeated 66-0 by the Manly Sea Eagles. It was Canterbury's third biggest defeat in their 86-year history. At the end of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury finished last on the table and claimed their sixth Wooden Spoon after winning only three matches all year.\nOn 16 May 2022, Barrett resigned from his role as head coach of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nBarrett finished his tenure with the second lowest win percentage of any Canterbury coach since the clubs foundation in 1935 with 15.2 percent, only inaugural head coach Tedda Courtney had a lower win percentage with 12.5 percent.\nOn 18 August 2022, Barrett signed with the Parramatta Eels as an assistant coach, starting in 2023. On 20 May 2024, Barrett was named interim head coach at the Parramatta club after Brad Arthur was terminated from the head coaching position. Barrett took over Parramatta with the team sitting 14th on the table.\nIn Barrett's first game as interim head coach, Parramatta would lose 42-26 against the bottom placed South Sydney team who were missing eight players and only had one previous win to their name before the match.\nThe following week, he earned his first win in charge as Parramatta upset top of the table Cronulla 34-22.\nBarrett would eventually guide Parramatta to a 15th placed finish at the end of the 2024 NRL season.\nIn November 2024, Barrett joined the Brisbane Broncos as an assistant coach, ultimately becoming part of the club's 2025 premiership winning coaching staff.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\nManly Sea Eagles profile\nNRL profile\nTrent Barrett Wigan Career Page on the Wigan RL Fansite.\nSuper League profile\n2001 Ashes profile\nState of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats",

    "text": "Mitchell is a city in Wheeler County, Oregon, United States.  The population was 130 at the 2010 census. It was founded in 1873 and was named after John H. Mitchell, a politician.\nThe Painted Hills unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is about 9 miles (14 km) northwest of Mitchell. Mitchell School, a public school with an enrollment of about 70 students, is in Mitchell.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nFoundation\nAt the request of William \"Brawdie\" Johnson, a blacksmith, a post office was established at Mitchell in 1873. Johnson, the first postmaster, suggested the name Mitchell after John Hipple Mitchell, a U.S. Senator from Oregon. Senator Mitchell held the office in 1873−1879, 1885−1897, and 1901−1905. Platted in 1885, the community was incorporated in 1893.\nIn 1872 the first school in Wheeler County was established near Mitchell, and in 1874 it was relocated into the town itself.\n\n\nEarly town\nOver the next two decades, Mitchell grew to include a store, assay office, two churches, two hotels, a livery stable, three houses of ill-repute (one of which is still standing), five saloons, a flour mill, and an apothecary. There were also two newspapers: The Sentinel and The News.\nThe business district, including the saloons, grew up along Bridge Creek and became known locally as \"Tiger Town\". The church and most of the city's homes were built at higher elevation on a bench overlooking the creek; this part of town was known locally as \"Piety Hill\". About half the town was destroyed by fire in 1899, but it was later rebuilt.\n\n\nThree catastrophic flash floods\nSince its founding, Mitchell has experienced three catastrophic flash floods along Bridge Creek, which runs through the center of the city. Flooding caused great damage to the city in 1884 and 1904.\nThe third flood occurred on July 13, 1956, shortly after an intense thunderstorm in the hills to the south. Bridge Creek is usually less than 12 inches (30 cm) deep during July, but minutes after the thunderstorm a 50-foot (15 m) wall of water surged through Mitchell, destroying or heavily damaging 20 buildings in the city and several bridges over the creek. Eight people were killed including a family of four who were swept away and never recovered.\nAn observer from the United States Geological Survey estimated that about 4 inches (10 cm) of rain had fallen in about 50 minutes at the storm's center. Total damage from the flood, which also caused extensive damage to crops and roads in a nearby valley, was US$709,000 (equivalent to about $8,200,000 in 2024).\n\n\nOregon's first dinosaur fossil\nIn 2018, a geologist from the University of Oregon found a fossilized toe of a plant-eating dinosaur near Mitchell, where the Pacific Ocean coast lay 100 million years ago. This discovery has been billed as the first dinosaur fossil found in Oregon.\nA competing claim involves fossil fragments of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur found in the Otter Point Formation near the mouth of the Rogue River.\n\n\nGeography and climate\nMitchell, in southwestern Wheeler County, is on U.S. Route 26 just east of its intersection with Oregon Route 207. By highway, the city is 47 miles (76 km) east of Prineville and 60 miles (97 km) west of John Day. To the city's south lie the Ochoco Mountains, the source of Bridge Creek. It flows through Mitchell and then north through the Painted Hills to the John Day River.\nEroded remnants of ancient stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood are nearby; these include Black Butte and White Butte, visible from town.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.26 square miles (3.26 km2), all of it land.\nPrecipitation in the region is limited by the rain shadow effect of the Cascade Range and the Ochoco Mountains to the west. In winter, much of the precipitation arrives as snow.\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\n2010 census\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 130 people, 61 households, and 39 families residing in the city.

He is only the fourth New Zealander to break the top 10 in the world, the ones before him, including former world champion and world no. 2 Ross Norman.\nColl claimed his first Commonwealth Games medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games as he clinched a silver medal in the men's singles event after being defeated by veteran English squash player, James Willstrop. On the other side, fellow New Zealand squash player, Joelle King clinched a historical gold medal in the women's singles event. This was also the first instance where a male and a female squash player from New Zealand had managed to qualify in the final of the respective events at a Commonwealth Games event.\nIn September 2019, Coll won the 2019 Open De France Nantes in France. Coll was able to take the final in three games (12–10, 11–3, 11–9), defeating Joel Makin. On 22 August 2021, Paul Coll won the British Open championship and became the first New Zealander to win the British Open men's squash title.\nIn March 2022, Coll became the first New Zealander men's world no. 1 squash player, surpassing Ross Norman as the highest-ranked male squash player from New Zealand. Coll enjoyed more success in March when he won his first Windy City Open title in Chicago after coming back from two games down against Youssef Ibrahim of Egypt. The next month in April, he successfully defended his 2021 British Open title without dropping a single set the entire tournament. He defeated Ali Farag in a repeat of the 2021 final.\nIn August 2022, Coll took home his first gold medal in the men's singles event at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and became the first New Zealander to win gold in this event after beating Welshman Joel Makin in a tight five-game contest. Also in 2022, Coll won the bronze medal at the 2022 PSA Men's World Squash Championship.\nIn the 2023 New Year Honours, Coll was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to squash. In May 2023, he reached the quarter final of the 2023 PSA Men's World Squash Championship, before losing to rival Ali Farag. In October 2023, he won the United States Open.\nColl married Belgian professional squash player Nele Gilis in July 2024.\nIn May 2025, Coll reached the semi-final of the 2025 Men's World Squash Championship in Chicago but was defeated by number 1 seed and four-time champion Ali Farag. The following month he reached the semi final of the 2025 Men's British Open Squash Championship, losing to Diego Elías. He won his 28th PSA title in September after winning the London Classic.\n\n\nTitles and finals\n\n\nMajor finals (13)\nMajor tournaments include:\n\nPSA World Championships\nPSA World Tour Finals\nTop-tier PSA World Tour tournaments (Platinum/World Series/Super Series)\n\n\nPersonal life\nColl's uncle was the New Zealand rugby league player Tony Coll.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPaul Coll – PSA World Tour profile at the Wayback Machine (archived 13 September 2013)\nPaul Coll at the Professional Squash Association (archived)\nPaul Coll at Squash Info\nPaul Coll at the New Zealand Olympic Committee",

    "text": "McLouth Steel is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth-largest steelmaker in the United States.\nThe company had three locations: the first was in Detroit, Michigan, the second (and largest) in Trenton, Michigan, and the third in Gibraltar, Michigan. The Detroit and Trenton plants have been demolished, while the Gibraltar plant has been restarted by Ferrolux.\n\n\nDetroit complex\nThe Detroit plant was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer, as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue. General Motors desired additional options for steel, and provided partial financing for the facility. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, and was eventually purchased in 1981 by Jones and Laughlin Steel Company.\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot-rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Over the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment, allowing the company to roll 108,000 net tons of hot-rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold-rolled products per year.\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single-stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills in Detroit. With this new addition to the plant, stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. The principal operating units were two 50-inch (1,300 mm), 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold anneal and pickle line, a temper mill, two slitting lines (36 and 24 in), and a coil polisher. The two 50-in reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above 1,900 °F (1,040 °C)), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck. The Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n\nTrenton complex\n\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, Michigan, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four 60-ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a Steckel mill, a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace.\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton plant was formally dedicated and McLouth Steel gained the ability to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60-ton basic oxygen furnace (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200-ton electric arc furnaces. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous 60-inch (1,500 mm) hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110-ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110-ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110-ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a continuous casting department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110-ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60-ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its products by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton plant had its electrical distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes. In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List. Site demolition and remediation have since taken place, but the property's future remains unknown.\n\n\nTrenton plant assets\n\n\nIron making\nTwo blast furnaces: the number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee Company. The hearth diameter was 28' 6\" with a working volume of 56,676 cubic ft.\nSinter plant: it was phased out in 1969, and was very inefficient; it produced low-grade ore from wastes from the blast furnaces.\nThree ore bridges: Built by Dravo Corp. Two cranes in 1954, with the last in 1958. 12 net tons each.\nOne conventional ore yard opposite of the blast furnace, and two conveyor fed auxiliary yards.\n\n\nSteelmaking\n\n\nOxygen process shops\nOP 1: Three 60-ton vessels were added in 1954. It was the first successful basic oxygen shop in the United States. The shop was dismantled in 1968 due to high operating costs compared to OP 2.\nOP 2: Five oxygen process vessels, with two 110-ton vessels added in 1958, one in 1960, and two more in 1968. All five were built by the Pennsylvania Engineering Company (PECOR). The reason that the relatively small vessels were used was due to the low ceilings in the existing building.\n\n\nMelt shop\nFour 60-ton electric arc furnaces were installed in 1948 as the first expansion project. Two 200-ton electric arc furnaces were installed in 1954 to replace the four original furnaces.\n\n\nAOD shop\nThree 100-net-ton-sized argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) vessels were installed in 1977 by PECOR. Only a total of 39 heats were produced by this process. The average time per heat was 2 hours and 15 minutes. The shop was later dismantled and turned into the ladle metallurgy station.\nThe entire steelmaking building, with the exception of the lime storage building, was demolished in 2005. The lime storage building was brought down with explosives on April 18, 2010.\n\n\nContinuous casting\nPilot plant: the first straight stick slab casting machine in America was installed in 1963. The machine was located south of OP 1. Schloemann was the main equipment vendor, and it was dismantled in 1968.\nConcast department: there were four low-profile curved molds with progressive straightening. Three molds cast 12-in thick slabs while the other cast 9.5-in ones. All molds could adjust the slab width from 36 to 57 in. Typical casting speed was 34–46 inches per minute for a 12-in slab, and 48-55 in/min for a 9.5-in slab, with a maximum of 120 in/min.\nThe main building was demolished in 2006.\n\n\nHot strip mill\n\n\nFurnaces\nSoaking pits\n\n5 two-hole batteries. Natural gas fired. Built by Amsler Morton and the Rust Furnace Company in 1948.\nReheat Furnaces\n\nTwo conventional three zone, natural gas furnaces that were primarily used to reheat stainless and carbon slabs prior to the caster installation. 125 Net tons per hour each.\nFirst furnace was installed in 1954. Second in 1958. Both were built by the Rust Furnace Company of Pittsburgh, PA.\nEighteen induction slab heating furnaces\n\nThree lines of three heaters were installed in 1968, the last three lines were installed in 1969. Heaters were provided by Ajax Magnethermic and the slab handling equipment by United Engineering and Foundry.\nMaximum rated capacity was 645 tons per hour.\nWalking beam furnace\n\nBuilt in 1985.

Built by Production Machinery in 1964.\nPickle line and #5 slitter remained until final demolition of the plant.\n\n\nGibraltar complex\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in Gibraltar, Michigan, close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four-stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold-rolled steel coils.\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around 900 acres (3.6 km2) of land along the Detroit river, bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All-American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel Company) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the facility.\n\n\nGibraltar Plant assets\n\n\nPickle line\nPickle liquor\n\nHydrochloric Acid, 10,000 gallon capacity.\n175°F, 10-12% HCL, 12-15% FeCL\nTower\n\nVertical two pass line.

Trenton's city ordinances against pollution would not allow use of a Bessemer furnace, forcing McLouth to take a different approach. McLouth turned to the rest of the world to search for a solution, finding in Austria the basic oxygen furnace.\nThe technology not yet operating on a scale large enough for American steelmakers, McLouth gambled on an attempt to scale the unproven basic oxygen process to its needs. By 1954, McLouth's original 60-ton furnaces were in action. As the process was refined and perfected (and larger furnaces were added), this technology enabled McLouth to average 30% higher profits than its competitors between 1960 and 1966. The process was adopted by many large steelmakers in the years following McLouth's venture.\n\n\nFirst online computer control\nOnline computer control of steel making processes became a reality with the first use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design in as much as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\nThe solid state circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by Arnold Spielberg of the GE Computer Department, newly formed in 1957.\n\n\nFirst continuous caster\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method, a method now commonly used in the steel industry.\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine, the first in the United States.\n\n\nPilot plant\nIn 1963, a full-size single-strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\". They then began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel) from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\nThe five-year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n\nCasting plant description\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9–11, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and 9,972 feet (3,039 m) long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n\n\nFirst use of slab induction heating\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12 in) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process, fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30-ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour was also a complication.\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest: Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of rimmed steel were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000 kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 kV line outage. Detroit Edison permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity, after the city of Detroit. The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n\n\nClosing\nMcLouth Steel's 1996 demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking, coke, and ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company.\nMcLouth was top-heavy, with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased.\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production and efficiency. Aging and incorrectly sized equipment paired with low employee morale and productivity in the 1980s and 1990s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\nThese factors, in addition to the economic conditions of the era, helped bring about the closure of a small, innovative, integrated steel company.\n\n\nReferences",

The Artistic Director of Theatre Network at the time, Stephen Heatley, brought the high-energy format to Edmonton, and eventually, performers from the show formed Rapid Fire Theatre, which officially became its own theatre company in 1988. Rapid Fire Theatre performed originally at the Phoenix Theatre in Downtown Edmonton until 1990 when it moved to The Chinook Theatre in Old Strathcona, which became the Varscona Theatre in 1994. Rapid Fire Theatre performed there until 2012, and was part of the Varscona Theatre Alliance, along with Teatro la Quindicina and Shadow Theatre.  In September 2012, Rapid Fire Theatre moved back north of the river to Zeidler Hall at the Citadel Theatre complex, as announced by Maria Bamford. In 2013 Rapid Fire Theatre launched a capital campaign with the goal of building their own theatre.\n\n\nArtistic Directors\nStephen Heatley (Theatre Network)\nJack Smith 1988–1991\nPatti Stiles 1991–1995\nJacob Banigan 1995–2004\nChris Craddock  2005–2009\nKevin Gillese 2009–2010\nAmy Shostak 2010–2015\nMatt Schuurman 2015–Present\n\n\nShows\nRFT currently produces two weekly shows: Theatresports and the long form improv show Chimprov.

In 1997 the inland shipping division became a separate company.\n\n\nMGR\nIn November 2021, TRC received the three modern locomotives (H10 series) worth Sh22 billion to strengthen their Metre-gauge railway (MGR) line, ordered from Malaysia.\n\n\nRail network\n\nTRC's gauge is 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) and the length about 2,600 kilometres (1,600 mi). Two east–west lines linking the coast and the hinterland were built under colonial rule as German East Africa: the Central Line runs from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma, and the Tanga Line from Tanga to Arusha. A north-south connection, from Korogwe to Ruvu, links the two lines. The main line runs to Lake Victoria where a connection operates via Lake Victoria train ferries with the Uganda Railway and Kenya Railways. From the Tanga line a line to Kenya is disused.\n\nThere is a break-of-gauge at Dar es Salaam to the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) line to Zambia. A second link is at Kidatu, where the TAZARA line meets the Kidatu branch.\nIn 2024, Tanzania inaugurated a new railway terminal in Dar es Salaam as part of its ambitious Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project. The railway, powered by electricity, connects Dar es Salaam to Dodoma in under four hours. The 460km route is the first phase of a larger 2,560km railway designed to link Tanzania with neighboring countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n\n\nFormer Marine Division\n\nTRC inherited ferry and cargo ship services on Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyasa and some ships on Lake Victoria.\nTRC introduced MV Bukoba on Lake Victoria in about 1979, MV Mwongozo on Lake Tanganyika in 1982 and passenger and cargo ship MV Serengeti on Lake Victoria in 1988.\nOn 21 May 1996 Bukoba sank in 25 metres (14 fathoms) of water about 30 nautical miles (56 km) off Mwanza. She had many more passengers aboard than she was certified to carry and at least 800 people were killed. After the disaster criminal charges were brought against nine TRC officials including Bukoba's master and the manager of the Marine Division.\nIn 1997 the Marine Division became a separate company, Marine Services Company Limited.\n\n\nRail accidents\nOn 24 June 2002 the Igandu train disaster killed 281 people, the second highest number of deaths in a train disaster in Africa (the highest being the Awash rail disaster).\n\n\nPrivatisation, re-nationalization and recent plans\nIn 2007 RITES Ltd of India won a contract from the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) to operate passenger and freight trains on a concession basis for 25 years. The concession agreement was signed on 3 September 2007, to begin on 1 October 2007.  The railway will be run as Tanzania Railway Ltd, with the government owning a 49% stake.\nThere were moves to abandon the contract \"due in part, to the fact that the Indian investor failed to pay over USD 6 million in concession fees to the Tanzania government in 2008\" but RITES officials countered noting that the contract \"misled Rites officials by indicating that the Railway Assets Holding Company (Rahco) was in possession of 92 working locomotives when, in actuality, only 55 existed\". In 2010, the government terminated the contract and resumed control.\nIn 2007 the Deputy Minister for Infrastructure Maua Abeid Daftari proposed conversion to standard gauge.\n\n\nSleepers\nIn 2008 tenders were sought for 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in)-gauge steel sleepers convertible to 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge and for concrete sleeper plant for dual 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) and 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) gauges.\n\n\nSee also\nTanzania Standard Gauge Railway\nEast African Railway Master Plan\nCentral Line (Tanzania)\nRail transport in Tanzania\nTAZARA\nTransport in Tanzania\n\n\nReferences",

It is his second album dedicated to a poet, after Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal in 1957. Here, Ferré focuses on former surrealist Louis Aragon, but the body of work he chooses (poetry collection Le Roman inachevé, mostly) is not surrealistic.\nThis album had much more impact than Ferré's first Baudelaire effort, maybe because when it was published Ferré was gaining both success and critical acclaim on stage, and Aragon was an active poet and a controversial committed communist figure in the French intellectual field.\n\n\nHistory\nLéo Ferré began to set Louis Aragon's poems to music in the fall of 1958 and completed the task in March 1959. At that time, Ferré was not under contract to a record label. After several refusals, Ferré ended up signing with Eddie Barclay in 1960. Barclay was sceptical about sung poetry and asked him to release an album of catchier middle-of-the-road tunes before he would release the Aragon record. Ferré obliged by recording the album Paname, which included classics such as \"Paname\" and  \"Jolie môme\". Les Chansons d'Aragon was finally recorded in January 1961 and released in February 1961.\nThe finished album lists only 10 of the original 12 compositions.  Ferré changed most of the original titles, and sometimes eliminated some verses or changed their order. Aragon, who was greatly impressed by Ferré’s adaptations, wrote a liner text wherein he recognized Ferré as a true poet and claimed that \"the literary history of France [would] have to be re-written a little differently because of the contribution made by Léo Ferré\".\nThis album is a landmark and is considered as an evergreen classic of the French song repertoire.\n\n\nTrack listing\nTexts by Louis Aragon.

A \"sort-of sequel\" to Apatow's film Knocked Up (2007), its plot centers on married couple Pete and Debbie, whose stressful relationship is compounded by each turning 40.\nFilming was conducted in mid-2011, and This Is 40 was released in the United States on December 21, 2012. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its cast, acting, and the film's comedic moments and perceptive scenes, but criticized its overlong running time and occasional aimlessness. In March 2022, it was announced that Apatow was in early development of a third film, set 10 years later and titled This Is 50.\n\n\nPlot\nFive years after Knocked Up, Debbie owns a boutique, and among her employees are a frumpy cynic and poor saleswoman named Jodi and an attractive and talented saleswoman named Desi about whom Debbie and Jodi gossip, mostly in terms of Jodi hating that Desi exists at all. Pete owns his own record label, but it struggles financially as he promotes the reunion of Graham Parker & The Rumour.\nDebbie and Pete also deal with conflict between their daughters, 13-year-old Sadie and eight-year-old Charlotte. For Debbie's 40th birthday, the couple goes on a romantic weekend to a resort. There they get high on marijuana cookies and fantasize out loud about ways they would kill each other.\nAfter speaking with her friends Jason and Barb, Debbie decides to improve her marriage and family through exercise and strengthening her relationship with her father. She tells Pete he needs to stop lending his father Larry money because it is hurting them financially, but he fails to follow through with this.\nMeanwhile, Debbie learns she is pregnant but decides not to tell Pete. Later, she yells at a student, Joseph, who had an online argument with Sadie on Facebook leading to a confrontation between Pete and Joseph's mother, Catherine.\nDebbie takes Desi out dancing at a club, where she plans to confront her about $12,000 in missing store funds that Jodi has told her were stolen by Desi. They meet several players from the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team there. Debbie awkwardly finds out that one of the players wants to hang out with her and possibly sleep with her. Though flattered, she reveals that she is married, has two children, and is pregnant. He responds with politeness and they part on good terms.\nWhen Debbie does ask Desi about the missing money, Desi says that she doesn't need to steal anything and reveals she can afford nice things because she is also an escort, while Jodi does need to steal because she's a pill-popping loser who sucks at sales. Jodi later admits that she stole money to pay Oxycontin and was high when watching Debbie's daughters. Debbie responds by telling her she needs to pay the money back and leaving Jodi high and fired. \nPete and Debbie deal with Sadie and Charlotte's constant fighting, which puts an additional strain upon the family. They meet with the school principal, but the couple denies Catherine's accusations, and when she starts using the same foul language they had used previously, the principal dismisses them.\nAt Pete's 40th birthday party, the couple again argues about the money his father wants from them. Debbie argues with her father about not spending enough time in her life, and how he is perfect. Oliver then explains that his life is not perfect, and how he has always cared about her and loved her.\nLater, Pete overhears Debbie talking about her pregnancy, and angrily leaves the house on his bicycle. Debbie and Larry pursue him, and after Pete cycles into a car door, he gets into an argument with the driver, who then punches him in the stomach.\nDebbie and Larry take Pete to the hospital, where they reconcile, with Larry recognizing that she is the fighter who keeps the family together. Pete further realizes he is actually thrilled about having another child, and reconciles with Debbie.\nSometime later, Pete and Debbie are watching a small concert with Ryan Adams performing. She suggests he sign him to his label and they plan to talk to him as they finish watching the show.\n\n\nCast\n\nCameos\n\nScott Hartnell\nIan Laperrière\nJames van Riemsdyk\nMatt Carle\nWyatt Russell\n\n\nRelease\nThis Is 40 was originally scheduled to be released on June 1, 2012. In May 2011, Universal postponed the release to December 2012, allowing the studio to use that date for their release of Snow White & the Huntsman; the Snow White film was seen as better competition with a rival 2012 Snow White film project, Mirror Mirror, by Relativity Media.\nThe premiere for This Is 40 was held on December 12, 2012, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre, in Los Angeles. The film was released on December 21, 2012, opening in 2,912 locations nationwide.\n\n\nBox office\nDuring its opening weekend, This Is 40 grossed $11.58 million at the domestic box office.\nBy the end of its theatrical run, This Is 40 grossed approximately $67.5 million at the domestic box office, and approximately $20.5 million at the foreign box office, with a worldwide total of $88,058,786. While it had the lowest opening weekend for any of Apatow's films, it was a greater box-office success than his prior film, Funny People.\n\n\nCritical reception\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a 52% approval rating, based on reviews from 221 critics, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Judd Apatow definitely delivers funny and perceptive scenes in This Is 40, even if they are buried in aimless self-indulgence.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 59 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film two stars out of five, commending its premise but criticizing its execution. \"This Is 40 is a comedy film about the hell of getting older in a place where aging naturally is the last taboo, and I only wish it lived up to that utterly inspired concept...every scene feels like an airbrushed composite of dozens of rambling takes, and 133 minutes is drainingly long for a story this sitcom-slight,\" he wrote.\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four, saying \"There are big laughs here, and smaller ones that sting. Rudd and Mann are a joy to watch, especially when their comic darts draw blood, as when Debbie tells \"charmboy\" Pete that inside he's a dick. Cheers as well to a terrific supporting cast, including Melissa McCarthy as a mother from hell, John Lithgow as Debbie's withdrawn father, and the priceless Albert Brooks as Pete's dad, living off his son's dole to support his tow-headed triplets. This Is 40 doesn't build to a catharsis. It sometimes dawdles as it circles the spectacle of a marriage in flux. Yet Pete and Debbie's sparring yields some of Apatow's most personal observations yet on the feelings for husbands, wives, parents, and children that we categorize as love.\"\nMichael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said \"More like This Is Whiny\", giving the film two and a half stars out of four. \"This Is 40 has its share of clever, zingy material, proving that writer-director Judd Apatow has lost none of his ability to land a punch line with the right, unexpected turn of phrase. 'My boobs are just ... gone,' bemoans Debbie, played by Leslie Mann, comparing hers with those of her employee, played by Megan Fox. Then comes the second line, building smartly on the setup: 'They didn't even say goodbye.' Mann is wonderful, a uniquely skillful comic and dramatic actor—wide-eyed yet merrily devastating when the venom's called for. Rudd can get away with murder on sheer charm. But it's easy, and sort of lazy, to establish jokes and entire scenes built upon mocking somebody's dialect, or the older daughter's obsession with Lost.\"\nRichard Roeper gave the film a C− and called the film \"a huge disappointment\". His main complaint about the film was its running time and most of the unnecessary supporting characters.\nThe New Yorker's Richard Brody writes, This Is 40 \"is the stuff of life, and it flows like life, and, like life, it would be good for it to last longer\".\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nHome media\nThis Is 40 was released for Blu-ray and DVD in the United States on March 22, 2013. The disc features an unrated and also theatrical version of the film, as well as numerous bonus features.\n\n\nSequel\n\nDirector Judd Apatow stated he is interested in a possible sequel, shifting the focus off married couple Pete and Debbie and moving it onto their budding teenage daughter Sadie. During an interview on March 30, 2013, Apatow was questioned about the prospect of a sequel to This Is 40. He admitted to being intrigued by the idea.\nIn March 2022, it was reported Apatow was in early development of writing a script, with the film set ten years after the previous, titled This is 50.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nThis Is 40 at IMDb\nThis Is 40 at Box Office Mojo\nThis Is 40 at Rotten Tomatoes\nThis Is 40 at Metacritic \nThis Is 40 on Facebook",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=728991",
    "text": "The 125th Street station is an express station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Lexington Avenue and East 125th Street (also known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, it is served by the 4 and 6 trains at all times, the 5 train at all times except late nights, and the <6> train during weekdays in peak direction. The station contains four tracks and two island platforms split across two levels. The upper level is used by northbound trains to the Bronx, while the lower level is used by southbound trains to Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.\nThis station was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and opened in 1918. A planned northern extension of the Second Avenue Subway, once built, will connect with this station and with the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem–125th Street station, located one block west.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nConstruction and opening\nFollowing the completion of the original subway, there were plans to construct a line along Manhattan's east side north of 42nd Street. The original plan for what became the extension north of 42nd Street was to continue it south through Irving Place and into what is now the BMT Broadway Line at Ninth Street and Broadway. In July 1911, the IRT had withdrawn from the talks, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was to operate on Lexington Avenue. The IRT submitted an offer for what became its portion of the Dual Contracts on February 27, 1912.\nIn May 1912, it was decided to modify the planned layout of the station from three tracks and two island platforms on each level, to two tracks and one island platform per level, saving $1.25 million.\nIn 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) system from looking like a \"Z\" system (as seen on a map) to an H-shaped system. The original system would be split into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and a west–east shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Upper East Side and the Bronx.\nThe 125th Street station opened on July 17, 1918, as part of the extension of the original subway up Lexington Avenue to 125th Street and into the Bronx. Initially, service was provided only as a shuttle on the local tracks of the Lexington Avenue Line starting at Grand Central, continuing past this station and under the Harlem River to 167th Street on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. On August 1, the \"H system\" was put into place, with through service beginning on the new east and west side trunk lines, and the institution of the 42nd Street Shuttle along the old connection between the sides. Express service began on this date. The cost of the extension from Grand Central was $58 million.\nThe opening of this station resulted in development of the surrounding neighborhood of East Harlem.\n\n\nLater years\nThe city government took over the IRT's operations on June 12, 1940. In 1952 or 1953, a public address system was installed at this station, providing information to passengers and train crews.\nIn late 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at Bowling Green, Wall Street, Fulton Street, Canal Street, Spring Street, Bleecker Street, Astor Place, Grand Central, 86th Street and 125th Street to 525 feet (160 m) to accommodate ten-car trains.\nIn 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. The station's elevators were installed in November 1989, making the station one of the earliest to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This station was renovated in 2005.\nIn July 2023, as part of a pilot program to deter assaults on New York City Transit staff, the MTA painted \"no standing zones\" on the 125th Street station's platforms near the centers of each train.\n\n\nStation layout\n\nThe station is unusual in design for an IRT station, being a bi-level station with island platforms. The 4 and 6 trains stop here at all times; the 5 train stops here at all times except late nights; and the <6> train stops here during weekdays in the peak direction. The 5 train always makes express stops, and the 6 and <6> trains always make local stops; the 4 train makes express stops during the day and local stops at night.\nUnlike at other bilevel express stations on an IRT line, the tracks are not grouped so that express and local trains are on different levels. Instead, the upper platform serves northbound (uptown) trains and the lower level serves southbound (downtown) trains. Adding to the unusual design is the local track on each level having train doors open to the right; the express tracks likewise have doors opening to the left. North of the station, just after crossing the Harlem River, the line splits into the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (heading north) and the IRT Pelham Line (heading east). On the lower platform, each track comes from one line, and a flying junction south of the station allows trains to be diverted to the local or express track. The next station to the north is Third Avenue–138th Street for 6 and <6>​ trains on the Pelham Line, 149th Street–Grand Concourse for afternoon 4 trains, and 138th Street–Grand Concourse for 4 and ​5 trains on the Jerome Avenue Line. The next station to the south is 116th Street for local trains and 86th Street for express trains. Fixed platform barriers, which are intended to prevent commuters falling to the tracks, are positioned near the platform edges.\nThroughout the station's history, this station has been one of the more important on the line as it is the northernmost transfer point between express trains to the IRT Jerome Avenue and White Plains Road Lines, and local trains to the IRT Pelham Line. There is an active tower at the north end of the upper platform; it is a satellite to the tower at Grand Central–42nd Street, which controls the entire length of the Lexington Avenue Line.\n\n\nExits\nThis station has a mezzanine with two separate turnstile banks. The northern turnstile bank leads to two staircases going to both northern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, and an elevator going to the northeastern corner of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street. The southern turnstile bank has two exits leading to both southern corners of Lexington Avenue and 125th Street.\nA fifth entrance will be built as part of the proposed Second Avenue Subway station here. It would be located on the southern side of 125th Street in the median of Park Avenue, and an ancillary facility would be located one block south. The proposed fifth exit is right underneath Metro-North Railroad's Harlem–125th Street station on Park Avenue, which is one block west of the Lexington Avenue exits. An ancillary facility would also be built at the southeast corner of 125th Street and Third Avenue.\n\n\nPlanned Second Avenue Subway station\n\nHarlem–125th Street is the planned northern terminal for Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway. It would be built underneath 125th Street, below and perpendicular to the existing Lexington Avenue Line station. Phase 2 would stretch from 96th Street to 125th Street, with the next stations south being 116th Street and 106th Street. When opened, it will initially be served by the Q train, with the T providing service when phase 3 of the line is built.\n\n\nIntroduction of the station to plans\nA station at Lexington Avenue and 125th Street was not on the original Second Avenue Subway proposed as part of the New York City Transit Authority's 1968 Program for Action; instead, a Second Avenue Subway station would be built at 126th Street and Second Avenue. The line was to be built in two phases—the first phase from 126th to 34th Streets, the second phase from 34th to Whitehall Streets.\nIn March 2007, plans for the construction of the Second Avenue Subway were revived. The line's first phase, the \"first major expansion\" to the New York City Subway in more than a half-century, included three stations in total and cost $4.45 to $4.5 billion, spanning from 105th Street and Second Avenue to 63rd Street and Third Avenue. Phase 1 opened on January 1, 2017, with the line's northern terminal at 96th Street.\nThe second phase, between 125th and 96th Streets, was allocated $525 million in the MTA's 2015–2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation. This phase will complete the project's East Harlem section. The alignment will run under Second Avenue to 124th Street, before turning west on 125th Street. On October 18, 2016, the de Blasio administration announced a rezoning plan for East Harlem. One of the three Special Transit Land Use (TA) districts is for the area of the 125th Street station.\nOn November 21, 2016, the MTA requested that the Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. On December 15, several elected officials for the area announced that they were seeking $6 billion of funding for Phase 2 of the line, including $2 billion from the federal government. These officials wished to secure funding from the presidential administration of Barack Obama before Obama's term ended on January 20, 2017. In their request for funding, they cited that they wanted to avoid an uncertain response from the first administration of Donald Trump and start construction on Phase 2 as soon as possible. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. In January 2017, it was announced that Phases 2 and 3, which are expected to cost up to a combined $14.2 billion, were on the Trump administration's priority list of 50 most important transportation projects nationwide.\n\n\nCurrent plans\nIn July 2018, the MTA released a supplemental environmental assessment for Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway. The updated report indicated that the 125th Street station would be relocated about 118 feet (36 m) west and 20 feet (6.1 m) below what had been proposed in the 2004 FEIS, in order to reduce impacts on nearby buildings. The proposed three-track station was reduced to two tracks. The modification would reduce flexibility, but would allow the section under 125th Street to be mined, rather than being constructed as cut-and-cover, thereby reducing impacts on nearby buildings. Simulations showed that a two-track layout could support the same level of service that the three-track layout could have provided: 28 trains per hour. To make up for the loss of the track, the tail tracks west of the station would be lengthened.\nWhen built, this platform will be the northern terminal of the Second Avenue Subway. It will be five levels below street level, or two levels below the lower-level IRT Lexington Avenue Line platform. The station was originally proposed to have a three-track, two-island platform layout with a mezzanine above it and switches to the east of the platforms. The July 2018 plans call for two tracks and one island platform, with switches both to the west and the east. The tail tracks would extend to Lenox Avenue to allow for six trains to be stored, three per track. This would also provide a provision for a future expansion of the line along 125th Street.\nExtra transfer capacity to the existing Lexington Avenue Line station would be provided as part of the construction of the Harlem–125th Street terminal. In its July 2018 supplemental report, the MTA indicated that it wanted to build new escalator entrances to the subway station complex on two of the corners at Lexington Avenue and 125th Street, replacing the existing entrances there. Entrance 1 would be located on the southeast corner, while entrance 2 would tentatively be located on the northwest corner, although this has yet to be confirmed. The original 2004 plans had called for entrance 2 to be located on the southwest corner, but the MTA stated that the location was comparatively small. The Second Avenue Subway station will include a new exit leading directly from the Second Avenue Line platform to the median of Park Avenue at the south side of 125th Street, allowing for a quick connection to the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem–125th Street station. In the 2018 report, the MTA stated that it also wanted to include a property on the intersection's southeast corner within the construction site. The ancillaries were also shifted from the locations proposed in the 2004 FEIS. Ancillary 1 and Ancillary 2, which were respectively supposed to be located at Third and Park Avenues on 125th Street, were both moved south to 124th Street. The ancillary buildings were also shifted west because the station cavern had been relocated west. Although local residents advocated for an additional entrance leading to an unused cavern under the elevated Metro-North station, the MTA ruled out this idea. The cavern contains the original routing of the Park Avenue main line, which was abandoned in 1897 when the current elevated station was completed.\n\n\nConstruction progress\nThe construction of the Second Avenue Subway was expected to improve quality of life around the existing subway station at Lexington Avenue, which was notorious for crime and drug use. In August 2025, the MTA board awarded a $1.97 billion contract to Connect Plus Partners, a joint venture between Halmar International and FCC Construction. The contract includes the construction of the 125th Street station shell, reconstruction of the existing tunnel near the 116th Street station, and new tunnels between Second Avenue–120th Street and Lenox Avenue–125th Street. Also in 2025, the MTA requested that the site of the Second Avenue Subway's 125th Street station be rezoned to allow the construction of 684 apartments above the station entrance. \n\n\nSecond Avenue Subway Community Information Center\nA Second Avenue Subway Community Information Center for Phase 2, along 125th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, was originally planned to open in May 2017. The center's opening was delayed to September 18, 2017.\n\n\nMedia\nThe station is mentioned by Lou Reed in his 1967 song \"I'm Waiting for the Man\", performed with The Velvet Underground, in which he describes traveling to Harlem to purchase heroin: \"Up to Lexington / One-two-five / Feeling sick and dirty / More dead than alive.\"\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nStookey, Lee (1994).

    "text": "River Raid is a 1982 shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Activision for the Atari 2600, designed by Carol Shaw. The player controls a fighter jet over the River of No Return in a raid behind enemy lines. The goal is to navigate the flight by destroying enemy tankers, helicopters, fuel depots and bridges without running out of fuel or crashing.\nShaw had made games for Atari, Inc. before joining Activision and before working on River Raid. Inspired by the game Scramble (1981), she set out to make a game that had a continuously scrolling screen. She had programmed and designed the game herself, occasionally getting advice from other Activision staff.\nRiver Raid was one of the best-selling games of 1983 and the second best-selling Atari 2600 video game of the year after Ms. Pac-Man. It received year-end awards from The Video Game Update and the Arkie Awards. The game was ported to several other consoles and computers and received a sequel in 1988. It has continued to receive praise as one of the best games for the Atari 2600 from various publications.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nIn River Raid the player is in a B1 StratoWing Assault Jet that is retrofitted with rapid-fire guided missiles and has the ability to both accelerate and slow down easily. The jet is going down the \"River of No Return\" where it is on a mission to break the enemy blockades and halt troop advances. The river in the game has no actual ending and scrolls infinitely.\nRiver Raid is played with the joystick. The player can control movement left and right on the screen and forward and backwards to accelerate and slow down respectively. Players can shoot missiles with the joystick's button to destroy enemy tankers, helicopters, fuel depots and bridges. The goal in River Raid is to collect as many points as possible before crashing or running out of fuel. Fuel can be collected from flying over a fuel depot to fill up the gauge that is displayed at the bottom of the screen. As the river progresses, there will be fewer fuel tanks. The player loses one of their jets if they collide with the river bank or enemy objects. If they have remaining jets, the player restarts play at the same section of the river they crashed. If the player manages to destroy a bridge at the end of a section, the player will restart at that bridge upon losing a life.\nIn the Atari 2600 version, Switch A has the player's missiles shoot straight, while Switch B gives the player guided missiles.\nThe port to Atari 8-bit computers adds the ability to select what bridge to start at, bonus points if the player shoots a bridge with tanks on it, and more hazards such as helicopters firing back at the player.\n\n\nDevelopment\nRiver Raid was designed by Carol Shaw for Activision. Shaw had started programming in High School coding in BASIC, which led her to pursue a career in computers. She received her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. While at university, she was in a work-study program that allowed her to work at various computer companies including a six-month position at Atari. She worked at Atari after graduation developing 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (1978) and Video Checkers (1980), which she described later as not being \"top-sellers\". Shaw later accepted an offer to work on developing games for Activision.\nShaw programmed the game. She said the idea of the game was mostly her own, with some feedback from other designers. Shaw recalled that there were a lot of video games with scrolling and thought it would be a good thing to do on the Atari 2600 as there had not been many that have done that. She was initially inspired by the game Scramble (1981) and approached Alan Miller of Activision to develop a space-themed game. Miller responded that there were too many outer space–themed games, suggesting her to come up with a different theme.\nShaw created a game where objects scroll down the screen. She began drawing the game on graph paper and found that creating a game that scrolled horizontally would not work well and would appear \"very jerky\", leading the game to be designed to scroll vertically. While doodling on graph paper, she found that she could design the game with a mirror image looking like a river with islands in the middle of it. Initially, the players would be controlling a boat which Shaw felt did not look good. She recalled that Activision programmer David Crane had potentially suggested to her a jet would appear better and began designing one that appeared to be flying up a canyon.\nSome input came from either David Crane or Steve Cartwright to add fuel tanks that the player could either fly over for fuel or shoot and destroy for points. Other gameplay elements followed after, such as how far apart bridges were in the game. While developing the sound effects in the game, she asked other Activision developers on appropriate Klaxon-styled sounds to warn the player when their fuel was running low. According to Crane, he thought for a moment and recited some lines of assembly code that created the effect.\nShaw coded the version of the game for the Atari 800, a game which was eight kilobytes in size compared to the Atari 2600 version, which was four kilobytes. Shaw said the game was harder to develop for home computers in a version she described as a \"whole new game\". Most of the code for River Raid had to be re-written for the Atari computer version. Shaw said that she had \"pretty much mastered playing the game\" and thought it would be more fun to be able to start at a higher level. This led to her adding the ability to restart the game from a bridge further down the river. Shaw also designed more detailed graphics such as the canyon's river and walls.\n\n\nRelease\nRiver Raid was published by Activision and released for the Atari 2600 on December 1982. It was released for the Atari 800 line of computers in September 1983 and both the Atari 5200 and Intellivision in December 1983. The game was also ported to other home computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX and IBM PCjr.\nIn West Germany, the Law for the Protection of Youth was updated in 1985 to ban arcade games from public spaces open to youth. This led to the Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Schriften (Federal Department for Works Harmful to Young Persons, now called the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons) to monitor video games, leading to River Raid to be banned due to its military-themed content.\nRiver Raid has been re-released on several compilation packages. These include the Atari 2600 Action Pack (1995) for home computers, Activision Classics (1998) for PlayStation, Activision Anthology (2002) for PlayStation 2 and portable systems such as Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable.\n\n\nReception\n\nRiver Raid was the top-selling Activision game of 1983 and the second best-selling game for the Atari 2600 in 1983, only being beaten by Ms. Pac-Man. Shaw responded to the sales stating \"I knew it was a good game, but I didn't expect to hit number one. Of course I was happy when it did!\" The Atari version sold almost one million copy in total by 1984, making it one of the best-selling video game at that point.\nEarly reviews from video game publications generally found the game fun with varying takes on the quality of graphics and how it compared to similar games for home consoles. E.C. Meade of Videogaming Illustrated praised the game for its exciting themes, fast-paced gameplay and high quality graphics, finding it superior to the similar ColecoVision game Zaxxon, while Jim Clarke of the same publication declared it a \"top-notch\" game but found it \"surprisingly flat\" after playing B-17 Bomber (1982) on Intellvision. Clarke wrote that he desired more complexity as \"blasting away at things [...] becomes redundant. There is no sense of pacing: it's one shot, one course correction, one potential collision after another.\" Michael Blanchet of Electronic Fun with Computers & Games wrote that the game was very similar to others on the market but stood out due to its ever-changing scenery and constant shift in strategy. A reviewer in The Video Game Update complimented the game as \"very easy game to learn, but a difficult one to master completely\" writing that the \"graphics are good, but not dazzling\". Phil Wiswell of Video Games echoed similar statements, writing that the game was \"fun to play\" and was \"demanding of your concentration\" while its graphics were not as appealing as other Activision titles.\nFor the game's various ports, The Video Game Update praised the Intellivision version of the game, noting its \"beautiful, brightly colored graphics and exciting game play\", feeling that the game plays most like the Atari 2600 game, with superior graphics. Scott Mace of InfoWorld found the Atari home computer version of the game more challenging than the Atari 2600 version and that it outshone other similar games such as Caverns of Mars (1981). Mace found the biggest flaw was the lack of a dial-like device to turn the controller, as the Atari joystick made for \"a lousy steering device\". Antic in 1984 said that the Atari 8-bit version was identical to the 2600 original, but with slightly \"spiffed up ... game visuals\". Craig Holyoak of the Deseret News praised River Raid on the ColecoVision as \"one of the most playable and entertaining of all war games\".\nThe Commodore 64 (C64) version had reviews in computer magazines Your 64 and Commodore Horizons finding the graphics average, with the latter publication saying that the game was enjoyable despite the lack of quality graphics rather than because of them. While Home Computing Weekly's review found the game tedious after extended play sessions, the Your 64 review found it better than the console game.\nRiver Raid received the award for \"1984 Best Action Videogame\" and a Certificate of Merit in the category of \"1984 Best Computer Action Game\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. The judges Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz described it as \"provid[ing] the brand of non-stop excitement the blast brigaders adore\". The Video Game Update awarded River Raid as the Game of the Year for the Atari 2600 in their Awards of Excellence 1983.\n\n\nRetrospective reviews\n\nFrom retrospective reviews of the Atari 2600 game, Brett Weiss included the game in his book The 100 Greatest Console Video Games, 1977-1987 (2014), noting its sharp non-flickering graphics and smooth difficulty progression with \"intense, challenging gameplay\". Weiss said that some reviewers have found the game has not aged well with the release of such games as Ikaruga (2003), but he found that River Raid still remained fun, charming, and elegant.  Matt Fox in his book The Video Games Guide (2013) echoed that the graphics and sound were impressive for the Atari 2600. He was lukewarm on the gameplay, writing that with only moving and static hazards to avoid, nothing actively attacked the player's jet.\nBoth Game Informer and IGN described the game as a highlight of the shooter or shoot 'em up game genre. Levi Buchanan of IGN placed the game at number two on their list of 2600 titles and praised its pacing, stating that \"the game never grew boring in 1982. And it retains its fresh, frantic feeling in 2008.\" An anonymous reviewer in Game Informer praised it \"one of the best shooters ever to grace the [Atari 2600]\", highlighting the game's scrolling as most games for the system at the time were confined to a single screen.\nBoth Weiss and Buchanan stated that it was one of the best games for the Atari 2600.  In their list of the top 25 Atari 2600 games, Stuart Hunt and Darran Jones from Retro Gamer magazine ranked River Raid third, stating it was the best of the shooter games on the 2600, noting \"smooth scrolling and surprisingly detailed scenery\". Other publications have included River Raid in their best video games of all time lists; such as Flux (1995) and Next Generation (1996) who highlighted the game's \"seemingly infinite scenery\" and its level design respectively. Mat Allen of Retro Gamer placed River Raid, along with Kaboom! (1981), Pitfall II: Lost Caverns (1984), Ghostbusters (1984), Little Computer People (1985) and Alter Ego (1986), among the best games from Activision's classic period.\nFor ports, the reviewers in Zzap!64 commented on the C64 version as having simple graphics and being \"a little repetitive\" by 1987 standards, though it was still deemed better than contemporary offerings like Xevious, Aftermath and Terra Cognita. Chris Hayward of Commodore Force covered the game in 1993 in an overview of shoot 'em ups for the computer. He described the game as having awful graphics and sound, summarizing it as a \"trip down memory lane for the infirm\". Weiss found the Atari 5200's controls \"a little loosey goosey\" and the ColecoVision faster-paced than other versions but with a slight delay in controls, declaring both games \"great nevertheless\"; he wrote that the Intellivision port had poor controls and was the worst of the four console ports. Writing for AllGame, he found that what was \"revolutionary\" about River Raid—the sound and graphics for the Atari 2600—appeared dated on the ColecoVision.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nShaw left Activision and the video game industry after programming the game Happy Trails (1983) for the Intellivision and releasing ports of River Raid for the Atari 5200 and 800 computer system. In 2017, Shaw won The Game Awards Industry Icon Award for her contributions to the video game industry.\nRiver Raid popularized vertically scrolling shooters among the home console audiences. The Atari 2600 was experiencing what video game historian Brett Weiss described as \"a resurgence of sorts\" after Nintendo had success in the marketplace with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Atari had just re-released the system a smaller budget-priced revision in 1986. Atari had convinced Activision to develop more games for the Atari 2600, starting with a port of the Activision game Ghostbusters (1984). Activision released River Raid II, which was designed by Dan Kitchen and coded by David Lubar. Kitchen explained that at this period, Activision wanted to focus on licenses and brands over original concepts, and as River Raid was one of those top-selling games, they wanted a sequel to capitalize on it. Lubar had previously coded games for 20th Century Fox and Spectravideo. Lubrar recalled that making the game was \"tough, really tough since I knew how good the original River Raid was and assumed people would make comparisons\". River Raid II uses the same polynomial algorithm Shaw used to create the scrolling playfield to have the sequel resemble the original game. The game was developed in about five months and sold over 501,000 copies.\nA third game, River Raid: The Mission of No Return, was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System but was never released. Next Generation reported that the game was cancelled following poor reception at the event. As of 2021, there have been no further official sequels to the game.\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of Activision games: 1980–1999\nList of best-selling Atari 2600 video games\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\nRiver Raid at MobyGames\nRiver Raid at Lemon 64",

In 1890, he entered Kyiv University, and from 1893, he became involved in revolutionary activities. From 1894 to 1897, he participated in the establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Group, the group \"Workers' Cause,\" \"Workers' Newspaper,\" and the Kyiv \"Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class.\" In 1898, he participated in the 1st Congress of the RSDLP in Minsk, where he and Natan Abramovich Vigdorchik represented the \"Workers' Newspaper\". At the congress, he was elected to the Central Committee of the RSDLP but was soon arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, and in 1900, he was exiled to Siberia. After returning from exile, he participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution, after which he withdrew from revolutionary activities. In 1910, he graduated from the medical faculty of Kyiv University. After the October Revolution of 1917, he worked in the People's Commissariat of Labor, and from 1919, he taught at the Moscow Higher Military Command School.

    "text": "On October 11, 1878, Jim Good, Jeff Hopkins, Ed Warner, William Chambers, and Dan Harris Sr. were lynched in Posey County, Indiana, near the town of Mount Vernon. These men, who were allegedly connected to the robbery of a brothel, were killed by a white mob who broke into the jail where they were being held. Two other men, Dan Harris Jr. and John Harris, were also lynched in the days leading up to October 11, in connection with the same alleged offense. This racial terror lynching is the largest reported lynching in Indiana's history.\n\n\nBackground of the lynching\nOn October 7, 1878, Mount Vernon newspapers reported that a group of Black men had robbed a group of white women working as sex workers at a brothel near Mount Vernon, Indiana in Posey County. Law enforcement officers listed Jim Good, Jeff Hopkins, Ed Warner, William Chambers, John Harris, and Dan Harris Jr. as suspects, and began to search for them.\nOfficers arrested Good, Hopkins, Warner, and Chambers, and brought them to jail to await trial. White mobs lynched two men, Dan Harris Jr. and John Harris, before officers could locate them. Officers were unaware of this when they went to the Mount Vernon home of Harris Jr.'s father, Dan Harris Sr. When they arrived, intending to arrest Dan Harris Jr., Harris Sr. informed them that his son had already been lynched the day before. The officers accused Harris Sr. of harboring his son within the home. When officers attempted to forcefully enter, Harris Sr. shot Deputy Sheriff Cyrus Thomas with a shotgun. The city marshal shot back, wounding Harris Sr. before taking him into custody at the same jail as Good, Hopkins, Warner, and Chambers. Deputy Sheriff Thomas died at the scene.\nAs news of the arrests spread, a mob gathered at the jail where the five men were being held. Even as the crowd grew more violent, officers refused to let them in the jail. Rumors later spread that the Governor had called in the militia, causing 200 armed white men to gather at the nearby train station and prevent the militiamen from departing their train cars once they arrived, even hauling a cannon from the courthouse lawn to the train depot. However, the militia never showed up, and by 2 p.m. on October 11, the crowd at the depot and the jail had dispersed.\n\n\nLynching\nThe mob reconvened at 8 p.m. and 100 or so masked men made their way towards the jail under the cover of darkness. The mob proceeded to raid the jail, overpowering the officers guarding it. After 45 minutes, using crowbars, chisels, and a sledgehammer, the mob broke through the iron door to the cell inside, where four of the men—Good, Hopkins, Warner, and Chambers—were being held. During this time, Harris Sr., who was in a separate cell and in poor condition due to his untreated gunshot wounds from earlier that day, was dismembered by the mob, with body parts being taken as souvenirs.\nAfter killing Harris Sr., the mob forced the other four men out of the jail with their hands bound and ropes around their necks. The men tried to claim their innocence and explain their whereabouts on the night of October 7, but to no avail. Good, Hopkins, Warner, and Chambers were hanged from a large tree outside the jail on the nearby courthouse lawn. The bodies remained hanging for most of the following day, with thousands of people from nearby counties traveling to view them.\n\n\nReactions\nEvents like this lynching in Mount Vernon allowed white southerners to revel in the racist violence that took place in the Midwest. Following the lynching, a Georgia newspaper, The Augusta Chronicle commented that \"It will not do for the North any longer to hold up its hands in horror over the disposition of the South to indulge in lynch law.\"\n\n\nMemorialization\nThe Equal Justice Initiative reports that 18 people were victims of racial terror lynching in Indiana. Ed Warren, Jeff Hopkins, Jim Good, William Chambers, and Dan Harris Sr. are memorialized at the Equal Justice Initiative's National Memorial for Peace and Justice on the Indiana marker. In October 2022, Posey County dedicated a historical marker and a granite bench outside of the Posey County Courthouse.\n\n\nReferences",

However, the cave was given its name by German archaeologist Wolfgang Erich Wendt (1934-2015) in reference to Apollo 11's then-recent return to Earth.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Apollo 11 rock shelter deposits were accumulated in a series of human \"occupational pulses\" over an interval of at least 40 millennia from ~71 ka to 29 ka ago, as confirmed by two independent sources.\n\nThe cave, which is more a rock overhang than a cave, once contained some of the oldest pieces of mobile art ever discovered in southern Africa and the oldest depictions of figurative art in Africa, carbon-14 dated to c. 30,000 years BP. The art slabs found in this cave are referred to as the Apollo 11 Stones. In total, seven grey-brown quartzite slabs were excavated from the cave. These items are now housed at the National Museum of Namibia in Windhoek.\nThe most famous of the stones depicts a drawing of a therianthropic figure that combines human hind legs with an antelope's abdomen, legs, neck and horns, and a feline predator's head into one creature.\nBesides the slabs, the cave contained several white and red paintings. The subject of paintings ranged from simple geometric patterns to bees, which are still a nuisance to the unwary traveler.\nArt was also found near the cave in the form of engravings on the banks of a riverbed and a large limestone boulder located 150 m (490 ft) from the cave. The engravings, which are mostly difficult to see without angled light, consist of depictions of animals as well as simple geometric patterns.\nResearchers who returned to the cave in 2007 found the site had been \"severely vandalized\" and appealed for government protection of the area.\n\n\nSee also\nCaves of Namibia\nUpper Paleolithic\nLate Stone Age\nApollo 11 in popular culture\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nJohn C.

    "text": "Sir John Ernest Buttery Hotson, KCSI, OBE, VD (17 March 1877 – 13 May 1944) was an administrator in India during the British Raj. Born in Glasgow to Hamilton and Margaret (Maggie) Hotson, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy (1889–1895) and Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1899, and MA (1905). He immediately joined the Indian Civil Service, being appointed Superintendent of Managed Estates in Kathiawar. His entire career was devoted to the administration of the province known as the Bombay Presidency. Subsequent positions included Under-Secretary to the Government of Bombay (Political and Judicial Departments), 1907; Collector, 1920; Secretary of the Political Department, 1922; Chief Secretary to the Government, 1924; Member of the Executive Council (MEC) of Bombay, 1926–31; and rising to become Home Member and Acting Governor of Bombay, 1931. He was appointed OBE on 3 June 1918, Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India (CSI) in the New Year Honours, 1926, and elevated to Knight Commander (KCSI) in 1930.\n\n\nNaturalist\nHotson served in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers, 1915 to 1920, in Baluchistan and Persia, attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Hotson was a dedicated naturalist who \"collected plants in Persian Baluchistan and Makran coast, 1916-18, which were sent to Father Blatter in Bombay\". His collections of mammal specimens from the same region during this period was described by the noted British zoologist Oldfield Thomas, FRS, who noted:\n\nAmong the fine series of Mammals from Baluchistan contributed by Col. J.E.B. Hotson to the Bombay Natural History Society there occur a number of interesting small mammals which have been put into my hands for examination. As a result the following new species seem to require description.\nThomas then lists seven new species, two of which, Hotson's Jerboa (Allactaga hotsoni) and Hotson's Mouse-like Hamster (Calomyscus hotsoni) he names after their collector.\nHotson acted as Consul at Shiraz (Persia) between 1918 and 1920, during which time he continued his collecting of native mammals. The specimens he collected between February and August 1919 were described by Major R.E. Cheesman, MBOU, FRGS, and included a new species of Persian Vole (Microtus irani).\n\n\nPost-World War I service\nIn 1924 Hotson married Mildred Alice, daughter of Arthur Bennett Steward (a fellow member of the ICS); this coincides with his elevation to the position of Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. This was a period of rising instability in India, that would lead eventually to its independence from the British crown in 1947. Mahatma Gandhi's theory of non-violent resistance to British rule, Satyagraha, was not always followed, especially within the Presidency (State) of Maharashtra that surrounded Bombay. After the arrest of the national leaders Khurshed Nariman and Jamnalal Bajaj on 8 May 1930, mass demonstrations in the district of Sholapur led the Collector, Mr Knight, to seek advice from Hotson who was now in Bombay as the Home Member. The visit resulted in the imposition of martial law on 12 May. Martial law was lifted on 30 June, however, a year later, on 22 July 1931, as Acting Governor of Bombay in the period after the departure of Sir Frederick Sykes, Hotson was visiting the library of Fergusson College in Pune (Poona) when one of the students, Vasudeo Balwant Gogte (Gogate), attempted to assassinate him. The bullet was stopped by a metal stud on Hotson's clothes, and he escaped unharmed. When asked why he had shot at the Home Member, Gogte is reported to have said \"As a protest against your tyrannical administration\". Remarkably, Hotson did not merely agree to Gogate's early release from Jail, he sent him a cheque for Rs. 100 as a token of goodwill and the hope that it would enable the young man to establish himself in a profession.\nAs well as a naturalist, Hotson was also a keen philatelist, serving as President of the Philatelic Society of India, and editor of the Philatelic Journal of India, 1923–28.\n\n\nNotes",

    "title": "Most favoured nation",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=381424",
    "text": "In international economic relations and international politics, most favoured nation (MFN) is a status or level of treatment accorded by one state to another in international trade. The term means the country which is the recipient of this treatment must nominally receive equal trade advantages as the \"most favoured nation\" by the country granting such treatment (trade advantages include low tariffs or high import quotas). In effect, a country that has been accorded MFN status may not be treated less advantageously than any other country with MFN status by the promising country.\nThere is a debate in legal circles whether MFN clauses in bilateral investment treaties include only substantive rules or also procedural protections. The members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agree to accord MFN status to each other. Exceptions allow for preferential treatment of developing countries, regional free trade areas and customs unions. Together with the principle of national treatment, MFN is one of the cornerstones of WTO trade law.\n\"Most favoured nation\" relationships extend reciprocal bilateral relationships following both the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO norms of reciprocity and non-discrimination. In bilateral reciprocal relationships a particular privilege granted by one party only extends to other parties who reciprocate that privilege, while in a multilateral reciprocal relationship the same privilege would be extended to the group that negotiated a particular privilege. The non-discriminatory component of GATT/WTO applies a reciprocally negotiated privilege to all members of GATT/WTO without respect to their status in negotiating the privilege.\nMost favoured nation status is given to an international trade partner to ensure non-discriminatory trade between all partner countries of the WTO. A country which provides MFN status to another country has to provide concessions, privileges, and immunity in trade agreements. It is the first clause in the GATT. Under rules of WTO, a member country is not allowed to discriminate between trade partners and if a special status is granted to one trade partner, the country is required to extend it to all members of WTO. In a nutshell, MFN is a non-discriminatory trade policy as it ensures equal trading among all WTO member nations rather than exclusive trading privileges.\n\n\nHistory\nThe most favoured nation status starts to appear in the 18th century, when the division of conditional and unconditional most favoured nation status also began. A 1778 trade treaty between the United States and France was a prominent early examples of a conditional most-favoured nation clause. It was common in subsequent trade treaties made by the US. By the mid-19th century, it was heavily used in trade treaties between European states and by Latin American states and Japan.\nIn the early days of international trade, \"most favoured nation\" status was usually used on a dual-party, state-to-state basis. A nation could enter into a \"most favoured nation\" treaty with another nation. In the Treaty of Madrid (1667), Spain granted England \"most favoured nation\" trading status. With the Jay Treaty in 1794, the US also granted the same to Britain. In the Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882, the Korean kingdom Joseon was compelled by the United States to give it most favoured nation status.\nAfter World War II, tariff and trade agreements were negotiated simultaneously by all interested parties through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which ultimately resulted in the World Trade Organization in 1995. The WTO requires members to grant one another \"most favoured nation\" status. A \"most favoured nation\" clause is also included in most bilateral investment treaties concluded between capital exporting and capital importing countries after World War II.\n\n\nBenefits\nTrade experts consider MFN clauses to have the following benefits:\n\nIncreases trade creation and decreases trade diversion. A country that grants MFN on imports will have its imports provided by the most efficient supplier if the most efficient supplier is within the group of MFN. Otherwise, that is, if the most efficient producer is outside the group of MFN and additionally, is charged higher rates of tariffs, then it is possible that trade would merely be diverted from this most efficient producer to a less efficient producer within the group of MFN (or with a tariff rate of 0). This leads to economic costs for the importing country, which can outweigh the gains from free trade.\nMFN allows smaller countries, in particular, to participate in the advantages that larger countries often grant to each other, whereas on their own, smaller countries would often not be powerful enough to negotiate such advantages by themselves.\nGranting MFN has domestic benefits: having one set of tariffs for all countries simplifies the rules and makes them more transparent. Theoretically, if all countries in the world confer MFN status to each other, there will be no need to establish complex and administratively costly rules of origin to determine which country a product (that may contain parts from all over the world) must be attributed to for customs purposes. However, if at least one nation lies outside the MFN alliance, then customs cannot be done away with.\nMFN restrains domestic special interests from obtaining protectionist measures. For example, butter producers in country A may not be able to lobby for high tariffs on butter to prevent cheap imports from developing country B, because, as the higher tariffs would apply to every country, the interests of A's principal ally C might get impaired.\nAs MFN clauses promote non-discrimination among countries, they also tend to promote the objective of free trade in general.\n\n\nExceptions\n\nGATT members recognized in principle that the \"most favoured nation\" rule should be relaxed to accommodate the needs of developing countries, and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (established in 1964) has sought to extend preferential treatment to the exports of the developing countries.\nAnother exception to the \"most favoured nation\" principle has been posed by regional trade blocs such as the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which have lowered or eliminated tariffs among the members while maintaining tariff walls between member nations and the rest of the world. Trade agreements usually allow for exceptions to allow for regional economic integration.\n\n\nRevocation\nWTO rules allow any country to revoke the MFN status that it had previously accorded to another: in particular, Article 21 (National Security) allows it to do so without further explanation.\n\n\nIndia revokes Pakistani status (2019)\nIn February 2019, following the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed over 40 CRPF personnel, India withdrew the MFN status that it had accorded to Pakistan.\n\n\nG7 revokes Russian status (2022)\nIn March 2022, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the G7 countries resolved jointly to withdraw 'most favoured nation' status from Russia and to  impose punitive tariffs. In a statement, the group declared that \"Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order\".\n\n\nSpecific countries' policies\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\nIndia\nAs per the obligation under their World Trade Organization (WTO) treaties of accession, the member countries of WTO automatically extend most favoured nation (MFN) status to each other unless otherwise specified in the agreement or schedule notified to the WTO by that member country. Pursuant to that provision, India has extended MFN status for goods to most member countries of WTO.\nWithin the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are members of the WTO and all excepting Pakistan have extended MFN status to India, which had extended MFN status to all SAARC countries. In 2019, India revoked its MFN status towards Pakistan. So far as exception to MFN status (if any) is concerned, each member country has indicated the same services in its schedule of services commitments, as notified to the WTO.\n\n\nIn contract law\nA most favoured nation clause (also called a most favoured customer clause or most favoured licensee clause) is a contract provision in which a seller (or licensor) agrees to give the buyer (or licensee) the best terms it makes available to any other buyer (or licensee). In some contexts, the use of such clauses may become commonplace, such as when online ebook retailers contract with publishers for the supply of e-books. Use of such clauses, in some contexts, may provoke concerns about anticompetitive influences and antitrust violations, while in other contexts, the influence may be viewed as procompetitive.\nOne example where most favoured nation clauses may appear is in institutional investment advisory contracts, where if a certain number of conditions are met, one client may be entitled to the lowest fee offered to other clients with a substantially identical investment strategy and the same or lower level of assets under management.\nThe most favoured nation clause can also be included in an agreement between a state and a company or an investor. This involves the provision of special privileges and advantages although the state cannot use contractual mechanisms to avoid its MFN treatment obligations with other countries. Unlike the relationship among states where a nation accorded an MFN status cannot be treated less advantageously than another, the host nation does not breach MFN treatment if it provides different privileges to different investors. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development clarified this when it stated that \"a host country cannot be obliged to enter into an individual investment contract\" and that \"freedom of contract prevails over the MFN standard.\" This general principle, however, is not absolute.\n\n\nEuropean Union\nThe current EU competition law position is that MFN clauses will infringe Article 101(i) if in the individual circumstances of the case result in an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the European Union. This is likely to happen when the parties to the agreement have substantial market power.\nIt is recognised by EU courts and regulators that such clauses are widely used in a number of industries including most topically with online travel agents. However the regulatory tide in the EU appears to be turning against the use of these clauses. In a number of recent EU cases in the UK and Germany, MFNs have been condemned when used by companies with significant market power.\n\n\nSee also\nCommercial treaty\nExtraterritoriality\nLike product\nPrerogative\nNational treatment\nUnequal treaty\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAccominotti, Olivier; Flandreau, Marc (2008). \"Bilateral Treaties and The Most-Favored-Nation Clause: The Myth of Trade Liberalization in the Nineteenth Century\".

Under rules of WTO, a member country is not allowed to discriminate between trade partners and if a special status is granted to one trade partner, the country is required to extend it to all members of WTO. In a nutshell, MFN is a non-discriminatory trade policy as it ensures equal trading among all WTO member nations rather than exclusive trading privileges.",

    "text": "Thillalangadi (transl. Defiler) is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language action comedy film directed by M. Raja. A remake of the 2009 Telugu film Kick, it stars Raja's brother Ravi Mohan (credited as Jayam Ravi) along with Tamannaah and Shaam, who reprises his role from Kick, and a supporting cast including Prabhu, Suhasini Maniratnam, Vadivelu, Santhanam, and Sanchita Shetty. The film features a soundtrack composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, whilst Thaman S's original score has been reused. The film, produced by Raja's father Editor Mohan and distributed by Sun Pictures, was released on 23 July 2010.\nThillalangadi depicts the story of Krishna (Jayam Ravi), a brilliant student who has excelled in all aspects of life but loves to have an adventure in his life and would do anything just to experience this kick (addiction).\n\n\nPlot\nKrishna is a happy-go-lucky youth who excels in every field but always does strange and dangerous things to obtain a certain \"kick\" – a thrill or excitement that he craves. One such activity is secretly double-crossing his childhood friend Das while helping him elope. At this point, he meets Nisha, who is shocked at his recklessness and writes him off as crazy. Krishna sets his sights on Nisha and woos her in a very unorthodox way; he begs her not to fall in love with him. After a host of comical situations involving Krishna's caring but easygoing parents, local thugs, and an ever-present comic relief Jackson, Nisha accepts Krishna's love. However, she sets a condition: Krishna must stay in a well-paying job (he had resigned from other jobs due to lack of \"kick\"), and only then will she agree to marry him. Krishna accepts but soon resigns again for the same reason and tries to hide it from Nisha. When Nisha finds out, she breaks up with him and leaves him for good.\nSome months later, Nisha's parents arrange for her to meet a prospective suitor in Malaysia. Though reluctant, she meets the suitor Krishna Kumar, a tough but honest policeman. She narrates the story of her affair with Krishna, and Krishna Kumar reveals that he is tracking a dangerous thief who has stolen large amounts of money from wealthy (mostly corrupt) politicians. At Malaysia, Nisha, her sister, and Jackson run into Krishna again but learn that he has lost his memory and cannot remember his past life. Nisha sees this as an opportunity to start their relationship again from scratch. However, it is revealed that Krishna is not really suffering from amnesia; he has faked his condition by convincing an amnesiac that he is a doctor, and tricked him into diagnosing his condition falsely. Nisha is upset but realizes that it was done due to his love for her, and she has hidden her own feelings from him. They reconcile.\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that the thief whom Krishna Kumar has been tracking is Krishna. His motives are simple; he steals ill-gotten money from politicians to pay for operations of children suffering from cancer. After manipulating various people, such as an MLA, and stealing from them, he is finally caught in the act by Krishna Kumar. Krishna is still unfazed, celebrating his failure at a street party. He dares Krishna Kumar to catch him in his final crime: stealing money from the minister. After many harrowing stunts, Krishna pulls it off successfully. Krishna Kumar is demoted from his job for his failure and is shocked to learn that his replacement is Krishna, who promises to \"guard\" the minister's remaining money. Knowing what is in store for the politicians, Krishna Kumar leaves with a new respect for his foe.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nDevelopment\nAfter the success of the Telugu film Kick in early May 2009, Editor Mohan purchased the remake rights for the Tamil version later the same month. While Mohan himself would produce the film, Mohan's elder son, M. Raja, was made the director, directing again his brother Jayam Ravi, who would later bag the lead role in the film. It is, noticeably, the fifth \"remake project\" of this combo, featuring 'Editor' Mohan as the producer, M. Raja as the director and Jayam Ravi as the lead actor, after Jayam,  M. Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi,  Unakkum Enakkum and Santosh Subramaniam.\n\n\nCasting\nThe lead female role, originally played by Ileana D'Cruz, was eventually won by Tamannaah Bhatia. Initially, the crew had planned to sign Ileana for the same role in Tamil as well and approached her, but her father is said to have refused the offer as he didn't want his daughter to play the same role again. Also actress Bhanu, who had starred in the films Thaamirabharani and the very recently released Azhagar Malai, was approached for the role. However, she, too, refused the offer as she felt the role was too glamorous and she wouldn't fit the role.\nMeanwhile, Shaam, who played a vital role in the Telugu version, took up the same the role in Tamil. Unlike in Raja's earlier remakes, which all had music scored by the composer who scored the original version and the same songs as well (except for M. Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi), composer Yuvan Shankar Raja was hired for the musical score this time, replacing Thaman S, who composed the music of Kick.\n\n\nFilming\nThe film was formally launched on 19 August 2009 at AVM Studios. The first shot, featuring Jayam Ravi and Tamannaah, was directed by S. Shankar, with actor Vijay giving the inaugural clap shot. The launch was attended by many prominent people from the Tamil film industry as Tamil Film Producers Council chief Ramanarayanan, KRG, Abirami Ramanathan, S. A. Chandrasekhar, R. B. Chowdhary, Ram Kumar, Kasthuri Raja, PL Thenappan, actor Karthi and actress Khushbu Sundar among others.\nThe film was shot at various locations, including Chennai (India), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Singapore. The crew, including director Raja, Jayam Ravi, manager Senthil, cinematographer B. Rajasekar and art director Milan had been looking for locations in Malaysia in August 2009, after which the film shooting began. At first, shooting was held in Chennai for nearly 20 days, following which the crew flew to Malaysia, where a major portion of the film was to be shot, where the original film was shot as well. By mid-November, the crew had completed a 30-day schedule in Malaysia. The shoot in Malaysia involved an action sequence, filmed by three cameras simultaneously, which was shot on busy roads with special permissions from the local police authorities and a song sequence featuring Ravi and Tamannaah. Shooting was held also at the famous Petronas Towers and on the Singapore-Malaysian railway line. During the 30-day filming, the September 2009 Sumatra earthquakes occurred, which the team survived. In late January 2010, a special song (\"Solpechu Ketkadha Sundari\"), widely publicized as the \"360 degree song\" was shot. It was filmed using a Nero motion control camera that revolves on a 360 degree angle set, which was handled by an Australian specialist Scott and would later look like a single shot. This song, choreographed by Shobi, which would feature 15 Jayam Ravis and 5 Tamannaahs, was completed in around 45 hours, on which alone nearly Rs. 75 lakhs was said to be spent.\n\n\nMusic\n\nThe Thillalangadi soundtrack is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, working together with director Mohan Raja for the first time. The soundtrack album features 7 songs, two of which have been reused from the original version, composed by Thaman S, as per Raja's wish. The lyrics are penned by Na. Muthukumar and Viveka. The audio was released on 2 July 2010 at the Sun TV studios and premiered on Sun Music in the evening. The background score was taken from the original, scored by Thaman. It comprises the first time working together of two legendary singers K. S. Chithra and Shreya Ghoshal. This duo got a nomination for best Playback Singing on Filmfare Awards South.\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nTheatrical\nThe film had a solo release on 23 July 2010.\n\n\nHome media\nThe film had its television premiere on 21 December 2014 via Sun TV.\n\n\nReception\nA reviewer from Sify rated the film as \"average\" film and added that it is \"boring\". Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff.com cited the film as a \"ridiculous pot-boiler\" and criticised Jeyam Ravi's lacking punch and wafer-thin story line, giving the film a mere 1.5 out of 5.  A critic from The Times of India also criticised the film saying that it \"lacks that light touch needed to carry off the candyfloss content\" as well as Jayam Ravi's performance describing his character as \"a ham of what is simply a ridiculously featherweight character\". A critic from Chennai Online said \"the film somehow manages to entertain with comedy elements\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThillalangadi at IMDb",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=697561",
    "text": "Newfoundland was a British Dominion in eastern North America, today the modern Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  It included the island of Newfoundland, and Labrador on the continental mainland. Newfoundland was one of the original dominions under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, and accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions of the time.  Its dominion status was confirmed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, although the statute was not otherwise applicable to Newfoundland.\nIn 1934, Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status, which ended 79 years of self-government. The abolition of self-government came about because of a crisis in Newfoundland's public finances in 1932. Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island, which was completed in the 1890s, and by raising its own regiment during the First World War. In November 1932, the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt. The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position. The commission's report, published in October 1933, recommended that Newfoundland give up self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer it by an appointed commission.\nThe Newfoundland parliament accepted the recommendations; it then presented a petition to the King to ask for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again. To enable compliance with the request, the British Parliament passed the Newfoundland Act, 1933, and on 16 February 1934, the British government appointed six commissioners, three from Newfoundland and three from the United Kingdom, with the governor as chairman. The system of a six-member Commission of Government continued to govern Newfoundland until Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 to become Canada's tenth province.\n\n\nName and national symbols\nThe official name of the dominion was \"Newfoundland\" and not, as was sometimes reported, \"Dominion of Newfoundland\". The distinction is apparent in many statutes, most notably the Statute of Westminster that listed the full name of each realm, including the \"Dominion of New Zealand\", the \"Dominion of Canada\", and \"Newfoundland\".\n\nThe Newfoundland Red Ensign was used as the de facto national flag of the dominion until the legislature adopted the Union Flag on 15 May 1931.\nThe anthem of the dominion was the \"Ode to Newfoundland\", written by British colonial governor Sir Cavendish Boyle in 1902 during his administration of Newfoundland (1901 to 1904). It was adopted as the dominion's anthem on 20 May 1904, until confederation with Canada in 1949. In 1980, the province of Newfoundland re-adopted the song as a provincial anthem. The \"Ode to Newfoundland\" continues to be heard at public events in the province; however, only the first and last verses are traditionally sung.\n\n\nPolitical origins\n\nNewfoundland was the oldest English colony in North America, being claimed by John Cabot for Henry VII, and again by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1583.  It gradually acquired European settlement; in 1825, it was formally recognised as a Crown colony by the British government.  The British government granted representative government in 1832, and responsible government in 1854. In 1855, Philip Francis Little, a native of Prince Edward Island, won a parliamentary majority over Sir Hugh Hoyles and the Conservatives. Little formed the first administration from 1855 to 1858.\nNewfoundland sent two delegates to the Quebec Conference in 1864 which resulted in Canadian Confederation, but the option of joining was not popular in Newfoundland.  In the 1869 general election, Newfoundlanders rejected confederation with Canada. Sir John Thompson, Prime Minister of Canada, came very close to negotiating Newfoundland's entry into Confederation in 1892.\nNewfoundland remained a colony until the 1907 Imperial Conference resolved to confer dominion status on all self-governing colonies in attendance. The annual holiday of Dominion Day was celebrated each 26 September to commemorate the occasion.\n\n\nFirst World War and afterwards\n\nNewfoundland's own regiment, the 1st Newfoundland Regiment, fought in the First World War. On 1 July 1916, the German Army wiped out most of that regiment at Beaumont Hamel on the first day on the Somme, inflicting 90 percent casualties. Yet the regiment went on to serve with distinction in several subsequent battles, earning the prefix \"Royal\". Despite people's pride in the accomplishments of the regiment, Newfoundland's war debt and pension responsibility for the regiment and the cost of maintaining a trans-island railway led to increased and ultimately unsustainable government debt in the post-war era.\nAfter the war, Newfoundland along with the other dominions sent a separate delegation to the Paris Peace Conference but, unlike the other dominions, Newfoundland neither signed the Treaty of Versailles in her own right nor sought separate membership in the League of Nations.\nIn the 1920s, political scandals wracked the dominion. In 1923, the attorney general arrested Newfoundland's prime minister, Sir Richard Squires, on charges of corruption. Despite his release soon after on bail, a commission of enquiry, headed by Thomas Hollis-Walker, reviewed the scandal. Soon after, the Squires government fell. Squires returned to power in 1928 because of the unpopularity of his successors, the pro-business Walter Stanley Monroe and (briefly) Frederick C. Alderdice (Monroe's cousin), but found himself governing a country suffering from the Great Depression.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council resolved Newfoundland's long-standing Labrador boundary dispute with Canada to the satisfaction of Newfoundland and against Canada (and, in particular, contrary to the wishes of Quebec, the province that bordered Labrador) with a ruling on 1 April 1927. Prior to 1867, the Quebec North Shore portion of the \"Labrador coast\" had shuttled back and forth between the colonies of Lower Canada and Newfoundland. Maps up to 1927 showed the coastal region as part of Newfoundland, with an undefined boundary. The Privy Council ruling established a boundary along the drainage divide separating waters that flowed through the territory to the Labrador coast, although following two straight lines from the Romaine River along the 52nd parallel, then south near 57 degrees west longitude to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Quebec has long rejected the outcome, and Quebec's provincially issued maps do not mark the boundary in the same way as boundaries with Ontario and New Brunswick.\nNewfoundland only gradually implemented its status as a self-governing dominion. In 1921, it officially established the position of High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (for which Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring had already assumed the role in 1918), and it adopted a national flag and established an external affairs department in 1931. Although the legislature of Newfoundland gave its assent to the passage of the Statute of Westminster, when the Statute was finalised the Newfoundland delegation requested that it not come into effect in Newfoundland until the legislature had consented to the application of the statute.  The legislature of Newfoundland never gave its consent, so the statute was not in force in Newfoundland until it joined Canada.\n\n\nEnd of responsible government\n\nAs a small country which relied primarily upon the export of fish, paper, and minerals, Newfoundland was hit hard by the Great Depression. Economic frustration combined with anger over government corruption led to a general dissatisfaction with democratic government. On 5 April 1932, a crowd of 10,000 people marched on the Colonial Building (seat of the House of Assembly) and forced Prime Minister Squires to flee. Squires lost an election held later in 1932. The next government, led once more by Alderdice, called upon the British government to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland's likelihood of defaulting on its war-debt payments, established the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political culture as intrinsically corrupt and its economic prospects as bleak, and advocated the abolition of responsible government and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted itself out of existence in December 1933.\nIn 1934, the British Parliament passed the Newfoundland Act, 1933 which suspended Newfoundland's Legislature and established the Commission of Government.  Letters patent passed under the act provided that Newfoundland was ruled by the governor, who reported to the Colonial Secretary in London, and the commission, appointed by the British government. Newfoundland remained a dominion in name only. The Newfoundland Supreme Court held that the surrender of responsible government and the establishment of the commission of government \"... reduces the Island to the status of a pure Crown colony\".\n\n\nSecond World War\n\nThe severe worldwide Great Depression persisted until the Second World War broke out in 1939.\nGiven Newfoundland's strategic location in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Allies (especially the United States of America) built many military bases there. Large numbers of unskilled men gained the first paycheques they had seen in years by working on construction and in dockside crews. National income doubled as an economic boom took place in the Avalon Peninsula and to a lesser degree in Gander, Botwood, and Stephenville. The United States became the main supplier, and American money and influence diffused rapidly from the military, naval, and air bases. Prosperity returned to the fishing industry by 1943. Government revenues, aided by inflation and new income, quadrupled, even though Newfoundland had tax rates much lower than those in Canada, Britain, or the United States. To the astonishment of all, Newfoundland started financing loans to London. Wartime prosperity ended the long depression and reopened the question of political status.\nThe American Bases Act became law in Newfoundland on 11 June 1941, with American personnel creating drastic social change on the island. This included significant intermarriage between Newfoundland women and American personnel.\nIn October 1943, the weather station Kurt was erected in Labrador, marking Nazi Germany's only armed operation on land in North America.\nA new political party formed in Newfoundland to support closer ties with the US, the Economic Union Party, which Karl McNeil Earle characterizes as \"a short-lived but lively movement for economic union with the United States\". Advocates of union with Canada denounced the Economic Union Party as republican, disloyal and anti-British. No American initiative for union was ever created.\n\n\nNational Convention and referendums\n\nAs soon as prosperity returned during the war, agitation began to end the commission. Newfoundland, with a population of 313,000 (plus 5,200 in Labrador), seemed too small to be independent. In 1945, London announced that a Newfoundland National Convention would be elected to advise on what constitutional choices should be voted on by referendum. Union with the United States was a possibility, but Britain rejected the option and offered instead two options: return to dominion status or continuation of the unpopular Commission. Canada cooperated with Britain to ensure that the option of closer ties with America was not on the referendum.\nIn 1946, an election took place to determine the membership of the Newfoundland National Convention, charged with deciding the future of Newfoundland. The Convention voted to hold a referendum to decide between continuing the Commission of Government or restoring responsible government. Joey Smallwood was a well-known radio personality, writer, organizer, and nationalist who had long criticized British rule. He became the leader of the confederates and moved for the inclusion of a third option – that of confederation with Canada. The Convention defeated his motion, but he did not give up, instead gathering more than 5,000 petition signatures within a fortnight, which he sent to London through the governor. Britain insisted that it would not give Newfoundland any further financial assistance, but added this third option of having Newfoundland join Canada to the ballot. After much debate, the first referendum took place on 3 June 1948, to decide between continuing with the Commission of Government, reverting to dominion status, or joining Canadian Confederation.\nThree parties participated in the referendum campaign: Smallwood's Confederate Association campaigned for the confederation option while in the anti-confederation campaign Peter Cashin's Responsible Government League and Chesley Crosbie's Economic Union Party (both of which called for a vote for responsible government) took part. No party advocated petitioning Britain to continue the Commission of Government. Canada had issued an invitation to join it on generous financial terms. Smallwood was the leading proponent of confederation with Canada, insisting, \"Today we are more disposed to feel that our very manhood, our very creation by God, entitles us to standards of life no lower than our brothers on the mainland.\" Due to persistence, he succeeded in having the Canada option on the referendum. His main opponents were Cashin and Crosbie. Cashin, a former finance minister, led the Responsible Government League, warning against cheap Canadian imports and the high Canadian income tax. Crosbie, a leader of the fishing industry, led the Party for Economic Union with the United States, seeking responsible government first, to be followed by closer ties with the United States, which could be a major source of capital.\nThe result proved inconclusive, with 44.5 percent supporting the restoration of dominion status, 41.1 percent for confederation with Canada, and 14.3 percent for continuing the Commission of Government. Due to no option getting at least 50 percent of the vote, a second referendum with the top two options from the first referendum was scheduled to be held on 22 July. The second referendum, on 22 July 1948, asked Newfoundlanders to choose between confederation and dominion status, and produced a vote of 52 to 48 percent for confederation. Newfoundland joined Canada in the final hours of 31 March 1949.\n\n\nSee also\nCharles Jost Burchell, Canada's High Commissioner to Newfoundland, involved in negotiating union with Canada\nGeneral elections in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation)\nHigh Commissioner of Newfoundland to the United Kingdom\nList of Newfoundland cases of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (pre-1949)\nList of political parties in Newfoundland and Labrador\nList of prime ministers of the Dominion of Newfoundland\n\n\nPolitical parties in the Dominion of Newfoundland\nConservative parties in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation)\nFisherman's Protective Union\nLiberal parties in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation)\nNewfoundland People's Party\nUnited Newfoundland Party\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\nAtlantic Crossroads, a 1945 Allied propaganda film on Newfoundland's role in the Second World War",
    "summary": "Newfoundland was a British Dominion in eastern North America, today the modern Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  It included the island of Newfoundland, and Labrador on the continental mainland. Newfoundland was one of the original dominions under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, and accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions of the time.  Its dominion status was confirmed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, although the statute was not otherwise applicable to Newfoundland.\nIn 1934, Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status, which ended 79 years of self-government. The abolition of self-government came about because of a crisis in Newfoundland's public finances in 1932. Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island, which was completed in the 1890s, and by raising its own regiment during the First World War. In November 1932, the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt. The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position. The commission's report, published in October 1933, recommended that Newfoundland give up self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer it by an appointed commission.\nThe Newfoundland parliament accepted the recommendations; it then presented a petition to the King to ask for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again. To enable compliance with the request, the British Parliament passed the Newfoundland Act, 1933, and on 16 February 1934, the British government appointed six commissioners, three from Newfoundland and three from the United Kingdom, with the governor as chairman. The system of a six-member Commission of Government continued to govern Newfoundland until Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 to become Canada's tenth province.",

The population in 2011 was 1,939, in an area of 21.51 km2.\n\n\nHistory\nA curious legend attributes the name São João de Areias to the apparition of John the Baptist on the banks of the Mondego River. An old woman, upon seeing this vision yelled out Boa Nova! Boa Nova!, so the area was named Nova. Following public notice, the local residents proceeded in procession to their church. Being an image of John the Baptist and owing to the apparition occurring along the sandbank, the town started being referred to as São João de (or das) Areias (Saint John of the Sands).\nThe town of São João de Areias was a municipal seat from 1514 to 1895, when its municipality was divided between Santa Comba Dão and Carregal do Sal municipalities. The locality of São João de Areias, which had vila (town) status possibly since the Middle Ages, eventually lost that title after the extinction of its municipality.\nSão João de Areias only recovered its title of town in the summer of 1997 (following the publication of Law 70/97).\nThe area of São João de Areias was occupied since remote history, from archaeological evidence encountered throughout this region's history, including graves and vestiges of the Roman occupation.\nDocuments from the 10th and 12th century identify the lands of São João de Areias as being donated by the Monastery of Lorvão to the Sé Cathedral of Coimbra and Sé Cathedral of Viseu. From this point forward the territory of this parish encompassed the towns of Silvares, São João de Areias and Parada.\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, São João de Areias was referred to in the Inquiries of Afonso III and other documents of the royal chancellery.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century (10 April 1514 specifically) Manuel I conceded a foral (charter), resulting in the building of the pillory of São João de Areias. The regal population cadastral document for 1527, indicated that the municipality of São João de Areias included the parishes of São João and Parada. Silvares was the seat of a small municipality, alongside that of São João de Areias, where 25 inhabitants (13 in Silvares, eight in Casal and four in Venda [da Guarita]) had homes. Sometime between the 15th and 16th centuries there was a growth in the construction of religious buildings, that would repeat itself in the 18th century. Seven chapels were constructed during this epoch, and dedicated to São Sebastião, São Pedro, São Silvestre, São João Evangelista, Santo António and São Miguel, in addition to a chapel to Nossa Senhora da Graça, and later the chapels dedicated to São José and São Francisco (no Casal).\nDuring the middle of the 17th century, the municipalities of São João de Areias and Silvares was composed of a municipality governed by Presiding Judge, Councilmen (three for São João de Areias and one for Silvares) and an attorney by district Magistrates letter and named His Majesty. This situation continued until the preceding centuries, until the municipality's extinction.\n\n\nGeography\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nCivic\nCasa das Armas Reais - São João de Areias\nCasa de D.ª Georgina Loureiro - Vila Dianteira\nCasa do Dr. José da Silva Carvalho - Vila Dianteira\nSolar dos Serpa Pimentel - Guarita\nCasa dos Neves de Lemos - Póvoa dos Mosqueiros\nPillory of São João de Areias (Pelourinho de São João das Areias)\n\n\nReligious\nChapel of Senhora da Graça (Capela da Senhora da Graça)\nChapel of Cristo (Capela de Santo Cristo)\nChapel of São João Evangelista (Capela de São João Evangelista)\nChapel of São Miguel (Capela de São Miguel)\nChapel of São Pedro (Capela de São Pedro)\nChurch of São João Baptista (Igreja Matriz de São João de Areias/Igreja de São João Baptista), the 18th-century parochial church of São João de Areias\n\n\nNotable citizens\nJosé da Silva Carvalho (1782–1856), labourer of the 1820 Revolution and minister of D.

    "text": "Veniamin Efimovich Basner (Russian: Вениами́н Ефи́мович Ба́снер, 1 January 1925 in Yaroslavl – 3 September 1996 in St Petersburg) was a Russian composer. He was recognized by the Soviet Union as a People's Artist of Russia and a State prize-winner. An asteroid called 4267 Basner, discovered in 1971, was named in his honour. He was a member of the St Petersburg Union of Composers.\n\n\nEarly life and initial success\nVeniamin Basner had been playing the violin from the age of six and graduated from the Leningrad Conservatory in 1949 with the violin as his principal instrument.\nBasner made his first experiments in composition at the age of fifteen.\nIn 1955 he was a prize-winner, for his Second String Quartet, at the International Composers' Competition in Warsaw. Biographer Alexander Uteshev has remarked that this marked the start of his most intense period of creative activity.\n\n\nBasner and Shostakovich\nVeniamin Basner, while still a student, met Dmitri Shostakovich, under whose advice his formation as a professional composer was furthered. They became personal friends. Basner’s widow, Lusha Basner, has elaborated on how Basner became Shostakovich’s student: \"Basner wanted to take composition lessons from Shostakovich, but didn’t dare to approach him. Shostakovich, who was a sensitive person, noticed this and helped Basner by asking him to light his cigarette. That’s how Shostakovich became Basner’s teacher.\"\nAnother in his circle of friends was Mieczysław Weinberg who, as revealed by Lusha Basner, entrusted his archive to Basner after he was released from his arrest in 1953. At the time Basner held an influential position in the Composers’ Union - and \"Weinberg trusted him.\"\nMuch later, Basner and Weinberg were amongst the six friends of Shostakovich (the others being Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, and Boris Tishchenko) who rejected the controversial Testimony (Свидетельство), said to be the \"authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich.\" (As stated in the article on Testimony.)\n\n\nCompositions\nBasner’s musical output spanned a wide spectrum in terms of genre and emotional substance. It encompasses, at the more academic end, thirteen works for musical theatre, symphonic suites, three symphonies, vocal symphonic cycles, two concertos and five quartets, which have been performed to critical acclaim in Russia and beyond. At a more popular level, he became widely known, reaching millions of people through his film music - for more than a hundred productions - and his over three hundred song compositions.\nHe drew particular inspiration from the events and pathos of the Second World War in works which, as Uteshev puts it, express simultaneously the “confession of a lonely soul as well as a voice of national grief.” The Fourth Quartet and Violin Sonata particularly evoke the pain of personal loss - as does, for example, the song On The Nameless Height (На безымянной высоте), based on a real event and is about three soldiers, fifteen of whose friends had died in battle. Melodies from his well-known songs are woven into more substantial works such as the Second Symphony and the Fifth Quartet.\nThe most important and impressive quality of Veniamin Basner's music, suggests Uteshev, is “an inspired lyricism [which] powerfully permeates all his art.”\n\n\nRecordings\nRecordings include:\n\nSuites for Films The Immortal Garrison, \"The Leningrad Symphony\", Destiny of a Man – performed by the Academic Symphonic Orchestra of the Leningrad Philharmonic.\nString Quartets recorded by the Taneyev Quartet.\nValery Gavrilin recorded a ‘’First German Notebook’’ in 1981, with Sergei Leiferkus (baritone) and Irina Golovnyova (piano), Sound-producer Gerhard Tses. Included are recordings of songs by Vladimir Shcherbachov, Veniamin Basner, Yuri Falik. Compozitor, St. Petersburg\nIn 2004 the Amsterdam-based Jewish Music Projects compiled (2004) a programme Zun mit a regn (Sun and Rain) - the Jewish element in the music of Mieczysław Weinberg, Veniamin Basner and Dmitri Shostakovich. Basner’s 1950 Poem for violin and piano (Opus 7 No 1) was featured. The programme was originally inspired by an invitation to participate in a St Petersburg festival commemorating the 80th anniversary of the birth of Veniamin Basner. CDs have subsequently been produced, in 2009, which also include three Russian songs by Basner from the 1994 musical Yevreiske Styastye (Jewish Luck) after the novel Mendel Marantz, by David Freedman, libretto by Boris Pantser.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nVeniamin Basner at Find a Grave",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=72443738",
    "text": "Mohsen Shekari (Persian: محسن شکاری; 24 February 2000 – 8 December 2022) was a 22-year-old Iranian man who was executed by the state of Iran after being convicted of injuring a member of Iran's Basij militia and being accused of Moharebeh, an Arabic word translating to \"waging war against God\".\nShekari's death is noteworthy for being the first known state-sanctioned execution to have occurred as a direct result of the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests. His execution drew immediate condemnation from human rights organizations who expressed concerns that Shekari's execution, as well as the subsequent execution of Majidreza Rahnavard four days later, would catalyze a rash of state executions of protesters.\n\n\nReported crime\n\nOn 25 September 2022, Shekari attended a protest against the death of Mahsa Amini in Tehran, Iran's capital city. During the protest, Iranian authorities asserted that he blocked or closed off a main road in Tehran, Sattar Khan Street, and used a machete to non-fatally wound a member of the Basij militia, which was sent in to quell the protests. The militiaman required 13 stitches in his left shoulder as a result of the injury, according to the Iranian Student News Agency.\nShekari's family has disputed the Iranian authorities' version of events and claimed that Shekari used non-violent means to separate protestors and security forces. Shekari's uncle, Mahmoud Shekari, told reporters that after witnessing security forces attacking protestors, Shekari had removed a guardrail and placed it in the middle of the street to block off the area.\nThe Iranian judiciary's news agency Mizan reported on Shekari's charges following the execution; he was also accused of being a \"rioter\". Mashregh News Agency, which is linked to the state military of Iran, published a video reportedly showing Shekari confessing, although his family doubted the validity of the confession and due to his facial injuries raised claims that he had been tortured. The video showed Shekari confessing that a friend encouraged him to attend the protests and offered him a bribe to assault a police officer.\n\n\nLegal\nShekari's trial took place on 1 November 2022, presided over by Judge Abolqasem Salavati. Shekari was found guilty of drawing a weapon \"with the intention of killing, causing terror and disturbing the order and security of society,\" as well as moharebeh, or \"enmity against God\" under Sharia, the latter of which carries an automatic death sentence. Shekari's judge had the choice to impose a lighter sentence, including deportation, but he did not opt to do so.\nShekari appealed the verdict. The Supreme Court of Iran upheld the verdict on 20 November 2022, despite the fact that Shekari was not represented by his lawyer at the time of the appeal.\n\n\nExecution\nShekari was executed by hanging on the morning of 8 December 2022. He was 22 years old. His family waited outside the jail awaiting updates on his fate while the execution took place. The Tasnim News Agency, which has connections with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, confirmed that Shekari's execution had taken place, but did not provide any other information. While at least 459 protesters have been killed by police since the Mahsa Amini protests began in September 2022, Shekari's execution made him the first person confirmed to have been judicially executed for his alleged role in the protests.\nAfter Shekari's execution, his uncle criticized Iranian officials for not giving his family possession of Shekari's body for burial. He accused Iranian officials of sending the family to two separate cemeteries, neither of which contained Shekari's remains. Multiple families of other protesters killed by police during the Mahsa Amini protests have made similar complaints.\n\n\nAftermath\nFollowing the execution, Iranian state television aired portions of Shekari's detention and trial. The footage showed Shekari limping down a hallway and offered excerpts from his testimony wherein he was wielding a knife and reenacting the attack. A video was posted to TikTok by an Iranian protest monitor, which depicted a woman, reportedly Shekari's mother, crying in the street with a caption claiming her emotional reaction after his mother was told that Shekari had been executed while the family was still waiting on an appeal.\nOn 6 December, a spokesperson for the Iranian judiciary announced that five people reportedly involved in the killing of Rouhollah Ajamian, a member of the Basij, were sentenced to death, but could appeal their verdicts.\nAmnesty International reported after Shekari's execution that a senior Iranian police commander had signed a document requesting the public execution of one prisoner connected with the protests \"in the shortest time possible\", specifically requesting that the execution be public \"as a heart-warming gesture towards the security forces.\" On 12 December, four days after Shekari's execution, Iran carried out the execution of Majidreza Rahnavard in public.\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nDomestic\nSeveral activists, lawyers, and Iranian citizens condemned the execution on social media. They claimed that Shekari was denied access to a lawyer during his interrogations and other legal proceedings leading up to his death. Many highlighted the fact that there had only been 74 days between Shekari's arrest and execution, which is an abnormally short period in comparison to similar trials. They also brought awareness that there were other detainees besides Shekari who were at imminent risk of execution.\nEven Iranian clerics and legal experts that are seen close to the government, including Ayatollah Morteza Moghtadai, the former head of Iran's Supreme Court, have voiced their opposition to the use of the death penalty in connection with the enmity against God charge that was brought against him. Mohsen Borhani, an assistant professor of criminal law at University of Tehran, has strongly condemned Shekari's execution in a debate in Imam Sadiq University, a religious institution founded by the conservative politician, Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani, that has been instrumental in the recruitment of hardliner politicians in the Islamic Republic.\nIranian actor Navid Mohammadzadeh made a post on Instagram reading, \"Nothing washes off blood.\" The post tagged Shekari's name. Another Iranian actor, Taraneh Alidoosti, made an Instagram post following Shekari's execution reading, \"Your silence means supporting oppression and oppressors.\" She added, \"Every international organization who is watching this bloodshed and not taking action, is a disgrace to humanity.\" Many other celebrities have condemned Shakeri's execution and the government's use of sham trials and death sentences, including prominent Iranian footballer Ali Karimi, well-known actresses Golshifteh Farahani and Nazanin Boniadi, and Iranian rapper Hichkas.\nSharyar, a protester who was held in prison before being released, tweeted that he and Shekari had crossed paths during their incarceration and that \"Mohsen Shekari loved life — he was waiting for his freedom.\" He said Shekari was a \"quiet young man\" who had worked at a Tehran café before deciding to join the protests, and that Shekari held hope that his death sentence would be commuted to 10 years in prison.\n\n\nIranian officials\nOn 5 December 2022, three days before Shekari's execution, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps praised Iran's judiciary for its hardline stance against the protesters and encouraged quick and decisive judgments for defendants accused of crimes related to the protests, including \"crimes against the security of the nation and Islam.\"\nThe deputy director of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Program, Sanam Vakil, noted that Shekari's execution sent a message to protestors that the state was \"[signifying] the apogee of its toleration. Up until now, the system sees itself as having shown restraint, but this execution could be the endpoint to that.\" Likewise, Iran's police chief, Hossein Ashtari, stated on Thursday, \"[T]he police will not show restraint in dealing with security threats.\"\n\n\nHuman rights advocates\nSome human rights groups, primarily based in European countries or the US, condemned Shekari's execution immediately.  Iran Human Rights director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam wrote after the execution that it \"must be [met] with STRONG reactions,\" or \"we will be facing daily executions of prisoners. This execution must have rapid practical consequences internationally.\" Amiry-Moghaddam also called Shekari's trial a \"show trial without any due process\" in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Court, criticizing The Revolutionary Court's tradition of holding trials behind closed doors, not allowing accused parties to pick their own lawyers, and not allowing accused parties to review the evidence that will be used against them.\nIn an interview featured in the reformist newspaper Etemad, sociology professor Taghi Azadarmaki warned that the judicial system's punishment of protesters would backfire: \"If the system punishes the protesters, people's behavior will become radical, and their patience will end. The news of issuing death sentences and long-term prisons is dangerous. If this trend continues, people will tend towards fundamentalist changes.\"\nAmnesty International said they were \"horrified\" at the execution, saying it had only been three weeks between Shekari's \"grossly unfair sham trial\" and his death. Amnesty called Shekari's execution \"yet another illustration of the fact that the authorities are resorting to the death penalty as a weapon of political oppression. . . .

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani stated that Iran had \"passed the point of no return\";\n The European Union said it \"condemns his execution in the strongest possible terms\".

He was accepted as a candidate for ordination by Archbishop Reginald Herbert Owen, and entered theological training at College House (University of Canterbury), and the University of New Zealand. \nHe was ordained deacon in 1961 and priest in 1962. His first post was as a curate at Wanganui from 1961 to 1964, followed by a decade of missionary work in Pakistan and the Middle East. In 1972, he completed a PhD in Sociology at the University of Karachi. \nIn 1975 he was appointed Principal of St Andrew's Hall a Church Mission Society missionary training college in Melbourne. He returned to New Zealand in 1979, where he was Vicar of All Saints' Church in Palmerston North. \n\n\nArchbishop of Melbourne\nIn 1982 he became a bishop coadjutor in the Diocese of Melbourne before becoming the archbishop two years later. Though remaining strongly Evangelical, he was passionately committed to dialogue between religious traditions. He ordained the first women to the diaconate in Melbourne in 1986 and was also a supporter of women's ordination to the priesthood in the Anglican church, proposing canons on this issue at three successive General Synods. \nHe was a member of the first Australian Palliative Care Council, President of the Australian Council of Churches, Patron of the National AIDS Trust and a member of the Australian National Council on AIDS. On his way to Britain for the 1988 Lambeth Conference he undertook a highly secretive detour to Iran in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to secure the release of Terry Waite, the personal envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and several other western hostages.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nOn 24 July 1989, after returning home from the Tokyo World Conference on Religion and Peace and the Lausanne Evangelical Congress in Manila, where he delivered a series of Bible studies, he suffered a severe heart attack. He was kept on life-support in Melbourne's St Vincent's hospital, but although he regained consciousness, he died on 1 October 1989. He was 53. His state funeral service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne on  6 October 1989.\n\n\nReferences",

It hosts the administration of Tarashcha urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 9,689 (2022 estimate).\n\n\nHistory\nTarashcha is an historic Cossack town (in the 17th century through 17th century - rather a city). It was founded when the area was under the ultimate control of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nUntil the mid-20th century, the town had a significant Jewish community, being a shtetl. The town was occupied by the German army on July 23, 1941.\nJews were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David, were not allowed to buy food and were relegated to forced labour. Afterward, a ghetto was established on Tarasha Street. Executions of the Jewish population were carried out by German security forces, S.S. Viking Division, detachment of Einsatzgruppe, in cooperation with Einsatzkommando 5 and local police. The execution of Jews started from the very first days of German occupation. Several executions were conducted. The main actions took place in August 1941, with 400 Jewish victims; on September 10, 1941, during which several hundred Jews were killed; while on November 9, 1941, the ghetto was liquidated. Altogether, up to 1,000 Jews were exterminated in Tarashcha between August and November 1941.\n\n\nModern developments\nRecently, the town has become known as the place of the clandestine burial and later recovery of Georgiy Gongadze, a Ukrainian journalist kidnapped and murdered in 2000.\n\nAlso, the Tarashcha Raion is closely associated with the prominent Ukrainian politician Oleksandr Moroz: he was born and started his career here, later became elected to the parliament from the local constituency. Moroz is the most notable and influential person in the neighborhood. There were even speculations between these two facts and Moroz's significant role in Gongadze case and Cassette Scandal.\nUntil 18 July 2020, Tarashcha was the administrative center of Tarashcha Raion. The raion was abolished that day as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven.

    "text": "The Canterbury election of 1205 was a contested election to the Archbishopric of Canterbury that led to the long quarrel between King John of England and Pope Innocent III.\n\n\nBackground\nKing John's attempt to force John de Gray's election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. Traditionally English kings had broad powers over the English Church, and this had survived the Becket controversy during John's father's reign. John, however, reigned concurrently with Innocent III, who was one of the foremost exponents of the concept of papal monarchy.\nAfter Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. King John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisors.\nWhile the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, Reginald, as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When King John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop. Some stories have Reginald's election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the papal curia. Another source, Gervase of Canterbury, has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray's election. A further story, from Roger of Wendover, states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter – the younger ones – participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.\nDe Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which presented Innocent with two candidates for the office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent's approval. John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an interdict on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only English bishops not in exile or dead. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences",

He studied first in Dresden at the Academy of Fine Arts (Akademie der bildenden Künste). In 1806 he moved to his brother in Vienna, where he attended the Akademie der bildenden Künste Wien. Here he came to the notice of the General Director of Museums in Paris, Dominique Vivant, Baron de Denon, and on his advice moved to Paris in 1809. He remained there for five years, during which he was occupied on a work about the campaigns of Napoleon. He returned to Vienna, and then in 1819 accompanied the painter Johann Christoph Erhard to Italy. After spending time in Rome and Naples he toured Sicily in the company of Prince Lobkowitz. Once back in Rome, he tried to dissuade his friend Erhard from committing suicide, but not only failed to do so but also in the attempt fell terminally ill himself, and died at the age of 36. He was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, where his monument features sculpture by Bertel Thorvaldsen.\n\n\nWorks\nApart from his illustration work, Reinhold was principally a landscape artist.

    "text": "The Pamplonita River is the main river of the Colombian city of Cúcuta and one of the most important of the Norte de Santander Department.\nThe Pamplonita River was used to transport cacao, the main form of wealth in the region and a major axis of the economy during the 18th and 19th centuries.\nIt begins, at an elevation of 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level, in the hill of Altogrande, the desert of Fontibón, the neighborhoods of Pamplona.\nIt descends by the valley of the Cariongo, leaves by the big hole of Pamplona and follows towards the northwest, until the height of Chinácota, receives waters of the Honda gorge and continues lowering until the valley of Cúcuta, through where it happens tired, and when leaving it is joined with the Táchira, until ending at the mighty Zulia river, that throws them to the lake of Maracaibo. Most of his course one occurs to 150 ms on the level of the sea.\nIts river basin is located on the eastern mountain range, extending by the southwest of north of Santander, from Pamplona to Puerto Santander.\nIn the 1960s, the World Health Organization worked with national health officials to extend clean water supplies to Pamplona.\nAmigos del Río (River Friends) for the Pamplonita River at Cucuta, works to rehabilitate and improve the river.\n\n\nFlora and Fauna\nThe vegetation cover in the Pamplonita basin is represented mostly by secondary forests, with an area of 253.6 km². 75 orders, 143 families, and 560 reported species have been identified for the basin. Among the orders with the most representation are the mirtales and rosales, with 7 families; followed by sapindales and liliales (6 families) and fabales, malvales and violales (5 families). According to the lists of threatened flora species and the Red Book of Phanerogamic Plants of Colombia, there are 18 species with some type of threat in the river basin.\n\n\nFauna\nIn birds there are 19 orders, 52 families and 258 species, the Passeriforme order being the most dominant with 21 families, followed by the Piciforme order with 4 families, Apodiforme, Caprimulgiformes, Charadriformes, Ciconiforme, Coraciforme, Falconiforme with 3 families and another 11 genera with 1 family.\nRegarding families, the most frequent is Trochilidae with 26 species, followed by the Tyrannidae family with 25 species, known as flycatchers and pirire, Furnariidae with 13 species, commonly called guito and trepapalo, Thraupidae and Accipritidae each with 11 species.\nIn mammals a list of 52 species was compiled, registered in 26 families and 9 orders. The most represented family is Murdidae, corresponding to mice, with 7 species; followed by the Mustelidae with 5, which includes the weasel and the marten, and the Felidae and Didelphidae (fara family) with 4 each.\nIn amphibians, 13 species, 2 orders and 8 families have been identified. The Hylidae family (Frogs) has 3 species and the remaining 6 have one species.\nIn the book Peces del Pamplonita , a study carried out between 2012 and 2013 by Ecopetrol resulted in more than 60 species, eight of them classified as vulnerable and 23 highlighted as important for human consumption. Another 31 are endemic, that is, exclusive to the Lake Maracaibo basin and 12 of them ornamental.\n\n\nEnvironmental problems\nThe municipalities of Cúcuta, Pamplona, Los Patios, Chinácota, Bochalema and Pamplonita, and the districts of El Diamante, La Donjuana, La Garita, San Faustino and Agua Clara belong to the Pamplonita river basin. It supplies 65% of the population of Norte de Santander.\nIt receives the first negative ecological impact when it becomes a receiver of waste water from Pamplona, and begins to lose the quality of its water. Then, it becomes the depository of decomposed water from Los Patios and Cúcuta. The city of Cúcuta dumps 722 liters of waste water into the river every second, which represents 76% of the total.\nAnother source of contamination is the discharges from the slaughterhouses of Pamplona and Bochalema, and pesticides and agrochemicals. Decree 1541 establishes the obtaining of a concession as a requirement for the use of water, as a legal mechanism to preserve the availability of the water resource, and gives priority to its use. However, many of the derivations and intakes that the river suffers are not legalized or subject to control.\n\n\nAverage flow\nIn the municipal development plan of Cúcuta 2008-2011 the average flow figures were 15 m³/s, already in 2015 this was drastically reduced, according to the Cúcuta aqueduct and sewerage company the water level is 10 m³/s and in times of drought it is 5 m³/s.\nA study carried out by Corponor in mid-2019, resulted in the measurement of the level of the Pamplonita River being 464 liters per second by the San Rafael bridge, while the ring road sector was 762 liters per second.\n\n\nTributaries\nThe main tributaries are:\non the right bank:\nthe Monteadentro, Los Negros, Los Cerezos, Zipachá, Tanauca, Ulagá, El Gabro, El Ganso, Santa Helena, Cucalina, La Teja, De Piedra, La Palmita, Matagira, La Chorrera, Iscalá, Honda, Cascarena, Villa Felisa, Ciénaga, Juana Paula, Don Pedro, Faustinera, Europea, Rodea, and Aguasucia streams.\nthe Táchira and Viejo rivers and the Las Brujas, Caghicana, and Guardo streams.\non the left bank:\nthe ravines of Navarro, San Antonio, La Palma, Hojancha, La Laguna, Batagá, Galindo, Santa Lucia, Las Colonias, El Laurel, Chiracoca, Montuosa, El Masato, Quebraditas, Aguanegra, Zorzana, El Ojito, Jaguala, Viajaguala, Tio Jose, El Magro, Aguadas, La Rinconada, Periquera, Voladora, La Sarrera, La Cuguera, Guaimaraca, Aguaclarera and Palermo.\nand the channels of La Trigrera, Negro, El Oso, Chipo.\n\n\nRecent history\nThe river is 155 km long from its source to its mouth in the Zulia River, its biggest problems are the felling of trees and waste water.\nIn a 14-year report (1987 and 2001), 2,455 hectares of natural forests were lost and there was an alteration of the flow in the middle part of the basin, by 2001, of less than two cubic meters per second.\nIn 1991, an epidemic occurred in the river with animals.\nIn 2007 and 2011, the river experienced a series of crises due to the oil spill. The spill of 10 thousand barrels of oil on the most important water source for the region that supplies 700 thousand inhabitants.\nWith the first oil spill, 11 families of macroinvertebrates of the 18 existing ones died. After that, a recovery process began that allowed the species to return to the river, but with the second spill only 11 species remained. There were 21 species of fish living there and after this environmental disaster, 8 species remained.\nWith the 90 km oil spill, the Pamplonita River accelerated 50 years of its disappearance.\nIn April 2013, a tanker truck overturned, causing a spill of 15 thousand liters of biodiesel into one of the river's tributary streams.\nIn 2014, hundreds of fish appeared dead on the banks of the Pamplonita River that it runs through, mojarras and fingerlings. Environmental authorities said that this could probably have been caused by the high sedimentation that the river flow presents on the sector where sewage from several urbanizations flow directly, another theory could be that they use the river as a garbage dump in nearby fish farms which gained strength when determining that the fish were not native, however the mayor of Cúcuta on its website reported that the cause was due to lack of oxygen as a result of high temperatures.\nA report presented by Corponor in September 2015 said that the river flow ranges between 4,200 and 3,600 liters per second, and due to the drought they are seeking to reduce the supply to the Cúcuta aqueduct by 30%.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The CVV-4 Pellicano (English: Pelican) was a single seat Italian glider designed for a competition to select an aircraft for the 1940 Olympic Games. The DFS Olympia Meise was preferred to it after the trials in Italy in 1939.\n\n\nDesign and development\nThe CVV-4 Pellicano was one of two Italian designs competing to become the preferred Olympic glider at the 1940 Olympic Games. Had they happened, these Games would have been the first to host a gliding event. It was planned that all competitors should fly the same 15 m (49 ft 3 in) span type and designs from Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were evaluated for the role at Sezze in Italy in February 1939.\nThe Pellicano was designed by the Centro Studi ed Ezperienze per il Volo a Vela (CVV) of the Politecnico di Milano, who had a tradition of glider development. A typical late 1930s glider, it had an all wood frame and was covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. The Pellicano was a mid-wing monoplane, with significant dihedral on the centre section forming a gull wing, rather fashionable at the time. In plan the wing was straight tapered, with rounded tips. It was built around a ply covered D-box leading edge with fabric covering aft. Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of the outer, zero dihedral section and there were mid-chord airbrakes, opening above and below the wings, towards the outer end of the centre section. At the wing root the plywood skin extended to the trailing edge. The choice of NACA rather than Göttingen airfoils, the former less cambered and so faster, was a little unusual.\nThe Pellicano had an oval cross-section, ply skinned monocoque fuselage tapering rearwards. The narrow chord fixed rear surfaces were ply covered with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and forward of the fin. The control surfaces were fabric covered and the rudder, broad and deep, moved in a gap between the elevators. The pilot sat ahead of the leading edge of the wing under a multi-piece canopy with a rather upright windscreen and which merged into the upper fuselage aft. There was no landing wheel, just a skid which ended under the wings and a very small tail skid.\n\n\nOperational history\nThe Pellicano took part in the olympic competition held in Sezze Littoria, near Rome in February 1939, have only just made its first flight and with little further testing.  It was not successful as the German DFS Olympia Meise was chosen for the Olympic event and, though this did not take place, went into post-World War II production in several European countries. The Pellicano remained a popular aircraft locally though production numbers are uncertain. Another source says that only the single prototype, I-ABNJ, was built and it the only one on the official records.\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nData from Sailplanes 1920–1945General characteristics\nCrew: One\nLength: 6.60 m (21 ft 8 in)\nWingspan: 15.00 m (49 ft 3 in)\nWing area: 14.7 m2 (158 sq ft)\nAspect ratio: 15.3\nAirfoil: root: NACA 2416; mid-span: NACA 2412; tip: NACA 0012\nEmpty weight: 160 kg (353 lb) structure\nGross weight: 255 kg (562 lb)\nPerformance\n\nMaximum glide ratio: 23:1\nRate of sink: 0.7 m/s (140 ft/min) minimum\nWing loading: 17.3 kg/m2 (3.5 lb/sq ft)\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Justin Morris Bibb (born April 26, 1987) is an American politician and former non-profit leader serving as the 58th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio since January 2022. Prior to serving as mayor, Bibb worked with public officials, business leaders and community organizations across the country as the Chief Strategy Officer of Urbanova, a business that leads new initiatives to make cities safer, healthier and more resilient. Bibb was the Co-Chair of Teach for America – Ohio, and a board member for the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, Destination Cleveland, and LAND Studio.\nOn January 12, 2021, Bibb announced his candidacy in the 2021 Cleveland mayoral election. In the crowded eight candidate primary, Bibb came in first with 27% of the vote in the September 14th primary, advancing him to the general election alongside the President of Cleveland City Council, Kevin J. Kelley. On November 2, 2021, Bibb won the city's mayoral election, defeating Kelley with a decisive 62% of the vote, becoming Cleveland's 4th African American mayor, and its 2nd youngest.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBibb was born in Cleveland and grew up in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood and on the southeast side in Garfield Heights, Ohio. Bibb is a graduate of Trinity High School. After high school, he attended American University in Washington, D.C. where he earned a B.A in Urban Studies. During his undergraduate degree, he studied abroad at the London School of Economics where he completed The General Course program in Social Policy and Economics. In 2014, he returned to Cleveland and attended Case Western Reserve University School of Law and received his JD and MBA.\n\n\nCareer\n\nBibb served as an intern for then-Senator Barack Obama in 2007 and began working in local government in 2011 as for Cuyahoga County, where he established the Cuyahoga County Public Policy Fellowship Program. Bibb spent two years working in corporate strategy for Knowledge Generation Bureau before taking senior positions at Gallup, Inc.. After working in New York and Washington, D.C, he returned to Cleveland to serve as vice president at KeyBank in 2019. He worked as an executive at Urbanova, a business focused on technology for cities. He also co-founded Hack Cleveland in 2014 following the death of Tamir Rice to advocate for criminal justice reform using civic technology.\n\n\nMayor of Cleveland\n\n\nElection\n\n\n2021\n\nBibb formally announced his candidacy for mayor of Cleveland in early 2021, promising to bring new leadership and a sense of urgency to Cleveland's problems. He pledged to make public safety his number one priority. Three months after launching his committee, Bibb's campaign announced that it had raised $180,000, a significant sum for a first-time candidate and more than other candidates in the 2017 primaries. According to a December 2020 poll, Bibb had just 2% support among likely voters.\n3,000 valid petition signatures were required to make the ballot for the 2021 Cleveland mayoral election, which was seen as a relatively high hurdle for candidacy. Bibb filed his petition to run for Cleveland Mayor at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections on June 10, 2021, and was announced as one of seven candidates to make the ballot on June 16, 2021.\nBibb gained momentum in the primary with a strong showing at the Cleveland Mayoral Candidates Forum on Criminal Justice held on April 28, 2021. He also brought attention to a chronic issue of predatory property owners in Cleveland taking advantage of residents by calling out well-known out-of-town landlord Holton Wise at a press conference.\nOn August 8, 2021, Bibb was endorsed by the editorial board of cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer, Cleveland's major newspaper. On August 18, 2021, Bibb was endorsed by two former Cleveland mayors, Michael R. White and Jane Campbell.\nOn September 14, 2021, Bibb placed first in the mayoral primary, advancing him to the November 2 general election alongside City Council President Kevin Kelley. Bibb was then endorsed by dozens of prominent Black pastors including Revs. Otis Moss Jr. and E. T. Caviness. He was also endorsed by previous primary opponents Zack Reed and Sandra Williams.\nOn November 2, 2021, Bibb defeated Kelley in the general election, receiving 62.86 percent of the vote, with a turnout of 23%. Bibb won 12 of Cleveland’s 17 wards, included winning 9 of 10 East Side wards with 70% of the vote or more.\n\n\nTenure\n\nOn January 3, 2022, Bibb was sworn in as the 58th Mayor of Cleveland.\n\n\nPublic safety\nIn July 2023, Bibb announced The Raising Investment in Safety for Everyone (RISE) Initiative to address violent crime.\nOne of the aims of the RISE initiative was to close Cleveland's police officer shortage. At a Public Safety Summit in August 2023, the Bibb administration, the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association and Fraternal Order of Police, agreed to change officer shifts to 12 hours to spread out staffing and reduce overtime payments and offer a pay increase to Cleveland officers. With these changes, the Cleveland Police Department will be in the 75th percentile for officer salary in Ohio. In November 2023, Bibb proposed to amend a September 2012 ordinance that set the maximum age to join the police force in Cleveland at 40 years old. Bibb would raise the age to 55 in an effort to encourage more citizens to join the police force. Cleveland had recently experienced a shortage of police officers and Bibb believes increasing the maximum age gives more opportunity for an increase of officers.\nIn October 2023, Bibb announced a plan for a ten million dollar Neighborhood Safety Fund in hopes of improving public safety in Cleveland. Bibb seeks to use the funds to help foster education and mentorship in an effort to combat the root causes of crime in the city. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cities across the country, including Cleveland, received funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). Bibb is able to use the funding from the ARPA stimulus relief for Cleveland's Neighborhood Safety Fund and must allocate the funds before the end of 2026.\nOne of Bibb's public policy initiatives has been focusing on reforming the Cleveland Police Department. With the goal of promoting accountability throughout the department, Cleveland voters passed Issue 24, a ballot initiative that created a commission made up of 13 Cleveland community members. The implementation of Issue 24 allows for citizens selected to the commission to make decisions surrounding the department's training, recruitment, and disciplinary action. The commission also takes power away from the city's public safety director and chief of police while putting it in the hands of Cleveland citizens.\nBibb also unveiled a plan to generate a new deal with the city of Cleveland and the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association. Bibb's office, along with the Cleveland Police Union, agreed to shorten officer shifts to 12 hours and offer a pay increase to Cleveland officers.\nCity Hall\nIn August 2023, the Bibb administration unveiled a new City of Cleveland website. The City also launched an Open Data Portal with crime reports, city land bank lots, Census data and parcel-by-parcel property conditions. The portal will expedite public records request and allow residents to view city data.\nIn May 2023, Bibb proposed a new policy that would provide parental leave to eligible Cleveland city employees. The policy would allow for 20 hours of leave prior to the birth or adoption of a new child and 480 hours of leave following. There would also be a provision to provide leave for employees who experience a loss of pregnancy. The legislation was approved by the Cleveland City Council in June 2023 and will apply to approximately 7,000 city employees.\n\n\nHousing policy\nIn September 2023, Bibb introduced the \"Residents First\" plan intended to address housing issues. The plan would tighten housing codes and introduce civil penalties for code violations. The plan also focuses on vacant properties, introducing systems in an attempt to prevent livable properties from sitting empty.\nIn February 2023, Bibb announced his \"Home for Every Neighbor Policy\" which focuses on helping the city’s unsheltered find permanent housing.\nEconomic Development\nThe Bibb administration utilized $50 million of American Rescue Plan Act funding for a Site Readiness for Good Jobs Fund. The fund will revitalize thousands of acres of vacant lots and brownfields in the City of Cleveland into shovel-ready job sites, and has a potential to create 60,000 jobs.\nMayor Bibb also presented a new lakefront and riverfront plan with a \"shore to core to shore\" approach. In March 2024, City Council passed Mayor Bibb's legislation creating a tax-increment finance district in Downtown Cleveland.  It is expected to generate between $3.5 billion to $7.5 billion in new revenue over the next 42 years.\nThe Bibb administration also announced new municipal income tax credits, a new economic development tool for the city.\n\n\nBudget and Finances\nBibb has passed structurally balanced budgets in 2023 and 2024.\nIn September, 2022, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the City of Cleveland issuer rating to Aa3 from A1 for the first time in 12 years. The higher issuer rating enhances the city's ability to finance capital improvements.\n\n\nAppointments\nIn March 2023, Bibb appointed Calley Mersmann and Jeffrey Weston Sleasman to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.\nIn June 2023, Bibb appointed two new members to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District Board of Education, Robert Briggs and Diana Welch Howell. He also reappointed three existing members to the board, Sara Elaqad, Leah Hudnall and Denise Link. Elaqad serves as the new board chair with Hudnall as the new vice chair.\nIn July 2023, Bibb appointed Andrew Sargeant to the Cleveland City Planning Commission. He named Michael Sanbury and Dr. Regennia Williams to the Cleveland Landmarks Commission. Bibb also announced the appointment of Luz Pellot, Robert Render III and Jay Westbrook to the Cleveland Community Relations Board. Additionally, Roland Muhammad and Rev. Charles Lucas were reappointed by Bibb to the Community Relations Board.\n\n\nFamily\nBibb's father was a police officer and firefighter.  His first cousin once-removed is journalist Leon Bibb.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Mayoral Site\nCampaign website",

This uncrewed orbiter was to map the surface of Venus using high resolution imaging systems. The spacecraft was identical to Venera 15 and based on modifications to the earlier Venera space probes. The latest data from the spacecraft were received on June 13, 1985, when it responded to the signal sent from Earth for Vega 1.\n\n\nMission profile\nVenera 16 was launched on June 7, 1983, at 02:32:00 UTC and reached Venus's orbit on October 11, 1983.\nThe spacecraft was inserted into Venus orbit a day apart from Venera 15, with its orbital plane shifted by an angle of approximately 4° relative to one another probe. This made it possible to reimage an area if necessary. The spacecraft was in a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis of ~1,000 kilometres (620 mi), at 62°N latitude, and an apoapsis of ~65,000 kilometres (40,000 mi), with an inclination ~90°, the orbital period being ~24 hours.\nTogether with Venera 15, the spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole down to about 30°N latitude (i.e., approx. 25% of Venus's surface) over the 8 months of mapping operations.\n\n\nSpacecraft structure\nThe Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were identical and were based on modifications to the orbiter portions of the Venera 9 and Venera 14 probes. Each spacecraft consisted of a 5 metres (16 ft) long cylinder with a 0.6 m (2.0 ft) diameter, 1.4 m (4.6 ft) tall parabolic dish antenna for the synthetic aperture radar at one end. A 1-metre (3 ft 3 in) diameter parabolic dish antenna for the radio altimeter was also located at this end. The electrical axis of the radio altimeter antenna was lined up with the axis of the cylinder. The electrical axis of the SAR deviated from the spacecraft axis by 10 degrees. During imaging, the radio altimeter would be lined up with the center of the planet (local vertical) and the SAR would be looking off to the side at 10 degrees. A bulge at the opposite end of the cylinder held fuel tanks and propulsion units. Two square solar arrays extended like wings from the sides of the cylinder. A 2.6-metre (8.5 ft) radio dish antenna for communications was also attached to the side of the cylinder. The spacecraft each weighed 4,000 kilograms (8,800 lb).\nBoth Venera 15 and 16 were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar. A radar was necessary in this mission because nothing else would be able to penetrate the dense clouds of Venus. The probes were equipped with on board computers that saved the images until the entire image was complete.\nList of spacecraft instruments and experiments:\n\nPolyus-V Synthetic Aperture Radar\nOmega Radar Altimeter\nInfrared Fourier Spectrometer\nCosmic-Ray Detectors (6 sensors)\nSolar-Plasma Detectors\nTo get to Venus, Venera 16 was placed in a heliocentric orbit with perihelion of 0.71 astronomical units, aphelion of 1.01 astronomical units, eccentricity of 0.17, orbital inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 293 days.\n\n\nSee also\n\nList of missions to Venus\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Soviet Exploration of Venus\nCatalog of Soviet Venus images\nVenera 16 Archived February 10, 2020, at the Wayback Machine\nVenera 15/16 Radar Mosaic Browser",

    "text": "The Tax Inspector is a 1991 novel by Peter Carey, published in Australia by the University of Queensland Press, in the UK by Faber & Faber and, at the start of 1992, by A. A. Knopf in the US. Its barbed portrayal of a dysfunctional New South Wales family brought the author strong national criticism.\n\n\nPlot\nCatchprice Motors is a terminally run-down used car business founded by 'Cacka' Catchprice and his wife Frieda in the 1940s but now resembling nothing more than a \"badly tended family grave\". The business is in Franklin, New South Wales, which used to be a country town twenty miles from Sydney. Since then Sydney has swollen in size and Franklin finds itself only two miles beyond the outermost suburbs; it too has become built up and is largely inhabited by indigent immigrants. Responsibility for running the business rests mainly with Frieda's daughter Cathy, an aspiring Country and Western singer, and her manager husband, Howie McPherson, a \"Rockabilly throwback\" with pencil-line moustache and ducktail haircut. \nAll of the Catchprice children were abused when young and are dysfunctional in their various ways. Their mother Frieda, who had turned a blind eye to Cacka's behaviour while he was alive, would rather have run a flower farm on their plot. Cathy was brought up on opera but now writes her own country material and longs to be on the road with her band. Of her brothers, Mort works as a morose mechanic, in denial about his upbringing. The younger brother, Jack, has left for Sydney and a successful career as a property developer. Mort has two sons, as abused by him as he by his father. The elder has escaped to join a Hare Krishna ashram in Sydney; though he has changed his name from Johnny to Vishnabarnu, he remains a Catchprice at the beck and call of his family. The mentally unstable younger son, Benny, was the only one in the family to be content until he is sacked from the business for inefficiency. His condition then worsens into delusion. \nInto this scenario enters Maria Takis, the Tax Inspector, who takes vengeful pleasure in investigating the affairs of the rich and privileged. Unmarried and eight months pregnant, she has now been sidelined into auditing the finances of Catchprice Motors. By doing so she acts as the catalyst that destabilises the lives of all the family members and forces them to acknowledge what the past has made of them.  Jack falls in love with her and is ready to renounce his affluent lifestyle. Cathy at last makes the decision to quit the business and follow her dream. Frieda believes the remedy for her increasingly senile confusion is to dynamite the garage. \nBenny too believes he is in love with Maria and kidnaps her. As the buildings blow up about the waterlogged cellar in which he has his den, Maria gives birth and bludgeons Benny to death in order to save her child.\n\n\nResponses\nThe Tax Inspector was Peter Carey's first novel following Oscar and Lucinda, which had won the Booker Prize in 1988. Begun as a reaction to hearing the then premier of Queensland declare his intention to cut the taxes of the affluent classes, his \"nihilistic Gothic saga\" went through twelve drafts and raised controversy for its references to child abuse and its criticism of high level corruption. As a result, Carey was described as a \"national conscience\" by one critic and accused of being anti-Australian by others.\nAssessments in general praised the quality of the writing while criticising the story's shortcomings. Francine Prose, for example, reviewing the book for The New York Times, commented that \"to summarize the novel's characters or its twisted plot is to risk making the book sound simply cartoonish, quirky and grotesque\". However, the author's style is admirable. \"Peter Carey writes beautiful sentences, worked on but not labored; his descriptive passages sweep us along and leave us in some felicitous, unanticipated place.\"\nReturning to the novel a decade later, David Carroll found himself broadly in agreement as to the persuasiveness of Carey's writing. He \"concentrates on the characters and their stories, conveying his wonderful knack for detail and the twisted yet compelling logic that underpins his societies\", but for all that \"the novel didn't really work\".  \"Why is it,\" he quotes Richard Glover complaining in his review of The Tax Inspector on its first appearance, and drawing a parallel with the 1990s fashion for demented murderers, \"Why is it…that every time I pick up a literary novel these days, I seem to end up in some cellar with a demented sexual pervert?\" (The Sydney Morning Herald, 27/7/1991).\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Beth Elliott (born 1950) is an American folk singer, activist, and writer. In the early 1970s, Elliot was involved with the Daughters of Bilitis and the West Coast Lesbian Conference in California. She became the centre of a controversy when a minority of attendees in the 1973 Conference, including a keynote speaker, called for her removal because of her trans status.\n\n\nEarly life\nElliott was born on November 26, 1950, in Vallejo, California. She was raised Catholic and is of Italian, Irish, and French Huguenot descent. Elliott stated that she started to have feelings of gender dysphoria when she was a child and began transitioning in her late teens.\n\n\nDaughters of Bilitis\nElliot served as vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of the lesbian political group Daughters of Bilitis from 1971 to 1972, during which she served as editor of the chapter's newsletter, Sisters. When she first joined in 1971, her right to join was heatedly debated because of her sex. The organization was split and eventually voted 35 to 29 against the inclusion of trans women in the San Francisco chapter of the DOB; When the vote was announced, the editorial staff of Sisters left the organization in solidarity with Elliott. Her college friend and member of the lesbian separatist Gutter Dykes Collective publicly accused her of sexually harassing her years earlier, which Elliott has denied, claiming she had made false accusations to save face with her group when it was revealed they were acquainted.\n\n\nWest Coast Lesbian Conference\nBeth Elliott continued her involvement in the women's movement and helped to create the West Coast Lesbian Conference which took place in April 1973. She was on the organization committee and was asked to perform as a singer in the conference's entertainment program. However, on the first night when she took the stage she met considerable opposition. Lesbian separatist group, The Gutter Dykes, had leafleted in protest of Elliott's presence, claiming she was a man, and approached the stage with hostility. Other performers, Jeanne Cordova, Robin Tyler, and Patty Harrison, have stated that they responded by defending Elliott and established the need for a vote on whether Elliott's performance should continue. It took over an hour to count the roughly 1,300 attendees and resulted in a reported two-thirds in favor of Elliott's performance. Some accounts state 3:1 in Elliott's favor while others state it as a bare majority. Elliott gave a brief performance and went on to leave the conference.\nThe following day, keynote speaker Robin Morgan gave her address, which she had altered after the events of the previous night. In the speech, titled \"Lesbianism and Feminism: Synonyms or Contradictions?\" Morgan referred to Elliott as a \"gatecrashing...male transvestite\" and, using male pronouns, charged her as \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer—with the mentality of a rapist.\"\n\n\nPost-conference\nThe incident at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, the largest lesbian gathering precedented, left a lasting impression. Not only was Elliott emotionally and socially scarred, but the words defaming her circulated among grassroots lesbian networks and began the 'transsexual rapist' trope.\" The event was the first time many feminists encountered the question of trans women's inclusion in the movement. Elliott was left ostracized from much of the women's and lesbian community due to the controversial division emerging among feminists, including her derailment from her career in the women's music scene.\n\n\nLife and career\nBeth Elliott has been publishing since the mid 1970s on bisexuality, feminism, the AIDS movement, sex positivity, and transgenderism. Additionally, Elliott is the author of several books published by ENC Press. Her 1996 memoir, Mirrors: Portrait of a Lesbian Transsexual, was described as a “classic in lesbian feminist and transgender/transsexual literary history” by the Bay Area Reporter. She reprised the book in 2011, adding a new introduction and afterword as well as a chapter recounting of her experience at the West Coast Lesbian Conference. She is also the author of the science fiction novel, Don’t Call it “Virtual” published in 2003.\nShe has been involved in political work in support of gay rights and co-founded the Alice B. Toklas LGBT Club. She was elected as a board member for the California Committee for Sexual Law Reform which, in 1975, supported Willie Brown to pass legislation repealing anti-gay sodomy laws in California.\nShe has been a folk musician since the late 1960s and was active in the Haight-Ashbury hippie music scene in the 1970s. Her latest work is the album entitled \"Buried Treasure,\" released independently in 2005.\n\n\nReferences",

Designed by the architect Robert Kerr in 1862–68, it is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\nHistory\nGreathed Manor, originally called Ford Manor, was designed by Robert Kerr for the Spender-Clay family, and was completed in 1868. The actress Joyce Grenfell was related to the family by marriage and often visited the house. Accounts of her time there are described in her autobiography “Joyce Grenfell Requests the Pleasure”.  In 1904 Herbert Spender-Clay, MP and founder of the 1922 Committee, married Pauline Astor, daughter of the American billionaire William Waldorf Astor. The couple lived at the house until 1937.\nGreathed Manor was requisitioned by the British Government during both World Wars. In the Great War it became a Hospital for wounded American Army officers. In the Second World War it was used as the Headquarters of a Canadian Armoured Division in the run-up to D-Day. It acted as temporary premises for the London College of Divinity between 1947 and 1957. The house was renamed Greathed Manor when the widowed Pauline Spender-Clay built a smaller house in the grounds of the original building, and requested that the new house be called Ford Manor. The original building was then leased by the Country Houses Association (CHA), which renamed the house after their Founder, Admiral Greathed. In 2008, following the collapse of the CHA, Greathed Manor was converted to a private nursing home, and is currently operated by Pressbeau Ltd.\n\n\nArchitecture\nKerr was an influential mid-Victorian architect who wrote The Gentleman's House - Or, How To Plan English Residences, From The Parsonage To The Palace, published in 1864. Kerr's influence was greater than his talent; the architectural critic Ian Nairn described Greathed as; \"over-confident, making no concessions to the landscape or anything else, without any (...) artistic sincerity, an extreme example of a justly neglected type\". The architectural historian Mark Girouard was no more complimentary, describing the house as \"appalling\" and Kerr's most significant work, Bearwood House, as of a \"design [...] as heavyweight as (its) technology\".\nThe manor is of stone, and mainly of three storeys. Until renovations in 1912, the building had a large porte-cochère at the front, and a winter garden at the rear.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nGirouard, Mark (1979). The Victorian Country House.

In 1943, he was assassinated by gunfire in a mission in Taybad, Iran. He was from a Sunni Hazara family. The Hazaras are an ethnic group native to the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan. Before Iran was forced to relinquish Herat according to the Treaty of Paris in 1857 during the reign of Naser al-Din Shah, the country was in possession of a much greater part of Greater Khorasan. One of the tribes that roamed in this part prior to cession, were the Hazaras. The tribe settled on both sides of the border after the border between Iran and Afghanistan was drawn. The leadership of this tribe at the end of the Qajar period and also the Pahlavi period was with Sulat al-Sultanah Hazara.\n\n\nKhorasan Revolt\nReza Shah summoned Sulat al-Sultanah from Mashhad and imprisoned him in Tehran following a policy of settlement and repression of nomads to be comfortable with Hazaras. After about two years, in 1935, he was deported to Fars with his family and was given land in Yazd and Firuzabad, instead of Khorasan properties. Despite the difficult conditions, Hazaras had extensive construction and agricultural efforts in Fars, which also produced significant results. However, following the events of September 1941 and the return of the Qashqai khans to Fars, who were the main owners of properties assigned to the Hazaras and the cessation of the proceeds of these properties, the situation changed.\nHe returned to Tehran after the Allies occupied Iran and Reza Shah was forced to abdicate. After his efforts to reclaim properties in Tehran did not side and even received death threats, he went to Khorasan and communicated with many heads of local tribes and readers in Mashhad and asked them for help in gaining lost power. In this way, with the help of his brother, \"Mantesur al-Mulk\", he started a rebellion that was the starting point in the border town of Taybad.\nThe Sulat al-Sultanah rebellion began in January 1942. His forces were sent from Taybad to Mashhad, and later the rebel forces occupied Bakharz and Fariman and were determined to capture the city of Mashhad. This was while Sulat al-Sultanah was still in Mashhad and led the rebellion from the city. He stated Mashhad after his forces seized the city of Fariman. In part, it stated:\n\nWe say loudly that we are against any kind of dictatorial regime, even though it prevails in every country. We are not willing to go under any kind of government except a democratic government, and we ask other dear compatriots to cooperate with us to save the country from oppression.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Hazara people\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nداستان ناتمام صولت السلطنه هزاره خانِ بزرگ تايباد و باخرز",

    "title": "Polar motion",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1475418",
    "text": "Polar motion of the Earth is the motion of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its crust. This is measured with respect to a reference frame in which the solid Earth is fixed (a so-called Earth-centered, Earth-fixed or ECEF reference frame). This variation is a few meters on the surface of the Earth.\n\n\nAnalysis\nPolar motion is defined relative to a conventionally defined reference axis, the CIO (Conventional International Origin), being the pole's average location over the year 1900. It consists of three major components: a free oscillation called Chandler wobble with a period of about 435 days, an annual oscillation, and an irregular drift in the direction of the 80th meridian west, which has lately been less extremely west.\n\n\nCauses\nThe slow drift, about 20 m since 1900, is partly due to motions in the Earth's core and mantle, and partly to the redistribution of water mass as the Greenland ice sheet melts, and to isostatic rebound, i.e. the slow rise of land that was formerly burdened with ice sheets or glaciers. The drift is roughly along the 80th meridian west. Since about 2000, the pole has found a less extreme drift, which is roughly along the central meridian. This less dramatically westward drift of motion is attributed to the global scale mass transport between the oceans and the continents.\nMajor earthquakes cause abrupt polar motion by altering the volume distribution of the Earth's solid mass. These shifts are quite small in magnitude relative to the long-term core/mantle and isostatic rebound components of polar motion.\n\n\nPrinciple\nIn the absence of external torques, the vector of the angular momentum M of a rotating system remains constant and is directed toward a fixed point in space. If the earth were perfectly symmetrical and rigid, M would remain aligned with its axis of symmetry, which would also be its axis of rotation. In the case of the Earth, it is almost identical with its axis of rotation, with the discrepancy due to shifts of mass on the planet's surface. The vector of the figure axis F of the system (or maximum principal axis, the axis which yields the largest value of moment of inertia) wobbles around M. This motion is called Euler's free nutation. For a rigid Earth which is an oblate spheroid to a good approximation, the figure axis F would be its geometric axis defined by the geographic north and south pole, and identical with the axis of its polar moment of inertia. The Euler period of free nutation is\n(1)   τE = 1/νE = A/(C − A) sidereal days ≈ 307 sidereal days ≈ 0.84 sidereal years\nνE = 1.19 is the normalized Euler frequency (in units of reciprocal years), C = 8.04 × 1037 kg m2 is the polar moment of inertia of the Earth, A is its mean equatorial moment of inertia, and C − A = 2.61 × 1035 kg m2.\nThe observed angle between the figure axis of the Earth F and its angular momentum M is a few hundred milliarcseconds (mas). This rotation can be interpreted as a linear displacement of either geographical pole amounting to several meters on the surface of the Earth: 100 mas subtends an arc length of 3.082 m, when converted to radians and multiplied by the Earth's polar radius (6,356,752.3 m). Using the geometric axis as the primary axis of a new body-fixed coordinate system, one arrives at the Euler equation of a gyroscope describing the apparent motion of the rotation axis about the geometric axis of the Earth. This is the so-called polar motion.\nObservations show that the figure axis exhibits an annual wobble forced by surface mass displacement via atmospheric and/or ocean dynamics, while the free nutation is much larger than the Euler period and of the order of 435 to 445 sidereal days. This observed free nutation is called Chandler wobble. There exist, in addition, polar motions with smaller periods of the order of decades. Finally, a secular polar drift of about 0.10 m per year in the direction of 80° west has been observed which is due to mass redistribution within the Earth's interior by continental drift, and/or slow motions within mantle and core which gives rise to changes of the moment of inertia.\nThe annual variation was discovered by Karl Friedrich Küstner in 1885 by exact measurements of the\nvariation of the latitude of stars, while S.C. Chandler found the free nutation in 1891. Both periods superpose, giving rise to a beat frequency with a period of about 5 to 8 years (see Figure 1).\nThis polar motion should not be confused with the changing direction of the Earth's rotation axis relative to the stars with different periods, caused mostly by the torques on the Geoid due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun. They are also called nutations, except for the slowest, which is the precession of the equinoxes.\n\n\nObservations\nPolar motion is observed routinely by space geodesy methods such as very-long-baseline interferometry, lunar laser ranging and satellite laser ranging. The annual component is rather constant in amplitude, and its frequency varies by not more than 1 to 2%. The amplitude of the Chandler wobble, however, varies by a factor of three, and its frequency by up to 7%. Its maximum amplitude during the last 100 years never exceeded 230 mas.\nThe Chandler wobble is usually considered a resonance phenomenon, a free nutation that is excited by a source and then dies away with a time constant τD of the order of 100 years. It is a measure of the elastic reaction of the Earth. It is also the explanation for the deviation of the Chandler period from the Euler period. However, rather than dying away, the Chandler wobble, continuously observed for more than 100 years, varies in amplitude and shows a sometimes rapid frequency shift within a few years. This reciprocal behavior between amplitude and frequency has been described by the empirical formula:\n(2)   m = 3.7/(ν − 0.816)   (for 0.83 < ν < 0.9)\nwith m the observed amplitude (in units of mas), and ν the frequency (in units of reciprocal sidereal years) of the Chandler wobble. In order to generate the Chandler wobble, recurring excitation is necessary. Seismic activity, groundwater movement, snow load, or atmospheric interannual dynamics have been suggested as such recurring forces, e.g. Atmospheric excitation seems to be the most likely candidate. Others propose a combination of atmospheric and oceanic processes, with the dominant excitation mechanism being ocean‐bottom pressure fluctuations.\nCurrent and historic polar motion data is available from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service's Earth orientation parameters. Note in using this data that the convention is to define px to be positive along 0° longitude and py to be positive along 90°E longitude.\n\n\nTheory\n\n\nAnnual component\n\nThere is now general agreement that the annual component of polar motion is a forced motion excited predominantly by atmospheric dynamics. There exist two external forces to excite polar motion: atmospheric winds, and pressure loading. The main component is pressure forcing, which is a standing wave of the form:\n(3)   p = p0Θ1−3(θ) cos[2πνA(t − t0)] cos(λ − λ0)\nwith p0 a pressure amplitude, Θ1−3 a Hough function describing the latitude distribution of the atmospheric pressure on the ground, θ the geographic co-latitude, t the time of year, t0 a time delay, νA = 1.003 the normalized frequency of one solar year, λ the longitude, and λ0 the longitude of maximum pressure. The Hough function in a first approximation is proportional to sin θ cos θ. Such standing wave represents the seasonally varying spatial difference of the Earth's surface pressure. In northern winter, there is a pressure high over the North Atlantic Ocean and a pressure low over Siberia with temperature differences of the order of 50°, and vice versa in summer, thus an unbalanced mass distribution on the surface of the Earth. The position of the vector m of the annual component describes an ellipse (Figure 2). The calculated ratio between major and minor axis of the ellipse is\n(4)   m1/m2 = νC\nwhere νC is the Chandler resonance frequency. The result is in good agreement with the observations.\nFrom Figure 2 together with eq.(4), one obtains νC = 0.83, corresponding to a Chandler resonance period of\n(5)   τC = 441 sidereal days = 1.20 sidereal years\np0 = 2.2 hPa, λ0 = −170° the latitude of maximum pressure, and t0 = −0.07 years = −25 days.\nIt is difficult to estimate the effect of the ocean, which may slightly increase the value of maximum ground pressure necessary to generate the annual wobble. This ocean effect has been estimated to be of the order of 5–10%.\n\n\nChandler wobble\n\nIt is improbable that the internal parameters of the Earth responsible for the Chandler wobble would be time dependent on such short time intervals. Moreover, the observed stability of the annual component argues against any hypothesis of a variable Chandler resonance frequency. One possible explanation for the observed frequency-amplitude behavior would be a forced, but slowly changing quasi-periodic excitation by interannually varying atmospheric dynamics. Indeed, a quasi-14 month period has been found in coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models, and a regional 14-month signal in regional sea surface temperature has been observed.\nTo describe such behavior theoretically, one starts with the Euler equation with pressure loading as in eq.(3), however now with a slowly changing frequency ν, and replaces the frequency ν by a complex frequency ν + iνD, where νD simulates dissipation due to the elastic reaction of the Earth's interior. As in Figure 2, the result is the sum of a prograde and a retrograde circular polarized wave. For frequencies ν < 0.9 the retrograde wave can be neglected, and there remains the circular propagating prograde wave where the vector of polar motion moves on a circle in anti-clockwise direction. The magnitude of m becomes:\n(6)   m = 14.5 p0 νC/[(ν − νC)2 + νD2]1⁄2   (for ν < 0.9)\nIt is a resonance curve which can be approximated at its flanks by\n(7)   m ≈ 14.5 p0 νC/|ν − νC|   (for (ν − νC)2 ≫ νD2)\nThe maximum amplitude of m at ν = νC becomes\n(8)   mmax = 14.5 p0 νC/νD\nIn the range of validity of the empirical formula eq.(2), there is reasonable agreement with eq.(7). From eqs.(2) and (7), one finds the number p0 ∼ 0.2 hPa. The observed maximum value of m yields mmax ≥ 230 mas. Together with eq.(8), one obtains\n(9)   τD = 1/νD ≥ 100 years\nThe number of the maximum pressure amplitude is tiny, indeed. It clearly indicates the resonance amplification of Chandler wobble in the environment of the Chandler resonance frequency.\n\n\nSee also\nGeodesy\nInternational Polar Motion Service\nPole shift hypothesis\nPole tide\nTrue polar wander\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nMcCarthy, Dennis D.

He began studying the oud at the age of 12 in Baghdad, following in the footsteps of Jamil and Munir Bashir. He received his diploma from the Baghdad Academy of Music in 1987. He began to teach oud after three years at the academy, as well as continuing his own studies. Shamma has composed music for films, plays and television and created the Arabic Oud House.\nAmong other recognitions, Shamma has been distinguished as UNESCO Artist for Peace and by the International Red Crescent and Red Cross Societies as goodwill ambassador.\nIn the 1980s, Shamma was accused by the Iraqi government of criticising Saddam Hussein.  He was asked to visit the Iraqi embassy to Amman, where he was kidnapped and transported against his will to Iraq where he was imprisoned.  He was interrogated for weeks, and was sentenced to death without a court hearing.  He was ultimately released without any meaningful process.

He has been singing for over thirty years and has released over twenty albums. His first album was released in 1973.

    "text": "Jonah Kirsten Sorrentino (born June 26, 1975), better known by his stage name KJ-52, is a Christian rapper from Tampa, Florida. He was awarded the Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year for \"Never Look Away\" and Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year at the GMA Dove Awards of 2007. On July 28, 2009, KJ-52 released \"End of My Rope\", which is the first single for his album Five-Two Television.\n\n\nName\nThe \"KJ\" part of his name refers to his old rap alias, \"King J. Mac\", a name which he later described in one of his podcasts as \"horribly cheesy\". \"52\", which is pronounced \"five two\", not \"fifty-two\", is a reference to the Biblical story of Jesus feeding the multitude with five loaves and two fish, which is also sung about in his song \"Push Up\" from The Yearbook and in the \"KJ Five Two\" on It's Pronounced Five Two. \n\n\nCareer\nIn 2002, Sorrentino released his second album, Collaborations. The album's title referred to the numerous contributions made to the album by guest artists, including Pillar, John Reuben and Thousand Foot Krutch. Collaborations also represented his first nomination for a Dove Award, for \"Rap/Hip Hop/Dance Album of the Year\" in 2003.\nKJ-52 has won four Dove Awards, three in the \"Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year\" category. He took the 2004 award for It’s Pronounced Five Two, the 2006 award for Behind the Musik (A Boy Named Jonah), and the 2007 award for Remixed. He received an additional honor in 2007, for \"Never Look Away\" from Behind the Musik, in the \"Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song\" category. KJ never tried out for American Idol, but suggested such in his song \"Fivetweezy\".\nIn October 2008, he released his album, The Yearbook: The Missing Pages, a re-release of his album, The Yearbook. It comes with the original record with a slip over cover that has a code to download the 13 songs.\n2009 Dove Awards\nAnother productive year for KJ-52 as he was awarded with \"Rap/Hip Hop Song of the Year\" for \"Do Yo Thang\"; The Yearbook; KJ-52; Jonah Sorrentino; BEC Recordings/Uprok\nIn 2009, he released \"Five-Two Television\", an album covering a variety of themes and rap styles. It is his first album in which autotune is used, a controversial step among his fans. The album brings us the (fictitious) story of Chris Carlino, a man who has ruined his life, through a series of interludes. As usual for KJ-52, the album includes both songs with a strong Christian message and songs that are meant only to entertain.\nKJ-52 also rapped in the Newsboys cover of \"Jesus Freak\".\nKJ-52 also rapped in the tobyMac remix of the song \"One World\" on the album Hip-Hope which also includes the KJ-52 remixed song \"What You Want\".\nKJ-52 released Dangerous on April 3, 2012. It mixes hip hop album with quite a bit of synth, and has some pop-electric. The first released single, \"Dangerous\", is more light rock-pop. The second single is called \"Shake Em Up\", but is commonly spelled \"Shakem Up\". It features guest artists such as Canton Jones on \"It's Goin Down\", Lecrae on \"They Like Me\", Thi'sl on \"Shake Em Up\", George Moss on \"Do the Bill Cosby\", and more. His final track, \"Go\", is a remake of the Hillsong United song with the same name.\nIn 2017, KJ-52 released his first independent album Jonah. The project was over 200% funded through Pledge Music. Following the release of the album, KJ-52 began working on an independent documentary about his life with filmmaker Denver Bailey. The film went on to raise 125% of the goal through kickstarter.  The film was released alongside KJ-52's second independent album titled \"Jonah Pt. 2\" on February 15, 2018.\nIn 2019, KJ-52 released What Happened Was, a joint album with CHH producer and 2019 Rapzilla Freshman, PoetiCS. The album features Xay Hill, Jodie Jermaine, Mitch Darrell, V. Rose, Dre Murray, and Dru Bex. The project was coupled with KJ's first book, also titled What Happened Was. Both the album and the book were over 170% funded through Kickstarter.\nOn November 5, 2019, KJ-52 announced that he would be retiring from music after the release of his next album.\nAs of January 6, 2020, he joined the pastoral staff of Christian Life Fellowship in Cape Coral, Florida.\n\n\nEminem and \"Dear Slim\"\nChristian sources often compared KJ-52 to Eminem, with many calling him a \"Christian counterpart\". One of the most notable mainstream reactions to the Christian hip hop scene was to KJ-52 and his single \"Dear Slim\", which was written to Eminem in an attempt to reach him with the message of the gospel. The song became famous and controversial among Eminem fans when it was featured on the hit show Total Request Live. KJ-52 began to receive hate mail (including death threats) from Eminem's fans, though KJ-52 claimed that the song was not being disrespectful. The artist addressed it in a follow-up song titled \"Dear Slim Pt. 2\".\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nSide projects and other releases\nPeace of Mind's self-titled album (2003, BEC)\nSoul Purpose with T.C.

    "text": "Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and human rights activist. He came to prominence as the original frontman of the rock band Genesis. He left the band in 1975 and launched a solo career with \"Solsbury Hill\" as his first single. After releasing four successful studio albums, all titled Peter Gabriel, his fifth studio album, So (1986), became his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. The album's most successful single, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. A 2011 Time report said \"Sledgehammer\" was the most played music video of all time on MTV.\nA supporter of world music for much of his career, Gabriel co-founded the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival in 1982, and has continued to produce and promote world music through his Real World Records label. He has pioneered digital distribution methods for music by co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. He has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the human rights organisation Witness in 1992. He developed the idea for The Elders, an organisation of public figures noted as peace activists, alongside Nelson Mandela and Richard Branson in 2007.\nGabriel has won three Brit Awards, six Grammy Awards, 13 MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the Q Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was named a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his \"influence on generations of music makers\". In recognition of his human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize laureates in 2006, and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. AllMusic described him as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, and as a solo artist in 2014. In recognition of his musical achievements, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in 2015.\n\n\nEarly life\nGabriel was born in Chobham on 13 February 1950, the son of Edith Irene (née Allen, 1921–2016) and Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912–2012). His maternal grandfather was Colonel Edward Allen, chairman of the Civil Service Department Store on London's Strand, and his paternal grandfather was Christopher Burton Gabriel (1876–1947). His mother came from a musical family, while his father was an electrical engineer and dairy farm owner from a long-established family of London timber importers and merchants. He was raised at Deep Pool Farm, a Victorian manor near Chobham. His great-great-great-uncle, Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet, was Lord Mayor of London from 1866 to 1877, who in turn was the grandson of Cornish Plane maker Christopher Gabriel. Gabriel attended the private primary school Cable House in Woking and St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in Horsell. During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he instead opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom.\nGabriel later remarked of his early influences, \"Hymns played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to soul music before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back.\" He wrote his first song, \"Sammy the Slug\", at age 12. An aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons around this time, but he used it to buy the Beatles' debut album Please Please Me, which had just been released. In September 1963, he started at the public Charterhouse School in Godalming. There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band, the trad jazz outfit the Milords (or M'Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word, which recorded an acetate in 1966. Gabriel played drums in both these bands, with Mike Rutherford later commenting, \"Pete was—and still is, I think—a frustrated drummer.\"\n\n\nCareer\n\n\n1965–1975: Early career and Genesis\nIn 1965, while still at Charterhouse, Gabriel formed the band Garden Wall with his schoolmates Tony Banks on piano, Johnny Trapman on trumpet, and Chris Stewart on drums. Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel, and the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At their final concert before they broke up, Gabriel wore a kaftan and beads and showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens. Garden Wall disbanded in 1967; Gabriel and Banks were invited by their Charterhouse schoolmates Anthony Phillips and Mike Rutherford, who were in their own band at the school called Anon until it split up the previous year, to work on a demo tape of songs together. Gabriel and Banks contributed \"She Is Beautiful\", the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to Charterhouse alumnus, musician Jonathan King, who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel's vocals. He signed the group and suggested that their name be Gabriel's Angels, but this was unpopular with the other members, and they soon settled on his other suggestion of Genesis.\nAfter King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote \"The Silent Sun\" as a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King's favourite bands. It became Genesis' first single, released in 1968, and was included on their debut studio album From Genesis to Revelation (1968). Following the commercial failure of From Genesis to Revelation, the band went their separate ways, and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse. In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on Mona Bone Jakon by Cat Stevens. The second studio album by Genesis, Trespass (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the flute, accordion, tambourine, and bass drum, and incorporating his soul music influences. Gabriel explained that he was driven to play these instruments because he was uncomfortable with doing nothing during instrumental sections. He would have preferred to play keyboard instruments, but said, \"[Banks] was extraordinarily possessive about the keyboards. I'd done a bit of flute at school, I always liked the sound, and a little bit of oboe (I was an even worse oboe player, but it made a couple of good noises now and again). Then the bass drum was something physical, visual, that I could kick hard and occasionally it was in time!\" The album sold few copies, with Gabriel at one point securing a place to study at the London School of Film Technique because the band \"seemed to be dying\".\nGenesis soon recruited guitarist Steve Hackett and drummer Phil Collins. Gabriel began growing in confidence as a frontman; during an encore performance of \"The Knife\" on 19 June 1971, he took a running jump into the audience and expected them to catch him, only for them to instead move out of the way and leave him to land on the floor and break his ankle. He consequently had to perform Genesis' next several shows with a wheelchair and crutches. Also during the Trespass tour, he started to recite stories to introduce songs as a way to cover the silence while the band tuned their instruments or technical faults were being fixed. These stories were all improvised on the spot, and evolved as the tour went along. The opener of their next studio album, Nursery Cryme (1971), \"The Musical Box\", was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics, as the lyrics to previous story-based Genesis songs such as \"White Mountain\" and \"One-Eyed Hound\" were all written by other members of the group. Gabriel was the primary writer of \"Harold the Barrel\", another story song on Nursery Cryme, with Collins helping him on the lyrics.\n\nThe shows featuring Foxtrot (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel's stage performance. During a gig in Dublin in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of \"The Musical Box\" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head, mimicking the album's cover. The idea of the fox costume had been suggested to him by Paul Conroy and Glen Colson, employees of Genesis's record label, Charisma Records. Gabriel said he consulted the rest of Genesis about the fox costume but grew tired of arguing about it, but the other members all maintained that nothing was said about it beforehand and that when Gabriel came out in costume they initially mistook him for a fan invading the stage. The incident received front-page coverage in Melody Maker, giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee. One of Gabriel's stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, Genesis Live (1973). By late 1973, following the success of Selling England by the Pound (1973), which centred on English themes and literary and materialistic references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make-up, a cape, and bat wings for \"Watcher of the Skies\", a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for \"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\", a  crown of thorns and a flower mask for \"Supper's Ready\", and an old man mask for \"The Musical Box\".\nGabriel continued to fight for involvement with Genesis's keyboards throughout his time with the group, and following a lengthy argument with Banks, he was allowed to play a minor keyboard part on \"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\", only for this part to be left out of the mix. \"I Know What I Like\" became Genesis's first hit single, reaching number 21 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) was Gabriel's final studio album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and insisted upon writing all the lyrics himself, whereas on previous albums the lyrics had been divided among all the members of Genesis. Tensions increased during this period, and Gabriel split with the band to pursue a film project with William Friedkin, only to rejoin a week later. Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel's first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. The other members complained that Gabriel was showing a lack of commitment to the band. Gabriel saw this as a \"really unsympathetic handling of my dealing with a family crisis\" and said it caused a breakdown in his relationships with the rest of Genesis; Rutherford later admitted that they had been overly fixated on their music and were very unhelpful in what must have been a difficult time for Gabriel. Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics, but has denied that he was too busy to write much music for the album and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford. Banks corroborated that Gabriel was the primary composer of the Lamb songs \"The Carpet Crawlers\" and \"The Chamber of 32 Doors\" and the sole composer of \"Counting Out Time\".\nDuring a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album's tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion. Rutherford recalled that they all \"could see it coming\". Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band. The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled \"Out, Angels Out\", about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family. The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him. His exit resulted in drummer Phil Collins reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.\n\n\n1975–1985: Solo debut with four self-titled albums\nGabriel described his break from the music business as his \"learning period\", during which he took piano and music lessons. He had recorded demos by the end of 1975, the fruits of a period of writing around 20 songs with his friend Martin Hall. In 1977, Gabriel released his solo debut, Peter Gabriel, which was recorded in Toronto with Bob Ezrin serving as the album's producer. Gabriel did not title his first four studio albums. All were labelled Peter Gabriel, using the same typeface, with designs by Hipgnosis. \"The idea is to do it like a magazine, which will only come out once a year,\" he remarked in 1978. \"So it's the same title, the same lettering in the same place; only the photo is different.\"\nPeter Gabriel (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 1: Car) was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its lead single, \"Solsbury Hill\", is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of Solsbury Hill in Somerset. \"It's about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get ...\" said Gabriel. \"It's about letting go.\" Gabriel toured the album with an 80-date tour from March to November 1977 with a band that included guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson often playing off stage and introduced as \"Dusty Rhodes\".\n\nIn late 1977, Gabriel started recording the second Peter Gabriel studio album (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch) in the Netherlands, with Fripp as producer. Its \"Mother of Violence\" was written by Gabriel and his first wife Jill. Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel's tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads.\nGabriel recorded the third Peter Gabriel studio album (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 3: Melt) in England in 1979. He developed an interest in African music and drum machines and later hailed the record as his artistic breakthrough. Gabriel banned the use of cymbals on the album in order to grant more sonic space for instruments like keyboards and synths. This resulted in the creation of the distinctive gated reverb, a noise processing technique which came about while recording drums on \"Intruder\", one of the tracks featuring Phil Collins. Collins implemented the reverb to great effect on his debut solo single \"In the Air Tonight\" and it has since became a signature sound of the 1980s and beyond.\nUpon completion Atlantic Records, Gabriel's US distributor who had released his first two albums, refused to put out Peter Gabriel 3: Melt as they thought it was not commercial enough. Gabriel signed a recording contract with Mercury Records. Released in May 1980, the album went to No. 1 in the UK for three weeks. In the US, it peaked at No. 22. The single \"Games Without Frontiers\" went to No. 4 and \"Biko\" went to No. 36 in the UK. After a handful of shows in 1979, Gabriel toured the album from February to October 1980. The tour marked Gabriel's first successful instance of crowd surfing (following his failed June 1971 attempt when touring with Genesis) when he fell back into the audience in a crucifix position. The stunt became a staple of his live shows.\n\nOn Peter Gabriel four (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 4: Security), Gabriel took on greater responsibility over the production than before. He recorded it in 1981 and 1982, solely on digital tape, with a mobile studio parked at his home, Ashcombe House, in Somerset. Gabriel utilized a Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer and incorporated electronic instrumentation with sampling world beat percussion. \"Over the course of the last two albums,\" he observed, \"I've got back into a rhythm consciousness. And the writing—particularly with the invention of these drum machines—is fantastic. You can store in their memories rhythms that interest you and excite you. And then the groove will carry on without you, and the groove will be exactly what you want it to be, rather than what a drummer thinks is appropriate for what you're doing.\"\nThe fourth Peter Gabriel, released in September 1982, hit No. 6 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The second single, \"Shock the Monkey\", became Gabriel's first top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 29. To handle American distribution, Gabriel signed with Geffen Records, which—initially unbeknown to Gabriel—titled the album Security to differentiate it from the first three. Gabriel's 1982 tour lasted a year and became his first to make a profit. Recordings from the tour were released on Gabriel's debut live release, Plays Live (1983).\nGabriel produced versions of the third and fourth Peter Gabriel albums with German lyrics. The third consisted of the studio recordings, overdubbed with new vocals. The fourth was remixed, with several tracks extended or altered.\nIn 1983, Gabriel developed the soundtrack for Alan Parker's drama film Birdy (1984), co-produced with Daniel Lanois. This consisted of new material, without lyrics, as well as remixed instrumentals from his previous studio album.\n\n\n1985–1997: So and Us\nAfter finishing the soundtrack to Birdy, Gabriel shifted his musical focus from rhythm and texture, as heard on Peter Gabriel four and Birdy, towards more straightforward songs. In 1985, he recorded his fifth studio album, So (also co-produced with Lanois). So was released in May 1986 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US. It remains Gabriel's best-selling album with over five million copies sold in the US alone. It produced one of Gabriel's signature songs, that has become a concert staple: \"In Your Eyes\", with a distinctive vocal appearance by Youssou N'Dour, and three UK top 20 singles: \"Sledgehammer\", \"Big Time\", and \"Don't Give Up\", a duet with Kate Bush.\nThe first went to No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, Gabriel's only single of his career to do so. It knocked \"Invisible Touch\" by Genesis, his former band, out of the top spot, which was also their only US number one hit. In the UK, the single went to No. 4. In 1990, Rolling Stone ranked So at No. 14 on its list of \"Top 100 Albums of the Eighties\".\n\n\"Sledgehammer\" was particularly successful, dealing with sex and sexual relations through lyrical innuendos. Its famed music video was a collaboration between director Stephen R. Johnson, Aardman Animations, and the Brothers Quay and won a record nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987. In 1998, it was named MTV's number one animated video of all time. So earned Gabriel two wins at the 1987 Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and Best British Video (for \"Sledgehammer\"). He was nominated for four Grammy Awards: Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year for \"Sledgehammer\", and Album of the Year for So. Gabriel toured worldwide to support So with the This Way Up Tour, from November 1986 to October 1987.\nIn 1988, Gabriel became involved as composer for Martin Scorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Scorsese had contacted Gabriel about the project since 1983 and wished, according to Gabriel, to present \"the struggle between the humanity and divinity of Christ in a powerful and original way\". Gabriel used musicians from WOMAD to perform instrumental pieces with focus on rhythm and African, Middle Eastern and European textures, using the National Sound Archive in London for additional inspiration. The initial plan had dedicated ten weeks for recording before it was cut to three, leaving Gabriel unable to finish all the pieces he originally wanted to record. When the film was finished, Gabriel worked on the soundtrack for an additional four months to develop more of his unfinished ideas. Its soundtrack was released as Passion in June 1989. It won Gabriel a Grammy Award for Best New Age Performance and a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score – Motion Picture. In 1990, Gabriel put out his first compilation album, Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats, which sold 2 million copies in the US.\nUp until 1989, Gabriel was managed by Gail Colson. From 1989 to 1992, Gabriel recorded his follow-up to So, titled Us. The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time.\nGabriel's introspection within the context of the album Us can be seen in the first single release \"Digging in the Dirt\" directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel's time since the previous studio album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in \"Come Talk to Me\" directed by Matt Mahurin, which featured backing vocals by Sinéad O'Connor. O'Connor also lent vocals to \"Blood of Eden\", directed by Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to Adam's rib for inspiration.\nThe album is one of Gabriel's most personal. It met with less success than So, reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles \"Digging in the Dirt\" and the funkier \"Steam\", which evoked memories of \"Sledgehammer\". Gabriel followed the release of the album with the Secret World Tour, first using touring keyboardist Joy Askew to sing O'Connor's part, then O'Connor herself for a few months. O'Connor quit the tour, and was replaced by Paula Cole, the latter appearing on the tour recordings: a double album Secret World Live, and a concert video also called Secret World Live, both released in 1994. The film received the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video, naming director Francois Girard and producer Robert Warr.\nGabriel employed an innovative approach in the marketing of the Us album. Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as Helen Chadwick, Rebecca Horn, Nils-Udo, Andy Goldsworthy, David Mach and Yayoi Kusama collaborated to create original artworks for each song on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video All About Us and the interactive CD-ROM Xplora1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World.\nGabriel won three more Grammy Awards, all in the Music Video category. He won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to \"Digging in the Dirt\" and \"Steam\", respectively. Gabriel also won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video for his Secret World Live video.\n\n\n1997–2009: OVO and Up\nIn 1997, Gabriel was invited to participate in the direction and soundtrack of the Millennium Dome Show, a live multimedia performance staged in the Millennium Dome in London throughout 2000. Gabriel said the team were given free rein, which contributed to the various problems they encountered with it, such as a lack of proper budgeting. He also felt that management, while succeeding to get the building finished on time, failed to understand the artistic side of the show and its content. Gabriel's soundtrack was released as OVO in June 2000. The Story of OVO was released in the CD-booklet-shaped comic book which was part of the CD edition with the title \"OVO The Millennium Show\". As part of Record Store Day 2025, OVO celebrated its 25th anniversary and was released on vinyl for the first time in limited quantity.\nAround that same time, the Genesis greatest hits album, Turn It On Again: The Hits (1999), featured Gabriel sharing vocals with Phil Collins on a new version of \"The Carpet Crawlers\" entitled \"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\", produced by Trevor Horn.\nIn 2002 he stuck with soundtrack work for his next project, scoring for the Australian film Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) with worldbeat music. Released in June 2002, Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score – Motion Picture.\nLater in 2002, Up, Gabriel's first full-length studio album in a decade, was released in September 2002. He started work on it in 1995 before production halted three years later to focus time on other projects and collaborations. Work resumed in 2000, by which time Gabriel had 130 potential songs for the album, and spent almost two years on it before management at Virgin Records pushed Gabriel to complete it. Up reached No. 9 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, and supported with a world tour with a band that included Gabriel's daughter Melanie on backing vocals. The tour was documented with two live DVDs: Growing Up Live (2003) and Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped (2005).\nIn 2004, Gabriel met with his former Genesis bandmates to discuss the possibility of staging The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) as a reunion tour. He ultimately dismissed the idea, paving the way for Banks, Rutherford and Collins to organise the Turn It On Again: The Tour. Gabriel produced and performed at the Eden Project Live 8 concert in July 2005. He joined Cat Stevens on stage to perform \"Wild World\" during Nelson Mandela's 46664 concert. In 2005, FIFA asked Gabriel and Brian Eno to organise an opening ceremony for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but FIFA cancelled the idea in January 2006. At the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Gabriel performed John Lennon's \"Imagine\".\nIn November 2006, the Seventh World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Rome presented Gabriel with the Man of Peace award. The award, presented by former General Secretary of the USSR and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail Gorbachev and Walter Veltroni, Mayor of Rome, was an acknowledgement of Gabriel's extensive contribution and work on behalf of human rights and peace. The award was presented in the Giulio Cesare Hall of the Campidoglio in Rome. At the end of the year, he was awarded the Q magazine Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by American musician Moby. In an interview published in the magazine to accompany the award, Gabriel's contribution to music was described as \"vast and enduring\".\n\nGabriel took on a project with the BBC World Service's competition \"The Next Big Thing\" to find the world's best young band. Gabriel judged the final six young artists with William Orbit, Geoff Travis and Angélique Kidjo.\nIn June 2008, Gabriel released Big Blue Ball, an album of various artists collaborating with each other at his Real World Studios across three summers in the 1990s. He planned its release in the US without assistance from a label; he raised £2 million towards the recording and distribution of the album with Ingenious Media with the worldwide release handled through Warner Bros. Records. Gabriel appeared on a nationwide tour for the album in 2009.\nGabriel was a judge for the 6th and 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.\nGabriel contributed to the Pixar film WALL-E soundtrack in 2008 with Thomas Newman, including the film's closing song, \"Down to Earth\", for which they received the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. In February 2009, Gabriel announced that he would not be performing on the 2008 Academy Awards telecast because producers of the show were limiting his performance of \"Down to Earth\" from WALL-E to 90 seconds. According to Gabriel, his window was reduced to 65 seconds. John Legend and the Soweto Gospel Choir performed the song in his stead.\nGabriel's 2009 tour appearances included Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Venezuela. His first ever performance in Peru was held in Lima on 20 March 2009, during his second visit to the country.\nOn 25 July 2009, he played at WOMAD Charlton Park, his only European performance of the year, to promote Witness. The show included two tracks from the then-forthcoming Scratch My Back: Paul Simon's \"The Boy in the Bubble\" and the Magnetic Fields' \"The Book of Love\".\n\n\n2009–2019: Scratch My Back, New Blood and further side projects\n\nIn 2009, Gabriel recorded Scratch My Back, an album of cover songs by various artists including David Bowie, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Regina Spektor and Neil Young. The original concept was for Gabriel to cover an artists' song if they, in turn, covered one of his for an album simultaneously released as I'll Scratch Yours, but several participants later declined or were late to deliver and it was placed on hold. Gabriel avoided using drums and guitar in favour of orchestral arrangements, and altered his usual songwriting method by finishing the vocals first and then the song, for which he collaborated with John Metcalfe. Released in February 2010, Scratch My Back reached No. 12 in the UK. Gabriel toured worldwide with the New Blood Tour from March 2010 to July 2012 with a 54-piece orchestra and his daughter Melanie and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ane Brun on backing vocals. The follow-up, And I'll Scratch Yours, was released in September 2013.\nDuring the New Blood Tour, Gabriel decided to expand on the Scratch My Back concept and, with Metcalfe's assistance, re-record a collection of his own songs with an orchestra. The result, New Blood, was released in October 2011.\nIn September 2012, Gabriel kicked off his Back to Front Tour which featured So (1986) performed in its entirety with the original musicians who played on the album, to mark its 25th anniversary. When the opening leg finished a month later, Gabriel took one year off to travel the world with his children. The tour resumed with a European leg from September 2013 to December 2014.\nIn 2014, Gabriel was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. They performed Gabriel's \"Washing of the Water\" together. Gabriel performed \"Heroes\" by David Bowie with an orchestra at a concert in Berlin to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 2014.\nIn 2016, he was featured on the song \"A.I.\" by American pop rock band OneRepublic from their fourth studio album Oh My My.\nIn June 2016, Gabriel released the single \"I'm Amazing\". The song was written several years prior, in part as a tribute to boxer Muhammad Ali. That month, he embarked on a joint tour with Sting titled The Rock Paper Scissors North American Tour.\nGabriel re-emerged in 2019 with the release of Rated PG, a compilation of songs that were created for film soundtracks throughout his career. The song selection spans over 30 years and includes tracks that had never been released on an official Gabriel album previously, including \"Down to Earth\" (from WALL-E) and \"That'll Do\" (from Babe: Pig in the City), an Oscar-nominated collaboration with Randy Newman. Initially only released on vinyl for Record Store Day on 13 April, the album was eventually released on digital streaming services later that month. Later that same year, Gabriel issued another digital release on 13 September titled Flotsam and Jetsam, a collection of B-sides, remixes and rarities that span Gabriel's entire solo career from 1976 to 2016, including his first solo recording, a cover of the Beatles' song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\n\n2022–present: I/O and O/I\nBy 2002, Gabriel had been continually working on what he had given the tentative title of I/O, his tenth studio album, which he had begun work on as early as 1995. It was originally set to be released 18 months after Up, but touring pushed the release far away. He did an interview with Rolling Stone in 2005 stating that he had 150 songs in various stages. From 2013 to 2016, he posted regularly on social media about recording the new album. In 2019, he spoke on BBC Radio 6 about how he had taken a hiatus from making music due to his wife being sick, but he had begun to return to it now that she had recovered. In 2021, he was interviewed multiple times about his new album, and revealed that he had been recording with Manu Katché, Tony Levin and David Rhodes on 17 new songs. He posted multiple photos to his Facebook and Instagram of these sessions. In June 2022, Katché told the French magazine L'Illustré that the album was nearly complete and would be released later that year, pending an official announcement.\nIn November 2022, Gabriel announced his upcoming \"I/O The Tour\" for the spring of 2023 across several European cities, with later dates to be confirmed for the North America leg of the tour for the late summer/fall of 2023. This announcement also confirmed the name of the upcoming album to be stylised as I/O. The first single from the album, \"Panopticom\", was released digitally on 6 January 2023. A new piece from the album will be released on the date of each full moon in 2023, as well as a different mix of the song on each new moon in 2023, starting with the Dark Side Mix of \"Panopticom\". On 5 February, Gabriel released \"The Court\", the second single from the album. On 7 March, Gabriel released the third single, \"Playing for Time\". A basic arrangement of the song featuring only Gabriel on piano and Levin on bass had already opened the shows on the Back to Front Tour, by the name of \"Daddy Long Legs\". The title track \"I/O\" was the fourth single released on 6 April. On 5 May, Peter Gabriel released the fifth single from the album, \"Four Kinds of Horses\", a track which is a collaboration with Brian Eno and Richard Russell. The sixth single, \"Road to Joy\", was released on 4 June. Six more singles were released, separately, within the next six months—\"So Much\", \"Olive Tree\", \"Love Can Heal\", \"This Is Home\", \"And Still\" and \"Live and Let Live\"—before I/O was finally released on 1 December 2023.\nOne day prior to I/O's release, Gabriel told The New York Times that he does not expect a follow-up album (which he described as his \"brain project\") to take another 21 years, saying that \"there's a lot of stuff in the can\" but added that the material is not yet finished.\nAdditionally, Gabriel stated in his November 2023 Full Moon update video that the track \"What Lies Ahead\" will be on \"the next record\". He performed \"What Lies Ahead\" several times in 2023 and it was a contender for I/O. In February 2025, Gabriel revealed to Mojo that he was working on the follow-up to I/O: \"It will be called O/I [...] that's I/O backwards.\"\n\n\nArtistry\nStylistically, Gabriel's music has been alternately described by music writers as progressive rock, art rock, art pop, worldbeat, post-progressive and progressive soul. According to Rolling Stone journalist Ryan Reed, Gabriel has developed in all as an \"art-rock innovator, soul-pop craftsman, [and] 'world music' ambassador\" over the course of his career, while music scholar Gregg Akkermann argues that, despite his progressive rock origins, he has \"managed to attract fans from across the spectrum: prog rock, alternative rock, world beat, blue-eyed soul, dance music, the college crowd, the teens, Americans and Europeans\". More broadly, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine says Gabriel emerged during the 1980s as \"one of rock's most ambitious, innovative musicians\", as well as \"an international pop star\".\nGabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career. Bass and Stick player Tony Levin has performed on every Gabriel studio album and every live tour except for Scratch My Back (2010), the soundtracks Passion (1989) and Long Walk Home (2002), and the New Blood Tour. Guitarist David Rhodes has been Gabriel's guitarist of choice since 1979. Prior to So (1986), Jerry Marotta was Gabriel's preferred drummer, both in the studio and on the road. (For the So and Us albums and tours Marotta was replaced by Manu Katché, who was then replaced by Ged Lynch on parts of the Up album and all of the subsequent tour). Gabriel is known for choosing top-flight collaborators, from co-producers such as Ezrin, Fripp, Lillywhite and Lanois to musicians such as Natalie Merchant, Elizabeth Fraser, L. Shankar, Trent Reznor, Youssou N'Dour, Larry Fast, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sinéad O'Connor, Kate Bush, Ane Brun, Paula Cole, John Giblin, Dave Gregory, Peter Hammill, Papa Wemba, Manu Katché, Bayete, Milton Nascimento, Phil Collins, Stewart Copeland and OneRepublic.\nOver the years, Gabriel has collaborated with singer Kate Bush several times; Bush provided backing vocals for Gabriel's \"Games Without Frontiers\" and \"No Self Control\" in 1980, and female lead vocal for \"Don't Give Up\" (a top 10 hit in the UK) in 1986, and Gabriel appeared on her television special. Their duet of Roy Harper's \"Another Day\" was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.\nHe also collaborated with avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson on two versions of her composition \"Excellent Birds\"—one for her second album Mister Heartbreak (1984), and another version called \"This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\", which appeared on original cassette and CD versions, and all versions past 2002, of So.\nGabriel sang (along with Jim Kerr of Simple Minds) on \"Everywhere I Go\", from the Call's 1986 studio album, Reconciled. On Toni Childs' 1994 studio album, The Woman's Boat, Gabriel sang on the track, \"I Met a Man\".\nIn 1998, Gabriel appeared on the soundtrack of Babe: Pig in the City as the lead vocalist of the song \"That'll Do\", written by Randy Newman. The song was nominated for an Academy Award, and Gabriel and Newman performed it at the following year's Oscar telecast. He performed a similar soundtrack appearance for the 2004 film Shall We Dance?, singing a cover version of \"The Book of Love\" by the Magnetic Fields.\nIn 1987, Gabriel appeared on Robbie Robertson's self-titled solo studio album, singing on \"Fallen Angel\"; co-wrote two Tom Robinson singles; and appeared on Joni Mitchell's 1988 studio album Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm, on the opening track \"My Secret Place\".\nIn 2001, Gabriel contributed lead vocals to the song \"When You're Falling\" on Afro Celt Sound System's Volume 3: Further in Time. In the summer of 2003, Gabriel performed in Ohio with a guest performance by Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan.\nGabriel collaborated on tracks with electronic musician BT, who also worked on the OVO soundtrack with him. The tracks were never released, as the computers they were contained on were stolen from BT's home in California. He also sang the lyrics for Deep Forest on their theme song for the movie Strange Days (1995). In addition, Gabriel has appeared on Angelique Kidjo's 2007 studio album Djin Djin, singing on the song \"Salala\".\nGabriel has recorded a cover of the Vampire Weekend single \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\" with Hot Chip, where his name is mentioned several times in the chorus. He substitutes the original line \"But this feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / This feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too\" with \"It feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / and it feels so unnatural / to sing your own name.\"\nGabriel collaborated with Arcade Fire on their 2022 studio album, We. He sang backing vocals on the track \"Unconditional II (Race and Religion)\".\n\n\nWOMAD and other projects\nGabriel's interest in world music was first apparent on his third solo studio album. According to Spencer Kornhaber in The Atlantic in 2019: \"When Peter Gabriel moved toward 'world music' four decades ago, he not only evangelized sounds that were novel to Western pop. He also set a radio template: majestic, with flourishes meant to read as 'exotic,' and lyrics meant to change lives.\" This influence has increased over time, and he co-founded the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival in 1982. Gabriel said:\n\nThe first time I really got into music from another culture was as a result of the shifting of Radio 4, which I used to wake up to. I'd lost it on medium wave and was groping around in the morning on the dial, trying to find something that I could listen to, and came across a Dutch radio station who were playing the soundtrack from some obscure Stanley Baker movie called Dingaka. That had quite a lot of stuff from—I think it was—Ghana. I can't remember now, but it really moved me. One of the songs I heard on that was a thing called 'Shosholoza', which I recorded on the b-side of the 'Biko' single.\nGabriel created the Real World Studios and record label to facilitate the creation and distribution of such music by various artists, and he has worked to educate Western culture about such musicians as Yungchen Lhamo, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Youssou N'dour.\nIn the 1990s, with Steve Nelson of Brilliant Media and director Michael Coulson, he developed advanced multimedia CD-ROM-based entertainment projects, creating Xplora (the world's largest-selling music CD-ROM), and subsequently the EVE CD-ROM. EVE was a music and art adventure game directed by Michael Coulson and co-produced by the Starwave Corporation in Seattle; it won the Milia d'Or award Grand Prize at the Cannes in 1996.\nIn 1990, Gabriel lent his backing vocals to Ugandan political exile Geoffrey Oryema's \"Land of Anaka\", appearing on Oryema's first studio album Exile, released on Gabriel's Real World label.\nIn 1994, Gabriel starred in Breck Eisner's short film Recon as a detective who enters the minds of murder victims to find their killer's identity.\nGabriel helped pioneer a new realm of musical interaction in 2001, visiting Georgia State University's Language Research Center to participate in keyboard jam sessions with bonobo apes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (This experience inspired the song \"Animal Nation\", which was performed on Gabriel's 2002 \"Growing Up\" tour and was featured on the Growing Up Live DVD and The Wild Thornberrys Movie soundtrack.) Gabriel's desire to bring attention to the intelligence of primates also took the form of ApeNet, a project that aimed to link great apes through the internet, enabling the first interspecies internet communication.\nGabriel was one of the founders of on Demand Distribution (OD2), one of the first online music download services. Prior to its closure in 2009, its technology had been used by over 100 music download sites including MSN Music UK, MyCokeMusic, Planet Internet (KPN), Wanadoo and CD WOW!. OD2 was bought by US company Loudeye in June 2004 and subsequently by Finnish mobile giant Nokia in October 2006 for $60 million.\nGabriel is co-founder (with Brian Eno) of a musicians union called Mudda, short for \"magnificent union of digitally downloading artists\".\nIn 2000, Gabriel collaborated with Zucchero, Anggun and others in a charity for kids with AIDS. Erick Benzi wrote words and music and Patrick Bruel, Stephan Eicher, Faudel, Lokua Kanza, Laam, Nourith, Axelle Red have accepted to sing it.\nIn 2003, Gabriel contributed a song for the video game Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. In 2004, Gabriel contributed another song (\"Curtains\") and contributed voice work on another game in the Myst franchise, Myst IV: Revelation.\nIn June 2005, Gabriel and broadcast industry entrepreneur David Engelke purchased Solid State Logic, a manufacturer of mixing consoles and digital audio workstations. In 2017, the company was sold to the Audiotonix Group.\nIn May 2008, Gabriel's Real World Studios, in partnership with Bowers & Wilkins, started the Bowers & Wilkins Music Club—later known as Society of Sound—a subscription-based music retail site. Albums are currently available in either Apple Lossless or FLAC format.\nGabriel is one of the founding supporters of the annual global event Asteroid Day.\n\n\nActivist for humanitarian causes\nIn 1986, Gabriel started what has become a longstanding association with Amnesty International, becoming a pioneering participant in all 28 of Amnesty's Human rights concerts—a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998. He performed during the six-concert A Conspiracy of Hope US tour in June 1986; the twenty-concert Human Rights Now! world tour in 1988; the Chile: Embrace of Hope Concert in 1990 and at The Paris Concert for Amnesty International in 1998. He also performed in Amnesty's Secret Policeman's Ball benefit shows in collaboration with other artists and friends such as Lou Reed, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Youssou N'Dour; Gabriel closed those concerts performing his anti-apartheid anthem \"Biko\".\nHe spoke of his support for Amnesty on NBC's Today Show in 1986.\nGabriel has a longstanding interest in human rights and launched Witness, a charity that trains human rights activists to use video and online technologies to expose human rights abuses. In 2006, his work with Witness and his long-standing support of peace and human rights causes was recognised by the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates with the Man of Peace award. In November 2007, Witness launched The Hub, a participatory media site for human rights.\nIn 1995, Gabriel and Cape Verdean human rights activist Vera Duarte were awarded the North–South Prize in its inaugural year.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Gabriel and entrepreneur Richard Branson discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts. On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. Kofi Annan served as Chair of the Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as deputy chair. The other members of the group are Martti Ahtisaari, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jimmy Carter, Hina Jilani, Graça Machel, Mary Robinson and Ernesto Zedillo. Desmond Tutu was an Honorary Elder, as was Nelson Mandela. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel, and use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may later cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to consider carefully which specific issues to approach.\nIn September 2008, Gabriel was named as the recipient of Amnesty International's 2008 Ambassador of Conscience Award. In the same month, he received Quadriga United We Care award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling and Wikipedia. The award was presented to him by Queen Silvia of Sweden.\nIn 2010, Gabriel lent his support to the campaign to release Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian Azeri woman who was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery.\nIn December 2013, Gabriel posted a video message in tribute to the deceased former South African president and anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. Gabriel was quoted:\n\nTo come out of 27 years in jail and to immediately set about building a Rainbow Nation with your sworn enemy is a unique and extraordinary example of courage and forgiveness. In this case, Mandela had seen many of his people beaten, imprisoned and murdered, yet he was still willing to trust the humanity and idealism of those who had been the oppressors, without whom he knew he could not achieve an almost peaceful transition of power. There is no other example of such inspirational leadership in my lifetime.\nGabriel has criticised Air France for their continued transport of monkeys to laboratories. In a letter to the airline, Gabriel wrote that in laboratories, \"primates are violently force-fed chemicals, inflicted with brain damage, crippled, addicted to cocaine or alcohol, deprived of food and water, or psychologically tormented and ultimately killed.\"\nIn March 2014, Gabriel publicly supported #withsyria, a campaign to rally support for victims of the Syrian Civil War.\nIn November 2014, Gabriel, along with Pussy Riot and Iron & Wine supported Hong Kong protesters at Hong Kong's Lennon Wall in their efforts.\nIn March 2015, Gabriel was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of South Australia in recognition of his commitment to creativity and its transformational power in building peace and understanding.\nHe composed the song \"The Veil\" for Oliver Stone's film Snowden (2016).\n\n\nPolitical views\nGabriel has been described as one of rock's most political musicians by AllMusic. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday massacre, Gabriel joined Peter Hain, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Benn, Ken Loach, John Pilger and Adrian Mitchell in voicing his support for a demonstration in London calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.\nAt the 1997 general election, he declared his support for the Labour Party, which won that election by a landslide after 18 years out of power, led by Tony Blair. In 1998, he was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to Labour. He subsequently distanced himself from the Labour government following Blair's support for George W. Bush and Britain's involvement in the Iraq War, which he strongly opposed. Gabriel later explained his decision for funding Labour, saying, \"after all those years of Thatcher, that was the only time I've put money into a political party because I wanted to help get rid of the Tory government of that time.\"\nAt the 2005 general election, Gabriel gave a Green Party of England and Wales candidate special permission to record a cover of his song \"Don't Give Up\" for his campaign. In 2010, The Guardian described Gabriel as \"a staunch advocate of proportional representation\". In 2013, he stated that he had become more interested in online petitioning organisations to effect change than traditional party politics.\nIn 2012, Gabriel condemned the use of his music by the American conservative talk radio personality Rush Limbaugh during a controversial segment in which Limbaugh vilified Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke. A statement on behalf of Gabriel read: \"Peter was appalled to learn that his music was linked to Rush Limbaugh's extraordinary attack on Sandra Fluke. It is obvious from anyone that knows Peter's work that he would never approve such a use. He has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair, aggressive and ignorant comments.\"\nIn 2016, Gabriel supported the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the referendum on the issue.\nGabriel has declared his support for the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 2014, he contributed songs to a new compilation album to raise funds for humanitarian organisations aiding Palestinian Arabs in Gaza. Gabriel was quoted: \"I am certain that Israelis and Palestinians will both benefit from a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. We have watched Palestinians suffer for too long, especially in Gaza. I am not, and never was, anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic, but I oppose the policy of the Israeli government, oppose injustice and oppose the occupation ... I am proud to be one of the voices asking the Israeli government: 'Where is the two-state solution that you wanted so much?' and clearly say that enough is enough.\" In 2019, Gabriel was among 50 artists who urged the BBC to ask for the Eurovision Song Contest to be moved out of Israel, citing human rights concerns. In 2023, Gabriel signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to President Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire during the Gaza war.\nGabriel has been in support of the Armenian genocide recognition. In October 2020, he posted a message on social media in support of Armenia and Artsakh in regards to the Nagorno-Karabakh war. He said, \"The fighting that has now broken out between Azerbaijan and Armenia is really horrific and we need to lobby whoever we can to encourage a ceasefire, but hearing reports that President Erdoğan has now lined up 80,000 Turkish troops on the Armenian border is a terrifying prospect, full of the dark echoes of history.\"\n\n\nIn popular culture\nGabriel's music featured prominently on the popular 1980s television show Miami Vice. The songs include \"The Rhythm of the Heat\" and \"Biko\" (from \"Evan\"), \"Red Rain\" (from \"Stone's War\"), \"Mercy Street\" (from \"Killshot\"), \"Sledgehammer\" (from \"Better Living Through Chemistry\"), \"We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\" (from \"Forgive Us Our Debts\" and \"Deliver Us from Evil\") and \"Don't Give Up\" (from \"Redemption in Blood\"). With seven songs used total, Gabriel had the most music featured by a solo artist in the series, and he is the only artist to have had a song used in four of Vice's five seasons. Five of the nine tracks on his most popular album So (1986) were used in the series.\nGabriel’s song \"In Your Eyes\" features twice in the teen romance drama Say Anything (1989).  It is the song playing on Lloyd Dobler’s boombox as he serenades Diane, creating the film’s most iconic scene.\nGabriel's cover of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" was featured in the fourth season finale of Big Love, as well as the first season and the ending scene of Stranger Things season 3 and the ending credits of Lone Survivor. The song also features in 'Children of Mars', a 2020 episode of the web series Star Trek: Short Treks.\nA series of spoof documentaries about the fictitious rock star Brian Pern were based loosely on Gabriel.\nIn 2021, Northern Irish post-punk band Invaderband released their second studio album entitled 'Peter Gabriel'. The sleeve was a painting of Gabriel by Luke Haines.\n\n\nPersonal life\nGabriel has married twice and has four children. In 1971, at age 21, he married Jill Moore, daughter of Baron Philip Moore. They had two daughters, one of whom, Anna-Marie, is a filmmaker who filmed and directed Gabriel's live DVDs Growing Up on Tour: A Family Portrait (2003), Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped (2005) and some of his music videos. Melanie is a musician who had been a backing vocalist in her father's band in 2002–2011. Both daughters appear in the final sequence of the video for their father's song \"Sledgehammer\".\nGabriel's marriage became increasingly strained, culminating in Moore's affair with David Lord, the co-producer of Gabriel's fourth studio album. After the couple divorced in 1987, Gabriel fell into a period of depression and attended therapy sessions for six years.\nFor a time after his divorce, Gabriel lived with American actress Rosanna Arquette. In 2021, Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor said that she maintained an on-and-off relationship with Gabriel in the wake of his divorce. She ended the relationship because of her frustration with his lack of commitment, which inspired her single \"Thank You for Hearing Me\".\nGabriel married Meabh Flynn in 2002, with whom he has two sons.\nGabriel has resided in Wiltshire for many years and runs Real World Studios from Box, Wiltshire. He previously lived in the Woolley Valley near Bath, Somerset. In 2010, he joined a campaign to stop agricultural development in the valley, which had also inspired his first solo single, \"Solsbury Hill\", in 1977.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nPeter Gabriel (1977; known as Peter Gabriel 1 and Car)\nPeter Gabriel (1978; known as Peter Gabriel 2 and Scratch)\nPeter Gabriel (1980; known as Peter Gabriel 3 and Melt)\nPeter Gabriel (1982; known as Peter Gabriel 4 and Security)\nSo (1986)\nUs (1992)\nUp (2002)\nScratch My Back (2010)\nNew Blood (2011)\nI/O (2023)\nSoundtracks\n\nBirdy (1985)\nPassion (1989)\nOVO (2000)\nLong Walk Home (2002)\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSee also\nList of ambient music artists\nList of artists who reached number one in the United States\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Dance Club Songs chart\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart\nList of best-selling music artists\n24997 Petergabriel\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\nBanks, Tony; Collins, Phil; Gabriel, Peter; Hackett, Steve; Rutherford, Mike (2007).

    "title": "NASUWT",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=989091",
    "text": "NASUWT – The Teachers' Union is a trade union representing teachers in the United Kingdom across all phases of education, affiliated with the Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Education International. It is one of the largest teaching unions in the UK and is distinctive in representing only qualified teachers, rather than a wider group of education staff.\nThe union describes itself as \"the undiluted voice of the teaching profession,\" emphasising that its work is centred exclusively on teachers’ interests. \nThe union engages in negotiations with employers, campaigns on pay and workload, provides legal and professional support to members, and, when necessary, takes industrial action.\nMembership is open to teachers at every stage of their careers, including those in supply roles, leadership positions, and in both the maintained and independent sectors.\n\n\nThe early years 1919–1976; breakaway and the formation of a new union\nThe origins of NASUWT can be traced back to the formation of the National Association of Men Teachers (NAMT) in 1919, which formed as a group within the National Union of Teachers (NUT) to promote the interests of male teachers. The formation of the NAMT was in response to an NUT referendum the same year, approving the principle of equal pay for women.\nThe NAMT continued its campaign to further the interests of male teachers, changing its name in 1920 to the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS). In 1922 the NAS broke away from the NUT and established its own organisation. The secession came about indirectly following a decision at the NAS Conference that year, to prohibit NAS members from continuing to also be members of the NUT after the 31 December 1922.\nThe NAS aimed to recruit every schoolmaster into the NAS, to safeguard and promote the interests of male teachers, to ensure recognition of the social and economic responsibilities of male teachers, and to ensure the representation of schoolmasters on matters concerned with education, with both the local education authorities and government. The NAS also maintained that all boys over the age of seven should be taught mainly by men and that schoolmasters should not serve under women heads.\nAs the secondary education sector expanded, the NAS built its organisation among male secondary teachers, it adopted the methods of collective bargaining and militant industrial action in pursuing a narrow range of pay and conditions issues related to the interests of full-time male 'career teachers'.\nBy the 1960s, the union was still opposed to admitting women as members, but it was concerned that the unions open to women teachers were all hostile to its objectives. As a result, it encouraged the formation of the Union of Women Teachers (UWT).\nIn 1976 the NAS merged with the Union of Women Teachers (UWT) and the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association (SSA). The merger was largely a consequence of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which made it unlawful to exclude from membership on grounds of gender. It then became the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT). The 'slash' separating the two sections of the union was later dropped and the name usually appeared subtitled 'The Career Teachers Union' – a reference to the lifelong commitment of the 'career' classroom teacher.\nAlthough from many years the union had officially registered its name with the Certification Office for Trade Unions and Employers Associations as the NASUWT, it is only since 2015 that the union has adopted its name in the short form using only the initials NASUWT and subtitled 'The Teachers' Union'.  The change reflected that 84 per cent of its members were now women and it was effectively able to remove from its name the now archaic term 'schoolmasters'.\n\n\nIndustrial relations, bargaining and strikes\nThe union as the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS) with 21,000 members attempt to seek representation in national pay negotiations known as the Burnham Committee was rejected in 1960. The Burnham Committees however were dominated by representatives of the much larger National Union of Teachers (NUT) with a membership of 201,000.\nHowever following a series of strikes and rallies the NAS achieved recognition for national pay bargaining on the Burnham Committees in 1962. Despite a successful campaign, the NUT continued to hold the majority of seats. In 1969 for instance, the NUT had 15 members on the Teachers’ Panel, with the NAS holding the 2 seats it achieved on joining the Committee in 1962. The NUT general secretary also held the joint secretaryship of the main Burnham Committees and the leadership of their Teachers' Panels for most of their existence.\nBy the mid-1980s, the pay rises for teachers of the previous decade had been considerably eroded by inflation   In February, 1985 the NASUWT along with other teaching unions withdrew 'goodwill' in pursuit of higher pay. Members refused to supervise at lunchtimes, attend meetings with parents outside school hours, or cover for absent colleagues. The dispute escalated and a series of strikes followed for a period of the next two years.\nBy 1987 the divisions over strategy with other unions, notably the NUT, brought the dispute to an end. The result was the 1987 Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act, which abolished the national pay negotiations and replaced them with an Interim Advisory Committee on School Teachers' Pay and Conditions, on which the unions had no representation.  This was in turn replaced in 1991 by The School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB), an independent body to examine and report on such matters relating to the statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in England and Wales.\n\n\nSocial partnership and work force reform\nFrom 2003 to 2010 the NASUWT was involved in \"social partnership\" – a programme of meetings between union leaders, the Labour government and employers' organisations. The meetings were initially to discuss pay and workforce issues but developed into a forum for broader discussion on policy proposals. The National Union of Teachers chose not to participate in social partnership.\nSocial partnership was confined to the Labour government, and did not continue after the establishment of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Instead, the union lodged a formal trade dispute with the government over workload, conditions of service, pensions, and jobs. In November 2011, members of the NASUWT voted by a 4-to-1 margin (on a 39% turnout) to take strike action, and begin working to the letter of their contracts. The NASUWT set aside historical differences with the National Union of Teachers; a joint declaration in May 2012 led to a co-ordinated work-to-rule and strike action in autumn 2013.\n\n\nNASUWT campaigns\nThe NASUWT has initiated a number of influential campaigns in recent years, including a campaign leading to the abolition of a code of conduct proposed by the General Teaching Council, a campaign recognising the effects of cyberbullying, and a campaign to bar members of the British National Party from the teaching profession.\nAfter 2010, the union joined campaigns against the coalition government. It asserted that \"the Education Act 2011 heralded the break-up of the entire state education service\" and subsequently lobbied under the slogan \"Reclaim the promise\", harking back to the Education Act 1944. NASUWT encouraged its members to join marches sponsored by the TUC, and participated in the Robin Hood tax campaign.\n\n\nLocation\nThe headquarters is situated by the Lickey Hills Country Park in North Worcestershire which borders the southern edge of the City of Birmingham (NASUWT Rose Hill, Rednal, Birmingham B45 8RS).  Built as a businessman's private house in 1897, Hillscourt was a preparatory school before the union bought it in 1971. Its library was named the Terry Casey Library in 1983 to commemorate Casey's 20 years as general secretary. The union also has nine regional centres in England, and national centres each of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.\n\n\nGeneral secretaries\n\n1975: Terry Casey\n1983: Fred Smithies\n1990: Nigel de Gruchy\n2002: Eamonn O'Kane\n2004: Chris Keates\n2020: Patrick Roach\n2025: Matt Wrack\n\n\nDeputy general secretaries\n1981: Fred Smithies\n1983: Nigel de Gruchy\n1990: Eamonn O'Kane\n2002: Chris Keates\n2004: Jerry Bartlett\n2010: Patrick Roach\n2020: Gareth Young\n2021 Jane Peckham\n\n\nSee also\n\nNational Education Union\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nCatalogue of the NAS archives, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick",
    "summary": "NASUWT – The Teachers' Union is a trade union representing teachers in the United Kingdom across all phases of education, affiliated with the Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Education International. It is one of the largest teaching unions in the UK and is distinctive in representing only qualified teachers, rather than a wider group of education staff.\nThe union describes itself as \"the undiluted voice of the teaching profession,\" emphasising that its work is centred exclusively on teachers’ interests. \nThe union engages in negotiations with employers, campaigns on pay and workload, provides legal and professional support to members, and, when necessary, takes industrial action.\nMembership is open to teachers at every stage of their careers, including those in supply roles, leadership positions, and in both the maintained and independent sectors.",

    "text": "Dennison School House is a historic school building (now a private residence) at Dennison Lane in Southbridge, Massachusetts.  Built about 1849, it is the city's only surviving rural district schoolhouse built in brick.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\n\n\nDescription and history\nThe former Dennison School House is located in a rural setting of southwestern Southbridge, on the east side of Dennison Lane near its junction with Dennison Crossing.  It is a modest 1+1⁄2-story brick structure, with a gabled roof.  The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows on either side of the entrance, which has a small transom window.  A wood-frame ell extends to the right.  The gable ends on the sides are framed in wood and finished in siding.\nThe building's location is believed to be the first place in Southbridge to be occupied by a school, because a school was documented to stand here in 1795, when the area was still part of Sturbridge.  The present building is estimated to have been built in 1849, based on its modest Greek Revival design.  It is unusual for the use of brick in its construction; the only other brick school from the period is the larger one in the city center.  The building was probably originally built with its entrance at one of the gable ends, a typical placement for small schools.  Only one other rural district school survives in the city; it is a heavily altered frame structure that has also been converted to residential use.\n\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Southbridge, Massachusetts\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts\n\n\nReferences",

In 2016, McDermott became a contestant on the second series of Love Island. She was voted into the villa by the public as a \"bombshell\" on the third day of the series and eventually coupled up with Scott Thomas, with whom she reached the final and finished in third place. Following her appearance on the show, McDermott began working as an influencer. In 2017, she was scheduled to switch on the Christmas lights in Welwyn Garden City, the town she grew up in, however angry residents started a petition arguing that having a contestant from Love Island switching on the lights was \"setting a bad example\", a point McDermott argued against on an episode of Good Morning Britain. McDermott was later dropped from the light switch-on, with organisers stating that they didn't expect such a \"strong reaction\".\nIn 2018, McDermott joined the cast of the ITVBe reality series The Only Way Is Essex for the show's twenty-third series, as she was dating cast member Myles Barnett at the time. In 2022, McDermott was signed up to appear on Celebs Go Dating but was later \"dropped from the series\".\nIn 2023, McDermott returned to the Love Island villa as a \"bombshell\" in the tenth series, seven years after her original appearance. She became the second contestant in the show's history to participate in another series, after Adam Collard. McDermott was dumped from the island on Day 44 alongside Ouzy See at the VIP Beach Party.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nKady McDermott at IMDb",
