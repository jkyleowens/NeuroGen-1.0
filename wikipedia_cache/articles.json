The following day, they announced their first incoming player for the upcoming season, with former Warriors \nflanker Matt Kvesic returning to the club after two seasons at Coventry.\nAs the following weeks progressed, Warriors began to build their squad, inviting fans to guess each player on a near daily basis, and giving three clues to help identify with an animated card titled \"Guess the Warrior?\", alike the children's board game, Guess Who?. Each player was then subsequently revealed at the end of the day.\nOn 22 May, Warriors announced that Tom Cruse had joined as Everard's assistant coach and on 31 May, Will Cusack joined as the new Head of Strength & Power Conditioning. On 2 June, former British & Irish Lions and England international Billy Twelvetrees was announced as Warriors 14th signing of the season in a player-coach role, coming out of retirement. On 5 June, Warriors announced their partnership with Italian sportswear manufacturer Macron to become their official kit supplier.\nOn 17 June, Warriors announced their title sponsorship with the Malvern-based British motor car manufacturer Morgan, to adorn their home and away kits for the season, with additional partnership bradning between the two. On 21 June, Sam Handy was announced as the new Head of Rugby Conditioning.\n\n\nSeptember\nOn September 13, Warriors would play their first game in 1,084 days, opening their pre-season against Ampthill at Dillingham Park. Warriors named a 34-man squad for the tie, naming fly-halfs Will Lane and Tiff Eden as the captains for each half.\nWarriors kick started their return to action with a 54–12 pre-season win on the road at their upcoming seasons Champ rivals.\nOn September 18, with the squad announcement for the first match back at Sixways, the pre-season friendly against Bath Rugby, Warriors also announced that Matt Rogerson had been named the club captain for the upcoming season.\nOn Friday, September 19, Warriors would play their first game in front of the home crowd at Sixways, facing the reigning Premiership Champions Bath. Bath named Ollie Lawrence and Ted Hill in their starting XV, and the former Warriors received a wholesome welcome from the capacity crowd. Despite a strong showing by the hosts, Bath proved too strong and achieved a narrow 33-19 win.\n\n\nOctober\n\n\nTransfers\n\n\nTransferred in\n\n\nSquad\n\n\nForwards\n\n\nBacks\n\nNote: Ages are correct as of September 1, 2025.Stats are correct as of October 25, 2025 (Matchday #04).\n\n\nCoaching staff\n\n\nSeason results\nPre-season\n\nResults\n\n\nSeason stats\nMatchday squads\n\nStatistics\n\n\nSee also\nWorcester Warriors\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nWorcester Warriors official website\nChamp Rugby",

    "title": "USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6)",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=218787",
    "text": "USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6) was a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship of the United States Navy commissioned on 15 August 1998. Like the previous five Wasp-class ships, Bonhomme Richard was designed to embark, deploy, and land elements of a Marine Corps landing force in amphibious assault operations by helicopter, landing craft, and amphibious vehicle, and, if needed, to act as a light aircraft carrier.\nLHD-6 was the third ship of the United States Navy to bear the name first given by John Paul Jones to his Continental Navy frigate, named in French \"Good Man Richard\" in honor of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, the publisher of Poor Richard's Almanack who at the time served as U.S. ambassador to France.\nOn 12 July 2020, a fire started on a lower vehicle-storage deck while the ship was undergoing maintenance at Naval Base San Diego. It took four days for firefighters to extinguish the fire, which injured at least 63 sailors and civilians and severely damaged the ship. After a lengthy investigation into the cause of the fire, a sailor was charged with arson but was acquitted at trial. Repairs to the ship were estimated to take up to seven years and cost up to $3.2 billion, so the ship was decommissioned on 15 April 2021 and sold for scrap.\n\n\nConstruction\n\nIngalls Shipbuilding received the contract to build the ship on 11 December 1992 and laid down her keel on 18 April 1995. She was launched on 14 March 1997, delivered to the Navy on 12 May 1998, and commissioned on 15 August 1998.\n\n\nCost\nThe average cost of a Wasp-class landing helicopter dock (LHD) ship was estimated to be $750 million in 1989\n($1.6 billion in 2024)\nwhereas the program unit cost of an America-class LHA (landing helicopter assault) was expected to be about $3.3 billion in 2015\n($4.3 billion in 2024).\nIn 2020, the cost of replacing the ship was estimated to be about $4 billion.\n\n\nShip's history\n\n\n1998–2009\nBonhomme Richard departed her building yard, Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton Industries, Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 8 August 1998, sailing into Pensacola Harbor at Naval Air Station Pensacola for commissioning activities and culminating with the main ceremony, which was held on 15 August 1998.\nU.S. Representative John P. Murtha, of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, delivered the principal commissioning address. Then Secretary of the Navy, John H. Dalton, placed the new ship in commission. Congressman Murtha's wife, Mrs. Joyce Murtha, served as Ship Sponsor and christened the ship at Ingalls in May 1997. During the commissioning, Mrs. Murtha gave the traditional order to \"Man our ship and bring her to life!\"\nBonhomme Richard participated in several operations. From 24 January to 24 July 2000, the ship made the first Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment of any U.S. Navy ship in the 2000s as part of Operation Southern Watch. She deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom from 1 December 2001 to 18 June 2002.\n\nHer next deployment was in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, beginning on 17 January 2003 and lasting until 26 July 2003. Bonhomme Richard played two significant roles in Operation Iraqi Freedom; first, she offloaded more than 1,000 Marines and gear from the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines into Kuwait. Second, after delivering her attack and transport helicopters, troops, and vehicles, she took up a position just miles off the coast of Kuwait and became one of two light aircraft carriers, or \"Harrier Carriers\", along with USS Bataan in the Persian Gulf, launching AV-8B Harrier strike aircraft into Iraq. Pilots from Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211) and VMA-311, embarked aboard Bonhomme Richard, expended more than 175,000 pounds (79,000 kg) of ordnance, providing close air support to the Marines on the ground and during predetermined strikes in Iraq. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Bonhomme Richard launched more than 800 sorties, including 547 combat launches.\nBonhomme Richard sailed to Sri Lanka to provide support for relief efforts following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis. On 4 January 2005, the ship helped airlift relief supplies to the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Bonhomme Richard deployed in Operation Unified Assistance from 5 January 2005 to February 2005. Her helicopters flew supplies and medical personnel into various areas of Indonesia and evacuated the wounded.\nThe following July, Bonhomme Richard participated in RIMPAC 2006. From April 2007 to November 2007, she joined up with two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, John C. Stennis and Nimitz and their Carrier Strike Groups (CSG) off the coast of Iran to carry out previously unannounced air and sea exercises. In July 2008, the ship took part in RIMPAC 2008 off the coast of Hawaii.\nFrom September 2009 to April 2010, Bonhomme Richard deployed to the Fifth and Seventh Fleet Areas of Operations (AoR). Ports of call include East Timor; Phuket, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Oahu, Hawaii. In July, she participated in RIMPAC 2010 in the Kaulakahi Channel, between Kauai and Niihau Islands, Hawaii, near the Pacific Missile Range Facility.\n\n\n2010–2020\nBonhomme Richard took the place of USS Essex as the command ship for Expeditionary Strike Group Seven and switched homeport from San Diego, California, to Sasebo, Japan, on 23 April 2012.\nDuring the summer of 2013 Bonhomme Richard participated in Exercise Talisman Sabre 2013. Maneuvers were performed off Queensland, Australia, and in the Coral Sea. After the exercise, the ship sailed for Sydney, arriving on 16 August 2013.\nUpon returning to her home port in Sasebo Japan,  her Commanding officer, Daniel Dusek was relieved of command for his alleged involvement in the Fat Leonard scandal. His Executive Officer, M.J. Tynch, took command of the ship.\nBonhomme Richard assisted in the air-sea rescue operation of the capsized South Korean ferry MV Sewol with helicopters on 16 April 2014.\nBonhomme Richard participated in Exercise Talisman Saber 2017 involving more than 33,000 Australian and U.S. troops in June 2017. Alongside Bonhomme Richard, 20 other ships and over 200 aircraft took part in what was Australia's largest exercise to date. A week-long port call in Melbourne followed.\n\n\n2017 Osprey crash\nOn 5 August 2017, a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit took off from Bonhomme Richard and then crashed in Shoalwater Bay on the east coast of Australia. Twenty-three personnel were rescued, while three died, their bodies being recovered about three weeks later.\nOn 8 May 2018 Bonhomme Richard completed her homeport change to San Diego.\n\n\nJuly 2020 fire\n\nWitnesses reported that an explosion occurred at about 8:50 a.m. on 12 July 2020 aboard Bonhomme Richard while in her homeport at Naval Base San Diego undergoing maintenance. The resulting fire was fueled by paper, cloth, rags, or other materials, not fuel oil or other hazardous materials, Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, told reporters that evening. Since the ship was in maintenance, on-board fire-suppression systems had been disabled, delaying the onset of firefighting efforts, according to Admiral Sobeck. The fire was reported to have started in an area that is normally used to park military trucks while the ship is at sea, but where shipyard workers might have temporarily placed other items including combustible materials.\nThe day the fire erupted, seventeen sailors and four civilians were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries; all but five were released by the morning of the next day, Navy officials said. By 14 July, the number of injured had risen to 61, as more people were treated for minor injuries, including heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation.\nOn 16 July, five days after the explosion, the Navy announced that all fires had been extinguished. The minor injury total had risen to 63 total (40 sailors and 23 civilians). Admiral Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, said the event was \"a very, very serious incident\" and that the Navy would address any systemic problems. He said the firefighting efforts had involved sailors from many ships and units in San Diego, including the helicopter squadron HSC-3, which dropped water on the ship. Eight sailors assigned to Bonhomme Richard were meritoriously promoted in rank on 31 July for their actions in fighting the fire.\nFire and water damage were sustained on 11 of 14 decks. Sections of the flight deck and other decks were warped and bulging, while the island was nearly gutted. The Navy removed the aft mast of the damaged ship to ensure it would not collapse.\n\n\nInvestigations and charges\nOn 26 August 2020, news outlets reported that a sailor from the ship was being investigated for arson, but no motive had been identified, and no one had been charged. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), along with other federal agencies, continued to investigate.\nAs of September 2020 three investigations were ongoing related to the fire. Two investigations were being conducted by Naval Sea Systems Command: The first was a failure review board investigation of safety issues relating to ship design and structure and how changes could prevent future fires from spreading through ships under similar circumstances; the second was a safety review related to the events and activities that occurred on the ship before the fire and their relation to existing navy policies and procedures; finally, an investigation into command issues was led by Vice Admiral Scott Conn, the commander of the 3rd Fleet. Fire-suppression foam could have been released, but was not, because of a lack of training.\nOn 29 July 2021, an unnamed sailor was charged by the NCIS with aggravated arson under Article 126 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and hazarding a vessel under Article 110 of the UCMJ. The sailor was the same unnamed suspect questioned in August 2020 by NCIS and other federal law enforcement agencies and was identified as Seaman Apprentice Ryan Sawyer Mays in an affidavit unsealed in August 2021. The next step in the process was an Article 32 hearing, the United States military equivalent of a preliminary hearing, to determine whether the case was strong enough to proceed to a court-martial.\nA Navy report published in 2021 lists numerous deficiencies in leadership, firefighting training, and equipment that contributed to the loss of the ship. In his 3 August endorsement of the report, United States Pacific Fleet commanding admiral Samuel Paparo characterized the crew as \"unprepared\" and their training and readiness as \"deficient\" while calling out \"a lack of familiarity with requirements and procedural noncompliance at all levels of command.\" Navy fire safety protocols enacted after the 2012 loss of attack submarine USS Miami in a similar fire were not followed, and Bonhomme Richard's captain, executive officer, command master chief, and chief engineer were criticized for leadership failures that \"directly led to the loss\" of the ship.\nThe report emphasized poor communication and coordination between sailors and officers on the ship, firefighting teams on the naval base, teams assembled on nearby destroyers, and civilian firefighters. When the smoke was first noticed, sailors aboard Bonhomme Richard failed to promptly and accurately locate and report its source, partially because some sailors did not don firefighting attire and breathing equipment because they mistakenly believed that it could not be worn with their working uniforms. Firefighting hoses and fittings on the ship were broken or missing, and numerous hatches could not be closed to contain the blaze because temporary utility lines routed through them for maintenance work could not be easily disconnected.\n\nOn 16 July 2022, the Navy issued a letter of censure to retired vice admiral Richard Brown, commander of Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, at the time of the fire. The letter said that he had failed \"to effectively ensure appropriate levels of training and readiness in units under your command\". In response, Brown complained that the Navy \"has abandoned me for political expediency\". The Navy later issued letters of reprimand to other officers, including Captains Gregory Thoroman and Michael Ray, the former commanding officer and executive officer, and command master chief Jose Hernandez, the senior enlisted sailor aboard, for inadequate training, improper oversight and a failure to properly maintain equipment, all of which had led to the fire being as destructive as it was. The two officers also forfeited pay; they were among 20 sailors punished over the fire.\nA view from general shipping.\n\n\nTrial of the accused\nAfter an article 32 hearing, a trial date of 19 to 30 September 2022 was set for Mays, who, according to his civilian defense attorney Gary Barthel, continued to maintain his innocence of charges of aggravated arson and willful hazarding of a vessel. Barthel claimed that the legal officer who oversaw the article 32 hearing recommended to the head of the San Diego–based command, Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, that \"the case not go to court-martial, and that the Navy is scapegoating Mays due to the high-profile nature of the Bonhomme Richard disaster.\"\nBefore the article 32 hearing, the accused sailor's attorney stated that the portrayal of his client had been unfair and that he looked forward to proving that his client is innocent. Dozens of Navy officials, including several admirals, \"have faced disciplinary action for failures that investigators said prevented the blaze from being put out sooner.\" He said that there is \"evidence that the fire was started because of negligence and the improper storage of lithium batteries close to crates of hand sanitizer.\"\nOn 19 September 2022, Mays's trial began at Naval Base San Diego. On 30 September after a two-week trial, a military judge acquitted Mays on both charges (arson and willful hazarding of a vessel).\n\n\nDisposal\nOn 30 November 2020, Navy officials said that attempting to repair the damage and return Bonhomme Richard to service would take between five and seven years and cost an estimated $2.5 billion to $3.2 billion. Instead, the decision was made to withdraw the ship from service and, following extensive component recovery, have her sold for scrap. In February 2021, a bipartisan group of congressional delegates from Florida proposed that the hulk be sunk off the coast of Florida as an artificial reef, arguing that the reef would become an environmental and economic benefit to the area. After a decommissioning ceremony on 14 April 2021, she was officially decommissioned on 15 April. The same day, the hull was towed from San Diego, heading for a scrap yard in Texas. On 9 April 2021, International Shipbreaking Ltd. of Brownsville, Texas, purchased the ex-Bonhomme Richard for $3.66 million for breaking and recycling.\nThe Marine Corps—in conjunction with International Ship Breaking Limited, Naval Sea Systems Command, Weapons Training Battalion and Method of Entry School (MOES)—salvaged 44 hatches and 2 hull sections, which will be used to teach Marines special procedures for breaching watertight doors during visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations. It is estimated that the service saved over $100,000 by salvaging these parts.\n\n\nShip awards\nList of awards the ship received during her time in service:\n\nAmong other unit awards, Bonhomme Richard was awarded the Navy Battle \"E\" eight times.\n\n\nSee also\n2012 USS Miami (SSN-755) fire, a civilian worker was convicted of arson.\n\n\nReferences\n\n This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

    "title": "White's law",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1508379",
    "text": "White's law, named after Leslie White and published in 1943, states that, other factors remaining constant, \"culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased\".\n\n\nDescription\n\nWhite spoke of culture as a general human phenomenon and claimed not to speak of 'cultures' in the plural. His theory, published in 1959 in The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome, rekindled the interest in social evolutionism and is counted prominently among the neoevolutionists. He believed that culture – meaning the sum total of all human cultural activity on the planet – was evolving.\nWhite differentiated between three components of culture: \n\nTechnological,\nSociological and\nIdeological, and argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution.\n\n\nArgument synopsis\nWhite's materialist approach is evident in the following quote: \"man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment\". This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques. White's argument on the importance of technology goes as follows:\n\nTechnology is an attempt to solve the problems of survival.\nThis attempt ultimately means capturing enough energy and diverting it for human needs.\nSocieties that capture more energy and use it more efficiently have an advantage over other societies.\nTherefore, these different societies are more advanced in an evolutionary sense.\nFor White \"the primary function of culture\" and the one that determines its level of advancement is its ability to \"harness and control energy\". White's law states that the measure by which to judge the relative degree of evolvedness of culture was the amount of energy it could capture (energy consumption). White differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of domesticated animals. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to agricultural revolution here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy.\n\n\nWhite's energy formula\nWhite introduced a formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        E\n        T\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C=ET,}\n  \n\n...where E is a measure of energy consumed per capita per year, T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy and C represents the degree of cultural development. In his own words: \"the basic law of cultural evolution\" was \"culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased.\" Therefore \"we find that progress and development are affected by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed\". Although White stops short of promising that technology is the panacea for all the problems that affect mankind, like technological utopians do, his theory treats technological factor as the most important factor in the evolution of society and is similar to the later works of Gerhard Lenski, the theory of Kardashev scale of Russian astronomer, Nikolai Kardashev and to some notions of technological singularity.\n\n\nEarlier research\nIn 1915, Geographer James Fairgrieve outlined a similar law of history. In its widest sense on its material side, he wrote, history is the story of man's increasing ability to control energy. By energy he meant the capacity for doing work, for causing—not controlling—movement of men and machines. Man's life is taken up by the one endeavor to harness as much energy as possible and to waste as little as possible. Any means where he can harness more or waste less marks an advance and important event in the world history. Inventions mark stages of progress. The forthcoming League of Nations, he believed in the first year of World War I, would be another stage in progress in saving energy, as it would save the energy wasted in wars.\n\n\nSee also\nAstronomical engineering – Form of megascale engineering\nClarke's three laws – Axioms proposed by British science fiction writer Arthur C.

    "title": "St Johns Wood, Queensland",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=11252138",
    "text": "St Johns Wood is a neighbourhood within the suburb of Ashgrove in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nA small residential pocket at the base of Taylor Range, it is embraced by a loop of Enoggera Creek and by the Ashgrove Golf Club, Brisbane City Council Reserve and the Enoggera Barracks. The locality was originally inhabited by the Indigenous Turrbal people before it opened up to European settlement during the second land-sales of the district in 1858, with the homestead called St John's Wood House (also known as Granite House) founded in 1864. It remains and occupies a small parcel of land within the locality, with the remainder being subdivided into housing allotments. Additionally, it is home to St Johns Wood Scout Group and The Woods Early Education Centre & Pre-school. The neighbourhood is accessed by either vehicular bridge, bikepath or footbridge. A prominent controversy for St Johns Wood surrounds the question of whether Princes Albert and George visited St Johns Wood on their visit to Brisbane in 1881.\n\n\nIndigenous history\nThe St Johns Wood and wider area (Ashgrove's native name is \"Kallindarbin\") was originally inhabited by the indigenous Turrbal or \"Duke of York\" clan. The main thoroughfare, Waterworks Road, was built on a Turrbal pathway that led to Mount Coot-tha, a place of the \"Honey-Bee Dreaming\". The water holes along Enoggera Creek and its tributaries, with their dense fringing scrubs, met many of the needs of a hunter-gatherer society. With its rainforests, eucalypt forests and connection to the Brisbane River, it would have provided a source of freshwater and food for the Turrbal people. The rainforests yielded yams, black beans and wild figs, all of which still grow along the creek today. Everyday life for the tribe consisted of hunting and gathering food, with time for games, and other social and spiritual activities. Inevitably with the expansion of European influence the balance of land use changed and this led to the eventual displacement of the Turrbal from their traditional base.\n\n\nOriginal development\n\nThe first Europeans were presented with well watered alluvial flats along Enoggera Creek, partly covered with scrub and presumably seen to include land suitable for cultivation. The land beyond the creek flats and in the foothills of the Taylor Range had better soil derived from the granite and was suitable for grazing. These were the factors that set the pattern for the sale of firstly leasehold and then freehold land by the crown in the pre-separation period.\nThe earliest known formal occupancy and use of the area by Europeans dates from 1849 when the first crown leases along Enoggera Creek were offered at public auction. The annual rent was 10 shillings per square mile. The area grossing 7020 acres which contained St Johns Wood was taken up by Darby McGrath in 1851 and was known as 'The Gap Station' on which he ran sheep. It is presumed that the lease of 'The Gap Station' was later extinguished by the crown as the granting of freehold land tenure spread along Enoggera Creek from 1856.\n\n\nSt Johns Wood estate\n\nThe original St Johns Wood estate comprised an area 67 acres (27 ha) of the portions 165 and 381, Parish of Enoggera, part of which was originally purchased by John Frederick McDougall for a price of £70 4s 0d on 14 September 1858. This estate had been established as a cattle station by the Hon Mr. McDougall who employed fencer Simon Kelly to fence its perimeter. This work was completed by the middle of 1859. He sold portions 164 and 165 to Arthur Martin, auctioneer, during the economic crash of the mid-1860s. On 5 August 1864 Daniel Rowntree Somerset, Registrar of Pensions, purchased the land with final registrations of the titles on 10 July 1865 and later on 29 August 1867 purchased portion 381 making up the total of the estate. Somerset began to build \"a magnificent home on his landed estate\" in a U-shape plan, utilising the granite from the local hillside for the external walls and a shingle roof . and it is he who named the Estate St John's Wood after his Son Henry St John Somerset. He resided there for 4 years till after the death of his wife in February 1867 where the Funeral Notice states that they are to move from his residence St John's Wood, Water Works Road and the marriage of his eldest daughter Anna Sophia held at the Estate in May 1868.\n\n\nThe Harding Settlement\n  Somerset leased, in May 1868, Portions 164, 165 and 381 to the next occupier being George Rogers Harding, initially a young barrister who became a prominent Judge. Harding proceeded to purchase the property on 27 January 1874. He extended the Homestead, which became known as \"The Granite House,\" by adding a ballroom by infilling the space between the two wings, constructed a separate adjacent building consisting mostly of bedrooms for his growing family which became known as the \"Cedar House\" due to the type of timber used in the construction, extended the Service Wing by two bedrooms for maids and men and added stables and yards. He established an Orange Orchard on land across the Creek and purchased adjacent properties to increase his landholdings.  The original property comprised a drawing room, dining room, large hall, smaller hall, library, \"best\" bedroom, dressing room, bachelor's room, seven other bedrooms, pantry, lumber room, two servants' rooms, kitchen, laundry and stables. Some of these rooms would have been in the adjacent building.\n\n\nEntertainment at St Johns Wood House\n\nThe Harding family entertained extensively in their home and were well known for the banquets and entertainment that they provided. At a function on 23 June 1881, they were entertained by an Austrian band with dancing and in August 1881, the Hardings held a masquerade dance in their Ball Room. There is a copy of a banquet menu from 26 November 1884, where the guests had six courses, liqueurs, claret, and coffee. At \"a large and brilliant gathering\" in 1892, \"guests including...Queensland Judges, the Chief Secretary and other Ministers, many members of both Houses and Legislature, of the legal profession, and of the civil service, and a large number of ladies. In all the number of visitors could not have been less than 500...the host and hostess charmingly received their visitors...A band of music was in attendance and the function passed off most pleasantly.\"\n\n\nRoyal visit controversy\nSince the 1930s there have been reports that the Hardings entertained Prince Albert and Prince George on their visit to Brisbane in 1881. The young Princes (aged 17 and 16 respectively) are reported as having spent most of their leisure at St Johns Wood and Ashgrove, riding through the country and fishing on Enoggera dam with the Harding children. No other records could be found to verify this story, although it has become local folklore. They attended the Ministerial Picnic that was held at Enoggera Reservoir 19 August 1881, along with two hundred other guests, who enjoyed the boating and lunch in the large marquee. There is no evidence that on their return to Government House that they visited the Harding residence, although they passed through the property along Waterworks Road. Even without Royal patronage George Harding's professional status in the community would have made the many functions at his home well attended by Brisbane society.\n\n\nSt Johns Wood housing estate\nAfter George Rogers Harding died in 1895 his estate was indebted to the Queensland National Bank Limited. The bank initially had difficulty in selling the land but eventually sold it in 1917 to the next owner, Francis Michael Anglim. Anglim initially used the land to breed thoroughbred brood mares.\nHe subsequently subdivided the land in 1923, and sold it as a housing estate called St John's Wood after the house. In the following year the neighbouring Glen Lyon Estate was also subdivided, and the tramline to Ashgrove (Oleander Drive) was finally completed. This assisted in the rapid development of the area. In August 1927 a feature article appeared in the Brisbane Courier.\n\nSt Johns Wood ...on account of its beauty, has been sold to the best people in the State—people of wealth, repute and undoubted position. This alone will make the name of St Johns Wood a hallmark of distinction and exclusiveness.\nA map advertised the sale of 800 allotments at Royal Park Estate, now The Gap and St. John's Wood Extension Estate, Ashgrove by F. M. Anglim in August 1927.\nAnglim died in 1931. In 1934 Edward Albert Hawkins purchased the property and although he planned a major extension to the Granite House, it did not proceed and he remained living at his Clayfield residence. He converted the house into two flats, partly enclosing the verandas and separating the service wing at the rear into a separate dwelling. At the same time he obtained an old school building at auction from the West End State School and used the materials to reconstruct a Recreation Hall adjacent to the Granite House in 1936.\nHis nephew, Mervyn E Hawkins, inherited the property on Mr Hawkins' death in 1956 and in 1958 he arranged a further subdivision of the remaining property into six building allotments, further reducing the size of the Granite House allotment to its present area of 1432m2. This resulted in the front of the house facing the side boundary with access now from Piddington Street.\nOwnership of Granite House changed several times and Mr and Mrs Guerassimoff converted it back to a grand house and sold it in 1987.\n\n\nEmbassy / Ambassador Hall\n\nThe Embassy Dance Hall, and then the Ambassador Theatre, occupied the same building at different periods.  It was located on the west corner of Gresham Street and Royal Parade, St John's Wood. Construction occurred in 1928 and was built for Frank Fraser Ltd. It was an all timber structure of 33.5m x 17m with a 6.5m ceiling height.  Entry was from the Enoggera Creek end via a twin flight of stairs to a wide verandah.  The Hall had side alcoves, a raised stage, two change rooms, a small apartment and a side refreshment counter.  Male and female toilets were under the building at the creek end.\nInitially it began as a cabaret style dance on Friday nights with simple dance evenings and private functions at other times.  Many of the patrons came by electric tram to the terminus at Oleander Drive and then by special bus to the hall; others walked or came by motor car.  Associated with the Hall were four tennis courts on the west side with high wire netting fences.  These were flood-lit for night use.\nDuring World War II, the 2/1st Australian Chemical Warfare Laboratory of the Australian Army took over the hall and adjacent tennis courts between 1943 and 1945.  This was a secretive unit where all sorts of chemical gases and munitions were tested.\nIn 1947, Bert Hyde became the owner of the building and lived in the enclosed verandah.  He converted the hall into a picture theatre which he called the Ambassador Theatre. He built a projection room through the roof, put a screen on the stage and installed canvas seats.  Screenings occurred on Saturday nights.  The small structure on the west side was converted into a grocery shop which served the patrons on picture nights as well as the residents of St Johns Wood.\nWith the advent of television in 1959, its popularity waned and on 17 December 1960 the last regular screening occurred. The Hall was still used for other functions such as square dances and pop bands.  Bert Hyde died in 1970 and the building was sold.\nThe 1974 flood did not affect the building structurally but it was becoming somewhat derelict and the Brisbane City Council issued a notice to the new owners to demolish the building, thus ending the life of the building which had served the community for 46 years.\n\n\nThe weir\n\nAs part of Mr Anglim's vision for the housing estate, he had the idea to create a recreation area along the banks of the Enoggera Creek and a lake formed by the construction of a small weir across the creek. In August 1928 one of Mr Anglim's compatriots, Mr Fraser, applied to the Brisbane City Council for approval to build a weir a few chains on the city side of the new bridge entering St Johns Wood and he was to bear the cost of its construction.\nIn January 1929 tenders were called for the construction of the weir. Applicants were to apply via Telephone No C 8506 to obtain Tender Documents. Note: The telephone number is that which belongs to Mr Anglim at his Town Hall office address (a central town contact is better than out in the country, even though Mr Fraser was the organiser.)\nThe construction of the weir, according to the council minutes, was designed by the council's Civil Engineers Department which was a concrete and reinforced steel structure. The creation of this lake proved very popular with the community as many social functions were held as recorded in the newspapers. Those activities were swimming, canoeing, various games of sport and picnics. As part of this two small bathing boxes were erected as change rooms on the flat area close to the edge of the top of the bank. In 1931 a devastating flood in Enoggera Creek occurred under-mining the supporting earth bank at the west end of the concrete weir wall, reducing the water-retaining capacity of the wall and was not able to serve its design purpose – as well the bathing boxes were washed away and were not replaced. History has not recorded the outcome of the weir but it is believed within the community that the structure was dynamited and destroyed some time in the 1940s.\nThe concrete across the floor of the creek which can be seen near the St Johns Wood Scout's Hall is all that remains of the original weir.\n\n\nA house crosses Enoggera Creek to become a hospital\n\nDr Thomas Brooke-Kelly was one of the earliest residents of St Johns Wood from 1931 to 1934.  He and his wife Lavinia and only son Noel lived down the bottom of St Johns Avenue, not far from the current pedestrian \"banana\" bridge.\nDr Brooke-Kelly, a surgeon, had an ambition to have his own hospital.  With the extension of the tram line from Oleander Drive to what was called The Terminus, near Ashgrove State School, he decided to shift his home in St Johns Wood to a block of land at 438 Waterworks Road, Ashgrove, and convert it into a hospital. He would add two bedrooms underneath.\nHe employed the McKenzie Brothers, from Station Terrace Dutton Park, for a price of 600 pounds.  The removal, in March 1934, became part of the folklore in the McKenzie family business.  It was recalled as the most difficult job they ever did – down and across the Enoggera Creek bed, roads terrible, hill steep, and house too large. It took one month and two days to move it. \"It was fascinating to watch...they lowered the house, in one piece, on to large timber slides, dragged the house to the creek bank and then slid and pulled it across the creek on substantial hardwood bearers. It was hard tough work and required a lot of muscle. Once across the creek the contractor raised the house on to a large wooden wheeled jinker.\"\nIt became Brookwell Private Hospital at 438 Waterworks Road until 1937. Dr Brooke-Kelly moved many times in his career as a doctor and died, aged 93 in Clayfield.  He is buried at Toowong Cemetery (with the Robinson family).\n\n\nThe dairy farm\nIn the early 1930s St Johns Wood operated a dairy to produce milk for the residents. It was within the residential allotments which were bounded along the street alignments of Buckingham Street (from No 45), Grand Parade, St John's Avenue and across the block at the gully (to No.45). This covered approx 2 ha (5 acres) and had a barbed wire fence enclosing the area.\nThis was operated by the Peake family. They lived in their house at No 57 Buckingham Street and the cow sheds were 50 m (164 ft) up hill. \nThey had a herd of approximately 25 cows which were producing 455 L (100 imp gal) of milk per day.\nAs this was a somewhat small land area to accommodate the herd of cows and as there were lots of \"feed\" outside this, as well as there were only a small number of houses and much vacant land, at times the cows were let out, without a \"herdsman\" to wander along the creek banks and across the properties then returning to the home paddock prior to milking. This occurred until 1939 when it ceased operating. The original house still exists and the current owners affectionately call it \"The Dairyman's Cottage\". Roy Mac Arthur was a \"billy boy\" for Stephen Peake:\n\nAt most residences the lady of the house put a china jug, with a beaded cloth mesh cover, on the front steps to receive the milk. You were in big trouble if you spilt any milk on to the hardwood tread or flooring. A milk stain is difficult to remove.\n\n\nWorld War II\n\n\nAir Raid Precautions Post – St Johns Wood Recreation Hall\nPrior to May 1941, the Queensland Government had established only a small number of Air Raid Precaution (ARP) posts. These posts were scattered across Brisbane and were staffed by professional personnel drawn from the various emergency services. The ARP post established at the St Johns Wood Recreation Hall in Laird Street on 17 May 1941 was different. It was organised through the local community and it was staffed and largely equipped by civilian volunteers. To encourage the formation of more community-run ARP posts, a procession involving civil defence organisations from different Brisbane suburbs assembled at the Jubilee Tce police station and marched to the new ARP post for its official opening. The St John's Wood ARP post was a new concept as community-based volunteers who provided both their expertise and some of the equipment required to run it. Mr. W.R. Johnstone, a resident of Piddington Street, established this new ARP post. He paid to equip the first-aid centre and Mr. E.A. Hawkins of Clayfield arranged premises in a room of the St Johns Wood Hall. Local registered nurse G. Weight offered to staff the centre, while her husband R.J. Weight offered his car as a temporary ambulance. Other local residents also volunteered their own cars and trucks and Mr. C.W. Bellingham lectured on first-aid.\n\n\n2/1 Australian Chemical Warfare Laboratory St John's Wood Hall\nThe use of chemical weapons by the Japanese in China increased the threat of chemical warfare during World War II. The allied forces in Australia stockpiled chemical weapons to be used in retaliation, and carried out experiments on the effectiveness of various gases and compounds. The Australian Government also established significant chemical weapon stocks and established a number of testing facilities and depots across the country.\nThis military organisation was originally formed as part of the Royal Australian Engineers in mid-1942, under the leadership of infantry Captain Jim McAllester. Known initially as the 2/1st Australian Mobile Anti-gas Laboratory, it was located in Broadmeadows Camp in Victoria. Following a name change to 2/1st Australian Chemical Warfare Laboratory in February 1943 it was moved to Brisbane to be closer to field operations. Approval was given to re-establish the laboratory at the St Johns Wood hall in Royal Parade in August 1943, and it was in operation at that site by October.\nThe mobile chemical warfare laboratory operated by the unit had been constructed in recognition of its need to be mobile in Australia in event of enemy chemical attack, and potentially to be used in the Pacific area of operations. The tasks and processes adopted by the unit were similar to those of British units, and were well established by the time they settled in at St Johns Wood. The Laboratory was tasked with the examination of enemy chemical weapons, ammunition, and protective clothing and respirators.\nAt various times the St Johns Wood Laboratory also stored larger quantities of chemicals. In February 1944 for example, 75 boxes of 25-pounder shells containing bromobenzyl cyanide (known as BBC) were delivered for training purposes. The site is believed to have been cleared when abandoned by the Army.\n\n\nThe Woods Memorial Playground\nA single Kauri pine (Agathis robusta) stands behind an upright Mt. Coot-tha bluestone boulder to commemorate Flight Sergeant Clifford Berger Hopgood. The memorial stands in a leafy children's playground on the banks of the Enoggera Creek, facing north, and the boulder is 1.6 m (5.2 ft) high. It bears a plaque with the inscription:\n\nTo the Memory of Flt/Sgt Clifford Berger HopgoodKilled in action over Occupied Europe24 February 1944\nThis Tree Was Planted By His Friends of St. Johns Wood\nA local resident, Marjorie Summerville, recalls being present at the planting of the memorial tree to Clifford Hopgood and the placement of the seat with the plaque, sometime after World War II. According to the council park history for the site, the seat was destroyed (possibly by the 1974 flood) and the plaque re-erected on the large Mt. Coot-tha bluestone boulder, one week before Anzac Day, 1974.\nFormer St Johns Wood Councillor for The Gap ward, Brian Hallinan, believes the planting occurred sometime in the early 1950s. The friends referred to on the plaque were an informal group of St Johns Wood residents.\n\n\nSt Johns Wood Scout Group\n \nThere has been a \"scout\" presence in St Johns Wood since before World War II. During the war, the local Red Cross branch would hold their meetings in the \"Scout's hall\". However, the 1st St Johns Wood Scout Group did not begin officially until 9 March 1945. \"Pop\" Johnstone was the first Cub Master, and the Cub Pack met in the Igloo in Royal Parade, 100m or so west of the Gresham Street intersection. An article on \"Australia's Tiniest Hospital\", Target included a photo of \"Pop\" Johnstone with two Cubs. He remained Cub Master until 1946, when he became Group Scout Master. He led the Group until June 1947, when he resigned for health reasons.\nThe Scout section started in August 1945, with four boys from the Ashgrove Troop and six new recruits, meeting at the hall in Laird Street in the grounds of Granite House. William arranged for a lease of land in Royal Parade from the Brisbane City Council and purchased an Army Quonset hut from the United States Army for the St John's Wood Cubs after WWII. The first Scout Master was Jas \"Skip\" Garland, who came from Baralaba.\nThe Senior Scout section of the Group started in 1954. In his annual report, the Chairman of the Group Committee reported that Cliff Farmer was appointed Senior Scout Master. The 'Seniors' met in the Army Quonset Hut on Friday nights while the Cubs met there on Saturdays. Senior Scouts are known now as Venturer Scouts.\nThe Rover Scout section started in 1959. \"Secondly, during March we began a Rover Crew, thus adding the fourth section to the Group.\" The first Rover Leader was Ian \"Sailor\" Webb who came to us through a fortuitous meeting with the then Group Scout Master \"Kernel\" Matthews.\nBy this time the Group had moved to the quarry site west of the Ashgrove State School. The Quonset Hut was later moved adjacent to the Boy Scouts in the old quarry but was lost in the 1974 flood. Cubs and Scouts met in the main Den; the Senior Den was built in 1959 and the Rovers built their own Den in 1963. The Joey Scout section started in 1991, and was an immediate success. The St Johns Wood Scout Fellowship, open to adult members, had their inaugural meeting on 10 February 1992.\nThe Group has been, and is, an integral part of the local community. It is responsible for helping shape the physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual development of its members. The Group has been fortunate to have had, over the years, an energetic leadership team; men and women committed to the inculcation of social and moral values in the boys and girls in their charge. In addition to Group activities such as camps and rallies, fetes and fairs, Scouting affords participation in worldwide events such as Jamborees, Ventures and Moots, and St Johns Wood has a proud history of active involvement in these pursuits at all levels.\n\n\nFlooding\n\nDue to St Johns Woods geography (being bordered on three sides by Enoggera Creek), there is a high risk of flooding on the parkland surrounding the creeks. In February 1931 a flood destroyed the Gresham Street Bridge, after 457 mm (18 in) of rain fell at Enoggera in 48 hours. During the 1974 Brisbane flood, waters in Enoggera Creek rose by up to 6.5 m (21.3 ft) and many houses were washed away. Today, parks take their place and provide a buffer against repeated flooding. On 20 May 2009 all access to St Johns Wood was cut off due to localised flooding for most of the afternoon and night.\nIn January 2013, ex tropical Cyclone Oswald caused flooding to Enoggera Creek, which inundated the Gresham Street bridge and destroyed the 'Banana' pedestrian bridge to the Ashgrove Sports ground.\n\n\nRainbow Subdivision/St Johns Wood Hill\nThe locale of St Johns Wood comprises portions 165, 166, 381 and 382 in the Parish of Enoggera, Brisbane. The land on the western perimeter of St Johns Wood identified as Portion 382 being an area of 15 acres (6 ha), 1 rod and 16 perches was originally purchased 10 August 1864 by Joseph Berry. This land remained intact until subdivision in the 1980s. The land had been bought by Blue Metal & Gravel (BMG Resources Ltd.) who also owned the quarry on the opposite southern side of Waterworks Road, (where The Gap Tavern stands today) with the intention of quarrying the site. In the 1970s there was enormous opposition to the quarry on the southern side of the road and BMG made the decision not to quarry the St Johns Wood site. Several attempts were made to subdivide the land including one in which it was to be subdivided into 60 townhouse sites. When these attempts proved fruitless the land was put up for sale and was purchased in 1984 by local real estate agent Syd Appleby and his wife Merryl and Allan and Maree Rainbow. They initially subdivided the land into 23 lots with the Applebys and the Rainbows retaining the largest two lots of 2.5 acres each in the north-western corner. The first purchasers of the subdivided land were airline pilot, Richard Kleeman and his wife Sue and Professor Peter Coaldrake and his wife Dr. Lee Coaldrake. Soon after their houses were built and they moved in, the Coaldrakes and the Applebys traded houses, with the Coaldrakes then owning the larger block in the north west corner next to the Rainbows. In 1991, the Coaldrakes and Rainbows decided to subdivide their two lots into six lots. Their properties had access with two other lots under a reciprocal easement arrangement. One of the owners demanded one hundred and thirty thousand dollars on payment to allow the subdivision to proceed without challenge. When this demand was rejected the owner took the matter to the Supreme Court where she lost the case. She continued to demand the money and appealed the court decision. This decision was upheld and the case proceeded to the High Court where it was again upheld. This case became and remains a landmark case on easements in Australian and British law. The issue was: When a dominant block is subdivided does each of the subdivided parts gain the benefit of the easement? The High Court held that it did only if it was of benefit to the subdivided parts. They emphasised the point that an easement is not a personal right, it belongs to land, it attaches to dominant land for the benefit of that land. If it benefits each of the subdivided parts, it is attached to them and does belong to them.\n\n\nLocality amalgamation into the Suburb of Ashgrove\nAlong with Dorrington, St Johns Wood as a suburb in its own right ceased when it was absorbed into Ashgrove in 1975. Although to this day, these locality names seem to be in such common use that they may not be lost at all, as many residents still associate their residence locations with those former names.\n\n\nArchitecture\nSt Johns Wood consists of predominantly detached housing. The \"Granite House\" is the original homestead in St Johns Wood. It is significant for its rarity because it is an 1860s house built primarily of granite quarried in the vicinity. The 1860s stone residence is significant for its aesthetic quality, craftsmanship and intactness, including the internal cedar joinery, skylight, plaster ceiling roses, stonework and original beech floors. The house and grounds are significant also for their landmark quality. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in June 2000. There are a number of pre-war \"Queenslander\" and \"Ashgrovian\" style houses that were built before the building boom of the post-war era, which resulted in many post-war style houses to be built. Some owners lived on-site in primitive single room dongas (ex-army huts) for the duration of the construction of the main house, sometimes a number of years. In the 1960s and 1970s some new streets were developed and the architecture of those homes reflect the building style of that era. It was during this time that the Enoggera Barracks built a small number of brick and tile homes in land bordering their Barracks for their personnel, however these are all now privately owned. In recent times gentrification has resulted in houses that have been either significantly renovated or demolished to make way for a contemporary new house.\n\n\nCommunity groups\n\n\nSt John's Wood sustainability\nSt John's Wood Sustainability is \"acting locally\" to encourage and support:\n\nre-localising our lives (business, leisure)\nethical buying (including food)\norganic local food growing\nrecycling and pooling resources\nbiodiversity – animals and plants\ngreen energy technologies\nclean creeks, tree planting\nunderstanding global warming / climate change issues\nlobbying government and business\nsense of community\n\n\nSt John's Wood History Group\nThe group consists of interested locals who strive to explore and preserve the unique story of St John's Wood. They meet regularly to report on current historical projects.\n\n\nSave Our Waterways Now\n\nSave Our Waterways Now (SOWN) is a community organisation working to restore the habitats of creeks, including Enoggera Creek. The organisation is supported by the Brisbane City Council through its Habitat Brisbane Program and Water Resources. Save Our Waterways Now aims to:\n\nrestore catchment health and biodiversity\nprovide a best practice working model for catchment group activities\nincrease community awareness, understanding and participation\nsupport and encourage member activities and involvement.\nSOWN is very involved in the community and undertakes a range of activities to improve the health of the local waterways.\n\n\nTransport\nSt Johns Wood has a regular bus service, run by Transport for Brisbane. Commuters have a choice of four bus stops within St Johns Wood or can utilise bus services on Waterworks Road.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nMacArthur, Roy; Gap Pioneer and History Group (2005), Enoggera Creek and me : from the Dam to St Johns Wood, The Gap Pioneer and History Group Inc, ISBN 978-0-9757412-1-4\n\"The Western Echo\".

    "summary": "St Johns Wood is a neighbourhood within the suburb of Ashgrove in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nA small residential pocket at the base of Taylor Range, it is embraced by a loop of Enoggera Creek and by the Ashgrove Golf Club, Brisbane City Council Reserve and the Enoggera Barracks. The locality was originally inhabited by the Indigenous Turrbal people before it opened up to European settlement during the second land-sales of the district in 1858, with the homestead called St John's Wood House (also known as Granite House) founded in 1864. It remains and occupies a small parcel of land within the locality, with the remainder being subdivided into housing allotments. Additionally, it is home to St Johns Wood Scout Group and The Woods Early Education Centre & Pre-school. The neighbourhood is accessed by either vehicular bridge, bikepath or footbridge. A prominent controversy for St Johns Wood surrounds the question of whether Princes Albert and George visited St Johns Wood on their visit to Brisbane in 1881.",

    "text": "HMS Procris was a Cruizer-class brig-sloop launched in 1807. She served at the second battle of Copenhagen. She then went out to the East Indies where she spent the rest of her active service, including participating in the 1811 invasion of Java. She returned to Britain in 1814 and was sold the next year. She then became a merchantman, while retaining her name. She traded primarily with North America but on a voyage in the Mediterranean an armed Greek brig captured her. However, her master was able to regain control. She was wrecked on 25 August 1839.\n\n\nCareer\nCommander Francis Beauman commissioned Procris in March 1807 for service in the North Sea. She is listed among the vessels qualifying for prize money arising out of the battle of Copenhagen. On the way, Procris and Cherub detained the Danish ship Neptunus on 30 August.\nCommander James M. Gordon replaced Beauman in October. He then sailed Procris for the East Indies on 18 December 1807. In February 1808 Commander Robert Maunsell replaced Beauman.\nIn the run-up to the British invasion of Java, on 14 July 1809 Procris encountered and destroyed the Dutch privateer Wagster. Wagster, a brig belonging to the Dutch East India Company, was armed with eight guns and four swivel guns, and had a crew of 86 men. The encounter took place off Batavia.\n\nThen on 30 July Procris anchored at the mouth of Indramayo, following the orders of Captain George Sayer of the frigate Leda. At daylight Maunsell discovered six Dutch gun-boats in the river, each armed with a brass 32-pounder carronade forward, and a long 18-pounder aft, and carrying a crew of 60 men. They were protecting a convoy of 40 to 50 proas. As Procris moved towards them she quickly ran into shallower water and had to anchor at a range that left her cannon fire ineffective. Maunsell persisted in his attack using Procris's boats, as well as two flat boats that had accompanied him, each carrying an officer and 20 men from the 14th and 89th Regiments of Foot. During the British attack one of the Dutch gunboats blew up. The British captured the other five seriatim, all with a loss of only 11 men wounded, albeit some dangerously or badly, despite the heavy fire from the gunboats' cannons and small arms. During the attack the proas escaped up the river.\n\nThe British finally were able to land troops on Java on 4 August, with Batavia falling to them on 26 August after a siege and heavy fighting. Total British casualties, army and navy combined, were 156 killed, 788 wounded, and 16 missing. Maunsell served on shore, assisting Sayer, who commanded the 500 seamen that manned the twenty 18-pounder guns landed from their ships and emplaced in batteries to bombard Fort Cornelius. In the exchange of fire several seamen became casualties. Procris alone lost one man killed and seven wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Java\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign.\nLieutenant Walter Forman became acting commander of Procris in late 1811. She was under his command in March 1812 when a British squadron, consisting of Bucephalus, Cornelia, and Procris, the Honourable East India Company's (HEIC) warships Mercury and Teignnmouth, and its gunboats Wellington and Young Barracouta, as well as the transports Sandany, Minerva, Matilda, and Mary Ann, sailed from Batavia on a punitive expedition to Palembang, on Sumatra, after the Sultan there massacred Dutch and Malays at the Dutch factory there earlier in the month. The British brought with them detachments from the 59th and 89th Regiments of Foot, the Madras horse artillery and hussars (dismounted), Bengal artillery, two battalions of sepoys, and an Ambonese contingent.\nPhoenix, under the command of Captain James Bowen, joined up with the fleet later, with Bowen taking command of the fleet as senior naval office. When Bowen discovered that frigates could not cross the bar before the river on which Palembang sits, Bowen transferred his command to Procris. Between 18 and 26 April, she, together with Teignmouth, Wellington and Barracouta and the larger warships' boats, proceeded 60 miles upriver. On the way, they captured undefended shore batteries containing 101 guns, and captured the Sultan's palace, which surrendered without a fight though 104 guns protected it. Foreman served about five months aboard Procris before transferring to Malacca to assume the post of first lieutenant.\nIn February 1812 Lieutenant Nathaniel Norton was appointed to command of Procris, replacing Forman. As Forman was still commanding her in the expedition to Palembang, Norton must have taken actual command in late April or after.\nProcris joined Phoenix, Barracouta, and a detachment of 100 men from the 48th Highlanders in a punitive expedition against the Sultanate of Sambas, along the Sambas River in western Borneo. Barracouta was unable to force the river defenses and the expedition was forced to retreat after she suffered some casualties. Bowen died shortly thereafter of fever. The HEIC cruiser Aurora and some gunboats then maintained a blockade until a second punitive expedition arrived in June 1813.\nThe Royal Navy contingent in the second punitive expedition consisted of Leda, Hussar, Malacca, Volage, Hecate, and Procris, with Captain Sayer of Leda as the senior naval officer.  The HEIC contributed the cruisers Malabar, Teignmouth, and Aurora, seven gunboats, the transport Troubridge, and the East Indiaman Princess Charlotte of Wales . The army contingent consisted of the 14th Regiment of Foot, a company each from the Bengal artillery and the HEIC's European Regiment, and the 3rd Bengal Volunteer Battalion. Eventually the British vessels, except the frigates, were able to cross bar in front of the river and move towards the town of Sambas. Capturing two forts yielded over 70 brass and iron guns of mixed calibers, but the town of itself yielded little booty. The expedition was able to recapture the Portuguese brig Coromandel, which the pirates had captured the year before. British casualties from combat were relatively low, but casualties from fever and disease were high.\nIn April 1813 Commander Thomas Cusson replaced Norton. Cusson sailed Procris back to Britain, arriving in August 1814.\nDisposal: The Navy put Procris up for sale in February 1815. She finally sold, for £900, on 23 November.\n\n\nMerchantman\nProcris then became a merchantman. She first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1816 with John Facey, master, J.Brown, owner, and trade Poole-\"Merm\".\n\nOn 1 January 1822, Procris, Taggart, master, ran aground as she was arriving at Poole from Cork. she was gotten off and arrived the next day.\nIn 1827 Procris, Arnold, master, was sailing in the Mediterranean. A letter from Smyrna dated 12 September 1827, reported that as she was sailing from Alexandria to Leghorn she encountered an armed Greek brig which put six men aboard her and ordered her to sail to Napoli. However, shortly thereafter the brig and Procris encountered a fleet of 80 vessels from Egypt, bound for Morea. The brig made off while Arnold sailed Procris into the fleet, over-powered the Greeks on board, and then sailed to Smyrna.\nOn 22 June Procris, Arnold, master, bought into Campbeltown. She had been on her way from Quebec to Liverpool when she struck rocks at Kiell, near the Mull of Kintyre. Her rudder irons were broken and it was possible that she had sustained severe damage.\n\n\nFate\nProcris was wrecked 25 August 1839 on Allan's Island, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her crew were rescued. Lloyd's Register (LR) for 1839 carried the annotation \"Wrecked\" by her name.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\nLow, Charles Rathbone (1877).

She then went out to the East Indies where she spent the rest of her active service, including participating in the 1811 invasion of Java. She returned to Britain in 1814 and was sold the next year.

Over the course of ten years, he worked his way up to restaurant management and hotel operation, and at age 21 was appointed General Manager of Food and Beverage Services at the Palace Hotel in Madrid.\n\n\nEmigration to Mexico and later career\n\nIn 1948, he emigrated to Mexico City, Mexico, and went on to become the head of the hotel and restaurant conglomerate Nacional Hotelera S.A., which included The Presidente Hotel chain in Mexico. Among them, the first air-conditioned luxury hotel in Acapulco and Cozumel, as well as several popular restaurants and night clubs such as Can-Can and Focolare, in Zona Rosa.\nIn 1958, Balsa signed a contract to operate the Prado-Alfer Hotel in Mexico City; in 1960, he acquired the Hotel Del Prado, then the largest hotel in Mexico. When he took over the Hotel De Prado, the dining room had a 1946–1947 mural, Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central (Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central), by Diego Rivera.  The mural, twenty meters long and seven meters high, was hidden by columns, so he moved it to the middle of the lobby, where it could be seen.\nIn 1960, Balsa bought the operating lease to the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, New York. He bought the hotel's leasehold in 1963, and then the building itself and the land in 1964. Balsa sold the hotel to Sheraton in 1966.\nIn April 1963, Balsa signed a partnership and management contract with Antenor Patiño to operate the newly built 600-room Maria Isabel Hotel (now known as the Sheraton Mexico City Maria Isabel Hotel) in Mexico City, at the time the largest hotel in Latin America. In November that year Sheraton and Balsa Hotels signed a collaboration agreement in which Sheraton would represent Balsa Hotels in the United States and Balsa would represent Sheraton in Mexico.\nInternational ventures included the Hotel Villa Magna in Madrid.\nTogether with ARA Inc., Balsa handled the catering for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, serving 10,000 athletes and 30,000 meals a day.\nIn 1963, he became president of the Mexican Association of Hotels and Motels.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Secretariat of Tourism and the Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística grant a medal every year that bears his name to recognise those who excel in the tourism industry.\n\n\nSee also\nList of people from Madrid\nList of Mexicans\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Cesar Balsa at Wikimedia Commons\n\nhttp://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n718100.htm\nhttp://www.eluniversal.com.mx/columnas/68324.html",

    "text": "Alfredo Catalán Schick (born November 12, 1968), is a Venezuelan politician. He is affiliated with Project Venezuela. He was elected mayor of El Hatillo from July 30, 2000 until December 1, 2008. He was reelected once in 2004.\n\n\nCareer as a mayor\nIn 2001 the mayor stated that his main goal for the municipality was to promote it as a touristic destination. In fact, Catalán's first year in office was focused on improving the appearance of the municipality, and the El Hatillo Independent Institute of Tourism and Recreation was created. Operation Joy (Spanish: Operación Alegría), a project that attempted to make the municipality cleaner and nicer, was in action during Catalán's government.\nAccording to the municipality website, Catalán's government made improvements to the educational facilities of the area, including the repair of five state-owned schools that support 1,400 students. Special programs were implemented for students, such as drug prevention, water conservation, the Francisco de Miranda Project, which focused on the use of technology to improve children's education, and other programs that also benefited the municipality by getting citizens more involved in the community activities. As of 2008 public schools conditions are worse than they were before the arrival of Catalan into office. Also, crime and heavy traffic problems caused by an irresponsible residential policy implemented by Catalan are impacting negatively in a municipality that was once considered \"the safest municipality of Caracas\". Catalan's approval ratings dropped towards the end of his term and most of the inhabitants of El Hatillo blamed him for the problems of the municipality.\n\n\nCriticism\nSome individuals, such as the journalist Nelson Bocaranda, have criticized Catalán's administration regarding the municipality's insecurity. Bocaranda himself was a victim of death threats after criticizing Catalán's government in his radio emission Los Run Runes de Nelson. According to the IFEX, the mayor's father Norberto Catalán, went to Bocaranda's office in La Lagunita with his bodyguard. Bocaranda was not in his office at the time, but his secretary was told that Norberto was armed and he would shoot the journalist if he did not take his comments back within 24 hours. The mayor's father also left threatening notes. A security video camera recorded the incident.\nCatalan dedicated his second term to the issuing of residential construction permits all over the municipality without stopping to consider how this would affect traffic in the municipality. There are few avenues and roads that connect El Hatillo to the rest of Caracas and, during Catalan's government, there was a substantial amount of new residential developments in the zone that have resulted in the collapse of El Hatillo infrastructure such as roads and public services.\n\n\nGovernment bankruptcy\nIn 2001, Alfredo Catalán mentioned in several occasions that the municipality was bankrupted. He said to the media that a lot had been done for El Hatillo for a first year in office, and since the beginning of his first term, Catalán had given priority to tourism. Between the five municipalities of Caracas, El Hatillo receives the least income from taxes, but he believed that Operation Joy would give the residents trust in the mayor, and more investments have been done in culture and tourism than in a new local government headquarters for example. Catalán denounced that Flora Aranguren, the previous mayor, had left a deficit of almost US$500,000 between budget and treasury.\n\n\nReferences",

It was originally located in Saint Petersburg at the cemetery in Smolny Convent  above  the grave of the commander. It was built from private donations. In 1909 during the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Yakov Baklanov  it was decided that transferral of the burial in Novocherkassk was necessary. The bones along with the monument were transferred in Novocherkassk in 1911. Baklanov's coffin was placed  into a shrine under Novocherkassk Cathedral. The sculpture composition with some adjustments in the pedestal was moulded on Yermaka square. The monument is located  to the south of the Novocherkassk Cathedral. The opening ceremony of the monument took place on October 5, 1911.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter Baklanov's death in 1873  military ataman Mikheil Chertkov requested to start a whip-round for the monument. By the beginning of 1875 2314.02  rubles was raised. A miniature of the monument was designed by N. Nabokov. It was demonstrated at the House of Nobility in Novocherkassk. Variant proposed by sculptor Dyleev had satisfied no one. Don superior commissioned leading Petersburg masters to realize the approved draft. Master Yefimov processed the granite monolith boulder and decorated the burial vault. The casting of the statue was being supervised by the famous French bronze designer Félix Chopin.\nThe iron cannons provided by the draft were replaced by granitical spheres owing to lack of money. In 1911 the monument was entirely transferred in Novocherkassk. The gilding and bronze elements  were dismantled and passed to scrap metal in 1930s. Restoration of the monument under the leadership of A. Tarasenko was completed on June 4, 1995, the year of the 195 years anniversary of Novocherkassk.\n\n\nDescription\nThe monument is a granitical boulder, which is covered with a cossack burka and a battle standard with the last sentence of Nicene Creed «we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.» (Russian: Чаю воскресения мёртвых и жизни будущего века. Аминь) written on it. A general's shashka is visible out from under the burka. The sculpture composition is crowned with a bronze papakha. The city's sites of military glory of Baklanov are carved on the sides of the pedestal.

A lahar – a sudden surge of mud-laden water – swept down the river, significantly weakening the structure of a railway bridge at the small settlement of Tangiwai. The overnight express train between Wellington and Auckland passed over the bridge minutes later, causing it to collapse into the turbulent waters. Of the 285 people on the train, 151 were killed.\n\n\nTimeline\n13 December 1859: The bridge was washed away.\nIn February 1862 James Coutts Crawford  was given a number of old songs and \"various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the Wangaehu bridge.\"\n1889: flood caused by the eruptions of Ruapehu.\n1895: flood caused by the eruptions of Ruapehu.\n24 December 1953: Tangiwai disaster\n18 March 2007: Mt Ruapehu crater lake burst releasing an estimated 1.29 billion cubic metres of water, mud, and sludge; the Ruapehu ERLAWS alarm successfully activated preventing any accidents.

    "text": "Richard Rothwell (20 November 1800 – 13 September 1868) was an Irish painter who specialised in portrait painting.\n\n\nBiography\nRichard Rothwell was born 20 November 1800 in Dublin. His father has generally been stated to be James Rothwell of Lisdaly, near Cloghen, King's Co. (Offaly), though primary source evidence suggests that he was the son of William Rothwell, gentleman, who appears in the 1820s as a publican of Ferbane, King’s Co., acquiring land at Ballicknahee, King’s Co. His mother was Elizabeth Rothwell (née Holmes). He had at least three siblings (a brother and two sisters) and possibly as many as six [3].  He trained to become a painter at the Dublin Society's school from 1814 until 1820 and won a silver medal for his work. At the age of 24, he was made a member of the newly established Royal Hibernian Academy and exhibited portraits there from 1826 to 1829. He subsequently moved to London and worked as a studio assistant to Thomas Lawrence,. When Lawrence died in 1830, Rothwell completed many of his unfinished works and was poised to become the next foremost portrait painter in Britain and Ireland. According to Leoneé Ormond's biographical article in the Grove Dictionary of Art, Rothwell \"was at the height of his powers from 1829 to 1831\"; he \"was much influenced by Lawrence, but he lacked the incisiveness and flair of his master\". From 1831 to 1834, Rothwell toured Italy to study Italian art so that he could paint history paintings. When he returned to London, his popularity had evaporated. Rothwell lived and exhibited works in Ireland, the United States, London, and Italy, but he never again achieved the same level of popularity he had reached in the late 1820s.\nIn 1842 Rothwell married Rosa Marshall; the couple had several children.\nIn 1868, Rothwell contracted a fever while working in Rome and died. Joseph Severn, who painted a portrait of the Romantic poet John Keats, arranged for Rothwell's funeral and tomb in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.\n\n\nWork\nAccording to Fintan Cullen's biographical entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Rothwell's \"portraits are highly accomplished\" and \"fine examples\" include those of novelist Gerald Griffin and Mary Shelley. In the 1830s, he started painting genre pictures, such as The Poor Mendicants (1837). Rothwell usually painted Italian-inspired pieces, such as his semi-nude study Calisto (c. 1850s), a work he considered his masterpiece. He was furious when the painting was poorly hung at the 1862 International Exhibition in London and published a pamphlet on the topic.\n\n\nExamples of his work\n\n\nNotes\n\n3.

Prior to their relocation to Blackwell Meadows, the club have agreed to ground-share with Bishop Auckland F.C. at their Heritage Park ground, where they played at for four years.\nThe club announced their intentions to finally make the move at the start of the 2016–17 season, with expansion plans in place to increase the capacity of Blackwell Meadows to 3,000 in order to meet requirements to play in the National League. They played their first game at the ground on 26 December 2016 against FC Halifax Town, which would be their record attendance as 3,000 spectators witnessed the club's return to their hometown.\nDespite finishing in the play-off places during their first season at Blackwell Meadows, Darlington were disqualified from competing in the play-offs for a chance for promotion to the National League due to an inadequate quantity of seats. As a result, the club expanded their seated stand to 588 in 2018 to avoid the same events occurring again.\nHaving reverted to their traditional playing name of Darlington F.C. ahead of the 2017–18 season, the club announced during the summer of 2017 that work had begun on a new playing area and a new seated stadium following the addition of further fundraising.

    "text": "Norbert Casteret (19 August 1897 – 20 July 1987) was a famous French caver, adventurer and writer, and is one of the most recognisable names in caving worldwide. Following Édouard-Alfred Martel (the \"father of modern speleology\", although Casteret sometimes also enjoys this title), Casteret, along with Robert de Joly, became a leading figure of French speleology between the world wars and into the middle of the 20th century.\n\n\nBiography\n\nNorbert Casteret was born in Saint-Martory in Haute-Garonne on 19 August 1897. His father, Henry Casteret, was a lawyer in Toulouse. His brothers were Roger, who died at the age of four, Jean and Martial Casteret, a physician who accompanied his brother on some of his explorations.\nAn all-round athlete and accomplished mountaineer, Casteret began caving in 1912, spanning the era of matches and candles into the age of electric lights. Unlike de Joly, who made caving his profession, Casteret was more the amateur adventurer (albeit a very knowledgeable one).\nCasteret served in the French infantry for three years during World War I, serving in his brother Jean's regiment. After being demobilized in 1919, he contracted the Spanish flu. He kept the helmet and lamp he used in the trenches for future use in caving.\nUpon his return from the front, at his father's urging Casteret studied law and became a notary's clerk, a position he quickly abandoned. In 1924, Casteret met his future wife, Élisabeth (born 13 May 1905), a doctor's daughter who ended her medical education after their marriage the same year. She later accompanied Casteret on many of his explorations, including the expedition to find the true source of the Garonne. The couple had five children: Gilberte, Raoul, Maud, Raymonde and Marie. Élisabeth died on 6 May 1940 of puerperal fever, a few days after the birth of their youngest child.\nCasteret's motto was the Latin phrase Ad Augusta per Angusta (through difficulties to greatness).\nCasteret died in Toulouse on 20 July 1987, at age 89.\n\n\nCaving career\n\nCasteret's fame began with a bold free-dive in the Grotte de Montespan (French) in 1923, which led to the discovery of prehistoric cave drawings on the far side. He went on to undertake many important cave explorations, including the caves of Marboré, including Grotte Casteret, in 1926, the Grotte de Labastide in 1931, Cigalère in 1931, Gouffre Martel (−303 metres (−994 ft)) in 1933, Henne Morte (thought to be −446 metres (−1,463 ft), corrected to −358 metres (−1,175 ft)) in 1947, and the Gouffre de la Pierre Saint-Martin (−689 metres (−2,260 ft)) in 1952–3 where his teammate Marcel Loubens died after a winch failure on the entrance shaft.\nCasteret's popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, in part from his prolific writing – hundreds of articles, and more than 40 books with numerous reprintings in French and translations into several languages. Two of his best-known works, Dix ans sous terre (1933) and Au fond des gouffres (1936) were combined and translated into English by Barrows Mussey as Ten Years Under the Earth in 1939.\nMy Caves, translated from the French by R. L. G. Irving, was published in London by J.M. Dent & Sons in 1947, followed by The Darkness Under The Earth, in 1954.\n\n\nSee also\nGrotte Casteret\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\nCasteret, N.

The much altered second light survives as a private residence.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe mouth of the Sheboygan River (then called the Chipewagan) was one of four sites examined in 1837 as possible sites for lights along the Wisconsin side of Lake Michigan. Examination of the site led to a favorable recommendation, and a light was erected on the bluffs at North Point (or North Sheboygan Point), north of the river mouth. This light, which was first lit in 1839, consisted of the typical brick tower and attached dwelling of the period. In 1857, the original lamp and reflector arrangement was upgraded to a fifth order Fresnel lens; however, by this date erosion threatened the structure, and a house was built further back in 1860. The new light was housed in a dwelling with the lantern on the roof.\nThe location of the light was (and is) some distance from the river, whose navigation was impeded by shoaling. In 1852 a series of improvements to the harbor commenced, beginning with a set of piers to delineate the channel. These piers were extended in stages, and were eventually supplemented by a breakwater which in turn was extended to shore, and which in the end supplanted most of the north pier. Each of these structures had a navigational light placed upon it, locally maintained at first, and then after 1873 by the lighthouse service. A 1905 upgrade to the north pierhead light rendered the older lighthouse superfluous, and it was deactivated that year. The old lighthouse was sold, and in 1916 it was moved further inland, where it still stands.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Giulio Ugo Bisconcini (2 March 1880, Padua – 1969) was an Italian mathematician, known for his work on the three-body problem.\n\n\nEducation and career\nBiscocini received his laurea in mathematics in 1901 at the University of Padua. In 1906 he was appointed an academic assistant in analytic and projective geometry at the University of Rome. He was also a professor ordinarius at the commercial institute \"Luigi di Savoia - Duca degli Abruzzi\" in Rome.  At the University of Rome he became a libero docente (lecturer) on rational mechanics, i.e. classical mechanics as a mathematical system based on axioms. At the beginning of his career he did research on number theory, but he soon began to specialize in rational mechanics. His research dealt with the classification of the types of holonomic systems and the three-body problem.\nBisconcini was one of the professors conducting the Università clandestina di Roma (1941–1943), which was organized by Guido Castelnuovo to teach secret university courses to Jews and disfavored opponents of fascism.\n\n\nBisconcini's work on the three-body problem\nAccording to Daniel Buchanan:\n\nLevi-Civita showed that in the case of the restricted problem (one mass infinitesimal, the finite masses moving in circles) it is possible to determine the character of the motion near collision without difficulty and that the only singularities are branch-points. This was later shown by Bisconcini to be the case in the general problem when the three masses are finite, but he made an assumption which seemed evident but which he was unable to prove, viz., that the angular velocity of the radius vector of two bodies which collide remains finite as the time approaches the instant of collision. The contribution made by Sundman which marked the climax of the solution of the problem was to substantiate the assumption made by Bisconcini. While no attempt should be made to belittle the profound results of Sundman, it must be stated that they are disappointing as they give no information concerning the properties of the motion and are unsuitable for practical applications.\nAccording to June Barrow-Green:\n\nBisconcini's result was important, but it did not provide a satisfactory solution to the problem. In the first place, his solution involved a complicated power series that was not all easy to use. But rather more problematic was the fact the series was only applicable when the interval of the time between the start of the motion and the collision was sufficiently short, and he gave no conditions for the latter condition, So there was still a need both to simplify the solution and to increase the range of its application. Moreover, Bisconcini had considered only the problem of a binary collision and not that of a triple collision.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Bombyx mandarina, the wild silk moth, is a species of moth in the family Bombycidae. It is the closest relative of Bombyx mori, the domesticated silk moth. The larvae (caterpillars) of both species are called silkworms, famous for producing the fibroinous cocoon that is harvested by humans for silk.\nUnlike its domesticated relative, who has lost the ability to fly and is too synanthropic to even survive outside human cultivation, B. mandarina is a fairly ordinary moth. The main difference between the wild B. mandarina and the domesticated B. mori is that the former has a more slender body with well-developed wings in males, and is dull greyish-brown in colour.\n\n\nPhylogeny and systematics\nBombyx mandarina and the domesticated Bombyx mori constitute two of the currently identified eight species of the genus Bombyx, the true or mulberry silk moths. The origin of the domestic silk moth is enigmatic. It has been suggested that it is the survivor of an extinct species that diverged from the ancestors of Bombyx mandarina millions of years ago. However, this is based on an untenable molecular clock hypothesis that assumes that wild and domestic silk moths evolved equally fast after their lineages diverged. Rather, the effects of artificial selection have accelerated evolution in the domestic form to a point where it is hard to trace the origin of the numerous breeds of domestic silk moths even with the most modern molecular phylogeny methods. Conceivably, today's domestic silk moths are all descended from an initial stock of B. mandarina collected as far back as 5,000 years ago. While wild silk could have been collected and used as threads, etc., since much earlier, the technology to breed and use silkworms from a domesticated stock did not exist before the late Neolithic.\nHowever, it has been possible to trace the geographical origin of the domestic silk moth. The wild species occurs over a considerable range from inland China to Korea and Japan, and shows much (albeit subtle) variation; Chinese specimens have 56 chromosomes and Japanese specimens have 54. The populations from the northeastern end of the range, for example, differ in karyotype from those of inland China. Domestic silk moths are closer to the latter regarding mtDNA sequence data, and especially lack some genetic apomorphies of the northeastern B. mandarina. Thus, the initial domestic stock came from inland China.\nB. mandarina is able to hybridize with B. mori. Both in the wild and a domesticated environment, females release pheromones and wait for males to be attracted and fly to them. However, B. mori males cannot fly. Hybridisation in the wild, therefore, inevitably means breeding between wild (B. mandarina) males and domestic (B. mori) females. Hybridization is possible in both directions in a domesticated environment.\nConsequently, the two silk moths have been united as subspecies of a single species; in this case, the name Bombyx mori, which was published first, applies to both. However, today it is usually recognized that the domestic silk moth is entirely dependent on human care for its survival and thus has a level of reproductive isolation from its wild relatives.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nJapanese Moths: Bombyx mandarina.

    "text": "Lega (English: League), officially named Lega per Salvini Premier (English: League for Salvini Premier, LSP or LpSP), is a right-wing populist political party in Italy, led by Matteo Salvini. The LSP is the informal successor of Lega Nord (English: Northern League, LN).\nThe LSP was established in December 2017 as the sister party of the LN, active in northern Italy, and as the replacement of Us with Salvini (NcS), LN's previous affiliate in central and southern Italy. The new party aimed at offering LN's values and policies to the rest of the country. Some political commentators described the LSP as a parallel party of the LN, with the aim of politically replacing it, also because of its statutory debt of €49 million. Indeed, since January 2020, the LN has become mostly inactive and has been practically supplanted by the LSP, which is active all around Italy. The LSP came third in the 2018 general election and first in the 2019 European Parliament election. Like the LN, the LSP is a confederation of regional parties, of which the largest and long-running are Liga Veneta and Lega Lombarda, established in 1980 and 1984, respectively. Despite misgivings within the party's Padanian nationalist faction, the political base of the LSP is in northern Italy, where the party gets most of its support and where it has maintained the traditional autonomist outlook of the LN, especially in Veneto and Lombardy.\nIn February 2021, the League joined Mario Draghi's government of national unity. After a disappointing result in the 2022 general election, the party joined Giorgia Meloni's government with five ministers, including Giancarlo Giorgetti as minister of Economy and Finance and Salvini as deputy prime minister and minister of Infrastructure and Transport. The League also participates in 15 regional governments, including those of the two autonomous provinces. Five regional presidents, including Attilio Fontana (Lombardy), Luca Zaia (Veneto) and Massimiliano Fedriga (Friuli-Venezia Giulia), are party members. Fedriga is also the president of the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Lega Nord (LN) was established in 1989 as a federation of six regional parties from northern and north-central Italy (Liga Veneta, Lega Lombarda, Piemont Autonomista, Uniun Ligure, Lega Emiliano-Romagnola and Alleanza Toscana), which became the party's founding \"national\" sections in 1991. Umberto Bossi was the party's founder and later long-time federal secretary. The LN long advocated the transformation of Italy from a unitary state to a federation, fiscal federalism, regionalism and greater regional autonomy, especially for northern regions. At times, the party advocated the secession of the North, which the party referred to as \"Padania\", and consequently Padanian nationalism. The party always opposed illegal immigration and often adopted Eurosceptic stances, joining the Identity and Democracy group in the European Parliament in 2019. Throughout its history, the LN formed alliances both with centre-right and centre-left parties, but, in general elections, it was usually part of Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right coalition and, occasionally, ran as a stand-alone party (in 1996, gaining its best-so-far result: 10.1% of the vote). In the North several regions have been led by LN members, including Veneto (since 2010) and Lombardy (since 2013).\nIn December 2013, Matteo Salvini, a member of the European Parliament and former editor-in-chief of Radio Padania Libera, was elected federal secretary of the LN, after having prevailed over Bossi in a leadership election. To revive a party overwhelmed by scandals and which had reached historical lows in the 2013 Italian general election, Salvini led the LN though dramatic changes, first by re-orienting it toward the European nationalist right. In the run-up of the 2014 European Parliament election, Salvini formed an alliance with the French National Front led by Marine Le Pen, the Dutch Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders and other alike parties on the issues of Euroscepticism, opposition to immigration and sovereigntism, leading to the establishment of the Identity and Democracy Party (ID Party). The League also started a brief co-operation with CasaPound, a far-right organisation. In December 2014 Salvini launched Us with Salvini (Italian: Noi con Salvini, NcS), with goal of putting forward LN's issues in central and southern Italy and expanding the party's electorate.\n\n\nRoad to the new party\n\nIn the 2017 leadership election, Salvini was confirmed LN's leader, defeating Gianni Fava, from the party's traditionalist wing. The May 2017 federal congress marked the \"national\" turnaround. In October 2017, Salvini announced that in the 2018 general election the party would be re-branded simply as \"Lega\" and would field lists also in central-southern Italy. On 14 December 2017, the \"Lega per Salvini Premier\" party was established by long-time LN member Roberto Calderoli and its constitution was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale. LSP's official goals were the transformation of Italy \"into a modern federal state through democratic and electoral methods\" and the support of \"the freedom and sovereignty of peoples at the European level\". LSP's symbol was inspired from Donald Trump's campaign for the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries in the United States: a blue rectangle with the words \"Lega per Salvini Premier\" in white, surrounded by a thin white frame. A week later Salvini presented the new electoral logo: the word \"Nord\" and the Sun of the Alps were removed, the word \"Lega\" and the representation of Alberto da Giussano remained, while the slogan \"Salvini Premier\" was added.\nIn the 2018 general election, the League gained its best-so-far result of 17.4% of the vote, becoming the largest party within the centre-right coalition and establishing itself as the country's third largest political force. After the election, the party formed an alliance with the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which had come first in the election with 32.7% of the vote. The so-called \"yellow-green government\" was led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent jurist close to the M5S, and included Salvini as minister of the Interior. Since the government's formation, thanks to Salvini's approval as minister, the party was regularly the country's largest party in opinion polls, at around or over 30%. In the 2019 European Parliament election, the League won 34.3% of the vote, winning for the first time a plurality of the electorate, while the M5S stopped at 17.1%. In August 2019 Salvini announced his intention to leave the coalition with the M5S, and called for a snap general election. However, after successful talks between the M5S and the Democratic Party (PD), the incumbent government was eventually replaced by a new government led by Conte. The League thus returned into the opposition, together with its electoral allies of the centre-right coalition.\n\nDuring 2019, along with the LN's membership recruitment in the Centre-North, the party launched a parallel drive in the Centre-South for the LSP, practically supplanting NcS. Finally, during a federal congress on 21 December 2019, the party's constitution underwent some major changes, including reduced powers for the federal president, the extension of the federal secretary's and federal council's terms from three to five years, the introduction of \"dual membership\" and the faculty given to the federal council to grant the use of the party's symbol to other political parties. With the end of its membership drive in August 2020, the LSP became active throughout Italy. The LN, unable to be dissolved because of its burden of €49 million debt to the Italian state, was instead formally kept alive, while its membership cards were donated to former activists.\n\n\n2020 regional elections\n\nSalvini's popularity was supposed to create better chances for the League to continue its winning streak in regional elections (the latest being the 2019 regional election in Umbria, where Donatella Tesei was elected president with 57.6% of the vote and the League obtained 37.0%), particularly in Emilia-Romagna, a large region long-governed by the centre-left coalition. However, in the 2020 Emilia-Romagna regional election the party's candidate, Lucia Borgonzoni, stopped at 43.6% of the vote and was defeated by incumbent president Stefano Bonaccini (PD). The League's list obtained 32.0% and came second after the PD. The LSP, which had already peaked in opinion polls after quitting the yellow-green government, continued a slow decline in opinion polls and would be eventually eclipsed both by the PD and the FdI during 2021.\nIn the 2020 Venetian regional election, Luca Zaia, whose popularity was the result of a long-term focus on his home-region Veneto, was re-elected for a third consecutive term with 76.8% of the vote; Liga Veneta fielded two lists, including the League's official one and Zaia's personal list, which obtained 16.9% and 44.6%, respectively. In the Tuscan regional election, League's candidate Susanna Ceccardi was defeated in her bid to become president of Tuscany. The fact that the League had grown electorally only in Veneto and had lost appeal in other regions started to weaken Salvini's leadership, which was more or less silently contested by the \"centrist\" wing of the party formed by Giancarlo Giorgetti, Zaia and all of the party's regional presidents, from Lombardy's Attilio Fontana to Friuli-Venezia Giulia's Massimiliano Fedriga, who would become president of the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces in 2021.\n\n\nDraghi national unity government\n\nIn January 2021, Conte's second government fell after losing support from Matteo Renzi's Italia Viva party. Subsequently, President Sergio Mattarella appointed Mario Draghi to form a cabinet, which won support from the League, the M5S, the PD and FI. The League entered the new government with three high-profile ministers from the party's \"centrist\" wing: Giorgetti, the architect of the party's pro-Europeanist turn and close friend of Draghi, as minister of Economic Development, Massimo Garavaglia as minister of Tourism and Erika Stefani as minister for Disabilities. The party's support for Draghi's government stood in contrast to its Eurosceptic stances.\nIn June 2021, Salvini proposed a federation with FI and other centre-right parties supporting Draghi (thus excluding FdI), which has so far went nowhere, as well as a campaign for six referendums on justice along with the liberal Radical Party. In February 2022 five of the six referendums were approved by Italy's Constitutional Court, opening the way for a popular vote by June.\nIn the run-up of the 2022 Italian local elections, the party launched a new organisation named Italy First (Italian: Prima l'Italia) in southern Italy. The League ran under the \"Italy First\" banner in most southern cities and in the 2022 Sicilian regional election. According to Calderoli, who registered the new symbol on Salvini's behalf, Italy First could eventually become a new political party, possibly including also FI and other centrist parties. However, as the notion of replacing the League's symbol also in northern Italy was criticised by several party members, especially in Veneto, Calderoli ruled it out.\n\n\n2022 general election and Meloni government\nIn July 2022, the M5S did not participate in a Senate's confidence vote on a government bill. Prime Minister Draghi offered his resignation, which was rejected by President Mattarella. After a few days, Draghi sought a confidence vote again to secure the government majority supporting his cabinet, while rejecting the proposal put forward by Lega and FI of a new government without the M5S. In that occasion, the League, despite calls from its regional presidents to do otherwise, as well as the M5S, FI and FdI, did not participate in the vote. Consequently, Draghi tendered his final resignation to President Mattarella, who dissolved the houses of Parliament, leading to a snap election.\nIn the 2022 general election, the League, which was part of the winning centre-right coalition, won 8.8% of the vote, compared to 26.0% gained by the Brothers of Italy (FdI) and 8.1% by FI. As a result, Giorgia Meloni, leader of FdI, accepted the task of forming a new government and announced the Meloni government, which assumed official functions after each ministers were sworn in on 22 October. The League joined the new government with five ministers: Giorgetti minister of Economy and Finance, Salvini deputy prime minister and minister of Infrastructure and Transport, Giuseppe Valditara (a former aide to Gianfranco Miglio and co-author of the party's liberal-conservative manifesto) minister of Education, Calderoli minister for Regional Affairs and Autonomies, and Alessandra Locatelli minister for Disabilities. Prior to that, Lorenzo Fontana, from the conservative wing of the League, had been elected President of the Chamber of Deputies.\n\n\nInternal debates and 2023 Lombard regional election\nIn the wake of the disappointing result in the 2022 general election and the run-up to the 2023 Lombard regional election, some leading members of the party's traditional wing, rooted in Padanian nationalism, formed Comitato Nord (English: Northern Committee, CN). The Committee was inspired by Umberto Bossi and, under the leadership of Paolo Grimoldi, a former leader of Lega Lombarda, and Angelo Ciocca, a member of the European Parliament, it attracted more than one thousand members in a couple of months. The inaugural event of the Committee, held in early December, was attended by some 600 people, including former ministers Roberto Castelli and Francesco Speroni. Contextually, provincial congresses were held in some of the party's strongholds: critics of Salvini affiliated with the CN narrowly won in Bergamo and Brescia, while the pro-Salvini wing retained Varese for a handful of votes and Roberto Marcato, a regional minister loyal to Zaia, was leading the challenge in Veneto. Also, four regional councillors affiliated with the CN formed a separate group in the Regional Council of Lombardy and were subsequently ejected from the party. In the meantime, another group of dissidents, led by Gianni Fava, who lost to Salvini in the 2017 Lega Nord leadership election and never joined the new party, formed the \"Lombard Autonomist Movement\" and supported Letizia Moratti for president, along with the separatists of Great North, in the regional election.\nIn the election, held in February 2023, Attilio Fontana was re-elected president with 54.7% of the vote, 20pp more than his closest opponent (while Moratti was a distant third and would return to FI one year later), as well as improving the 2018's tally. While FdI became the region's largest party with 25.2%, the combined score of the Lombard League and Fontana's personal list was 22.7%. Also the CN, whose members might have voted Fontana's list in protest according to some sources, rejoiced, while being worried by FdI's largest party status. Contextually, the centre-right coalition won also in the 2023 Lazio regional election, in which the League obtained 8.5% of the vote.\nIn June 2023, the LV held its congress: Marcato retired from the race when Franco Manzato emerged as an alternative opposition candidate. At the congress, outgoing federal commissioner Alberto Stefani, a loyalist of Salvini, was thus elected secretary with 64.3% of the vote against Manzato's 35.7%, possibly with Zaia's silent support. The congress' result stabilised the regional party, but did not silence internal critics and several minor figures left the party, some of them joining FI, which had been led in Veneto by former LV leader Flavio Tosi since June 2022. and had become that party's regional coordinator in March 2023, In Lombardy, Castelli started his own People's Party of the North in November.\n\n\n2024 EP election and 2025 federal congress\nIn the run-up of the 2024 European Parliament election, Salvini invited Marine Le Pen to the party's traditional rally in Pontida in September 2023 and organised a conference of the Identity and Democracy Party in Florence in December 2023. The party also tried to forge a big-tent, by wooing popular mayors and regional presidents like Zaia, maximizing the right-wing vote by fielding general Roberto Vannacci and broadening toward the political centre by welcoming longtime centrist MEP Aldo Patriciello, the Union of the Centre and the Italian Liberal Party. In the end, neither Fedriga nor Zaia chose to stand, while Vannacci accepted to be a candidate, despite strong reservations by virtually all senior members of the party. In the meantime, a group of former LN members, led by Tosi, formed the \"Forza Nord\" coalition within FI: these included Alessandro Sorte (leader of FI in Lombardy), Roberto Cota (former president of Piedmont), Marco Reguzzoni (former floor leader of the LN in the Chamber of Deputies), Massimiliano Bastoni (former member of LN's right-wing, as well as lately of the CN), Matteo Gazzini (outgoing MEP and leader of FI in South Tyrol) and Stefania Zambelli (outgoing MEP). Furthermore, Grimoldi revealed that Bossi was going to vote for FI too.\nThe party's share of the vote was 9.0%, with Vannacci (500,000+ preference votes) being one of the most voted candidates in the election. The party improved its tally in the South, also thanks to candidates like Patriciello and Raffaele Stancanelli, but suffered in its traditional northern strongholds, where the party fared even worse than in the 2022 general election. Contextually, in the 2024 Piedmontese regional election the party won a mere 9.4% of the vote, while being part of the winning centre-right coalition led by incumbent president Alberto Cirio. Right after, long-time internal critic Grimoldi was ejected from the party. In October Grimoldi launched the Pact for the North, which was joined by Roberto Bernardelli (Padanian Union–Great North), Mario Borghezio, Giuseppe Leoni, Giancarlo Pagliarini and other dissidents of Lega Nord and Lega, while Bossi was appointed honorary president.\nIn December 2024 Massimiliano Romeo was elected secretary of Lega Lombarda unopposed, after that Luca Toccalini, Salvini's candidate, had withdrawn from the race due to lack of support. In his victory speech, Romeo reclaimed the party's northern identity, while president of Lombardy Fontana spoke of \"free Padania\".\nIn April 2025 the party held its long-awaited federal congress in Florence. Salvini was re-elected secretary unopposed. Of the 22 elective members of the federal council, the party's governing board, six (plus one representing Lazio) were Lombards, four Venetians, four from other northern regions, three from central Italy and four from the South. During the congress, which was presided over by minister Giorgetti, Vannacci formally became a member of the party. International speakers included Elon Musk. In May Salvini appointed four deputy secretaries: Alberto Stefani, also leader of the party in Veneto, and Claudio Durigon, who were confirmed in their roles, as well as Silvia Sardone and Roberto Vannacci, two new entries.\n\n\n2025 regional elections\nDuring 2025 a string of 2025 regional elections took place. The League has so far had generally disappointing results. In Aosta Valley the party, whose dissidents had set up the Valdostan Rally or joined Future Aosta Valley, won 8.4% of the vote (–15.5 pp), in Marche 7.4% (–15.0 pp), in Calabria 9.4% (+1.1 pp) and Tuscany 4.4% (–17.4 pp). The latter defeat was almost universally ascribed to Vannacci, who had led the campaign, sidelining some leading members, and was accused of denaturalising the party's message with his excessively right-wing rhetoric.\nAll eyes and party's hopes were thus directed toward the upcoming election in Veneto, the party's ultimate stronghold and one of the last three regions to vote in 2025, along with Campania and Apulia. The League long tried to change the law in order to allow term-limited Zaia to run again, as well as fielding Zaia's personal list, under which most of the party's regional councillors had been elected in 2020, but FdI and FI did not agree. However, the party was successful in obtaining the nomination of Alberto Stefani, regional secretary of the LV, as the coalition's joint candidate for President of Veneto. Unable to run again for the top job, Zaia announced that he would lead the party in all seven provinces. In the run-up of the election, Zaia also floated the idea of restructuring the federal party under the CDU/CSU model, with the current League and a northern regionalist party centred around the LV.\n\n\nIdeology, platform, factions, alliances\nInternationally, the League is usually described as a right-wing or far-right party. Its robust anti-immigration stance, Eurosceptic outlook, and populist rhetoric are frequently mentioned as central factors in this categorisation. However, as pointed out by Miles Johnson of the Financial Times, most Italian media endorse the party's description as centre-right. Moreover, according to Antonio Polito, columnist for the Corriere della Sera and a former centre-left politician, the League is \"at least half centrist, surely it is entirely centrist in Veneto and Lombardy, both as electorate and political culture of its governors\". Differently from Matteo Salvini, most leading members, such as ministers like Giancarlo Giorgetti and regional presidents like Luca Zaia and Massimiliano Fedriga, are frequently described as \"centrist\", \"moderate\" and pro-Europeanist, appealing to \"centrist\" voters and parties. The \"far-right\" label is rejected altogether by the party, including by Salvini himself. Of the leader's long-time three deputy secretaries, Giorgetti represented the liberal-centrist wing, Lorenzo Fontana the Catholic, traditionalist and social-conservative one, and Andrea Crippa the populist to right-wing populist one. However, fault lines are more complicate: Giorgetti is also a devout Catholic, Fontana has voiced concerns over the party's European alliances, while Crippa is outspokenly in favour of abortion and euthanasia.\nWhile continuing to support autonomism, regionalism and federalism, under Salvini the League has gradually but decidedly set aside Padanian nationalism and separatism, which were long pursued by Lega Nord. Through \"sovereigntism\", the party has also been making inroads in southern Italy. It is actually a matter of debate whether the League has embraced Italian nationalism and abandoned regionalism, or whether it combines nationalism and regionalism, similarly to the Ticino League in Switzerland. According to Daniele Albertazzi, Arianna Giovannini and Antonella Seddone, \"regionalism has been replaced by an empty form of nativist nationalism, which fails to address socio-economic issues related to the North–South divide\", while \"populism remains central to the party's strategic communication, but the EU has taken Rome's place as the people's 'enemy'\". However, locally, the regional parties forming the League continue to be supportive of regional identities, such as Venetian nationalism in Veneto and Lombard nationalism in Lombardy.\nThe League supports the implementation of article 116 of the Constitution, the so-called \"differentiated\" or \"asymmetrical\" regionalism, i.e. the attribution of \"particular forms and conditions of autonomy\" also to ordinary-statute regions (with the consequent possibility for some regions to have further powers than others, but still less than the five special-statute regions).\nThe League is formally part of the centre-right coalition, along with Forza Italia (FI) and the Brothers of Italy (FdI); however, since 2018, the party has governed both with the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). In early 2022, two leading Democrats, minister Dario Franceschini and Goffredo Bettini, hinted that the League could re-affirm a \"centrist\" position and could again form a coalition government with the PD after the next general election, respectively. Anyway, the PD's secretary Enrico Letta ruled it out.\nIn most regions the League forms coalitions with FdI and FI, with some peculiarities. In Aosta Valley it formed a short-lived left-right coalition in 2018. In South Tyrol it has teamed up with the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP) since 2018. In Trentino it is also in alliance with the similarly-regionalist Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (PATT). In Sardinia it has close ties with the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az), whose leader and former president of the region Christian Solinas was often counted among the League's governors, so that, since 2018, there has been a \"League–Salvini Premier–Sardinian Action Party\" joint parliamentary group in the Senate. Finally, in Sicily the League has formed a short-lived federation with the Movement for Autonomy. Countrywide, the party has federative pacts with the Union of the Centre and the Italian Liberal Party.\nThe party's 2022 political manifesto, penned by Alessandro Amadori and Giuseppe Valditara in 2022, was described by the Corriere della Sera as liberal-conservative. More specifically, its authors designed a \"country that should be liberal in its economy and society, wisely conservative on values, profoundly republican in its collective culture\".\nIn home affairs, the League strongly opposes illegal immigration, especially migratory flows from the sea. It is highly critical of non-governmental organisations transporting migrants to European cross-border countries, as they believe them to be complicit in \"human trafficking\". Within Italy's borders, the League is sceptical of asylum requests and related reception centers and hopes for the deportation of irregular immigrants. It has tried to regulate some of the immigration issues through the so-called \"security decrees\".\nIn foreign policy, the party is Atlanticist and pro-Israel. It has also supported friendlier ties with Russia; before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it has long also opposed sanctions. In 2019, allegations that the party accepted Russian funding were discussed in Italy and dubbed \"Russiagate\", before being completely dismissed. In September 2022, the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that the party was still \"seen as Russia-friendly\".\nUntil 2018, the League expressed a strong opposition to the Euro currency; in the 2018 general election, Eurosceptic professors Alberto Bagnai and Claudio Borghi were elected in Parliament for the party. Following President Sergio Mattarella's rejection of the appointment of Paolo Savona (who had expressed himself on a \"plan B\" for Italy's exit from the Eurozone) as minister of the Economy in Giuseppe Conte's first government, the League reviewed its opposition to the single currency.\nIn economic policy, the League has a mixed record. Lega Nord started as libertarian, under the influx of Giancarlo Pagliarini, to become more economically populist. The current party's platform includes the reduction of the tax burden and the implementation of a flat income tax at 15%, while opposing limits to cash payments. As a result, according to some sources, the party is distinctly \"neo-liberal\", while other observers have contested any such characterisation and the League would be torn between \"economic liberalism\" and \"Keynesian economics\". Giorgetti is usually considered a liberal, while Bagnai identifies as \"post-Keynesian\" and \"left-wing populist\" and factions are somewhat anti-globalist.\nOn welfare, the League is one of the major critics of the increase in the retirement age envisaged by Elsa Fornero's 2011 pension reform and during Conte's first government got the approval of the so-called \"Quota 100\" (retirement with 62 years of age and 38 of contributions). Furthermore, the party opposes the citizens' income and regrets having voted for it in 2018.\nOn social issues, the League generally holds conservative positions, with some exceptions. For instance, the party has been a long proponent of the decriminalization of sex work. Additionally, a majority of the party's regional councillors in Veneto was supportive of a bill that would have regulated assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, under particular conditions.\n\n\nPolitical communication\n\nSince 2014, the political communication and propaganda of Salvini and the League have been entrusted to an external communication company, named Sistema Intranet, owned by Luca Morisi and Andrea Paganella. This company has used a software known as \"the Beast\" which, through a series of algorithms (based on monitoring the sentiments of the network), according to many commentators, has contributed to Salvini's success on social networks. According to the various reconstructions it would be through this software that political messages, slogans, successful hashtags and scenes from Salvini's daily life would be selected. The communication strategy of the Beast was analysed in a study by the Department of Political Sciences of the University of Padua, according to which Salvini \"opened the page in 2010 ... with a strategy that is still considered effective today ... able to be in tune with the prevailing moods of a substantial part of users on the network\". Morisi's ability consists in \"positioning himself on the right and majority side of public opinion\" and being \"able to analyse in real time the orientation of comments and reactions to a post and suggesting which topics to focus on in the next post\". Morisi also invented the nickname \"the Captain\", with which Salvini is called by his supporters. In September 2021 Morisi resigned for \"personal and family problems\" and, right after, he was investigated following an accusation of cocaine transfer by two Romanian boys, a case that was archived in November. Also Paganella is no longer involved since he was elected senator in the 2022 general election.\n\n\nRegional and local government\nThe League participates in 14 out of 21 sub-national governments (Italy has 20 regions, one of which, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, is composed of two autonomous provinces with dinstict autonony and a seat each in the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces: Trentino and South Tyrol).

    "summary": "Lega (English: League), officially named Lega per Salvini Premier (English: League for Salvini Premier, LSP or LpSP), is a right-wing populist political party in Italy, led by Matteo Salvini. The LSP is the informal successor of Lega Nord (English: Northern League, LN).\nThe LSP was established in December 2017 as the sister party of the LN, active in northern Italy, and as the replacement of Us with Salvini (NcS), LN's previous affiliate in central and southern Italy. The new party aimed at offering LN's values and policies to the rest of the country. Some political commentators described the LSP as a parallel party of the LN, with the aim of politically replacing it, also because of its statutory debt of €49 million. Indeed, since January 2020, the LN has become mostly inactive and has been practically supplanted by the LSP, which is active all around Italy. The LSP came third in the 2018 general election and first in the 2019 European Parliament election. Like the LN, the LSP is a confederation of regional parties, of which the largest and long-running are Liga Veneta and Lega Lombarda, established in 1980 and 1984, respectively. Despite misgivings within the party's Padanian nationalist faction, the political base of the LSP is in northern Italy, where the party gets most of its support and where it has maintained the traditional autonomist outlook of the LN, especially in Veneto and Lombardy.\nIn February 2021, the League joined Mario Draghi's government of national unity. After a disappointing result in the 2022 general election, the party joined Giorgia Meloni's government with five ministers, including Giancarlo Giorgetti as minister of Economy and Finance and Salvini as deputy prime minister and minister of Infrastructure and Transport. The League also participates in 15 regional governments, including those of the two autonomous provinces. Five regional presidents, including Attilio Fontana (Lombardy), Luca Zaia (Veneto) and Massimiliano Fedriga (Friuli-Venezia Giulia), are party members. Fedriga is also the president of the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces.",

She has cerebral palsy, placing her in the S6 classification.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJohnson was born in Newport on 3 December 1985. She has cerebral palsy, and, at the age of three, was encouraged by her mother to join a group for disabled swimmers to strengthen and relax her muscles.  She came to love the sport, competing as an S6 swimmer, and was selected to swim for Team GB at the age of 14. Johnson attended Swansea University and in 2008, completed a degree in business management and finance. She currently lives in Bath, Somerset, and trains with the University of Bath training group, Team Bath.\nWhile Johnson was on the aeroplane to the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, her mother died after a long battle with cervical cancer.  She decided to continue with the Games when she was told that the funeral could be held when she returned home.\nJohnson spends one day a week studying accountancy, and is considering a career in that field when she retires from competitive swimming.\nShe has been in a relationship with Brazilian para-swimmer Phelipe Rodrigues since 2011.\nIn July 2016, Johnson appeared in the eleventh series of Celebrity Masterchef on BBC One.\nShe is an athlete mentor for the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nSwimming\nJohnson is significant within the British Para Swimming Team; specialising in breaststroke, she is one of a select few to have won gold medals in the Paralympics, World Championships, and European Championships.\nAt the 2006 IPC Swimming World Championships in Durban, South Africa, Johnson won an individual gold medal in the 100 metre breaststroke, and two relay golds. She repeated her breaststroke success at the 2009 event, breaking the world record in the process, and also picked up two individual medley bronze medals. She won gold in the 100 metre breaststroke at the 2008 Summer Paralympics, eleven days after the death of her mother, dedicating the victory to her memory.\nJohnson's successes were recognised when, in April 2011, she was given the honour of laying the final tile in the competition pool at the London Aquatics Centre. She was also selected as the Paralympic Oath taker for the 2012 Paralympic Games.\nJohnson added to her Paralympic medal collection at London 2012 Paralympics, as she set a new Paralympic record en route. Johnson recorded a season's best time of 1:40.90, to take the bronze medal in the SB6 100 m backstroke. In the buildup towards her fourth Paralympics at Rio, Johnson underwent an operation for a hernia. While recovering, she found herself falling behind in her training, which impacted on her preparation for the 2016 Paralympic trials. Her failure to make the trials resulted in her decision to retire from competitive swimming.\n\n\nEntrepreneurship\nIn August 2018, Johnson announced starting \"The Ability People\" an organization that is aimed at recruiting disabled people beside the able-bodied people without discrimination. In 2018, she was listed as one of the BBC's 100 Women.\n\n\nTV Career\nJohnson was a Channel 4 pundit during Rio Paralympics Games in 2016. \nIn 2024, she was appointed as executive producer by Whisper TV to cover the 2024 Paris Paralympic Games.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nElizabeth Johnson at the International Paralympic Committee\nLiz Johnson at the International Paralympic Committee\nLiz Johnson on Twitter",

    "text": "Cupeta or copeta (originating from Arabic qubbayt, literally meaning 'preserved sweet') is a dessert made from honey, dissolved sugar and diced almonds.\nCupeta is usually consumed during the Christmas period in the Calabria, Campania, Apulia and Sicily regions of Italy, as well as in Ponente Ligure, where on the other hand it is prepared all-year-long.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nSeveral sources (including official Italian ministerial ones) state that the name comes from the Latin word cupedia; however, this is an incorrect etymological attribution made by Matteo Camera in 1838. The similar Latin terms cupedia and copadia respectively mean 'sweat treats' and 'meat pieces'.\nSome sources hold the view that the name cupeta, on the other hand, comes from the Arabic word qubbayt, literally meaning 'sweet preserve', and was documented for the first time in a document from Palermo of 1287, where a cubaydario cited (a producer of cubaita, a dessert made of apples, almonds, toasted chickpeas and sesami seeds).\nThe name is then mentioned by Giambattista Basile (Naples, 600s) twice; in the Lo cunto de li cunti overo lo trattamento de peccerille and in the Le cinco figlie, as well as by Giulio Cesare Cortese in the Micco Passaro nnammorato.\n\n\nHistory\nThe word cupeta is of Latin or Arabic origins.

He grew up and studied in Najaf, under his father, as well as other notable scholars of the religious seminary of Najaf.\nHe was a long time opponent of the rule of Saddam Hussein. By 1992, he had moved to London where he opposed Saddam's rule for many years. He was an active member of London's Shi'a community and was the head of AhlulBayt Centre in South London. In November 1992, at the Salahuddin gathering, within the safety of the southern air exclusion zone, along with Masoud Barzani and Colonel Hassan al-Naqib, he was one of the three men to be appointed to the presidential council by the Iraqi National Congress. Mohammad Bahr al-Uloom continued to live in London prior to the 2003 Iraq invasion.\nAfter the United States deposed Saddam Hussein in 2003, as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Bahr al-Uloom was appointed to the Iraq interim governing council. He agreed to participate in the interim government and was appointed to the nine-member rotating presidency. He was the first president of the council, in an interim capacity, serving in that position from 13 July 2003 until 1 August 2003.\nIn August 2003, Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, a friend of Bahr al-Uloom, was killed in a car bombing. Shortly after, Bahr al-Uloom announced his voluntary suspension from the council, citing the failure of the council's ability to maintain law and order in post-war Iraq. He later returned to the council, and became president again on 1 March 2004, serving until 1 April 2004.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBahr al-Uloom was married to the great-granddaughter of Mirza Shirazi. They had four daughters and three sons. His son, Ibrahim, was the Oil Minister of Iraq from September 2003 to June 2004, and again during 2005.

    "text": "Dance of the Tiger (Swedish: Den Svarta Tigern) is a novel by Finnish palaeontologist Björn Kurtén, published in 1978 and English translation in 1980. It is a prehistoric novel dealing with the interaction between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. A sequel, Singletusk, published in 1982, continues the story of the family. \n\n\nPlot\nSet 35,000 years ago in Scandinavia, during a thaw in the great Ice Age, the novel follows a Cro-Magnon named Tiger as he tries to defeat Shelk, a tyrant and a hybrid (Neanderthal/Cro-Magnon), the man who killed his father.  With his family and much of his tribe dead, Tiger meets, interacts, and allies himself with groups of Neanderthals.  He eventually marries a Neanderthal woman.\n\n\nDepictions\nNeanderthals are depicted as white-skinned, while Cro-Magnons are dark. Kurtén's skin color identification for both populations appears to agree with recent DNA studies, including those proposing the African origin of modern humans. His racial presentation of the Cro-Magnon is in contrast to Jean M. Auel's view in her Earth's Children series. Auel's initial book, published a few years later than Dance of the Tiger, portrayed Neanderthals as light-skinned and Cro-Magnons as more racially varied, either light or dark-skinned. The author himself says \"The book is not intended to be a 'theory about interaction between Neanderthals and Modern Humans', it is just a fictive description of one possible scenario among several that might have taken place\".\nCro-Magnon children and adults are portrayed as having smooth brows and small faces; the characteristic features of childhood act as \"innate releasing mechanisms\" for feelings of affection.\n\nTo the Whites, the Blacks were godlike, tall and eloquent, with a speech as varied and flexible as that of the birds. And there was something else. No White could look at the clear brow of a Black without feeling a mysterious tenderness, such as a child might evoke in the heart of his parents.\n— Kurtén, p. 33, 5th printing, paperback\nKurtén postulates that this attraction led to intermarriage between the two people, which produced sterile offspring.  He emphasizes the possibility of Neanderthal extinction through inter-breeding rather than through violence.  He also presents social differences between the two groups, presenting the Cro-Magnon people as more aggressive, practicing slavery and choosing violence to solve social problems. The Neanderthal society, based on a matriarchal system, is drawn as peace-loving with elaborate social rituals designed to resolve problems.\n\n\nReception\nThe novel is known for its plausibility and accuracy.  Kurtén's supposition that Neanderthals and ancestors of modern Homo sapiens occupied same areas in the same time in Europe has been confirmed by fossil evidence.\n\nKurtén has managed to insinuate into his story—in a way so subtle and natural that we can scarcely recognize he is teaching as well as novelizing—every fact and theory that I know (and several, undoubtedly, that I don't) about Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons, human evolution during the Ice Age, glacial geology, and ecology and behavior of the great Ice Age mammals, including mammoths and saber-toothed tigers.\n— Stephen Jay Gould, introduction to Dance of the Tiger, 1980.\nKurtén was not the first novelist to examine the subject; for instance, author William Golding also examined the issue of Neanderthal extinction in The Inheritors.\n\n\nRelease details\nOriginally published as Den Svarta Tigern, ALBA Publishing, Stockholm, Sweden, 1978.\nEnglish translation copyright, 1980, Björn Kurtén.\nEnglish translation, Random House, New York, 1980.\nPantheon Books paperback editions, initially published September 1980, Fifth printing October 1983.

    "text": "Fritz Hartung (12 January 1883 – 24 November 1967) was a political and constitutional historian of Germany.\n\n\nLife\nFritz Hartung was born in Saarmund, a short distance to the west of Potsdam.   His father worked in the Prussian government service.   However, he attended secondary school far to the west in Freiburg (1892–1900), and then in Berlin (1900–1901) where he passed his school final exams (Abitur).   He went on to study history at Heidelberg and Berlin, with a particular focus on constitutional and legal history.   He was taught by a number of the leading historians of the time including Gustav Schmoller, Heinrich Brunner and Otto Hintze.   It was Hintze who supervised him at Berlin for his doctorate, received in 1905, for a dissertation on Hardenburg and the Prussian administration of Ansbach-Bayreuth between 1792 and 1806.   After receiving his doctorate Hartung obtained a post as a research assistant at the Centre for Franconian History, based in Würzburg.   During this period he was encouraged by the historian Richard Fester to focus on the history of the so-called Franconian Circle, and his work on this theme, supervised by Fester, provided the basis for his habilitation, awarded in 1910.   Fester was associated with various universities through the years, but in 1908 he had become a full professor at Halle, and it was from Halle that Hartung received this higher degree for a work adapted and published shortly afterwards as \"The History of the Franconian Circle 1521–1559\".   In 1914 his book on constitutional history during the previous 4 centuries appeared.  It became a much revisited core textbook:  the seventh edition was published, posthumously, in 1969, and it enabled Hartung to be identified as one of the most important and influential German constitutional historians of the twentieth century.\nIn 1915 Hartung was conscripted into an infantry regiment to serve as a soldier in the war which had started the previous year, but the next year he was released from military service on grounds of illness.   In 1917 he joined the Free Conservative Party (Freikonservative Partei / FKP), a small traditionalist splinter party, liberal in matters of trade and industry, and in favour of a British-style imperial policy, but with an agenda that no longer made much sense in the post-imperial revolutionary period that followed the end of the war:  the FKP dissolved itself at the end of 1918.\nThroughout this time, starting in 1915, and on until 1922, Hartung was listed as a visiting professor at Halle.  In 1922 he switched to Kiel, gaining a full professorship in early modern and modern history.   However, just one year later he switched again, this time to Berlin where he took a professorship in modern history, economic history and constitutional history, taking over the teaching chair hitherto occupied by his old tutor, Otto Hintze.  He was still at Berlin more than twenty years later when, finding itself now in the Soviet occupation zone, the Frederick William University was renamed, identified as the Humboldt University of Berlin.   He served as university dean in 1945/46, and retired from the Berlin professorship in 1949.\nFollowing the success of his pre-war constitutional history, 1920 saw the appearance of Hartung's book on modern German history between 1871 and 1919, which again became a standard work and was regularly revised, updated and reprinted till the 1960s.   During the 1920s and 1930s further works on German history followed.\nRégime change in 1933 was followed by a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship in Germany,   Hartung was not one of those to oppose the abolition of parliamentary democracy, and there is no sign that in 1933 he foresaw Germany's future political direction of travel.  He was one of many mainstream academics and professors who adapted themselves to the new political context without in any way becoming a cheer-leader for the toxic Nazi ideology.   In 1937 Hartung may have been one of those conservative historians who agreed to join the party, possibly when he became an advisor to Walter Frank's Nazi Historical Institute (\"Reichsinstitut für Geschichte des neuen Deutschlands\").   He produced a couple of books covering topics over which the Nazis obsessed: \"Volk\" (\"Volk und Staat in der deutschen Geschichte\", 1940) and \"Reich\" (\"Das Reich und Europa\", 1941).   Between 1941 and 1943 he also published three written volumes from the academic papers left by Otto Hintze, who had died in 1940.\nWar ended in May 1945 with what remained of Germany divided into military zones of occupation.   The Humboldt University where Hartung continued to work found itself in the eastern part of Berlin, administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone.   Hartung himself tried hard to avoid choosing between the two versions of Germany emerging during the late 1940s, but after 1949, when the military occupation zones gave way to two newly created German states, sponsored respectively by the United States and the Soviet Union, it became harder to believe that the division of the two version of Germany was a temporary phenomenon, and during the 1950s the political divisions were increasingly matched by physical divisions: it became ever more difficult for Berliners to move between the two \"halves\" of the city.  In 1948 Hartung \"chose\" to live in West Berlin, a decision that drew comment, both adulatory and critical, from fellow historians.  He was urged to transfer his academic base to the newly founded Free University of Berlin by Friedrich Meinecke among others, but did not do so.   He resigned from his functions at the German Academy of Sciences (in East Berlin) only in 1953, and remained a member of the academy till 1967.   Meanwhile, having by the end of his life lived and worked under five completely different political regimes in successive versions of Germany, he reacted to the apparent return of democracy in West Germany with what one commentator later interpreted as \"cautious optimism\".\n\n\nReferences",

Located next to Sligo's tourist office, it was the first purpose-built theatre in rural Ireland.\n\n\nHistory\nWhen the theatre opened on 12 January 1982, it was the first purpose-built theatre in 'rural Ireland'. The then president of Ireland, Patrick Hillery, attended the opening. It was named after W. B. Yeats play At the Hawk's Well, and was a result of an initiative of the Arts Council and Bord Fáilte.\nIn 2002, it was the subject of an RTÉ television documentary on the \"Townlands\" series.\nIn a 2019 article in The Irish World, the theatre was described as \"binding people together, bridging perceived boundaries and manifesting the spirit of enterprise which are intended to build a bright future for the local economy\".\nAs it approached its 40 year anniversary, the 340 seats in the theatre were scheduled to be replaced in August 2020.\n\n\nProgrammes\nSince 1966, the theatre has hosted the Yeats Summer School, named after the Irish poet and dramatist W. B. Yeats, who is associated with the region. The Sligo Fun Company is based at the theatre and organises theatrical productions and programmes for school-aged children.\n\n\nNotable people\nBy 1993, the Hawk's Well theatre had developed some of Ireland's \"premier actors\". Other performers, associated with the theatre, include Westlife members and Sligo natives Shane Filan, Kian Egan and Mark Feehily. The performers had featured in the Sligo Fun Company's production of Grease while in secondary school. They then formed a six-member boyband with three other friends and played four nights at the theatre before Filan's mother contacted Louis Walsh, eventually leading to the formation of Westlife.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources",

Morningside is an old streetcar suburb adjacent to Minneapolis' Linden Hills neighborhood.\nMorningside, which is located along the old Como-Harriet Streetcar Line, grew faster than Edina, which was mostly rural. Morningside residents voted in 1920 to secede from Edina and form their own village in order to provide amenities more suited to a professional streetcar suburb.\nMorningside's residential landscape reflects several important broad themes in the pattern of suburban development in the Twin Cities area: the relatively high population density per square mile within the platted subdivisions, the architectural similarity of the houses, and reliance on mass transit. Morningside developers built several hundred new single–family homes, including many bungalows, on standard-sized suburban lots along straight-line streets between about 1905 and 1936, replacing land previously occupied by farm fields and orchards.\n\nThe children of Jonathan Grimes, who inherited the Grimes farm and apple orchard in the village's northeast corner, platted the Morningside neighborhood for residential development in 1905. Grimes Avenue cuts through the neighborhood in a north-south direction. The Jonathan Taylor Grimes House on West 44th Street was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\nGeorge Weber was a well-known figure in the village early on. In 1929, the mayor of Morningside asked Weber, the school janitor, to be the village marshal. He initially turned down the job, but the council voted him in anyway. Weber remained in charge of Morningside for the next 27 years. With the retirement of Weber in 1956, the Village Police began providing police protection to Morningside. It wasn't until 1960 that the first black family moved into the Morningside neighborhood, where they were met with an anti-immigrant campaign. The family was supported by a fairness petition signed by 251 Morningside residents, representing a majority of the community.\nMorningside's police station was located at 4400 Branson Street and was run by Weber's wife. His responsibilities also included water meter reading and census taking. On the first and third Monday evenings of each month, court was held in the Edina Grange Hall. Weber is commemorated by a park in the Morningside neighborhood.\nMorningside remained a separate village for 46 years, until 1966, when it was reincorporated into the larger City of Edina in response to state pressure. Citizens of Morningside voted to rejoin Edina, owing in part to the impracticality of building a sewage infrastructure for such a small municipality. Morningside's previous autonomy is still visible in the 55416 Zip Code that it shares with neighboring Minneapolis and St. Louis Park, as well as in the water system, which is linked to the City of Minneapolis water department..\nMorningside retains a distinct personality from the rest of Edina, and its name is still found in community organizations, roads, and businesses. The Morningside Babysitting Cooperative has been around for nearly a century and still keeps track of its members' shared hours of child care. The Morningside Woman's Club, formerly known as the Morningside Literary Club, was founded in 1937. Morningside has an active Neighborhood Association that provides a voice at City Hall to represent the neighborhood. A Morningside men's group, the Morningside Athletic Club (MAC), meets every Saturday morning at Weber Park for sports activity, such as soccer, football and ice boot hockey.\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\nReferences\n\nRetrieved 17 September 2005 article on Morningside Neighborhood\nMorningside Village, 1905-1966, Special Collections, Hennepin Country Library\nEdina Historical Society, Morningside History Page\n\"Historic bungalows of the Morningside neighborhood: A multiple property study\"",

    "text": "Manos Arriba (English: Hands Up) is an extended play (EP) by American singer Rosanna Tavarez released by her own record label Patacon Productions in March 2008. Tavarez adopted the stage name Chana while pursuing a music career in Latin alternative music and used it for the EP. Chana rose to prominence in 2001 as a member of the girl group Eden's Crush. Following their disbandment, she worked as a host on music television shows and decided to record Spanish-language music after meeting producer Marthin Chan. She had previously rejected working with Latin music producers because she did not want to pursue a career in conventional Latin pop.  \nA pop EP, Manos Arriba includes influences from other genres such as reggae, ska, power pop, and disco. The lyrics were based on Chana's past relationships and break-ups. She wrote and produced all five songs with Chan, and recorded them in Los Angeles, including at his personal recording studio, over roughly two years. Chana was inspired by studying Afro-Dominican dance and music. Music journalists believed the EP was not directly rooted in specifically Latin genres or topics and contrasted the style with her work with Eden's Crush.  \nReviews were generally positive from critics, who praised the EP's production. Manos Arriba had two singles: \"No Me Mandes Flores\" and \"La Duda\". For the beginning of March 2008, \"No Me Mandes Flores\" was the third most downloaded song on iTunes Latino, and \"La Duda\", along with the rest of Manos Arriba, were promoted by the iTunes Store's Latin music section. Chana released a music video for the track \"Icaro\", which reviewers described as inspired by her modern dance training. She promoted the EP through live performances in nightclubs across the United States, on Spanish-language networks, and at industry showcases.  \n\n\nBackground\nRosanna Tavarez developed an early interest in music, initially being inspired by the musical Annie. She moved from New York City to Miami at age nine and attended the New World School of the Arts. Tavarez studied dance as an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan and choreography at Ohio State University's graduate program. After trying to join a New York dance company, she returned to Miami where she was approached by Latin music producers who thought her appearance would make her an ideal Latin pop singer. Tavarez rejected their offers because she felt unprepared for a music career. At the time, she had only performed in karaoke and did not have any vocal training. In a 2008 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Tavarez recalled she did not want to be \"just another girl doing Latin-y pop\", instead preferring to develop \"something distinctive, even if the crowd would be more niche\".\nIn 2001, the WB Television Network (the WB) aired an American version of the reality television franchise Popstars, and its first season focused on creating a girl group. After seeing an ad in the Miami New Times, Tavarez participated in the series, and along with four other finalists, became a member of the group Eden's Crush. The same year, they signed a record deal with London-Sire Records, which released their debut studio album Popstars and its lead single \"Get Over Yourself\". The album peaked at number six on the US Billboard 200 chart and the single reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. \nEden's Crush disbanded after London-Sire Records closed in 2001. In 2008, Tavarez told the Houston Chronicle that Eden's Crush was not representative of her style or musical preferences. After Eden's Crush ended, Tavarez worked as a host for programs such as the music television series On Air with Ryan Seacrest and the second season of Jammin'. She credited her work on the TV Guide Channel with giving her the time and money to experiment with music and dance.\n\n\nRecording\nTavarez moved to Los Angeles because of her husband Andres Baez's work with Univision, and she was introduced to musician Marthin Chan in 2005 through his mutual friends with Baez. Chan was known as a songwriter and guitarist for the rock band Volumen Cero, and he was putting together the group Popvert with MTV executive Jose Tillan. While auditioning singers for Popvert, he met Tavarez and they bonded over having grown up in New York City in the 1980s and their musical interests, specifically in the bands Depeche Mode, the Cure, and Velocity Girl. As Tavarez focused on Latin alternative music, she adopted the stage name Chana, a childhood nickname and a shortening of her first name Rosanna.\nChana recorded music with Chan for over two years, at his recording studio in Echo Park, as well as at Sonora Recorders in Los Angeles. While recording, Chan produced the instrumental and Chana wrote melodies and lyrics to the track, although they helped one another if they struggled to find a certain sound or word. In a 2008 Houston Chronicle interview, Chana said Chan was an integral part of the recording process, likening him to Timbaland and his collaborations with Justin Timberlake. She based lyrics on past relationships and break-ups, and said recording these songs was difficult. Although she found writing in Spanish to be more challenging, Chana thought the language was more poetic than English and that she could write better lyrics that way; she often consulted an English–Spanish dictionary to translate her ideas.\nChana and Chan recorded eighteen songs, out of which five were chosen for the extended play (EP) Manos Arriba. They initially created these songs to secure a recording contract, but later decided to release an EP as independent musicians. Chana believed this decision had allowed her to maintain creative control over her music and image, but said creating music without support from a record label was more challenging because it took more time. She was the creative director for the EP, and Steve Joseph handled the art direction and design.\nChan programmed the music on Manos Arriba and played the guitar and synthesizers. Additional instruments were played by Louis Tamblay and Eric J (bass guitar), Darrius Minnaee (drums), Stewart Cole (trumpet), Dan Osterman (trombone), and Fran Iturbe (guitar). Eric J mixed four of the EP's tracks at Sonora Recorders, with the assistance of Chris Constable and Richard Barron, while \"Icaro\" was done by Orlando \"Don\" Vitto at the Warehouse Recording Studios in Miami. All of the songs were mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.\n\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\n\nSound\nChana described Manos Arriba as \"trop-electro-hip-pop\"; while studying Afro-Dominican dance and music in the Dominican Republic, she was inspired by how musicians combined elements of their folklore with electronic music. When the New York Daily News's Carolina González viewed the EP as pop with diverse influences, Chana explained: \"The definition of pop has become looser, more inclusive. When you talk about pop, you're basically talking about a hook, a melody that catches your attention.\" Chana sought to keep the music accessible while also artistic, but emphasized she never tried to be as experimental as Björk. In a 2008 Billboard interview, she said she did not focus on commercial appeal while recording the EP, such as attempting to go platinum or get radio airplay. \nIn LA Weekly, Falling James wrote that although Chana performs \"sunny melodies\" throughout Manos Arriba, the songs have \"a harder, funkier and more readily danceable ska backing\". Other critics pointed out the use of wind instruments and video game noises in its production. Some music journalists found the EP to be disconnected from Latin music. González wrote that although Chana sings in Spanish, none of the lyrics are specifically about Latin topics; she likened the productions to reggae, power pop, and disco and felt certain songs had a \"retro-futurist disco feel\". Billboard's Ayala Ben-Yehuda said the EP does not conform to conventional Spanish-language genres. and Sergio Burstein of the Houston Chronicle did not hear any influences of merengue and salsa music, genres that Chana listened to as a child. While discussing Tavarez's music as Chana, critics contrasted it with Eden's Crush, including a Latina writer who said that she \"imploded her girl-group roots\". Jordan Levin for PopMatters felt her \"hip indie Latina persona\" for Manos Arriba was more authentic than her image as \"a prefab pop figurine\" in Eden's Crush.\n\n\nSongs\nThe Los Angeles Times's Agustin Gurza characterized Manos Arriba as \"songs of personal passion delivered with cool detachment\". The EP opens with \"No Me Mandes Flores\" (\"Don't Send Me Flowers\"), which Gurza referenced as a \"cold kiss-off to a stubborn ex-lover\". In the Los Angeles Times, Tommy Calle wrote that the title was reminiscent of two 2006 singles—Fanny Lu's \"No Te Pido Flores\" (\"I'm Not Asking You For Flowers\") and Fonseca's \"Te Mando Flores\" (\"I Send You Flowers\"). The second song \"A Veces\" (\"At Times\") is about jealousy and a man who does not pay attention to his girlfriend. The track has tropical influences and uses what Levin called \"old-school salsa horns\". Burstein compared the production to big band music, and James wrote that Chana's vocals on the song, as well as on \"La Duda\" (\"The Doubt\"), were similar to Julieta Venegas, specifically her \"airy pop\".\nBen-Yehuda referred to the third track \"La Duda\" as a \"flirtatious challenge to a guy giving mixed signals\" built on an instrumental featuring synths. Cory Bohon for Engadget said that the song had a dance-inspired opening before transitioning to \"an electronic-tinged alt-pop tune with searing guitars and disco bass-lines\". For the following track \"Icaro\" (\"Icarus\"), Chana provides her own perspective on the Greek myth; rather than criticizing Icarus for his hubris, the lyrics praise his desire to follow his passions despite the risks. Chana identified with Icarus, explaining: \"I would rather take the risk and fall on my butt. It's about that part of you that says just do it.\" Burstein compared Chana's vocals on \"Icaro\" to Andrea Echeverri. The EP closes with \"The Whistler\", a song that mocks the practice of catcalling; Levin and Gurza interpreted the track as a humorous take on the activity. Rapper Malverde adds guest vocals to \"The Whistler\" in which he assumes the role of a cat-caller. The instrumental includes what James described as \"bouncing dub echoes\".\n\n\nRelease and promotion\n\n\nRelease and singles\nManos Arriba was released in March 2008 by Chana's own record label Patacon Productions as an audio CD and a digital EP. Chana held a release party in Los Angeles, which she described as \"this crazy multimedia thing\" featuring a local promoter and disc jockey as well as dancers. Following the release of Manos Arriba, Chana discussed wanting to release a full album, which would include songs from the EP, and in a 2010 interview, she said she was working on it with Thom Russo. She talked about expanding her sound to add a \"more layered\" production and sound, explaining: \"We have better resources now, so I’m just excited to see what happens.\" According to a 2021 Billboard article, Tavarez has transitioned from music to a career in dance; she said in a separate interview that after turning 32, she decided to complete her Master of Fine Arts degree in choreography and fully focus on being a dancer.\nThe iTunes Store featured Manos Arriba as the \"Best of the Week\" on iTunes Latino, the store's Latin music section. Two singles – \"No Me Mandes Flores\" and \"La Duda\" – were released from the EP. \"No Me Mandes Flores\"' was the third most downloaded song in iTunes Latino for the beginning of March 2008. \"La Duda\" was selected as a free download for iTunes Latino's Single of the Week, which Cory Boson described as a way to broaden exposure to up-and-coming artists.\nChana promoted \"Icaro\" with a music video, in which she performs what Jordan Levin calls \"full body twists and falls of modern dance\". Levin thought Chana drew upon her experiences at the New World School of the Arts and the dance program at Ohio University. Carolina González wrote that Chana \"vindicates\" Icarus with her choreography; González viewed her performance as indicative of her past dancing training in a magnet school and as part of the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Company.\n\n\nLive performances\nChana promoted Manos Arriba through live performances at nightclubs across the United States. According to Agustin Gurza, Chana and Chan focused on the \"local party circuit\" as well as a \"hip series of happenings\" done by the promoters Turn Off the Radio, Hang the Deejays, Remezcla, and Automatico. For these performances, they used a band made up of local musicians; Chana said that she hired members of the ska band Upground to help make the songs sound fuller and more alive. When discussing her eclectic performances with González, Chana said: \"It’s how someone defined rock n' roll to me once. You rock, you get in a van, and then you roll.\" She said Los Angeles was a major part of her promotion because of its large Latino population and the amount of opportunities available for up-and-coming Latin artists. In addition to her U.S. performances, Chana did a show at the Hard Rock Cafe in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.\nChana performed songs from the EP on Spanish-language networks, like mun2 and Telemundo, and at industry showcases. Her first showcase was in the fall of 2007 in Hollywood; other events included the Latin Alternative Music Conference, the Los Angeles' Sunset Junction festival, and the Billboard Latin Music Conference, where she performed alongside Aleks Syntek. Chana was a performer at the 2006 Latin Billboard Music Awards, and an opening act for Latin rock band Locos por Juana. Reviews for Chana's performances were positive. Ayala Ben-Yehuda praised her ability to \"take audiences along for the ride with a convincing swagger and a dose of self-deprecating humor\". Levin and González wrote that the EP and live performances helped with building buzz for Chana.\n\n\nCritical reception\nManos Arriba was generally well received by critics, such as a Latina writer who considered it some of \"the best Latin music you don't know\". Ayala Ben-Yehuda commended the songs for having strong hooks and themes that are easily accessible to a large audience. Jordan Levin and Falling James highlighted Chana's personality in their reviews. Levin attributed the EP's success to her \"faith in her instincts, disregard for convention, and impish sense of fun\". James wrote that her dance and art school were apparent through the tracks, and appreciated her refusal to \"dumb down\" her music.\nThe EP's production was the subject of praise. James appreciated the music's levity, writing: \"Who says music has to be full of doom and gloom all the time?\" Describing Manos Arriba as representative of the Echo Park music scene, Agustin Gurza characterized the compositions as \"infectious fusion of Caribbean rhythms, cool electronic vibes and sharp, satirical lyrics\". Levin referred to the EP as \"infectious [and] genre-straddling\", and People en Español's Laura Kusnyer and a writer for Univision thought the uptempo songs inspired people to dance.  In the Los Angeles Times, Reed Johnson praised as a \"hot house hybrid\", and looked forward to a full album by Chana and Chan.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks were written and produced by Chana and Marthin Chan.\n\n\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of Manos Arriba:\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nExternal links\nManos Arriba at Discogs",

    "text": "Club Esportiu Manacor is a Spanish football team based in Manacor, Mallorca, Balearic Islands. Founded in 1923, its first team plays in the Tercera Federación – Group 11, the fifth tier of Spanish football. Moreover, Manacor's first women's team is active in the Femenina Autonòmica, and the club has around a dozen of teams in its youth academy. The club's ground is the Estadi de Na Capellera, located in the same city, holding 4,000 spectators.\nThe highest category in which Manacor has played is the extinct Segunda División B, doing so during five seasons divided over the 20th century. Moreover, the club has participated in around 60 editions of the Tercera División/Tercera Federación.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nName evolution\nFutbol Club Manacor (1923-1934)\nClub Deportivo Nacional de Manacor (1934-1935)\nRacing Club de Manacor (1935-1937)\nClub Deportivo Manacor (1937-present)\n\n\nBeginnings of football in Manacor\nIn 1908, football arrived to Manacor for the first time with the creation of Foot-Ballista Club Manacor, related to the local agricultural syndicate. Later, a new club was founded after splitting from the first club: Foot-Ballista Club Alfonso XII, but both clubs disappeared one year later. The members and players of both teams created Club Manacor de Foot-Ball in 1909, a club that would be active for a decade, but also ended up disappearing.\n\n\nFoundation of CE Manacor (1923)\nOn 23 June 2023 in the Teatre Principal in Manacor, a new club was founded: Futbol Club Manacor, which became the new representative club of the homonymous city and registered at the Catalan Football Federation. Quickly, Manacor would turn into one of the referents of football in the Part Forana (the parts of Mallorca outside of Palma), together with CE Constància from Inca.\n\n\n1920s. Runners-up in the Primera Categoria and a new stadium\nIn the 1924-25 season, Manacor debuted in the Primera Categoria of the regional Campionat de Mallorca de futbol after one season of absence due to the lack of a stadium that complied with the competition rules. One season later, the club obtained the second place after the excision of many teams from the competition. The 1925-26 final was played against RS Alfons XIII FC (currently RCD Mallorca) in Felanitx and was won by the Palma team. It would be the only second place that Manacor would achieve in this competition.\nDuring the second celebration of Easter in 1925, the Estadi de Na Capellera was inaugurated with a friendly against RS Alfonso XIII FC. Interestingly, Manacor played with a blue-red shirt during its first years, imitating FC Barcelona, a team that had many followers on the island.\n\n\n1930s. Crisis, refoundations and war\nAround 1930, Manacor started to suffer severe financial problems, leading to the club being relegated, the stadium being sold in August 1934, and the entity disappearing a few days later. That same year, Club Deportivo Nacional de Manacor was founded, formed by ex-players of the recently disappeared club. The new club changed its colours, which became red and white vertical stripes and black socks (which turned blue in the 1970s), while they maintained the stadium of the previous club. In the beginning of 1935, Nacional changed its name to Racing Club de Manacor.\nInitially, it seemed like Racing would be able to return to the heights that FC Manacor had reached before, but the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War caused the temporary complete paralysation of the club's activities. In the beginnings of 1937, Francoist directors took over the club and refounded it as Club Deportivo Manacor, incorporating the base of players of Racing.\n\n\n1940s. Promotion to the Tercera División\nAfter one season in the Segunda Regional, Manacor achieved promotion to the Primera Regional in 1940-41. The club maintained that category with ease and was finished first on three occasions: 1944-45, 1945-46, and 1948-49, achieving promotion to the Tercera División after the third championship.\n\n\n1950s. Consolidation and almost another promotion\nWith the promotion to the Tercera División, Manacor left the regional competitions behind for a long time and started to play against Catalan and Valencian teams. The fourth place, obtained in the debut season, placed Manacor above renowned Mallorcan teams like CE Atlètic Balears or CE Constància, becoming the temporary second-strongest team on the island (behind CD Mallorca, active in the Segunda División).\nDuring the rest of the 1950s, Manacor usually finished in a high position, even being close to winning the competition during some seasons. The best season of the decade was 1959-60, in which Manacor won the league after an agonic season finale. Manacor played the play-off final for promotion to the Segunda División against Hércules CF and lost 2–0. The club would not be that close to promotion to the second tier again.\n\n\nChampionship of the Copa Uruguay (1958)\nParallel to the Tercera División, Manacor participated in the Copa Uruguay, an important Mallorcan tournament during the 1950s and 1960s. The club won the 1957-58 edition after surviving the group phase, eliminating CE Atlètic Balears in the semi-final (2-2, 1-1, and 6-2), and beating CE Alaró in the final (4-1).\n\n\n1960s and 1970s. Many promotions and relegations\nDuring the 1960s, Manacor only played in the Tercera División, but without participating in the promotion playoffs. In 1970, the club got relegated to the Primera Regional, a competition that would turn into the Regional Preferente two years later. The 1970s are characterised by the many promotions and relegations of Manacor. Successively, the club was relegated (1970), promoted (1973), relegated (1974), promoted (1978), relegated (1979), and finally promoted (1980). The 1979-80 season would be Manacor's last one in the regional categories during the 20th century.\n\n\n1980s and 1990s. The glory era\nDuring the 1980s, Manacor aimed for promotion to the newly created Segunda División B for the first time. In the 1983-84 season, Manacor achieved promotion to the Segunda B despite not being crowned champion. The next season would, in a way, be the most successful season in the club's history, given that Manacor stayed up in the new third division, the only time it would achieve that goal. In 1985-86, however, the club was relegated to the Tercera División.\nDuring the 1990s, Manacor won two championships of the Tercera División: in 1989-90 and in 1992-93. Both titles had similar outcomes: the club achieved direct promotion to the Segunda División B, but also returned to the Tercera División one year later. During these years, Manacor lived its glory era, used to fill the Estadi de Na Capellera, and was considered one of the strongest teams of the Part Forana.\n\n\n2000s and 2010s. Many more seasons in the Tercera División\nIn the 21st century, Manacor confirmed its profile as a 'classic' team in the Tercera División, accumulating 16 seasons more during the first two decades. During the first years of the century, it seemed like the club could return to the Segunda División B, but was eliminated from the promotion playoffs every time it participated and dropped down to the Regional Preferente in 2009.\nEven though the relegation had a profound impact on the club, it also led to the start of a new dynamic. With a strong team, Manacor was crowned champions twice and, subsequently, achieved two promotions, one to the Tercera División (2010) and one to the Segunda División B (2011). However, the club failed to stay up and returned to the Tercera División after one season. Between 2015 and 2017, Manacor competed in the Regional Preferente, playing all other seasons of the 2010s in the Tercera.\n\n\n2020s. Playoffs and the Copa del Rey\nIn the 2020-21 season, affected severely by the COVID-19 pandemic, Manacor aimed for promotion for the first time since returning to the Tercera División in 2017. The club finished fourth in the first phase and third in the second phase, missing out on the promotion play-offs by one point.\nBefore the start of 2021-22, the Tercera División was replaced by the Tercera Federación and turned into the fifth tier of Spanish football. In this way, Manacor debuted in a new competition, even though it was practically a continuation of the previous one. Regarding the results, Manacor had a better season than the previous one, finishing in second place. In the play-off for promotion to the Segunda Federación, Manacor survived the regional phase, eliminating CE Llosetí (4-1) and UE Poblera (2-1). In the national phase, however, the club lost to AD Alcorcón B from Madrid (0-2).\nThe 2022-23 season would be another positive one, but with the same outcome. In a close title race with CE Andratx, SE Penya Independent, and UE Poblera, Manacor finished second, balanced on points with Andratx. In the regional play-off phase, the club lost to CE Santanyí in the first round (1-0 in Santanyí and 1-1 in Manacor) and had to continue in the Tercera Federación.\nIn 2023-24, Manacor qualified for the play-off for promotion to the Segunda Federación for the third consecutive time, but this time after finishing fifth in the regular league. For the second time in a row, the club was knocked out of the play-off in the first round, this time by RCD Mallorca B (1-0 in Manacor and 5-1 in Palma).\n\n\nTwo participations in the Copa del Rey\nThanks to the good classifications in the Tercera Federación in the seasons 2021-22 and 2022-23, Manacor entered the Copa del Rey in 2022-23 and 2023-24. In the first season, the club received FC Andorra from the homonymous state, a team active in the Segunda División, and lost 1–3. The second season, the Estadi de Na Capellera was visited by UD Las Palmas, a side from La Liga, and the Canarians won 0–3.\n\n\nSeason to season\n\n5 seasons in Segunda División B\n56 seasons in Tercera División\n4 seasons in Tercera Federación\n21 seasons in Categorías regionales\n\n\nHonours\nTercera División: 1959–60, 1989–90, 1992–93, 2010–11\nCategorías Regionales: 1940–41, 1944–45, 1945–46, 1948–49, 1979–80, 2009–10, 2016–17\nCopa Uruguay: 1958\n\n\nFamous players\n Toni Muñoz\n Miguel Ángel Nadal\n Xavi Ginard\n\n\nStadium\nThe Estadi de Na Capellera was inaugurated in 1923 and has a capacity of 4,000 seats.

    "text": "Monica Ali  (Bengali: মনিকা আলী; born 20 October 1967) is a British writer of Bangladeshi and English descent. In 2003, she was selected as one of the \"Best of Young British Novelists\" by Granta based on her unpublished manuscript; her debut novel, Brick Lane, was published later that year. It was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It was adapted as a 2007 film of the same name. She has also published four other novels. Her fifth novel, Love Marriage, was published by Virago Press in February 2022 and became an instant Sunday Times bestseller.\nAli was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to literature. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2019.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAli was born in Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in 1967 to a Bangladeshi father and an English mother. When she was three years old, her family moved to Bolton, England. Her father is originally from the district of Mymensingh. She attended Bolton School and then studied philosophy, politics and economics at Wadham College, Oxford.\n\n\nBrick Lane\n\nBrick Lane, Ali's 2003 novel, takes place in London's Bangladeshi community. It follows the life of Nazneen, who moves from Bangladesh to Tower Hamlets at the age of 18 to marry an older man, Chanu. At first, Nazneen speaks only a few words of English; the novel explores her life and adapting to the community, while the narrative also follows her sister, Hasina, through her correspondence.\n\nBrick Lane was generally well-received among the British press becoming a The Daily Telegraph bestseller and earning a place on the Man Booker Prize shortlist. The Observer highlighted especially the characterisation of Chanu as both exasperating and lovable. The novel was well-received by critics also in the United States.\nHowever, the novel provoked controversy within the Bangladeshi community in Britain. Some groups thought Ali had negatively portrayed people from the Sylhet Division, as they constitute the majority of the Bangladeshi immigrants living in the Brick Lane community. Tensions escalated in 2006, when some of the Bangladeshi community opposed Ruby Films's intention to shoot parts of the film adaptation in the Brick Lane area. The Campaign Against Monica Ali's Film Brick Lane was formed, organizing demonstrations against what was seen as a negative and stereotyped portrayal of the area and the Bangladeshi community more broadly, and for ignoring the area's layered history.\nThe writer and activist Germaine Greer supported the campaign, writing that the novel caricatured Sylhetis of Brick Lane and reflected Ali's \"lack of authenticity\", as she had never spent much time in the Brick Lane community. The writer Salman Rushdie criticised Greer for her \"philistine, sanctimonious, and disgraceful, but ... not unexpected\" statements.\n\n\nLove Marriage\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, during which Ali suffered a \"loss of confidence\" according to an interview in The Guardian, she returned with her fifth novel, Love Marriage. Described in The Times' culture section as a \"literary love story\", the book is set in London in 2016–2017, and tells the story of Yasmin Ghorami, a 26-year-old junior doctor, who is engaged to be married to fellow doctor, Joe Sangster. In the same article, journalist Rosie Kinchen argues that we are living in \"a time when feelings are so fraught and people seem to be itching to taking offence\", going on to say: \"This is precisely why it's a good time to have her back. Nuance is one of Ali's greatest skills; she can lay out a character's flaws, self-delusions and inconsistencies and then make you love them anyway.\"\nIn a review in The Times Literary Supplement, novelist Tash Aw described it as a \"rich, sensitive and gloriously entertaining novel...brimming with extremely funny moments of excruciating social comedy.\" Writing in The Financial Times, novelist Susie Boyt called it \"wildly entertaining…a bold and generous book\". David Sexton in The Sunday Times concurred, describing Love Marriage as:\n\"Enormously satisfying in its inventions and observations, and its exploration of cultural diversity in Britain. At once touching and satirical...engrossing and enjoyable.\"\nCritical responses were overwhelmingly positive, propelling the novel into The Sunday Times' bestseller list in its first week of publication. Ali announced on her website that television rights to Love Marriage had been sold to New Pictures after a \"heated auction\", and that it is currently in development with the BBC.\nIn 2023, Love Marriage was shortlisted for the Comedy Women in Print Prize.\n\n\nViews\nAli opposed the British government's attempt to introduce the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. She discussed this in her contribution to Free Expression Is No Offence, a collection of essays published by Penguin Books in association with English PEN in 2005.\nAli coined the term of \"marketplace for outrage\" in an article in The Guardian in which she gives her response to events around the filming of Brick Lane.\nFrom 2015 to 2020, Ali served as a trustee for the Saint Giles Trust, a charity that helps ex-offenders and other marginalised people, and wrote about the need to help newly-released prisoners.\nIn 2020, Ali was appointed Patron of Hopscotch Women's Centre, a charity that was originally set up by Save the Children to support ethnic minority families who had come to join their partners in the UK. The organisation became independent in 1998 and continues to empower women and girls to achieve their full potential.\n\n\nMarks & Spencer's campaign\nIn 2013, Ali was announced as one of several new models for Marks & Spencer's \"Womanism\" campaign. Subtitled \"Britain's leading ladies\", the campaign saw Ali appear alongside British women from various fields, including pop singer Ellie Goulding, double Olympic gold medal-winning boxer Nicola Adams, and actress Helen Mirren.\n\n\nPersonal life\nAli lives in South London with her husband, Simon Torrance, a management consultant. They have two children.\n\n\nPublications\nBrick Lane (2003), Doubleday\n\"Knife\" (short story), included in The Weekenders: Adventures in Calcutta, Ebury (2004)\nThe End of the Affair (introduction), Vintage Classics (2004)\n\"Do We Need Laws on Hatred?\" (essay), included in Free Expression is No Offence , English PEN (2005)\nAlentejo Blue (2006), Doubleday\nThe Painter of Signs (introduction), Penguin Classics (2006)\nIn the Kitchen (2009), Doubleday\nUntold Story (2011), Scribner\nDangerous Edges of Graham Greene (afterword), Continuum (2011)\n\"Contrary Motion\" (short story), included in Closure: Contemporary Black British Short Stories, Peepal Tree (2015)\n\"The Son's Tale\" (essay), included in Refugee Tales III, Comma Press (2019)\nLove Marriage (2022), Little, Brown\n\n\nSee also\nBritish Bangladeshi\nList of British Bangladeshis\nList of English writers\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\nSaykar, Satish. \"Portrayal of Muslim Women Characters in Monicaali's Brick Lane\".

Mills were established in 1875 in the village of Ōji, at the time a suburb of Tokyo, and in 1889 in Shizuoka. In 1893 Shibusawa renamed the company Oji Paper after the location of its first mill. William Anderson went to Japan to oversee the erection of the paper mill in 1871.\nIn 1933, Oji Paper merged with Fuji Paper and Karafuto Industries, developing into an oligopolistic corporation that produced 80 percent of Japan's Western-style paper.\nFollowing World War II, in order to prevent anti-competitive activities caused by overconcentration, the Excess Economic Powers Decentralization Act was implemented, breaking up the company into three components: Tomakomai Paper, Jujo Paper, and Honshu Paper.\nTomakomai Paper began as a one-plant operation, but upon its expansion into Kasugai, Aichi in 1952, the company was renamed Oji Paper Industries, and in 1960, it was renamed Oji Paper again. Oji Paper expanded its business through acquiring competitors including Kita Nippon Paper, Nippon Pulp Industries, and Toyo Pulp.\nIn 1993, Oji Paper merged with Kanzaki Paper to become New Oji Paper, and furthermore, in 1996, New Oji Paper and Honshu Paper merged again to become Oji Paper.\nIn 2012 Oji Paper transferred to a pure holding company system and started anew under the trade name Oji Holdings Corporation.\n\n\nNew Zealand operations\nIn September 2024, Oji Fibre Solutions announced that it would close its Auckland pulp and paper recycling mill in mid-December 2024. The company would continue operations at its Kinleith Mill near Tokoroa. The company also confirmed that it would shift the processing of recycled paper waste from New Zealand to its Malaysian paper mill in Banting. Malaysian environmentalist Lay Peng Pua expressed concern that the increased volume of paper waste would pollute the nearby Langat River.\nIn mid November 2024, Oji Fibre Solutions proposed halting paper processing at its Kinleith Mill in Tokoroa by 2025, affecting 230 jobs. Oji CEO Jon Ryder said that manufacturing paper had become unprofitable but said the mill would continue to produce pulp. The company said it would consult with workers and confirm its decision by mid-January 2025. In mid February 2025, Oji Fibre Solutions confirmed plans to halt paper processing operations at Kinleith Mill by the end of June, affecting 230 jobs.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nGinjirō Fujiwara\nOji Eagles\nPulp and paper industry\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in English)",

    "text": "The Rhein–Main was an express train that linked Frankfurt am Main with Dortmund in Germany and later with Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The train was named after the two rivers, the Rhine and the Main, that join west of Frankfurt.  For most of its life, it was a Trans Europ Express (TEE).\n\n\nF-Zug\nThe Rhein–Main was launched in May 1953 as train number F 31 northbound and F 32 southbound. The service was operated by Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Federal Railways) with Class VT 08 diesel multiple units.\n\n\nTrans Europ Express\nOn 2 June 1957, the Rhein–Main was one of the initial TEE services. The rolling stock was given TEE signage on front but the use of VT 08 continued for a few months, because the German TEE trainsets planned for it were not available for the Rhein–Main until 1 December 1957. With the start of the TEE network the northern terminus was changed from Dortmund to Amsterdam, and the Cologne – Dortmund portion of the Rhein–Main became part of the TEE Saphir. During the summer of 1958 and the winter of 1958–59 the Rhein–Main and Saphir ran coupled between Frankfurt and Cologne after the Saphir's eastern terminus was changed from Dortmund to Frankfurt. After 31 May 1959, the Saphir, using the east bank of the Rhine, and the Rhein–Main using the west bank of the Rhine calling at the West-German capital Bonn, ran as separate trains again.\nOn 28 May 1967, the Oberhausen–Arnhem railway electrification works were completed and Rhein–Main's rolling stock was replaced by electric-locomotive-hauled trains. Because of poor loading figures on the evening service between Bonn and Frankfurt the southbound service was shortened to Bonn on 26 September 1971. The northbound route continued to start in Frankfurt.  On 28 May 1972, the service was renamed TEE Van Beethoven.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited",

    "text": "Pierre Louis Trouillon-Lacombe (26 November 1818 – 30 September 1884) was a French pianist and composer.\n\n\nBiography\nLacombe was born in Bourges (Cher), the brother of composer Felicita Casella. He showed unusual musical abilities at very young age and was soon hailed as a child prodigy. He studied piano at the Paris Conservatoire from 1829 to 1832 with Pierre Zimmerman and won first prize in piano performance at age 12 in 1831. He began touring Western Europe after leaving the Conservatoire, and in 1834 studied composition in Vienna with Carl Czerny as well as theory with Ignaz von Seyfried and Simon Sechter. At the end of the decade, he settled in Paris and married his first wife; his second wife, Andrea Lacombe (née Favel), whom he married in 1869, was a singer.\nIn Paris, Lacombe initially established himself as a virtuoso pianist, increasingly dedicating himself to composition and music criticism (his essays were partly reprinted in a posthumous collection, Philosophie et musique, 1896).\nLacombe's first published works include a piano quintet, a trio, and some piano pieces. He wrote a number of dramatic symphonies with soloist and choir, and his cantata, Sapho, was performed at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1878).\nHe wrote several operas, but only two were performed in his lifetime. La Madone was a modern composition with musical continuity through each act, elaborate orchestration, and only a small amount of spoken dialogue. However, the opening night response was described as lukewarm. Madame Boniface, a two-act comic piece, was performed in 1883, late in his life. Perhaps his finest work is Winkelried (1892), a four-act grand opera that premiered posthumously. Steven Huebner, writing in Grove, states \"musically the score is worth more recognition than it has received. It betrays none of the influence of Gounod seen in so many French operas of the period. Though it is conservative in form, the orchestration and harmonic style are rich (...) Stirring homorhythmic choruses make Winkelried a fine vehicle for Swiss patriotic sentiment\".\nLacombe died in Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, a small town located on the English Channel, at age 65.\n\n\nOperas\nLa Madone, opéra comique, 1 act (P.

In 1945, Fourteenth Air Force also used the airfield as a transport base, primarily moving Chinese troops and their equipment from the base to other locations in China.    The Americans used the base until the end of December 1945, when they closed their facilities at the station.\nThe runway is not now used for fixed wing aircraft. A resort facility has been developed at the south end of the runway for housing visitors and providing them helicopter service to view canola crops when they are in blossom.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",

He recorded an album of original music as A Rose Parade with Shannon Funchess of Light Asylum and also produced music with Midnight Masses and The Stationary Set.  He died at age 36 from lung cancer.\nAs a self-taught musician who played the piano, bass, organ, classical guitar, and sitar, he studied fine arts and Art History at FIT and SUNY Purchase.\nSmith was busking in a Brooklyn subway when he was recruited by TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe in 2003. Smith recalled in an interview:\n\nI saw Tunde in the movie Jump Tomorrow on IFC. And I was super addicted to film at that time. A year later, I was playing on the subway platform here, at the Bedford stop, and he kept giving me money. And then I was like, I recognize this guy. Then it finally clicked, and I said, 'Dude you were in that movie! I loved that movie!' That film had meant a lot to me, especially because there was a black actor that wasn't in the ghetto, and there weren't a lot of politics.  He was being a human being and not only a black actor. And that meant a lot to me.\nSmith played on the critically acclaimed albums Return to Cookie Mountain, Dear Science, and Nine Types of Light.\nAside from writing music and playing bass and keyboards in TV on the Radio, Smith, along with Adebimpe, composed the score for the 2010 documentary feature The Lottery, (now Success Academy Harlem).\n\n\nTributes\nThe song \"Killer Crane\" from Nine Types Of Light was written about the band coming to terms with Smith's impending death, and the song's video serves as a tribute to him, featuring many shots of Smith.\nUpon learning of his death on April 20, the band The National played \"About Today\" in his memory at their concert at Starlight Theater in Kansas City, Missouri.\nThe song \"While You're Here\" on Dirty Projectors' 2012 EP About to Die is a tribute to Gerard Smith.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Durga Puja (ISO: Durgā Pūjā, Assamese pronunciation: [duɹɡäpuzä] , Bengali pronunciation: [d̪uɾɡapud͡ʒa] ), also known as Durgotsava or Sharadotsava, is a major Hindu festival honouring the goddess Durga and commemorating her victory over Mahishasura. In 2021, 'Durga Puja in Kolkata' was inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nThe festival is observed in the Indian calendar in the month of Ashvin (September–October) on the Hindu luni-solar calendar.  It lasts ten days, with the final five being most prominent. Even though Durga Puja and Navaratri are both dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga and are observed simultaneously, they are not the same festival.\nThe puja is performed in homes and public spaces with temporary structures (known as pandals), religious recitations, cultural performances, visiting, feasting, and processions; it is central to the Shaktism tradition.\nScriptures portray Durga’s defeat of Mahishasura, often interpreted as the triumph of good over evil; some traditions also link the festival with post-monsoon harvest themes. Durga Puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism.\nAlongside Durga, devotees commonly venerate Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha and Kartikeya. Major public celebrations run from Mahalaya to Vijayadashami and conclude with immersion of the images; practices vary by region. \nDurga Puja is an old tradition with medieval textual references and detailed manuals from at least the 14th century; elite and community forms expanded under early modern and colonial patronage.\n\n\nNames\nIn West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura, Durga Puja is also called Akalbodhan (literally, \"untimely awakening of Durga\"), Sharadiya pujo or puja (\"autumnal worship\"), Sharodotsab (\"festival of autumn\"), Maha pujo (\"grand puja\"), Maayer pujo (\"worship of the Mother\"), Durga pujo, or merely Puja(In Odisha, Bihar) or Pujo. In Bangladesh, Durga Puja has historically been celebrated as Bhagabati puja. Maa Durga is known as the Goddess of Power (feminine) which represents triumph of Goodness over evil.\nDurga Puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu Dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore Dasara celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai Golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala Koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana.\n\n\nHistory and origins\n\nDurga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.\n\nThe name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the Rigveda hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the Atharvaveda A deity named Durgi appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word Durga, the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga Puja that is found in later Hindu literature.\nA key text associated with Durga Puja is Devi Mahatmya, which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely a well-established deity by the time this Hindu text was composed, which scholars estimate to date between 400 and 600 CE. The Devi Mahatmya scripture describes the nature of evil forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Indian texts.\nIn the Mahabharata, both Yudhisthira and Arjuna invoke hymns to Durga. She appears in Harivamsa in the form of Vishnu's eulogy and in Pradyumna's prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have led to her worship.\n\nSome versions of the Puranas mention Durga Puja to be a spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and two other Shakta Puranas mentions it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in the north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the Krittivasi Ramayana, a 15th-century manuscript by Krittivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping Durga. As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to have her blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one of the 108 flowers of lotus, very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at the time of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place of that lotus. When he was about to offer his eye, Durga appeared and told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his devotion and she was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed to be sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also known as akāla bodhana.\nSurviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at least the 16th-century. The 11th or 12th-century Jain text Yasatilaka by Somadeva mentions an annual festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of Durga Puja.\nAccording to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by Muslim invasions and conquests.\nThe significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamic armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to yet other scholars, the marginalisation of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.From the medieval era up to present-day, Durga Puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the roots of religious worship.\n\n\nRituals and practices\n\n\nTexts\nThe puja rituals involve mantras (words manifesting spiritual transformation), shlokas (holy verses), chants and arati, and offerings. The worship begins with a reading of the Sanskrit Devī Mahātmya from the sixth-century Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The shlokas and mantras praise the divinity of the goddess; according to the shlokas, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfilment and peace.\n\n\nScriptural References\nSource:\n\nMarkandeya Purana (Devi Mahatmya / Chandi Path): The primary text narrating the battle of Durga with Mahishasura.\nDevi Bhagavata Purana: Expands on the cosmic significance of Maa Durga and her victory.\nSkanda Purana: Mentions Durga’s various forms and their purpose in destroying evil.\nVaraha Purana: Contains references to the goddess as Mahishasura Mardini.\nTantra Texts (e.g., Devi Mahatmyam in Shakta Tantra): Emphasize her as Shakti, the supreme power.\n\n\nRelation to harvest\nDurga Puja is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called navapatrika, as a symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. Many people think Nabapatrika is just a banana tree wrapped like a bride, often called “Kolabou”. In reality, it is a sacred combination of nine plants, each representing a form of divine energy and cosmic force. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is \"not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation\".\nThe festival is a social and public event in the eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary pandals built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The festival is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private home-based festival.\nBefore Durga puja there is Paata Puja, the ritual of making an idol on the day of the Rath Yatra, usually around July. 'Paata' is the wooden frame that forms the base for the idols.\n\n\nDay One\nDurga Puja is a ten-day event. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform tarpaṇa by offering water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the arrival of Durga from her marital home in Kailash.\nThe festival starts at twilight with prayers to Saraswati. She is believed to be another aspect of goddess Durga. This is also the day when the eyes are painted of the deities on the representative clay sculpture-idols, bringing them to a lifelike appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to pandals and temples.\n\n\nDay Two to Five\nDay two to five mark the remembrance of the goddess and her manifestations, such as Kumari (goddess of fertility), Mai (mother), Ajima (grandmother), Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and in some regions as the Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) or Navadurga (nine aspects of Durga). On the sixth day major festivities and social celebrations start. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.The specific practices vary by region.\n\n\nDay Six to Nine\nThe next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (Shashthi), on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. Rituals typically performed on the sixth day include:\nBodhana: Involves rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest. The amorphous sight of the goddess is consecrated into a ghata or noggin while the visible sight is consecrated into the murti or idol. These rituals are known as ghatasthapana and  pranapratistha respectively.\nAdhivasa: Anointing ritual wherein symbolic offerings are made to Durga, with each item representing a remembrance of subtle forms of her.\nOn the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya, social visits to elaborately decorated and illuminated pandals (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others.\n\nNavapatrika snan: Bathing of the navapatrika with holy water done on the seventh day of the festival.\nSandhi puja and Ashtami pushpanjali: The eighth day begins with elaborate pushpanjali rituals. The cusp of the ending of the eighth day and beginning of the ninth day is considered to be the moment when per scriptures Durga engaged in a fierce battle against Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of Ashtami and Navami, the eighth and ninth days respectively. This moment is marked by the sandhi puja, involving the offering of 108 lotuses and lighting of 108 lamps. It is a forty-eight minutes long ritual commemorating the climax of battle. The rituals are performed in the last 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions, there is not an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic sacrifice substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolise the blood spilled. The goddess is then offered food (bhog). Some places also engage in devotional service.\n\nHoma and bhog: The ninth day of festival is marked with the homa (fire oblation) rituals and bhog. Some places also perform kumari puja on this day.\n\n\nDay Ten\nSindoor khela and immersion: The tenth and last day, called Vijaya Dashami is marked by sindoor khela, where women smear sindoor or vermillion on the sculpture-idols and also smear each other with it. This ritual signifies the wishing of a blissful marital life for married women. Historically the ritual has been restricted to married women. The tenth day is the day when Durga emerged victorious against Mahishasura and it ends with a procession where the clay sculpture-idols are ceremoniously taken to a river or coast for immersion rites. Following the immersion, Durga is believed to return to her mythological marital home of Kailasa to Shiva and the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members on the tenth day. Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the day after Vijaya Dashami, called Ekadashi, by visiting a Durga temple.\n\nDhunuchi naach and dhuno pora: Dhunuchi naach involves a dance ritual performed with dhunuchi (incense burner). Drummers called dhakis, carrying large leather-strung Dhaks, Dhols and other traditional drums depending on the region, to create music, to which people dance either during or not during arati. Some places, especially home pujas, also observe dhuno pora, a ritual involving married women carrying dhunuchis burning with incense and dried coconuts, on a cloth on their head and hands,\n\n\nDecorations, sculptures, and stages\n\nThe process of the creation of clay sculpture-idols (pratima or murti) for the puja, from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post-monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the sculpture-idols months before, during summer. The process begins with prayers to Ganesha and to the perceived divinity in materials such as bamboo frames in which the sculpture-idols are cast.\n\nClay, or alluvial soil, collected from different regions form the base. This choice is a tradition wherein Durga, perceived as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and in everything in the universe. In certain traditions in Kolkata, a custom is to include soil samples in the clay mixture for Durga from areas believed to be nishiddho pallis (forbidden territories; territories inhabited by the \"social outcasts\" such as brothels).\nThe clay base is combined with straw, kneaded, and then moulded into a cast made from hay and bamboo. This is layered to a fine final shape, cleaned, painted, and polished. A layer of a fibre called jute, mixed in with clay, is also attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex and are usually made separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the sculpture-idols which are later dressed in clothing, are decorated and bejewelled, and displayed at the puja altars.\nThe procedure for and proportions of the sculpture-idols are described in arts-related Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, such as the Vishvakarma Sashtra.\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nThe sculpture-idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. In today's times, brighter coloured statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colourful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.\nBrighter colours that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colours, are typically more expensive compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.\n\n\nAnimal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice\n\nShakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the asura is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.\nIn communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a fowl, pig, goat, or male water-buffalo. Large scale animal sacrifices are rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Nepal. In these regions, festivals are primarily when significant animal sacrifices are observed.\nThe Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The Kuldevi (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.\n\n\nPandals and theme-based pujas\n\nMonths before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build pandals centered around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalisation of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, celebration of cinema, womanhood,  pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of maati (literally, soil or ash) and \"finding one's own light\". Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga Puja pandals have also been centered around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National Register of Citizens of India.\nThe budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, the preparations and the building of pandals are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such commercialised pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based pandals has escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticise the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.\n\n\nRegional celebrations and observances\n\nThere exists variation in Durga Puja worship practices and rituals, as is the case with other Hindu festivals, in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different localised rituals may be observed regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals, and within families.\nThe festival is most commonly associated with Bengali Hindus, and with the community having variability and differences in practices. There may exist differences of practice between the puja of theme-based Pandals, family pujas (with puja of erstwhile aristocrat families known as bonedi puja), and community pujas (known as barowari pujas) of neighbourhoods or apartments.\nThe rituals of the puja also varies from being Vedic, Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga Puja rituals typically combine all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja rituals tend to be essentially Vedic (srauta) in nature but they too incorporate esoteric elements making the puja an example of a culmination of Vedic-Tantric practices.\nHistorical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social, and creative. The festival had earlier been a domestic puja, a form of practice that still remains popular. But it had also come to be celebrated in the sarvajanin (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and efforts to set up pandals and illuminations, and celebrate the event as a \"mega-show to share\". The origins of this variation are unclear, with some sources suggesting a family in Kolkata reviving such celebration in 1411 CE. While other set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord, named Kamsanarayan, held a mega-show puja in late 16th-century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as Durgotsavaviveka, Durgotsava Prayoga, Vasantaviveka and Kalaviveka. The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions from Bengal, such as in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in various styles and forms.\nIn Kolkata, Durga Puja is an annual festival celebrated magnificently. Kolkata alone hosted more than 3,000 Barowari pujas in Kolkata in 2022, with more than 200 pujas were organised in the city with a budget of over one crore rupees. Kolkata has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in December 2021.\nIn Bishnupur, West Bengal, Durga Puja holds a unique and significant place. The district boasts the Rajbari Durga Puja, also known as the Mrinmoyee Maa er pujo, which dates back to 994 AD. This makes it the oldest Durga Puja in the entire Bengal region, encompassing present-day Bangladesh, Odisha, and Tripura.\n\nIn Basirhat, West Bengal, the scale and intensity of Durga Puja celebrations are among the largest in North 24 Parganas district. In terms of the number of Durga Puja pandals, the city ranks fourth in West Bengal, following Kolkata, Asansol, Durgapur, and Siliguri. For more than 150 years, the Durga idol has been immersed on boats in this city. On the day of Vijayadashami, people usually come in Basirhat to see the immersion festival. The idols and installations have changed in the modern era, but the immersion continues to be done in the Ichamati River by boat according to the ancient tradition. A fair is held on both banks of the river centering on the immersion. The special attraction of this fair is wooden furniture and various wooden items.\nSiliguri, West Bengal also hosts more than 100 durga pujas, 82 of which are registered by the Siliguri Metropolitan Police. Siliguri's Durga Puja is the third largest in West Bengal after Kolkata and Asansol-Durgapur.\n\nDurga Puja is a widely celebrated festival in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts), Assam, and Odisha. It is celebrated over a five-day period. Streets are decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play festive songs as well as recitation of hymns and chants by priests, and pandals are erected by communities. The roads become overcrowded with revellers, devotees, and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on puja days. It often creates chaotic traffic conditions. Shops, eateries, and restaurants stay open all night; fairs are also set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organising committees, which plan and oversee the pandal during the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, a major public spectacle and a major arts event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship, and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes, known as thakur dalan, for Durga Puja where the sculpture-idols for worship is placed and decorated with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentations, and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like arati are performed and prasad is distributed after being offered to the deities. As a tradition, married daughters visit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja with them, a symbolism alluding to Durga who is popularly believed to return to her natal home during the puja.\n\nDurga Puja is also a gift-giving and shopping season for communities celebrating it, with people buying gifts for not only family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together during Durga Puja. During puja holidays, people may also go to places of tourist attractions while others return home to spend Durga Puja with their family. It's a common trend amongst youngsters and even those who are older to go pandal-hopping and enjoy the celebrations.\nThe organising committees of each puja pandal hires a purohita (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, Durga Puja is a time of activity wherein he pursues the timely completion of Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequences to make various offerings and perform fire oblations, in full public view, while the socio-cultural festivities occur in parallel. The complex puja rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The puja involves crowds of people visiting the pandals, with smaller groups visiting family pujas, to witness the celebrations. On the last day, the sculpture-idols are carried out in immersion processions across Bengal, following which they are ritually immersed into rivers or other waterbodies. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after the last day of puja.\n\nAccording to some scholars, the ritual of immersing the Durga sculpture-idol into the river attracted the attention of colonial era travellers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by the Muslim community in Bengal. Shia Bengali Muslims observed Muharram over ten days, taking out processions in memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the tenth day. Tassy further stated that the Bengali rituals of Muharram included the same offerings at the annual observation of Muharram that the Hindu rituals included during Durga Puja. According to yet other scholars, the ritual of immersion in water by Hindus for Durga Puja in Bengal and Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states of India, may have grown because members of the Hindu community attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Muharram, allowed by the colonial British Indian government in the 19th and early 20th-centuries.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the city of Nashik and other places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati, and Mahatmanagar host Durga Puja celebrations. While in Delhi, the first community Durga Puja was organised near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, in 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India. This group came to be the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja. The Durga Puja at Timarpur, Delhi was started in the year 1914. In 2011, over 800 Durga Pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and Noida.\n\nIn Odisha, Durga Puja is one of the most important festivals of the people of the state. During the 4 days of the festival, the streets of the city turns into a wonderland throughout the state, people welcome the arrival of their maa by rejoicing themselves, eating tasty food, wearing new clothes, seeing different pandals across the city, family gathering and gift givings. In 2019, ninety-seven pandals in Cuttack alone, Odisha were reported to bedeck respective sculpture-idols with silver jewellery for Durga Puja celebrations; such club of pandals termed regionally as Chandi Medha. The state capital is famous for the modern themes and creativity In the pandals, while the Western part of the state has a more retro decoration theme to the pandal. In the northern parts of the state particularly Balasore, Durga Puja is celebrated with much fervor and the Odia diaspora abroad especially in Australia, which originates 95% from the district of Balasore celebrates the puja in the same manner which is done back home in Balasore. In September 2019, 160 pandals were reported to be hosting Durga Puja in Cuttack.\nWhile in Tripura there were over 2,500 community Durga Puja celebrations in 2013. Durga Puja has been started at the Durgabari temple, in Agartala by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur.\n\n\nSignificance\nBeyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political event with regional and national political parties having sponsored Durga Puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of ₹25,000 to all community-organised Durga Pujas in the state.\nIn 2019, Kolkata's Durga Puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Durga Puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga Puja in Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronise the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of ₹25,000 to puja organising committees in West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a ₹70 crores. The state government also announced an additional grant of ₹5,000 to puja organising committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five per cent concession on total electricity bills for puja pandal. The government had made a grant of ₹10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja organising committees in the state in 2018.\nA 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal's Durga Puja to be a ₹25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga Puja organising committees in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organising community pujas.\n\n\nEconomic significance\nDurga Puja directly affects the economy. A 2019 study by the British Council estimated the economic value of creative industries associated with Durga Puja in West Bengal at ₹32,377 crores (2.6% of the state's GDP in that financial year). In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of 50,000 crore rupees. The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 per cent that year. The factors responsible for this economic boost are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism, industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.\nThe famous puja pandals get sponsorship from renowned companies and labels. Usually, the dress and jewelries of the idols, the material used to make the typically very elaborate pandals, decorations, lightings are sponsored.\n\n\nSocial significance\nDurga Puja plays a great significance in the living of certain peoples. The kumors, those who make the idols with clay and also makes other clay products, earns lakhs of rupees by selling a single set of Durga idol of average size. Hence, it makes their annual income because idols used in other festivals are much cheaper. Other professions that receive the majority of their annual income are dhaaki (plays dhaak), priest and other small homecrafts. It is assumed that these profession based small classes would become smaller in population if Durga Puja was absent.\n\n\nMedia attention\n\nThe day of Mahalaya is marked by the Indian Hindu community of West Bengal with Mahishasuramardini — a two-hours long All India Radio program — that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from Devi Mahatmyam (or Chandi Path) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies.\nDramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as Pujabarshiki (Annual Puja Edition) or Sharadiya Sankhya (Autumnal Volume). These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples of such magazines in Bengali are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sananda, Nabakallol, and Bartaman.\n\n\nCelebrations outside India\n\nDurga Puja is celebrated commonly by both Bangladesh's Bengali and non-Bengali Hindu community. Some Bengali Muslims also take part in the festivities. In Dhaka, the Dhakeshwari Temple puja attracts visitors and devotees. In Nepal, the festivities are celebrated as Dashain.\nBeyond South Asia, Durga Puja is organised by Bengali communities across the world.\n\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States Durga Puja is celebrated across the country in many cities. The oldest community Durga Puja in the US was held in Columbia University organised by the East Coast Durga Puja Association (ECDPA) in 1970. While many community pujas are typically held over a Friday-Sunday period, some pujas in the US e.g. organised by Bharat Sevashram Shangha, Paschimi, Women's Now and others follow the full 5 day schedule.  While most major metropolitan centers have multiple Durga Pujas organised by multiple Bengali organisations, Saikat  in San Diego, CA, SABCC in San Antonio, TX, and the Bengali Association of Greater Chicago (BAGC), are three of the biggest American cities to have an unified Durga Pujas for the whole metropolitan area.  In addition to the actual puja, most Durga Pujas in North America have a tradition of having elaborate cultural events involving both local artists and invited professional artists from India.    \nIn Canada, Bengali Hindu communities both from Bangladesh and West Bengal, India organise several Durga Pujas. Greater Toronto Area has the most Durga Puja celebration venues organised by different Bengali cultural groups such as Bangladesh Canada Hindu Cultural Society (BCHCS), Bongo Poribar Sociocultural Association zetc. City of Toronto has a dedicated Durga Temple named Toronto Durgabari where Durga Puja is organised along with other Hindu celebrations. Most of the puja venues of Toronto area try to arrange the puja in the best way possible to follow the lunar calendar and timings.\n\n\nSouth America\nIn Brazil, The Swami Vivekananda Cultural Center, São Paulo, organises an annual Durga Puja. \n\n\nEurope\nCelebrations are also organised in Europe. The sculpture-idols are shipped from India and stored in warehouses to be re-used over the years. According to BBC News, for community celebrations in London in 2006, these \"idols, belonging to a tableau measuring 18ft by 20ft, were made from clay, straw and vegetable dyes\". At the end of the puja, the sculpture-idols were immersed in River Thames for the first time in 2006, after \"the community was allowed to give a traditional send-off to the deities by London's port authorities\". In Germany, the puja is celebrated in Cologne, and other cities. In Switzerland, puja in Baden, Aargau has been celebrated since 2003. In Sweden, the puja is celebrated in cities such as Stockholm and Helsingborg. The oldest and first puja in Sweden was founded in 1988 and is one of the oldest ones in Europe, and goes by the name Stockholm Bangiya Sanatan Samaj. In the Netherlands, the puja is celebrated in places such as Amstelveen, Eindhoven, and Voorschoten.\n\n\nAfrica\nIn South Africa, Durga Puja has been revived with celebrations in Johannesburg. In Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa Durga Puja is organised by the Addis Ababa Durga Pooja Committee\n\n\nAustralia\nIn Sydney, Durga Puja is celebrated in many community centers including at the Ponds Community Hub in Sydney where the Bengali Community Dorpon Cultural and Religious Association organised Durga Puja\n\n\nAsia outside the subcontinent\nDurga Puja celebrations have also been started in Hong Kong by the Bengali diaspora.  In China Durga Puja has been organised in Shanghai and is organised by the Embassy of India in Beijing  In Japan, Durga Puja is celebrated in Tokyo with much fanfare.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\nDurga Puja at the Encyclopædia Britannica\n\"Durga Puja - The Hindu Festival, Durga-Puja.org\". www.durga-puja.org.

    "summary": "Durga Puja (ISO: Durgā Pūjā, Assamese pronunciation: [duɹɡäpuzä] , Bengali pronunciation: [d̪uɾɡapud͡ʒa] ), also known as Durgotsava or Sharadotsava, is a major Hindu festival honouring the goddess Durga and commemorating her victory over Mahishasura. In 2021, 'Durga Puja in Kolkata' was inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nThe festival is observed in the Indian calendar in the month of Ashvin (September–October) on the Hindu luni-solar calendar.  It lasts ten days, with the final five being most prominent. Even though Durga Puja and Navaratri are both dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga and are observed simultaneously, they are not the same festival.\nThe puja is performed in homes and public spaces with temporary structures (known as pandals), religious recitations, cultural performances, visiting, feasting, and processions; it is central to the Shaktism tradition.\nScriptures portray Durga’s defeat of Mahishasura, often interpreted as the triumph of good over evil; some traditions also link the festival with post-monsoon harvest themes. Durga Puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism.\nAlongside Durga, devotees commonly venerate Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha and Kartikeya. Major public celebrations run from Mahalaya to Vijayadashami and conclude with immersion of the images; practices vary by region. \nDurga Puja is an old tradition with medieval textual references and detailed manuals from at least the 14th century; elite and community forms expanded under early modern and colonial patronage.",

    "text": "Mahendranath Gupta (Bengali: মহেন্দ্রনাথ গুপ্ত) (14 July 1854 – 4 June 1932), (also popularly known as Shri M and Master Mahashay), was a disciple of Ramakrishna and a mystic himself. He was the author of Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita (5 vols.), a Bengali classic; in English, it is known as The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. He was also an early teacher to Paramahansa Yogananda, a famous 20th-century yogi, guru and philosopher. In his autobiography, Yogananda noted that Gupta ran a small boys' high school in Kolkata, and he recounted their visits, as they often traveled to the Dakshineshwar Kali Temple  together. Having a devotional nature, Gupta worshipped the Divine Mother in the form of Kali, and often reflected the wisdom of his guru Ramakrishna in his daily life and mannerisms. Yogananda reverentially regarded Gupta's spirituality, calling him an \"Incarnation of purity\" and \"the greatest man of humility I ever knew.\"\n\n\nLife\n\n\nBirth and education\nMahendranath was born to Madhusudan Gupta and Swarnamayi Devi in a Bengali Hindu family of Baidya sub-caste in the Shimuliya (Shimla) locality of Calcutta (now Kolkata) of Bengal Presidency . After elementary education at the Hare School, he attended Presidency College, receiving his B.A. in 1874. Gupta was a gifted student and performed consistently well until 1874 till he graduated from Presidency College. In 1874 he was married to Nikunja Devi, daughter of Thakur Charan Sen and a relative of Keshub Chandra Sen, a Brahmo Samaj leader. After some time working for the government and a merchant house, he began teaching English, Psychology, and Economics at various colleges. Eventually he became headmaster of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's high school, where he was called \"Master Mahashay\"—just as he was often addressed in Ramakrishna's circle and later by Yogananda.\n\n\nMeetings with Ramakrishna\n\nAs an adult, Mahendranath, like some of the other disciples of Ramakrishna, was connected with the Brahmo Samaj for several years. Mahendranath had lost his mother at a very early age and was experiencing domestic friction in the joint family. As the friction within the joint family increased, Mahendranath decided to commit suicide. At this critical juncture, Mahendranath's nephew took him to the temple garden of Dakshineswar Kali Temple, where Ramakrishna, a mystic and the chief priest of the Kali temple lived. It was here that Gupta met Ramakrishna for the first time and this meeting was a turning point in his life. Years later, when Mahendranath was asked about the greatest day in his life, he said, \"the day I had my first darshan of Thakur [Ramakrishna] in February 1882.\" According to other traditional accounts, Mahendranath related that he may have met Ramakrishna for the first time when he was four years old and became separated from his mother while visiting the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. He began crying, and a blissful and youthful man came up and consoled him. He believed it to be Ramakrishna, who was then a priest at the Kali temple.\n\n\nSri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita\n\nShri M had the habit of maintaining a personal diary since the age of thirteen. M met Sri Ramakrishna in 1882 and, attracted by the latter's teachings, started to maintain a stenographic record of Sri Ramakrishna's conversations and actions in his diary, which finally took the form of a book Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita. Initially when M began writing the diaries, he had no plans of publication. Regarding his methodology M wrote,\n\nI wrote everything from memory after I returned home. Sometimes I had to keep awake the whole night...Sometimes I would keep on writing the events of one sitting for seven days, recollect the songs that were sung, and the order in which they were sung, and the samadhi and so on...Many a time I did not feel satisfied with my description of the events; I would then immediately plunge myself in deep meditation ...Then the correct image would arise...That is why in spite of the big gap in the physical sense, this story remains so fresh and lifelike in my mind as if it happened just now.\nIn each of his Kathamrita entries, M records the date, time and place of the conversation. The title Kathamrita, literally \"nectarine words\" was inspired by verse 10.31.9 from the Vaishnava text, the Bhagavata Purana. Both Sri Ramakrishna's wife, Holy Mother Sarada Devi, and Swami Vivekananda later testified to Mahendranath's faithfulness to Sri Ramakrishna's words. The first four volumes were published in 1902, 1904, 1908 and 1910 respectively and the fifth volume in 1932, delayed because of M's health problems. The Kathamrita contains the conversations of Sri Ramakrishna from 19/26 February 1882 to 24 April 1886, during M's visits. The Kathamrita is regarded as a Bengali classic and revered among the followers as a sacred scripture. Its translations of Kathamrita include works by Swami Nikhilananda (1942), Swami Abhedananda, and Dharma Pal Gupta.\n\n\nTeacher to Paramahansa Yogananda\nParamahansa Yogananda, a 20th-century philosopher and a yogi, was a student of Mahendranath Gupta. Mahendranath moved to 50 Amherst Street in Calcutta, where he ran a small boys' high school. It was also formerly Paramahansa Yogananda's family home—a site especially poignant to Yogananda because it was the site of his mother's death. In his Autobiography of a Yogi, Yogananda dedicated an entire chapter to describing his friendship with Mahendranath, whom he referred to as \"Master Mahasaya,\" which was along spiritual rather than academic lines. Yogananda described Mahendranath as having a \"silky white beard and large lustrous eyes\" and described his personality thus:\n\n\"His role in the world was humble, as befitted the greatest man of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst Street house, Master Mahasaya conducted a small high school for boys. No words of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and ferule maintained his discipline. Higher mathematics indeed were taught in these modest classrooms, and a chemistry of love absent from the textbooks. He spread his wisdom by spiritual contagion rather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophisticated passion for the Divine Mother, the saint no more demanded the outward forms of respect than a child.\"\nYogananda went on to describe several seemingly miraculous experiences with Mahendranath. Later, Yogananda said about him that \"I would roll on the ground where he'd walked, so great was my love for him. I felt that even that ground had been sanctified.\"\n\n\nLater life and death\nIn 1922, M. lived in Mihijam, a town 144 miles from Kolkata, for nine months.\nIn 1932, when the fifth Volume of Kathamrita was at the printers Mahendranath died at his home, now called Kathamrita Bhavan, located near the Thanthania Kali Temple in Calcutta. Kathamrita Bhavan is a pilgrimage place for followers of Ramakrishna due to numerous visits there by Ramakrishna and Sarada Devi, and several relics associated with their lives.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\nWorks by or about Mahendranath Gupta at the Internet Archive\nTable of Contents for \"M\" – The Apostle and the Evangelist (16-volumes)\nSources of Biographical Information about M.",

    "text": "Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy (CEP) is a method of teaching and learning based on cognitive psychology and constructivist learning theory which claims that construction and retention of new concepts and skills is most effective if the learning content is associated with creativity and emotionally distinct experiences. The theoretical framework was created by Joni Mäkivirta.\n\n\nTheoretical Framework\nConceptual extension happens when new concepts are so closely linked to the existing knowledge that the overall conceptual structure and logical connections can be retained. Conceptual extension is associated with linear logical processes.\nConceptual rearrangement happens when new concepts are sufficiently dissimilar in terms ‘shape’ and ‘behavior’ to the existing concepts that their assimilation requires existing knowledge to be rearranged. Conceptual rearrangement is associated with lateral logical processes.\nParadigmatic structuring happens when new concepts are so dissimilar in terms of ‘shape’ and ‘behavior’ to the existing knowledge that their assimilation to existing knowledge fails. The acquisition of new concepts is possible only if the conceptual map is rebuilt. Paradigmatic structuring is associated with creative theorizing that challenges existing assumptions.\nMäkivirta claims that traditional education is creativity-deprived because it focuses on conceptual extension and rearrangement, but not on paradigmatic structuring, even though the latter has been responsible for paradigm shifts that have created the greatest progress in human knowledge.\nAccording to the theory all three types of learning happen at all ages, but the greatest amount of paradigmatic structuring takes place in the early childhood. Traditional schooling is criticized for destroying the ability to learn paradigmatically by conditioning students to believe that the teacher is the only source of reliable knowledge and using assessment as a 'cognitive control tool'. This practice is particularly detrimental if assessment tasks are inappropriate for the students' level of cognitive maturity.\nAccording to Mäkivirta the 'fact fetish' and the overemphasis of mathematical and linguistic operations at expense of emotional engagement and concept discovery lead to deprived and biased thinking and prevent development of fully functioning intellect.\nMäkivirta suggests that more effective and transformative learning can be achieved if the learning content is delivered using Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy (CEP) that combines creative emotional experiences with learning tasks. To create a learning environment that supports CEP, schools should align their pedagogical practices and learning cultures with the principles of CEP.\n\n\nPrinciples of CEP\nTeachers are concept assimilation and creativity facilitators\nLearners are knowledge creators\nPedagogy should support knowledge creation by fostering conceptual manipulation skills, providing relevant emotional experiences and promoting sharing of created knowledge\nCurriculum should be based on assimilation of concepts and logical operations typical of various ‘areas of knowledge’ and provide learner-specific educational plans\nAssessment should be based on expressed guidelines and should credit concept creation, creativity, emotional expression and conceptual manipulation skills\nLearning culture should be defined by positivity, openness and tolerance for ambiguity\nSelf-evaluation should be used to create meta-cognition regarding aspects of the learning process\n\n\nTeacher Training\nTeacher training based on CEP principles is available by some educational consultancies. Teacher training focuses on topics such as rediscovering creativity; constructive verbal and non-verbal communication; CEP in lesson and unit planning; CEP pedagogy in different learning contexts; and building of creative and positive learning communities.\n\n\nReferences\nChabot, Michel (2006): Emotional Pedagogy.

    "text": "James Barrett McNulty (February 27, 1945 – March 2, 2016) was an American politician who served as Mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nEarly life\nMcNulty was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania on February 27, 1945 to Henry and Aloise McNulty, the eldest of six siblings. He graduated from St. Patrick's High School in 1962 and  the University of Scranton, where he received a degree in political science.\n\n\nMayor of Scranton\n\n\n1981 campaign\nMcNulty ran for mayor in the 1981 mayoral election. The flamboyant and rotund McNulty's trademark was the red rose and the red rose boutonniere he was never without. He also handed out some 20,000 red roses to both supporters and other courted members of the electorate during his career. His main campaign pledge was to try to revive the near dead coal mining city's economy with tourism. His plans helped to boost the city's profile and he won the November election.\n\n\nBuilding a New Scranton\nDuring his term, he undertook several large scale projects designed to build a new economy to replace the lost coal mining industry. He attracted Steamtown, USA, a Hilton Hotels & Resorts (for which grand opening McNulty hired Guy Lombardo's orchestra to play) and the Montage Ski Resort to Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is on a thoroughfare that \"Jimmy\" stated a million Canadians passed down on their way to gamble in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He convinced Houston Astros owner John McMullen (engineer) to serve as developer of a civic arena for Scranton. This was said to be, itself, a 24 million dollar project.\n\n\nMayor as promoter\nMcNulty also arranged several publicity stunts to draw attention to the city. He helped plan for the 1983 heavy weight title bout between Easton, Pennsylvania's Larry Holmes and French challenger Lucien Rodriguez to be fought in Scranton and as the network television cameras panned in on the champion Holmes' robe, there inside it was, instead, the 300 pound mayor \"Jimmy\" McNulty plugging the city of Scranton and its fight.\nIn the summer of 1982 McNulty gave free rein to the city to Scranton resident Jason Miller to direct the on-location filming of his motion picture That Championship Season based on his Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name and set in Scranton. Many city locales and properties were featured in the film, including the city council chambers and the mayor's office at Scranton City Hall.\nMcNulty also traveled extensively promoting \"his\" city. During the aftermath of Hurricane Gloria, \"Jimmy\" could be seen in his fire engine red \"Scranton No. 1\" warm up jacket, conspicuously, personally, directing hurricane cleanup.\n\n\nFamily and personal life\nJames Barrett McNulty was a cousin to Sister Mary Adrian Barrett.\nMcNulty was married to Evie Rafalko-McNulty. In 2015, Evie threw her then 70-year-old husband James, who was battling late stage colon cancer, a birthday bash. The couple even managed to weave red roses into the theme. It is said that the turn-out for the party, which doubled as a fund raiser for the Foundation for Cancer Care, was quite large and that the party lasted for hours. Amidst the many politicos present to honor McNulty, including the senior United States senator for Pennsylvania Bob Casey, Jr., and his wife Terese and Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, was then 65 year old Larry Holmes. Evie Rafalko McNulty (born 1959) is, herself, a multi term Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Recorder of Deeds and a member of the Democratic National Committee. Rafalko-McNulty was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. In 1996, she was a presidential elector for Pennsylvania for William Jefferson Clinton.\nIn 2015, Rafalko-McNulty was reported to have been snubbed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf when seeking the position as his Northeast Regional Director. Neither James McNulty nor Evie Rafalko-McNulty would comment to the press. McNulty died from effects of cancer and heart disease on March 2, 2016, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the city where he had lived his entire life.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Lu Lac Political Letter 28 February 2015",

A new main building was constructed later the same year. Tjusterby Manor is owned privately.\n\n\nHistory and architecture\n\n\nThe Old Manor House\n\nThe original main building of Tjusterby was destroyed in a fire in 1903. After the fire, a new main building, designed most likely by famed architect Carl Ludvig Engel, was moved from Helsinki to Siuntio. As previously mentioned, this 19th-century building was destroyed in a fire in 2011. The manor house was under restoration, and the fire started when paint was being removed inside the manor by using heat blowers.\nThe building represented empire style. Its frame was made of timber and the facades were painted yellow. The two-storey construction encompassed 450 square metres.\nTjusterby Manor was owned privately until the 1960s, when it became a course centre for people with visual disabilities. In the 1980s Tjusterby became a rehabilitation centre to aid people with drug addiction. Later on, the rehabilitation centre was closed down, and the manor house stood empty for some years, until it was bought by private individuals, who started renovating the manor house to make it a private home once again.\nThe old manor by Engel was one of the most important sights in Siuntio. The manor house was considered a significant cultural object even on the national level.\n\n\nThe New Manor House\n\nThe new Tjusterby Manor was constructed on the same place of the previous manor, destroyed in a fire. Stone elements were used as construction material, and the building works were completed in 2011. Only an old stone cellar, located under the main building remains from the former main building. The new Tjusterby was constructed by JokaRak Oy. Architecturally the new manor house resembles the old one.\n\n\nSee also\nPickala Manor\nSiuntio\nSuitia Manor\nSjundby Manor\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Arianta arbustorum, sometimes known as the copse snail, is a medium-sized species of pulmonate land snail in the family Helicidae.\n\n\nSubspecies\n\nSeveral subspecies are recognized by some authors:\n\nArianta arbustorum alpicola Férussac, 1821\nArianta arbustorum arbustorum (Linnaeus, 1758)\nArianta arbustorum canigonensis (Boubée, 1833)\nArianta arbustorum picea\nArianta arbustorum pseudorudis (Schlesch, 1924)\nArianta arbustorum repellini (Reeve, 1852)\nArianta arbustorum styriaca (Frauenfeld, 1868)\nArianta arbustorum vareliensis Ripken & Falkner, 2000\n\n\nDistribution\nThis species is native to Europe:\n\nNorth-western and central Europe with Alps and Carpathians\nNetherlands\nAustria\nCzech Republic\nSlovakia\nPoland\nSwitzerland. One of the most frequent species of land snails in Switzerland, can be very abundant, up to 20 adults per square meter.\neastern Pyrenees, Spain\nNorway\nIceland\nFaroe Islands\nthe British Isles: Great Britain and Ireland In Britain the species suffered slightly from intensive farming and the continuous destructions of suitable uncultivated refuges. It is rare in Ireland.\nKaliningrad\nFinland. In Finland, it has become so common in the Porvoo region east of Helsinki, that it is locally called the \"Porvoo snail\".\nEstonia\nLatvia\nscattered to Serbia\nBulgaria It is rare in Bulgaria.\nwestern Ukraine\nArianta arbustorum is introduced to North America, but is only known from Canada, where established populations are known from Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island.\nThis species has not yet become established in the US, but it is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe shell is usually brown with numerous pale yellowish rows of spots and usually with a brown band above the periphery, occasionally yellowish, reddish or with greenish hue, weakly striated and with fine spiral lines on the upper side. The shell has 5-5.5 convex whorls with deep suture. The last whorl is slightly descending near the aperture. The aperture is with prominent white lip inside. The apertural margin is reflected. Umbilicus is entirely covered by the reflected columellar margin.\nThe width of the shell is 18–25 mm. The height of the shell is 12–22 mm. Dimensions are locally variable.\nThe shell shape is globular in most present-day populations, but originally is believed to have been depressed in the Pleistocene, before lowlands were invaded and shells became globular, re-invading mountain regions except some isolated spots among glaciers.\nThe animal is usually black.\n\n\nLife cycle\nArianta arbustorum lives in forests and open habitats of any kind. It requires humidity. It lives also in disturbed habitats (not in Ireland where it is restricted to old native woodland). It may locally tolerate non-calcareous substrate, in north Scotland also on sandhills. In the Alps up to 2700 m, in Britain 1200 m, in Bulgaria 1500 m.\nIt feeds on green herbs, dead animals and faeces.\nIf snails hatched more than 50 m distant from each other, they are considered isolated since they would not move more than 25 m (neighbourhood area 32–50 m), usually they move about 7–12 m in a year, mostly along water currents.\n\nThis species of snail makes and uses calcareous love darts during mating. Reproduction is usually after copulation, but self-fertilization is also possible. The size of the egg is 3.2 mm. Maturity is reached after 2–4 years. The maximum age up to 14 years.\nAngiostrongylus vasorum has successfully experimentally infected this snail.\n\n\nPrevention\nMetaldehyde and iron phosphate can be used to exterminate snails. Since copper generates electric shocks that make it difficult for snails to move, it makes a great barrier material for them.\n\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates public domain text from the reference:\n\nKerney, M.P., Cameron, R.A.D. & Jungbluth, J-H.

It is published by Singapore-based Ate Media, and officially sponsored by the German home appliance maker Miele. Other official partners include TIME Magazine, Visa Inc. and Hyatt Hotels. The guide does not accept advertising and none of the official partners have any influence on the multi-round judging process.\n\n\nHistory\nThe Miele Guide was created by Aun Koh and Tan Su-Lyn as they felt there is no authoritative reference to restaurants in Asia. Aun Koh is the director of Ate Media and also the noted blogger behind popular Singapore food blog, Chubbyhubby.net. As early as 2006, the blog featured entries discussing the lack of recognition for restaurants in Asia in international listings and rankings such as Restaurant Magazine's annual Top 50 list Restaurant (magazine) Top 50. A predecessor of the Miele Guide was probably Koh's early efforts to compile an alternative list of Asia's best restaurants through online polling on his website.\n\n\nRestaurant Rankings and Listings\n\n\nGeographical Coverage\nThe first printed edition of the Miele Guide was published at the end of October 2008. The 16 Asian countries evaluated by the Miele Guide in the first edition are: Brunei, Cambodia, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n\nJudging Process\nEach year's list of restaurants to be featured in the printed edition of the Miele Guide was compiled through four rigorous rounds of judging. In the initial round, the publishers worked with respected food critics at top magazines and newspapers across Asia, called the \"shortlisting jury\" to create a shortlist of restaurants for all the countries to be surveyed. In the second round, voting opens to the public on the website. In the third round, a special jury of more than 2000 food lovers and food and wine professionals cast their votes in a closed round of voting. In the final round, the Miele Guide's team, together with contributing editors across Asia, verify the results by dining anonymously and independently, before the final list of restaurants is compiled.\nJudges are not paid for their efforts.\n\n\nTop 20 List\nA key feature of the printed edition of the Miele Guide is the Top 20 restaurants in Asia list. The restaurants that emerge in the top 20 from the combined rounds of judging are featured and profiled in-depth. The top 20 restaurants are listed with a detailed description on the Guide's website.\n\n\nTop Restaurant List\n2008/09: Iggy's, Singapore.\n2009/10: L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Hong Kong.\n2010/11: Iggy's, Singapore.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n[1]",

Selsky, of the Associated Press, published an article based on interviews with former captives who knew Saleh.\nRecently released Binyam Mohammed asserted that suicide was totally out of character for Saleh: \"He was patient and encouraged others to be the same. He never viewed suicide as a means to end his despair.\"\nMohammed said that Saleh had been chosen as a prisoner's representative.\nMohammed said that Saleh had been escorted from Camp five on January 17, 2009, for a meeting with Admiral David Thomas, commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo, and Colonel Bruce Vargo, Commander of the camp's guard force.  Mohammed said that Saleh never returned to Camp five, and instead was confined to the camp's Psychiatric wing.\nSelsky reported that Elizabeth Gilson the attorney for one of the other captives confined to the psychiatric wing, was aware of details of Saleh's death, which she could not disclose because they were classified.\nOn August 1, 2009, Mike Melia, of the Associated Press reported that, Mohammed Albasha, a Yemeni official said that US authorities had informed the Yemen government that Al Hanashi died of \"asphyxiation\".\nThe Associated Press quoted \nfellow captives Yasin Qasem Muhammad Ismail and Adnan Latif, who said Al Hanashi's weight had dropped to under 45 kilograms prior to his death, and that he could only get around on crutches.\n\n\nNCIS Investigation Report released in 2016\nAccording to documents released via Freedom of Information Act in 2016, Al Hanashi died by tearing off a piece of elastic underwear and strangling himself to death. Attempts by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to understand the timeline of events leading up to the death were complicated by the fact that someone at Guantanamo told staff in the Behavioral Health Unit where Al Hanashi was found to turn off all computer logging of events that were then occurring. NCIS was never able to determine who had ordered the database logs shut down. Al Hanashi had made multiple suicide attempts in the month or so prior to his death, and even been put on suicide watch at least once. The description of his underwear type did not comport with other reported rules about the kinds of clothing allowed for Guantanamo inmates. At least one camp staff member interviewed by NCIS said they were surprised when they saw the deceased Al Hanashi wearing clothing that had not been approved. According to the FOIA documents, Al Hanashi was considered a leader among the other detainees, and the day he died had complained to the Chief of the Behavioral Health Unit about proposed changes in the rules governing punishment in that unit. He also complained about being tortured on the day he died, and wrote in a final note that he was very upset when his report was ignored, and said he didn't want to live anymore.\n\n\nSee also\nGuantanamo Bay homicide accusations\nHunger strike\nSuicide\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMurder at Guantanamo?

    "text": "Butcher's Broom is an epic, historical novel by Neil M. Gunn written and published in 1934, and re-titled Highland Night for its first American printing in 1935. Based on a semi-fictionalised account of the Highland Clearances in Sutherland, the novel deals with the decline of Highland culture in a wide scope of pre-Clearance and post-Clearance life, as well as the Clearances themselves.\n\n\nPlot\nThe book opens on Dark Mairi, a local healer and widow making her way back to the Strath where she, her grandson Davie and Elie (a young woman from the community) live. They live on the Riasgan estate where they have lived for many years under the ancient clan system. The decline of the clan system is one of the catalysts that drives the Clearances and the plot of the novel.  Elie falls in love with Colin, a young man in the community and falls pregnant to him, just as he leaves to go to fight in the Napoleonic Wars for regiment raised by the local Captain, who as tacksman emigrates, leaving his community lacking the protection he once provided.\nElie wanders the Lowlands destitute with her child but returns to the community an outcast just as the threat of clearance hangs over the whole Strath (this is carried out by a thinly veiled equivalent of Patrick Sellar called Heller). Through this all Young Davie struggles to regain his trust for Elie, and Elie also attracts the attentions of Rob the Miller, who eventually marries her.\nThe community is burned out and cleared to the rocky shore, with a wall erected to stop them using their old lands. They eke out a pitiful existence in a harsh environment. Mairi is killed at the end by an estate sheepdog. Colin returns from the war to find his community relocated and overtly changed. He encounters he and Elie's son Colin, and together, although not recognising each other as father and son they bury Mairi according to custom.\n\n\nSignificance\nButcher's Broom was one of the first pieces of 20th Century fiction to deal with the Highland Clearances. It deals with the social unrest which came with the decline of the Highland Clan System as chiefs became anglicised, the tacksmen emigrated and attitudes of laissez-faire capitalism and a belief in the inferiority of Gaelic culture arose to prominence in the 1800s.\nWhilst Riasgan is a fictional location, the Clearances are very similar to those carried out in Strathnaver and Strath Kildonan, including the death of 93 year old Margaret MacKay, allegedly through the neglect by Patrick Sellar and his men.\nIt is Gunn's only book which directly deals with the Clearances, although many of his works are written in the historic aftermath of the events. When asked why he never wrote more than one novel about the Clearances itself, he referenced the complicity of Lowland Scots and the Highland Gentry in the process saying it was due \"To the shame of the thing.. because our own people did it.\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nA Celebration of the Light with analysis of Butcher's Broom\nreview",
    "summary": "Butcher's Broom is an epic, historical novel by Neil M. Gunn written and published in 1934, and re-titled Highland Night for its first American printing in 1935. Based on a semi-fictionalised account of the Highland Clearances in Sutherland, the novel deals with the decline of Highland culture in a wide scope of pre-Clearance and post-Clearance life, as well as the Clearances themselves.",

In previous years, fiction competed with poetry for one award in each language.\nIn July 2014, three judges of the English non-fiction category of the prize resigned in protest against the National Library Board's removal and pulping of controversial children's titles. Mr T. Sasitharan, a prominent arts educator; former journalist Romen Bose; and American author and Writer-in-Residence at Yale-NUS College, Robin Hemley were subsequently replaced. The Prize also received flak for perhaps spreading itself too thin, and for naming the non-fiction prizes after a sponsor, the publisher World Scientific.\nA day after the winners were announced at an awards ceremony on 4 November 2014, poet-editor Grace Chia, whose poetry collection Cordelia was shortlisted but did not win in the English Poetry section, delivered a speech in absentia at the Singapore Writers Festival which accused the Prize of sexism. Chia wrote, \"The fact that the prize has been given to two co-winners who are both male poets is deeply informing of choice, taste and affirmation. A prize so coveted that it has been apportioned to two male narratives of poetic discourse, instead of one outstanding poet - reeks of an engendered privilege that continues to plague this nation's literary community.\" Chia also posted her speech on Facebook before subsequently removing it. In response, one of the poetry judges, poet and literary critic Gwee Li Sui, said, \"All entries have an equal chance of consideration for winning, and we discussed it based on that point alone, and on the strengths of the collections.\" The other poetry judges were prominent female poet Leong Liew Geok and poet Boey Kim Cheng.\n\n\nFiction\n\n\nEnglish\nWinner: Amanda Lee Koe - Ministry of Moral Panic\nClaire Tham - The Inlet\nO Thiam Chin - Love, or Something Like Love\nAudrey Chin - As the Heart Bones Break\n\n\nChinese\nWinner: Lim Hung Chang (Lin Gao) - Weixingxiaoshuo(林高微型小说／林高)\nLai Yong Taw - Ding Xiang (丁香／流军)\nTham Yew Chin (You Jin) - Jin Se Dai Shu(金色袋鼠／尤今)\nLee Xuan Lou - Shuang Cheng Zhi Lian(双城之恋／李选楼) \n\n\nMalay\nWinner: Yazid bin Hussein - Kumpulan Cerpen (Armageddon)\nAbdul Manaf bin Abdul Kadir - Suzan\nAnuar bin Othman - Tenggelamnya Kapal  (Prince of Wales)\nHassan Hasaa'ree Ali - Selamat Malam (Caesar)\nYazid bin Hussein - Cahaya\nMohd Pitchay Gani bin Mohd Abdul Aziz - Seking\n\n\nTamil\nWinner: Mohamed Kassim Shanavas - Moontraavatu Kai\nJayanthi Sankar - Muga Puthagamum Sila Agappakkangalum\nSuriya Rethnna - Naan\nNoorjehan binte Ahmadsha - Vergal\nPackinisamy Panneerselvam - Maaya\nKrishnamurthi Mathangi - Oru Kodi Dollargal\n\n\nPoetry\n\n\nEnglish\nCo-winner: Joshua Ip - Sonnets from the Singlish\nCo-winner: Yong Shu Hoong - The Viewing Party\nGrace Chia - Cordelia\nTheophilus Kwek - The Circle Line\nTania De Rozario - Tender Delirium\nKoh Jee Leong - The Pillow Book\n\n\nMalay\nWinner: Johar Buang - Pasar Diri\nPeter Augustine Goh - Genta Cinta\nAhmad Md Tahir - Aisberg Kesimpulan\nHamed bin Ismail - Suara Dalam\nYazid bin Hussein - nota (buat wangsa dan buanaku)\n\n\nTamil\nCommendation: Krishnamurthi Mathangi – Malaigalin Parathal\nSamuel Nepolian Devakumar – Kaanaamal Pona Kavithaikal\nChinnadurai Arumugam – Thagam\nPichinikkadu Elango – Thoorikai Sirpangal\nSwaminathan Amirthalingam – Urakkach Cholvaen\n\n\nNon-fiction\n\n\nEnglish\nCo-winner: Lim Siong Guan - The Leader, The Teacher & You\nCo-winner: Josephine Chia - Kampong Spirit Gotong Royong: Life In Potong Pasir 1955 to 1965\nM.

    "text": "William Steuart (25 May 1686 – 13 September 1768) of Seatter, Orkney was a Scottish lawyer and Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1713 to 1741. An agent of the 2nd Duke of Argyll, he pursued Argyll's interests in Parliament and without, and held a succession of public offices.\n\n\nEarly life\nSteuart was the only son of Thomas Steuart, commissary and stewart clerk of Orkney, Scotland and his second wife  Isobel Young, daughter of Andrew Young of Castle Yards, Orkney. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen in 1701, becoming an advocate in 1707. He was an agent of the Duke of Argyll and his brother,  Lord Ilay and under their patronage he  obtained a place  as principal clerk of the Scottish Exchequer worth £500 p.a.  in 1705. After the Union, the post was abolished by the Act establishing the Scottish exchequer court  and he was compensated with a joint post as King's remembrancer of the Scottish Exchequer in 1708 which he held for the rest of his life.\n\n\nCareer\nSteuart stood as Court candidate for Tain Burghs  at the 1710 British general election but was unsuccessful. At the 1713 British general election he was returned as Member of Parliament for Inverness Burghs. Argyll and Ilay had split with Robert Harley and Steuart's return  was a hostile act towards ministerial interests, and a reprisal against the Jacobite former member. Steuart  followed the Hanoverian line of his patrons and voted  against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March. He voted  in favour of extending the schism bill to cover Catholic education on 12 May, and was a teller against a Scottish Tory initiative for the investigation of episcopal revenues in Scotland on 3 July. He was appointed secretary to the  Prince of Wales for Scotland in 1714.\nAt the 1715 British general election Steuart was returned unopposed as MP for Inverness Burghs, but was unsuccessful standing for Orkney and Shetland. He voted with the Government from 1715, except on the motion against Argyll's rival, Lord Cadogan, on 4 June 1717.  He was  a director of the East India Company from 1716 to 1719. At the 1722 British general election he was returned as MP for Ayr Burghs. In about 1724 Argyll and Ilay quarrelled, and never spoke to each another  for many years after. During this time, Steuart acted as a channel of communication between the two brothers. He lost his post to the Prince of Wales when George became King in 1727. At the 1727 British general election, he was returned unopposed  as MP for Ayr Burghs and for Elgin Burghs, but chose to sit for Ayr Burghs. He was appointed paymaster of pensions in 1731 and was returned again for Ayr Burghs in the consequential by-election. At the 1734 British general election he was returned unopposed for Elgin Burghs alone. By 1739 he was appointed overseer of the King's swans and was in possession of offices worth £1,400.  When Argyll went into opposition in 1739, Steuart continued in support of Ilay. He retired from Parliament at the 1741 British general election.\n\n\nLater life and legacy\nSteuart married Frances Cheyne, the daughter of Dr. George Cheyne of Bath, in 1741, but had no children. He died on 13 September 1768.\n\n\nReferences",

To cooperate with the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, or other kindred organisations, in joint political or other action in harmony with the party constitution and standing orders.\n3. To give effect as far as possible to the principles from time to time approved by the party conference.\n4. To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.\n\n5. Generally to promote the political, social and economic emancipation of the people, and more particularly of those who depend directly upon their own exertions by hand or by brain for the means of life. \n\n\n1960 amendments\nIn 1960, Hugh Gaitskill attempted amendments to the constitution, including change of clause IV, but was voted down. However two further points were added.\n\n6. To cooperate with labour and socialist organisations in the commonwealth overseas with a view to promoting the purposes of the party and to take common action for the promotion of a higher standard of social and economic life for the working population of the respective countries.\n7. To cooperate with the labour and socialist organisations in other countries and to support the United Nations and its various agencies and other international organisations for the promotion of peace, the adjustment and settlement of international disputes by conciliation or judicial arbitration, the establishment and defence of human rights, and the improvement of the social and economic standards and conditions of work of the people of the world\n\n\nCurrent version\nThe Labour Party Constitution was amended in 1995 under Tony Blair, and changed the \"Aims and Values\" under Clause IV as follows.\n\n1. The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few, where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe, and where we live together, freely, in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect.\n2. To these ends we work for:\n\nA. A dynamic economy, serving the public interest, in which the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition are joined with the forces of partnership and co-operation to produce the wealth the nation needs and the opportunity for all to work and prosper, with a thriving private sector and high quality public services, where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them\nB. A just society, which judges its strength by the condition of the weak as much as the strong, provides security against fear, and justice at work; which nurtures families, promotes equality of opportunity and delivers people from the tyranny of poverty, prejudice and the abuse of power\nC. An open democracy, in which government is held to account by the people; decisions are taken as far as practicable by the communities they affect; and where fundamental human rights are guaranteed;\nD. A healthy environment, which we protect, enhance and hold in trust for future generations.\n3. Labour is committed to the defence and security of the British people, and to cooperating in European institutions, the United Nations, the Commonwealth and other international bodies to secure peace, freedom, democracy, economic security and environmental protection for all.\n4. Labour will work in pursuit of these aims with trade unions, co-operative societies and other affiliated organisations, and also with voluntary organisations, consumer groups and other representative bodies.\n\n5. On the basis of these principles, Labour seeks the trust of the people to govern.\n\n\nSee also\nLabour Party (UK)\nUnited Kingdom labour law\nUnited Kingdom enterprise law\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Labour Party Rule Book 2025\nEvolution of Rulebook",

    "text": "Molly Kerr (28 May 1904 – 31 May 1942) was an actress and theatre producer who originated the role of Bunty Mainwaring in  Noël Coward's play The Vortex.\nBorn into a family of actors, Kerr made her London stage debut in 1921. She gained wider notice in The Faithful Heart later that year. This was followed by appearances in The Second Mrs Tanqueray, a spell touring with the theatre troupe of Mrs Patrick Campbell, and another West End role in The Return of Sherlock Holmes, all in 1922. The Vortex had a good run in London (1924–1925) and another in New York (1925–1926). Further plays followed in London and New York over the next two years.\nIn 1927, Kerr became, according to The Westminster Gazette, the youngest female producer of stage plays in history when she produced The Intriguing Ladies at the Q Theatre and then produced at the Arts Theatre. Her last London stage performance, in 1928 was in Two White Arms. She continued producing into 1929. In 1931 she moved to Balcombe, Sussex, with her parents, where she appeared in entertainments presented by the local Women’s Institute.\n\n\nEarly life\nKerr was born Frances Keen on 28 May 1904 in Kensington, London, to Frederick Grinham Keen (1858–1933), an actor who used the stage name Frederick Kerr, and Lucy Houghton Keen, née Dowson (1862–1941). She was baptised Frances Mary Keen at the church of St Mary Abbots in Kensington. Her elder brother was the actor, author and playwright Geoffrey Kemble Grinham Keen (1895–1971), who used the stage name Geoffrey Kerr, and her older sister was Lucy Joyce Gunning Keen (1897–1980), who acted under the stage name Joyce Kerr before marrying, in 1924, James Boswell Talbot, 3rd Baron Talbot de Malahide (1874–1948).\nKerr was educated at  St Paul's and Granville House School for Girls in Eastbourne. In about 1920 at the age of 16 she enrolled in the drama school run by Lady Constance Benson at Pembroke Gardens, Kensington.\n\n\nCareer\nKerr made her stage debut aged 17 in 1921 in Threads by Frank Stayton playing Chloe, the daughter of a judge. The play ran for 30 performances from 23 August 1921 at the St James's Theatre in London. She gained wider notice in her next role, as society girl Diana Oughterson, in The Faithful Heart by Monckton Hoffe, which opened at the Comedy Theatre in November 1921 and ran for 185 performances. This was followed by appearances in The Second Mrs Tanqueray by Arthur Pinero at the Playhouse Theatre in 1922; a spell touring with the theatre troupe of Mrs Patrick Campbell, as her father had done, and playing Lady Frances Carfax in The Return of Sherlock Holmes by J. E. Harold Terry at the Princes Theatre. In 1922 Kerr appeared in her only film, a four-reel silent comedy called Hide and Seek produced by Martin Walker.\nIn 1924 Kerr played the part of Bunty Mainwaring opposite Noël Coward in the original production of his play The Vortex at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead. The play ran for 244 performances at three more London theatres between November 1924 and June 1925. In September 1925 The Vortex transferred to the US and after a try-out week in Washington, D.C. it played for 157 performances at Henry Miller’s Theater in New York, where Coward, Lilian Braithwaite and Kerr repeated their roles until it closed in January 1926. During her stay in New York, Kerr modelled French fashions for American  Vogue. On her return to England Kerr played the part of Brenda Fallon in Loose Ends by Dion Titheradge, a play that also transferred to the US and opened at the Ritz Theatre in New York in November 1926. Also in 1926, Kerr appeared in  Escape by John Galsworthy as the Shingled Lady.\nIn 1927, aged 23, Kerr became, according to The Westminster Gazette, the youngest female producer of stage plays in history when she produced The Intriguing Ladies with the play’s author, Frank Stayton, at the Q Theatre. Kerr then produced at the Arts Theatre the first play written by the novelist Audrey Lucas, called The Peaceful Thief. She also acted in both plays. The theatre critic and impresario J. T. Grein wrote of her performance: \"Personally, I think that she is destined to be an emotional actress of much power\".\nFrom January 1928 Kerr appeared in 149 performances of Two White Arms a farce by Harold Dearden at the Ambassadors Theatre, playing the wife, Alison Liston, and then played Margaret Orme in Loyalties by Galsworthy in both Paris and London. \nIn April 1929 Kerr took a short lease on the Everyman Theatre in Hampstead where she produced and directed one of four plays that she had written, called Requital, which had 15 performances starring Moyna MacGill and Peggy Ashcroft.\n\n\nLast years and death\nIn 1931 Kerr moved to Balcombe, Sussex, with her parents. There she appeared in entertainments presented by the local Women’s Institute, published a small book of poems and bred caged birds.\nKerr died of a brain tumour in a nursing home in Hove on 31 May 1942, three days after her 38th birthday.  She was buried in the graveyard of St Mary’s Church, Balcombe, in the plot next to her mother, who had died the previous year.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPortrait of Kerr in The Sketch at the National Portrait Gallery, London",

    "text": "Treasure Hunters is a reality television series on NBC (US) and Global (Canada) in which ten teams of three solve puzzles and complete challenges in hopes of solving the ultimate puzzle and winning the grand prize. Teams travel across the United States and Europe in search of seven \"artifacts\" which when assembled will \"lead to the key. Find the key, and find the treasure.\" The challenges and puzzles are spliced with American history, and the ultimate goal is to find a hidden treasure, leading the show to be compared on various occasions to the film National Treasure. The value of the treasure in the series was revealed on the season finale to be $3,000,000.\nThe two-hour premiere episode aired on June 18, 2006 and beginning June 26 the series moved to its regular Monday night timeslot.  The season finale was broadcast live on August 21, 2006.\nThe Hunt is similar in format to The Amazing Race. Key differences include:\n\nTeams consist of three members as opposed to The Amazing Race's usual two\nThe start location of each leg is not necessarily the end point of the previous leg\nTeams start each leg at the same time; Amazing Race teams have staggered starts based on previous leg finish order\nAmazing Race teams may take no electronic devices with them; Treasure Hunters teams are provided several pieces of electronic equipment, including:\na Motorola RAZR cell phone, by which they receive messages and information from host Laird Macintosh;\nadditional phones they may use to call other teams and each other;\na laptop computer with \"special access\" to Ask.com and Orbitz.com;\na Garmin GPSMAP 60C GPS unit\nThe show focuses more closely on the solving of clues and tasks, which are much more difficult and cryptic than in The Amazing Race; The Amazing Race uses comparatively simple clues, and focuses more closely on the interpersonal relationships within the teams.\nClues sometimes offer multiple solution methods, and false solutions are incorporated into them.\n\n\nTeams and rankings\n\nA red placement indicates the team was eliminated.\nA dark red placement indicates the team withdrew for medical reasons.\nAn underlined blue indicates the team was initially eliminated, but was allowed to return due to unforeseen circumstances.\n+Team Grad Students dropped out after Leg 2 because of injury; Team Brown Family was brought back to replace them.\n§Teams Air Force and Southie Boys were both eliminated at the same time at the end of Leg 8 once Team Geniuses found the treasure.\n‡Leg was shown over two episodes.\n\n\nThe Hunt\n\n\nLeg 1 (Alaska/Hawaii → Nebraska → South Dakota)\nTen teams started the hunt split into two groups of five, with each group of teams unaware of the other's existence. Five teams started at the Independence Mining Camp in Alaska and the other five started aboard a ship identified as the U.S.S. Jefferson (although the US Navy currently has no ship by that name), off the coast of Hawaii. The first clue for both sets was in the form of a Morse Code message which teams had to decipher. Although none of the teams knew Morse Code offhand, there were guidebooks scattered around the locations.\nThe Alaska teams headed to Matanuska Glacier where they had to locate a block of ice. The words \"Stillwater Washington\" were etched on each block, and a map with various destinations was contained inside it, along with the word \"dig.\" Teams had to figure out where to go next by associating the etched clue with a place on the map (the answer was Lake George, Alaska), and tell that location to one of the five awaiting helicopter pilots before they could commence. At Lake George, teams had to dig for a cylinder and a clue directing them to the capitol building in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nThe Hawaii teams were led by their Morse Code clue to a dive site (Hāna Bay) where they had to locate a metal box containing a pilot's log with the coordinates of the next location, Black Sand Beach. There, the teams had to look for the Monticello crash site, where they had to find a locked box among plane wreckage. A key concealed within a Jeffersonian cane would open the box, but it would not work until assembled along with the handle segment of the cane. Inside the box was a coded map, with a painting on the reverse, and teams received a message to head to Lincoln.\nWhen teams reached Lincoln, they learned that there were not five but ten teams. Each team was paired with one from the other starting point based on their order of arrival in Lincoln. Each pair of teams boarded a bus, which headed away from their next destination. By combining the cylinder found in Alaska (which had a cipher alphabet engraved on it) and the coded map found in Hawaii, teams had to determine their next destination and relay this information to their driver. The decoded message, \"Mount Theodore Roosevelt,\" could be interpreted in two ways: literally, leading to the incorrect location of Mount Theodore Roosevelt, South Dakota; or along with a clue given in a message to consider where the teams have been - Lake George (Washington), USS Jefferson, Lincoln, Nebraska - along with Mount Theodore Roosevelt together point to the four presidents carved on Mount Rushmore, the correct destination. Unbeknownst to – and undiscovered by – the teams, if they had put the two clues together in a different way (by placing the cylinder in the middle of the painting on the back of the map), an image of Mount Rushmore would have been revealed. All teams deduced or guessed the correct destination except for the Young Professionals/Geniuses. After a fruitless search at Mount Roosevelt eventually the Young Professionals/Geniuses called the Wild Hanlons, who gave away the correct destination.\nAt Mount Rushmore, the teams, no longer working in two-team pairings, had to find a spot on the Presidential Trail where only two of the four presidents could be seen and then follow a smaller path until they found locked boxes containing the first of seven \"artifacts\" necessary to find the treasure. In this instance, the artifact was a map. The boxes opened with a combination. Teams were earlier given a clue message telling them to pay attention to the natural order of things, but that sometimes history has a way of changing it. This clue referred to the fact that the heads are not in the correct presidential order; Roosevelt and Lincoln are reversed. This led to the correct combination of 1-3-2-6-1-6 (each number referring to the order in which the given President – based on their location in Mount Rushmore – was in office). Team Young Professionals and Team Geniuses raced for the last artifact with the Geniuses eventually finding it.\n\n\nLeg 2 (South Dakota → Montana)\nLeg 2 was based on the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Beginning at about 2:20 am, teams travelled over 600 mi (965 km), from South Dakota to Lexington Mine in Montana. Teams travelled 10,000 ft (3,050 m) into the mine and searched for the clue, a bucket (which was covered with snakes) inscribed with the words \"bend the light.\" Teams discovered that by filling the bucket with water, the words \"Wood Bottom Missouri River Montana\" became visible by refraction. Team Southie Boys never found this clue, instead allying with Team Brown Family to leave the Wild Hanlons 11 hours behind them in last place. Teams travelled to the Wood Bottom Recreation Area, from where they would have to canoe in search of the next clue. Canoes could not be in the water after 5:30 pm and no teams arrived at the campsite early enough to launch, so all teams camped there overnight.\nThe next morning, teams canoed along a 20 mi (32 km) stretch of the Missouri River (including a 3 mi (5 km) portage), following a trail of stars in search of the next clue buried 40 paces behind the fourteenth star. Team Brown Family capsized their canoe, nearly drowning for the second time in as many legs. While portaging, Jessica of Team Grad Students stepped in a hole and injured her ankle. The production team intervened with medical assistance and the team was able to continue with Jessica alternating between crutches and being carried by her teammates. Team Fogal Family misled Teams Ex-CIA and Southie Boys into believing the Fogals were going to stop with them at the 13th star but instead kept paddling after those two teams had docked, which led to contempt for the Fogals (and the expression, \"You've been Fogaled!\") by the other teams – especially since the Southie Boys had helped the Fogals portage their canoe earlier.\nBuried within a fire pit behind the 14th star teams found a table and code key for a double substitution cipher devised by Thomas Jefferson and used by Lewis and Clark, and journal pages describing their next destination, Tower Rock, Montana. At Tower Rock, teams discovered an encrypted sign, which when deciphered read \"Follow close and to the right. Look 'neath a rock as dark as night.\" This led teams to the second artifact, a compass, hidden under black rocks.\nThe Wild Hanlons spent four hours trying to decipher the clue before Ben decided that they would go get some food. After making an estimated 80 mi (130 km) round trip to a Burger King restaurant, Josh quickly deciphered the message and they were able to find the artifact ahead of Team Brown Family.\n\n\nLeg 3 (Massachusetts)\nLeg 3 of the Hunt focused on the American Revolution and started from a bed and breakfast in Boston. It is not explained how the teams travelled from Montana to Boston. Prior to the leg, Team Grad Students bid a tearful farewell to the other teams, having been forced to withdraw because of Jessica's injury on the previous leg. Team Brown Family was brought back in their place, to the consternation of Team Wild Hanlons.\nAll teams travelled to the Old Burke School in search of their first clue for the leg. Everyone followed Boston natives Team Southie Boys except Team Air Force and Team Brown Family. Team Fogal Family called Team Geniuses, who misdirected them. Team Air Force arrived at the school first and discovered a sign reading \"Look until you can see no more.\" In a classroom, they discovered a chalk board with Revolutionary War facts and decided to go to the location of the \"shot heard 'round the world.\" All other teams except Team Fogal Family and Team Brown Family arrived at the school and discovered the sign. Josh Hanlon noticed light switches in the chalk board and flipped them. This caused the main lights to go out and black lights to come on, revealing two hidden messages. One read \"Go to the Old Newgate Prison and search the darkness to find the way to the light.\" The other read \"Go to the Wentworth House in Strawberry Banke and find what the Minutemen left behind.\" All teams present were instructed to pair off, with one team from each pair going to each destination. Messages hidden at each destination would when combined reveal the next destination. As the five teams were departing, Team Fogal Family again called Team Geniuses, who again misdirected them. Team Brown Family arrived at the school shortly thereafter and joined with the other five teams. Team Ex-CIA, Team Southie Boys and Team Wild Hanlons went to Wentworth House and Team Brown Family, Team Miss USA and Team Geniuses went to the prison. Team Wild Hanlons were partnered with Team Brown Family, but when the Browns called the Hanlons for a status update the Hanlons pretended they had bad cell reception, tried to mislead the Browns and finally hung up on them.\nTeam Air Force realized that the clue was at the school and headed back. They located the two black light clues and called Team Fogal Family. Team Air Force went to Wentworth House and Team Fogal Family went to the prison. As teams arrived at the two destinations, a Motorola message informed them they were searching for hollowed-out bullets with messages hidden inside.\nTeam Air Force arrived at Wentworth House after the other teams had found the clue and realized that all six remaining teams were allied against them and Team Fogal Family. The Fogals managed to arrive at the prison ahead of the other teams and found their bullet. Combined, the messages, referring to Paul Revere's famous midnight ride read:\n\nTeams determined they needed to head for the cemetery at the Old North Church. Once there, they discovered two lanterns in the church steeple, thereby determining that the next destination was Boston Light. Teams raced to Pemberton Pier, from which ferries departed for Boston Light, and grabbed tickets to determine their order of departure the following morning. Ferries left fifteen minutes apart and could accommodate two teams, which gave teams with earlier departure times the option of sharing their ferry with a later team. Team Southie Boys got the first ferry slot, followed by Team Ex-CIA, Team Air Force, Team Wild Hanlons, Team Fogal Family, Team Miss USA, Team Geniuses and Team Brown Family.\nThe next morning Team Southie Boys departed first, allowing Team Geniuses to go with them. Team Ex-CIA departed next, inviting Team Miss USA along. Team Air Force left third, bringing Team Fogal Family with them. Team Wild Hanlons were next to depart but they refused to allow Team Brown Family to go with them, leaving the Browns in last place by 15 minutes.\nAs teams arrived at the lighthouse they were informed that seven artifacts were located in ten lockboxes scattered around the island. Team Southie Boys and Team Geniuses noticed rocks laid out in patterns and team members climbed the lighthouse. From above, the rocks formed Roman numerals which revealed the combinations for the two locks on each box. The combinations were IX II LIII, or 9253, and I III IV I, or 1341. The third artifact was an engraved box.\nTeam Wild Hanlons and Team Brown Family were the last two teams with one artifact left. Team Brown Family solved the Roman numerals but Team Wild Hanlons couldn't figure out the correct value for L. Team Wild Hanlons unsuccessfully attempted to spy on the Browns to get the combination, but ultimately Team Brown Family prevailed.\n\n\nLeg 4 (Massachusetts → New York → South Carolina → Georgia)\n\n\nPart One (Massachusetts → New York → South Carolina)\nLeg 4 sent teams along the Underground Railroad. Teams woke up to find a facsimile copy of a Brooklyn Times newspaper. In the paper was a story written by Walt Whitman, directing teams to the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel in Brooklyn, New York. Team Miss USA was the first in the tunnel, the only entrance to which was a manhole. They found Civil War artifacts and lyrics to the slave song Follow the Drinking Gourd written on the tunnel walls. Among the artifacts were bundles wrapped in cloth, which Team Miss USA discovered but ignored. All other teams as they arrived recognized that the bundles were clues, consisting of a Don't Tread On Me flag, a copy of the Drinking Gourd lyrics and special glasses. The glasses revealed the words BENEVENTUM and GEORGETOWN SC in secret printing on the flag. The next destination was Beneventum Plantation in Georgetown, where the \"Don't Tread On Me\" flag was created. With the discovery of the destination, teams received a Motorola message that a $30,000 treasure could be claimed by the first team to reach an upcoming location. Team Miss USA realized their mistake in not taking a bundle and returned to the tunnel. Through it all a bluesman performed the song at the tunnel entrance.\nAfter well over a 14-hour trip to arrive at Beneventum, teams located a key and a quilt with a map hidden in the embroidery, like those used by escaping slaves on the Underground Railroad. Combining the symbols on the quilt with the lyrics of the song would lead teams through a swamp to several locked boxes. Each box bore a symbol from the quilt map and contained the key for the next box and teams had to locate the boxes in order.\nAs teams struggled through the swamp, Team Fogal Family and Team Southie Boys allied but Kayte of Team Fogal Family became hysterical. At the third box (the \"old man\" box) a twist was thrown at the teams. Teams were given the option of at any time eliminating one of the three team members if they felt that the two-person team would be stronger. From the third box teams had to travel by boat but only two could travel at a time. If teams chose not to cut a member, retrieving that member would cost the team a three-hour delay. A distraught Kayte insisted that her parents leave her behind, but like all other teams who reached that point by the end of the episode, the team stayed together.\nTeam Ex-CIA claimed the $30,000 treasure in gold coins, which they had to carry with them for the rest of the leg. With the coins was the instruction that the leg would end at the \"safe house with the American flag.\"\nWell behind the other teams, Keith Brown fell in the swamp, injuring himself. He had to be removed by ambulance. With teams having the option to cut a player, it appeared that the remaining Brown Family members would be able to continue. At the end of the episode, no teams had completed the leg. Team Geniuses members Charles and Francis were in the boat, still contemplating whether to cut Sam, and Team Brown Family had not yet reached the boats.\n\n\nPart Two (South Carolina → Georgia)\nPart two picked up where part one left off, with Team Geniuses deciding whether to abandon a team member and Team Brown Family dealing with Keith's injury. Team Geniuses decided to remain together. Team Brown Family was informed that because of Keith's injury they could either quit the Hunt or continue, skipping the swamp but incurring a six-hour penalty. The remaining Browns, after consulting with Keith, chose to continue.\nAs teams arrived at the \"safe house with the American flag,\" they discovered that the house was filled with quilts and gourds, and the word FREEDOM was written on the wall. Teams searched through the quilts until they found one with a pouch sewn onto it. The pouch contained a quilt panel with the message \"I believed that in America most all men loved freedom and would rather go to their grave free than live their life as a slave.\"  Followed by \"This warrants some reflection. Dock Street Theatre, Charleston.\" The letters R, E and D in \"FREEDOM\" written on the wall were in red. Team Geniuses was the only team to figure out that by donning the red-lensed glasses retrieved from the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel, a star became visible on the quilts holding the message panels.\nTeam Brown Family was the last to arrive at the safe house and served out the penalty. The team was then advised to go to the theatre without having to locate the quilt panel and were verbally apprised of the reflection portion of the clue.\nAt the theatre, teams found a number of mirrors hung on the walls. Teams discovered that by breathing on the mirrors, a picture of a flag, a fort and the words FORT PULASKI appeared in the condensation. This led teams to Fort Pulaski National Monument near Savannah, Georgia. At the fort, teams discovered a room displaying a number of variations of the United States flag. Brooke of Team Air Force noticed a plaque that explained how soldiers hid messages in the finials of flag poles. Unscrewing the finials yielded maps of the surrounding area. Following the maps led to the location where the fourth artifact was buried. The artifact was a reproduction of the death mask of a hero of the American Revolution. Although he was not identified by name either to the teams or on-screen, a portrait of the Marquis de La Fayette was shown. Teams were instructed to dig for the artifact, advised that there would be no indication of how deeply it was buried.\nAll other teams discovered the artifact before Team Brown Family arrived at Fort Pulaski.\n\n\nLeg 5 (Georgia, USA → Paris, France → England:  Dover → London)\nLeg 5 led teams in search of the identity of the man whose death mask they retrieved in Leg 4. From a bed and breakfast in Savannah, teams were instructed to book flights to Paris, France and find the Catacombs of Paris. All teams arrived in Paris together and took the RER B (Paris RER) to the Catacombs. Following the advice of two locals, Team Fogal Family, Team Geniuses and Team Air Force got off the subway five stops before the other teams, at Gare du Nord. Team Southie Boys, Team Ex-CIA and Team Miss USA stayed on the train, which was the correct choice, and got off at Denfert-Rochereau. These three teams arrived at the Catacombs tied for first place.\nOne member of each team descended into the Catacombs in search of the remains interred in 1789, the year the Marquis de La Fayette designed the tricolor Flag of France. A plaque near the remains read \"The Hero Of Two Worlds Awaits upon the RIGHT BANK of the SEINE sword raised. A friend to America. A friend to Washington. Face him to find your fate.\" This led teams to the \"Children's Statue of La Fayette\" sculpted by Paul Wayland Bartlett, located at the Cours Albert 1er.  Upon their arrival teams were finally apprised by Motorola message of La Fayette's identity and his work as a spy during the American Revolution, and that they are seeking the identity of La Fayette's American contact. Near the statue was a broken replica of the death mask. Teams decided to break their copies of the mask, within which were concealed the true fourth artifacts, a medallion engraved with an unknown ship and the words \"Dover Castle The Arrow Points The Way.\" Teams took a ferry to Dover, England.\nTeam Southie Boys realized that the arrow referred to a portion of Dover Castle itself. The three lead teams followed the arrow to a cairn of stones which concealed parchment scrolls. The parchments included the words \"1725 Samuel Palmer Printing Press London.\" This led teams to the identity of \"America's first spy,\" Benjamin Franklin, and the location where Franklin apprenticed as a printer, the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great. Southie Boys, Ex-CIA and Miss USA remained tied for first. Team Geniuses initially broke away in fourth place but Team Fogal Family and Team Air Force passed them at the castle when Kayte figured out the arrow.\nThe three lead teams arrived at the church together and began searching. Todd of Team Ex-CIA suggested heating the parchment over some of the many burning candles. This caused a message written in invisible ink to appear. The message was a map of the church with the five locations of the fifth artifact, a key, marked. Each of the three lead teams found an artifact.\nTeam Fogal Family and Team Air Force arrived at the church together but spent so much time searching that Team Geniuses was able to catch up and locate an artifact ahead of them. Team Air Force found the last key, eliminating Team Fogal Family.\n\n\nLeg 6 (Kent, England → France: Nice → Peille/Saint-Tropez → La Turbie → Paris → Normandy)\nTeams were sent in search of the headquarters of a secret society whose membership included many of America's Founding Fathers. Teams departed from Eastwell Manor in Kent, England for Nice, France, in search of \"where Via ferrata ends,\" which led them to Peille. In Peille, teams were advised that a US$50,000 treasure awaited the first team who located an \"inverted rose,\" symbol of the secret society. To find the next clue, teams were told to search a cave in Peille Gorge, accessible by climbing several rock faces and crossing three suspension bridges. All team members were required to make the climb, but teams were given the option of an alternate route.\nTeam Air Force, Team Southie Boys, Team Geniuses and Team CIA scaled the cliffs and found a ring of keys and a picture of a castle with the French words Retire la Pierre. This led the teams to Peille Castle. Team Air Force broke away in first place and discovered a scroll hidden behind some loose rocks in the castle wall (\"retire la pierre\" translates to \"remove the rock\"). Team Southie Boys, in second place, tried the keys on the castle gate, unsuccessfully, and Team Geniuses and Team Ex-CIA caught up with them. The three teams searched around the castle grounds up to two miles away before returning to the wall and discovering the scroll. The scroll read \"The Ancient Roman Ruin crumbles on the hillside in La Turbie.\"\nThe alternate route, taken by Team Miss USA, involved driving 150 miles (240 km) to Saint-Tropez and locating a statue of Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez. At the base of the statue was the castle picture with instructions to return to Peille and locate a marked path. From the path the team spotted the castle and located the scroll, managing to pass Southie Boys, Geniuses and Ex-CIA.\nAt La Turbie (the Trophy of the Alps), Team Air Force, well in first place, spotted a placard on the ground with an \"inverted rose.\" Searching around the area turned up a box with $50,000 in gold coins and a portfolio containing a partial street map of Paris with the Champ de Mars marked. Air Force flew to Paris and headed to the park, and were instructed to climb to the second level of the Eiffel Tower and look West for \"a classic symbol of American freedom.\" They spotted a model of the Statue of Liberty and traveled to it. Near the statue were buckets and a plaque reading \"They hid beneath the streets of Paris. Clean the streets of Paris to find your path.\" Brooke figured out to wash the street map, revealing the name of the secret society, the Rosicrucian Order. Also revealed were the words \"To the rose through the cross, to the cross through the rose. In this and everything is a resurgent jewel,\" along with the name of the Rosicrucian headquarters, the Chateau d'Omonville in Normandy, France.\nAll the other teams diverged from this path. Team Miss USA arrived at the Eiffel Tower after dark and actually discovered the Statue of Liberty on a souvenir picture postcard. Southie Boys, Geniuses and Ex-CIA discovered the hidden Rosicrucian message on the subway travelling to the Champ de Mars and so were not required to ascend the Eiffel Tower or visit the Statue of Liberty.\nAt the chateau, the keys teams found earlier at Peille Gorge unlocked a cabinet in which there were locked boxes containing the sixth artifact, a cryptex. Teams Air Force, Geniuses, Ex-CIA and Southie Boys retrieved artifacts. Team Miss USA struggled with the cleaning clue and were eliminated just as they were about to leave for Normandy.\n\n\nLeg 7 (Bronx, NY → Philadelphia, PA)\nTeams returned to New York City and spent the night at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The next morning, each team received a Susan B. Anthony dollar along with a clue directing them to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans on the campus of Bronx Community College. At the Hall of Fame, teams located a bust of Susan B. Anthony, and by following her gaze, located a bust of La Fayette. Attached to a fence under La Fayette was a mailbox containing keys, labelled \"Gould Library,\" which led teams to the Gould Memorial Library, designed by Stanford White.\nIn the library, teams received a message that their next clue was hidden in one of the paintings and that \"in this case, art imitates life.\" Team Geniuses discovered a painting called Today, depicting a scene of the Gould Library with a light shining on a particular sculpture. They located the sculpture and found a switch for a spotlight, which caused the sculpture to cast a shadow of a sailing ship. They located a painting featuring the same ship in shadow entitled Sailing to Philadelphia, which was labelled as being owned by the Land Title Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for which they quickly departed. The other teams discovered the sculpture and painting clues shortly thereafter, and headed to the same location.\nAt the Land Title Building, teams were advised to send one member to a suite on the 22nd floor in search of the next clue. With one team member headed up, the other two were told that their teammate needed to find a plaque on the ledge outside the 22nd floor. The member on the ledge had to work with the members on the ground in order to find the plaque, which was visible from the ground but not readable. Outside the suite, the team member who went up received a text message reading \"Bird of peace holds the code to this door. If your credit had wings you'd find the answer for sure.\" This lead teams to enter the card security code from the back of the show-provided VISA credit card to unlock the door. Charles from Team Geniuses arrived first and entered the suite. Todd from Team Ex-CIA was second but didn't have his card, so he was delayed until Matt R. from Team Air Force arrived and unlocked the door, admitting John from Team Southie Boys and Todd.\nAs only one person could go out onto the window ledge at a time, the order was determined by the order they got into the suite. The plaque read \"Founders Hall Girard,\" which all teams other than the Geniuses, who were in the lead, determined correctly to mean Girard College, where Founders Hall is located. Francis of Team Geniuses, who is from Philadelphia, thought that Girard referred to Girard Avenue, and by the time they finally ended up at Girard College, they were in last place. Teams were informed upon arrival that the code to open the cryptex was a seven-letter word, found in multiple locations within the hall, and that some of the rooms have secret entrances. Revealed to the television audience but (apparently) not to the teams was that the solution is hidden in a secret room, but that other items including record books and model ships also contain the solution.\nTeam Air Force located a shipping record book and after trying the names of a number of the ships, stumbled across the word \"LIBERTY\" in the book. They dialed the word into their cryptex and it opened, revealing a parchment reading \"Library of Congress,\" which they are advised is the location of the final artifact, as well as a smaller cryptex.\nTeam Southie Boys arrived at the college second, but twins Martin and Matthew nearly came to blows. John finally defused the situation, and after receiving the Motorola message, they began searching. The team began guessing seven letter words that have to do with Philadelphia, finally getting the right answer (from the Liberty Bell) and advancing to the final round.\nTeams Ex-CIA and Geniuses were left to find the answer to the cryptex, and be the last team to move on to the final. While Ex-CIA began dialing in names of model ships and words from posters on the walls, Team Geniuses found the secret room behind a portrait of Stephen Girard and discovered a large model ship named Liberty. Team Ex-CIA found an old street map of Philadelphia and tried street names from it. Finally, each team entered the correct word into their cryptexes, with the Geniuses getting it first to move on. Todd of Team Ex-CIA stated in the season finale that Team Genius's margin of victory was two seconds.\n\n\nLeg 8 (Philadelphia, PA → Washington, D.C. → Baltimore, MD)\nThe three remaining teams spent the night at a bed and breakfast in Philadelphia. In a message, host Laird Macintosh reviewed the artifacts the teams had already collected and informed the home audience that the previous artifact, the cryptex, contained in addition to the parchment a smaller 5-character cryptex. Teams were directed to seek the final artifact at the Library of Congress and advised that they could no longer use their computers. Teams headed to Washington D.C.\nTeam Southie Boys were first to arrive at the Library of Congress, followed by Team Geniuses and Team Air Force in third. Teams were advised to seek one of three specific books (titled Poltroons & Patriots, Official Histories and The American Flag: Of Stars and Stripes) each of which covered the final artifact. Team Air Force headed for the card catalogue, followed by Team Southie Boys. Team Air Force was the first to find the artifact, a leather-bound book detailing the history of The Star-Spangled Banner. Within the book were semi-transparent maps with chevrons which, when overlaid, marked the various destinations teams had previously visited. The book included a notation that it had been printed on the Library's old printing press and Air Force went in search of the press. In the press room was a template into which the box, key, medallion and compass fit. With the blank map inserted in the press, the artifacts printed a map to Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. Team Geniuses apparently stumbled onto the artifact largely by chance and printed the map. Team Southie Boys, having temporarily given up on the card catalogue, searched for a while then returned to the catalogue to locate the final book. They too printed the map.\nTeam Geniuses were the first to arrive at the Fort McHenry docks and hired a boat to take them to the Francis Scott Key Truce Ship. On board and below decks, they located a mounted glass pane with a duplicate map engraved on it. Behind the map was a box containing another map and a token embossed with a star on each side. The map read \"The treasure is not here. The answer is right in front of you.\" There was also a key and the word \"Lazaretto\" printed on the map. By Motorola message the team was advised to seek the site of Lazaretto Battery. Team Air Force was second at the ship and Team Southie Boys was third.\nBack in the boat, Team Geniuses searched the harbor for the battery site. They spotted a factory named \"Key Industries\" with a duplicate of the Star Spangled banner flag on it and headed there. Upon arrival the team was advised to locate a hidden chamber to find the solution to the second cryptex, and that what was inside would point them to the treasure. Team Geniuses located a hidden entrance inside a pipe and headed down into the chamber. There they located a sliding door with a slot into which the star token would fit. Dropping the token into the slot caused the door to slide open, revealing the \"treasure chamber.\" The walls were covered with hieroglyphs and other symbols and panels were embedded into the floor. The team searched the room for possible solutions to the cryptex.\nAs the episode came to an end, Team Geniuses were searching the treasure chamber and Team Air Force and Team Southie Boys were still looking for the pipe entrance.\n\n\nFinale (Baltimore, MD)\nAs Team Geniuses continued to try to solve the cryptex, Team Southie Boys discovered the secret door in the pipe. Before they could solve the chamber door, Team Air Force located the pipe door and joined them outside the chamber. Matt R. figured out to drop his team's star token down the slot and all three teams were together in the secret chamber.\nTeam Air Force noticed that of the symbols on the walls, there was only one star, but were unable to determine its meaning. All three teams continued to search the chamber and try various word combinations on the cryptex. After eight hours, Francis, citing \"a vision,\" tried FSKEY (for Francis Scott Key) and opened the cryptex. Inside was a metal pointer engraved with symbols matching some of those on the large octagonal plates embedded in the floor. Inserting the pointer into the center of one of the plates, Team Geniuses spun the pointer. It landed on the star symbol. Francis punched the star symbol on the wall and was hit in the face with a blast of gas. A panel slid back, revealing a final secret room. Team Geniuses entered the room, discovering a cache of gold coins. Team Geniuses claimed the treasure, valued at $3,000,000.\n\n\nHome viewer game\nEach episode included a historical trivia question related to the subject matter of the episode. Home viewers answered the question via text message. One winner was selected at random from those who correctly answered and received $10,000.\n\n\nGenworth Financial Treasure Challenge\nOver 400,000 home viewers competed in an online version of the TV show. After successful completion of each challenge, they were given the opportunity to guess the final location of the online treasure.  Out of 37,000 people who correctly guessed the location, 10 were randomly chosen to receive a $10,000 prize and competed in Washington, D.C. in a \"mini-hunt\" for an additional $100,000 grand prize, which aired August 21, 2006 during the season finale. The grand prize winner was Scott Gray, an environmental scientist from Brandon, MS.\n\n\nPublic Reception\nPre-show reviews seemed optimistic about the fact that Treasure Hunters would be an intense, stepped-up version of The Amazing Race, in the wake of two lackluster seasons the latter show had just aired. It premiered to ratings of approximately 6.9 million viewers on June 18, 2006.\nThe show's main criticism as it progressed, however, seemed to be that it was just simply too similar in format and style to The Amazing Race. Many were also irked by the stiff, robot-like persona of host Laird Macintosh, who appeared live and in-person to contestants only on two occasions: the premiere and the finale (for the rest of the season, he delivered clues and instructions to teams via video-message on teams' Motorola RAZR cellular phones). The season finale aired on August 21, 2006 to approximately 5 million viewers.\n\n\nGenworth Financial \"Hints\"\nAlong the course of the hunt, Genworth Financial sponsored several messages shown to home viewers and possibly the teams.\n\nLeg 1 - \"Rush to where the treasure stands.\" This hint was on a road sign on the way to the Mount Rushmore artifact.\nLeg 2 - \"Look on water for it is inspiration.\" This was on the way to Lexington Mine. It was a clue for teams to pour water in the bucket they found in the mine to reveal their next clue, by way of refraction.\nLeg 3 - \"     \" This was located on the Genworth Financial blimp above the Old Burke School. It was meant for teams to turn out the lights in the classroom, which revealed the clue in blacklight. \"In dark times, the words form\" On a flag in the old burke school\nLeg 4 - \"Match the tune with an early drinking song.\" On the way to Beneventum Plantation teams found this.\nLeg 7 - \"Independence for the People\" The hint was on the blimp over Founders Hall at Girard College. It was meant to define liberty.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial Website\nView Trailer\nOnline game\nTreasure Hunters at IMDb\n\n\nTeam websites\nTeam Brown Family Official Website\nTeam Fogal Family Official Website\nTeam Geniuses Official Website",

    "text": "John R. Anderson, also known as J. Richard Anderson (1818–May 20, 1863), was an American minister from St. Louis, Missouri, who fought against slavery and for education for African Americans. As a boy, he was an indentured servant, who attained his freedom at the age of 12. Anderson worked as a typesetter for the Missouri Republican and for Elijah Parish Lovejoy's anti-slavery newspaper, the Alton Observer. He founded the Antioch Baptist Church in Brooklyn, Illinois and then returned to St. Louis where he was a co-founder and the second pastor of the Central Baptist Church. He served the church until his death in 1863.\nMore than half of his congregants were slaves. Reverend Anderson helped enslaved people attain freedom by encouraging them to file freedom suits and by raising funds to emancipate them. He was a minister and spiritual advisor to Harriet Scott and Dred Scott, of the landmark Dred Scott v. Sandford Supreme Court case.\nIn 1854, Anderson operated the floating Freedom School, after its founder John Berry Meachum's death, and he lobbied for schools for black children. He worked with a ten-person board to bring subscription and public schools to the city. After ten years, a law was enacted in 1864 that provided funding for four or five public schools. There were four subscription schools also established by that year. He founded the first African American Masonic temple west of the Mississippi River in the early 1860s.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJohn Richard Anderson was born in 1818 in Shawneetown, Illinois. His parents had been enslaved in Virginia. As a child, Anderson was moved to Missouri by the family who owned him. Legally, his past residence in Illinois territory meant that he was free. He moved to Missouri with Sarah Bates, the sister of United States Attorney General Edward Bates. While he was technically an indentured servant, he was treated like a slave until the age of 12, when he attained his freedom. Anderson and his mother Chloe Anderson were emancipated by Sarah Bates on January 25, 1830.\nAs a child, he learned to read at the Sunday school of the First Colored Church, which was established by Reverends James Welch and John Mason Peck. Anderson received most of his education in reading and theology at John Berry Meachum's \"Freedom School,\" which was conducted on a riverboat in the Mississippi River. He sought to take advantage of evening schools in St. Louis, but was told to leave when it was discovered that he was not white. Anderson was baptized at the First African Baptist Church.\n\n\nNewspapers\n\nAnderson was hired out as a slave to distribute the Missouri Republican newspaper. He performed so well that he was taken into the office to work as a press roller, and then a typesetter. Anderson moved to Alton, Illinois with the anti-slavery activist and editor Elijah Parish Lovejoy and worked as his typesetter for the Alton Observer. He was working when Lovejoy was killed in Alton, Illinois in 1837, and was an eyewitness to his murder and the destruction of the printing press.\n\n\nMinistry\nAnderson was ordained at the Union Baptist Church in Alton. In 1838, Anderson founded the Antioch Baptist Church at his home in Brooklyn, Illinois. Back in St. Louis, he established a white-washing business with Richard Sneethen.\n\nAnderson was a minister for the First African Baptist Church in St. Louis until he resigned in June 1846. With 20 others, he founded the Central Baptist Church in August 1846. Rev. Richard Sneethen was the church's first minister. In 1847, Anderson became an associate pastor of the church with Sneethen. When Sneethen accepted a new position at a church in Louisville, Kentucky, Anderson became the second pastor, a position he held from 1849 to 1863. More than half of the congregants were enslaved men and women. To walk the streets and attend church, they needed approval in the form of a pass from their slaveholders. Unable to support himself and his family on the earnings from the church, Anderson worked  in the City Jail as an assistant police officer for the rest of his life.\nIn 1852, the edifice for the Central Baptist Church was completed at the cost of $12,000 (equivalent to $404,957 in 2024). Anderson gave one year's salary to the edifice fund and raised the rest of the money. Each year, he held a revival. By the 1850s, Anderson served more than 1,000 parishioners.\n\n\nActivist\n\nAnderson was an anti-slavery activist who provided loans to purchase the freedom of enslaved people, preventing them from being sold into the Deep South to work on cotton plantations. The Central Baptist Church acquired two of its deacons after Anderson bought them from the slave pen in St. Louis. They were Merriman Ramsey and Henry Lee. He helped African Americans file freedom suits in the courts. Anderson regularly carried baskets of food and other necessities for the poor and hungry.\n\nHarriet Robinson Scott, a member of the Central Baptist Church, sought his advice for their freedom suit. Anderson was also a spiritual advisor to Harriet and her husband, Dred Scott.\nAfter Meecham died in 1854, Anderson ran the Freedom School for African American children. With Galusha Anderson, a white Baptist minister, he lobbied the St. Louis school system for education for black children over a ten-year period. Anderson served on a board of education established to provide schooling for black students. It was the first and only board of its kind in the city. The ten members included three black ministers, two black businessmen,  and three whites. A subscription school opened in 1856 that charged one dollar per pupil. By 1864, four public schools were established and there were also four subscription schools that operated out of the basements of black churches. This was accomplished during a period when the prevailing belief among pro-slavery and some anti-slavery factions that African Americans should not be educated. The St. Louis Board of Education petitioned the Legislature to enact laws to provide schools for African American children. A law was enacted in 1866 to provide funding for four or five public schools for $500 (equivalent to $10,052 in 2024).\n\n\nFraternal life\nHe and Henry Mcghee Alexander became involved in Prince Hall Freemasonry during a trip to Boston and was then a member of a local Masonic lodge in St. Louis. In the early 1860s, he co-founded the McGhee Lodge (H. McGee Lodge) in St. Louis. It was the first Prince Hall Masonic organization established west of the Mississippi River.\n\n\nPersonal life\nAnderson met Nancy Barton in Alton, and was married to her on November 9, 1838, in Madison, Illinois. They had five children: Mandy J., Simon P., May E., Matilda, and Martha Anderson. His son, Simon Peter Anderson was also a pastor of the Central Baptist Church, serving from 1868 to 1880 and 1885–1889.\n\nHe died of poisoning after a druggist accidentally made medicine for him from the root of a plant, rather than the leaf. He died on May 20, 1863, and was buried in the Bellefontaine Cemetery next to John Berry Meachum. A historical marker at the cemetery memorializes his efforts to provide education for African Americans and in recognition for his efforts as a minister and a community leader.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nWright, John Aaron (2002).

    "text": "Ethel (Nicholson) Browne Harvey (December 14, 1885 in Baltimore, Maryland – September 2, 1965 in Falmouth, Massachusetts) was an American embryologist, known for her critical findings about cell division, using the embryology of sea urchins, and for early work studying embryonic cell cleavage.\n\n\nBiography and education\nEthel Nicholson Browne was born December 14, 1885, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Bennett Barnard Browne and Jennifer Nicholson Browne.  She was one of five children; three of her siblings became doctors, including two of her sisters (Jennie Nicholson Browne and Mary Nicholson Browne), and one of her brothers became a metallurgist.\nBrowne's parents sent their three daughters to the Bryn Mawr School, which was the first solely preparatory girls' school in the United States.  Browne graduated there in 1902, and then attended Goucher College (then known as the Woman's College of Baltimore).  After graduating with her B.A. in 1906, she then studied zoology at Columbia University, earning an MA in 1907 and a Ph.D. in 1913 under Thomas Hunt Morgan and Edmund Beecher Wilson.\nIn 1915, she married fellow scientist, E. Newton Harvey, a physiologist known for work on bioluminescence. Browne, adopting her husband's surname, had two children with him; Edmund Newton Harvey, Jr. (born 1916, later a chemist) and Richard Bennet Harvey (born 1922, later a physician).  Although working only part-time for the next several years, she nevertheless continued her work, making numerous important contributions.\nEthel Browne Harvey died of peritonitis from appendicitis in 1965.\n\n\nCareer and research\nAt Columbia she worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan and Edmund Beecher Wilson.  Her doctoral thesis in 1913 was on the male germ cells of genus Notonecta, an aquatic insect, leading her to further work focusing on cellular mechanisms in inheritance and development.  She was supported during this time by several fellowships aimed at assisting women in science, including a Sarah Berliner Research Fellowship from the Society for the Promotion of University Education for Women.\nDuring her graduate studies at Columbia, Browne \"demonstrated that transplanting the hypostome from one hydra into another hydra would induce a secondary axis in the host hydra.\" This work, done in 1909, preceded experiments in 1924 by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold, that are credited with discovering the \"organizer\" — this work was the basis of a Nobel Prize given to Spemann.  Howard M. Lenhoff has argued that Ethel Browne should have shared in Spemann's Nobel Prize, because she did the experiment first; she understood its significance; and she had, in fact, sent her paper to Spemann, who had underlined the portion of the paper that discussed the significance of her work.\nIn the 1930s, she demonstrated a method of parthenogenetic cleavage, inducing unfertilized sea urchin eggs to cleave and ultimately to hatch. Browne used centrifugal force to remove the nuclei of these eggs. This work received popular attention as \"creation of life without parents\". Browne's experiments were especially noteworthy in that she demonstrated that chromosomes were not necessary to create life. Her experiments showed that cytoplasm was capable of developing life without the need for the nucleus. She termed this method of creating life as \"parthenogenic merogony\" in which \"a portion of the egg without the nucleus is fertilized\". In 1950, Ethel Browne Harvey was elected to be the second woman on the Marine Biological Laboratory board of trustees.\nBrowne worked for many years at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  She taught at a variety of institutions, including the Bennett School for Girls in Millbrook, New York, the Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts; Washington Square College at NYU.  She conducted scientific research in a variety of positions including Princeton University and Cornell Medical College.  She was associated with the American Women's Table in Naples, an organization established by Ida Henrietta Hyde and other women scientists.\n\n\nBibliography\nSelected significant publications\nThe American Arbacia and Other Sea Urchins (1956)\n\"A Study of the Male Germ Cells in Notonecta\", Journal of Experimental Zoology, Jan. 1913\n\"A Review of the Chromosome Numbers in the Metazoa\", Journal of Morphology , Dec. 1916 and June 1920\n\"Parthenogenetic Merogony or Cleavage Without Nuclei in Arbacia puntulata \", Biological Bulletin, Aug. 1936\n\"Fertilization\", Encyclopædia Britannica , 1946 and 1961.\nMany publications in The Biological Bulletin from 1919 to 1962\n\n\nAwards\n1956 - Honorary D.Sc. from Goucher College\nFellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\nFellow, L'Institut International d'Embryologie in Utrecht\nFellow, New York Academy of Sciences\nElected as trustee of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading and research\nDonna J.

She joined the faculty of Dramatic Arts at Brock University from a professional career as an actor, director, dramaturg and coach, working in theatre, opera and film and television. For 13 years she taught part-time at Brock and officially became full-time in 2006, teaching acting, directing and voice. Her vocal work includes directing all the voices for the last 76 episodes of Sailor Moon that were dubbed into English. She has directed Ring Round the Moon, Marat/Sade, A Little Night Music, Phedre, Orpheus Descending, and The Blue Room for mainstage DART productions. She has worked professionally with Opera In Concert, Toronto Operetta Theatre and Tapestry New Opera. Reh was founding co-director of Script Lab, developing plays, musicals and film scripts. She was artistic director of the Gryphon Theatre. For many years Reh was acting coach and production manager to the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus.

Reh was an Ontario councillor for the Canadian Actors' Equity Association and secretary/treasurer of the executive through 2012. In the course of nine years at Brock she directed seven main stage.\n\n\nEarly life\nReh began acting at a young age with the Emerson Players, a community theatre company based out of the unitarian church which she participated in with her parents in New York. She attended the University of Berkeley as a French major but soon transitioned to Dramatic Arts major after her first audition. In her studies at Berkeley, it was required for her to take directing courses for her masters, which then lead her to the Scholar Director PHD program. She dropped out of the PHD program so that she could pursue acting in a small theatre company in California. The company did not have enough directors, so she volunteered. She started directing seriously in the early 1980s, at a time when a movement of women playwrights and directors was beginning.\n\n\nSelected Theatre Work: Acting\nRichard III: Queen Margaret/Edward IV.

    "text": "The Inishtrahull was a passenger cargo vessel that sank off the coast of Kilkee, County Clare between 28 and 29 December 1894. After leaving Glasgow, Scotland with a consignment of coal for Limerick city on 27 December 1894, the ship ran into difficulty somewhere near Kilkee and foundered due to the heavy gales reported along the west coast of Ireland in late December of that year. This was confirmed on 3 January 1895 when a section of a port bow marked \"Glasgow\" was picked up near Kilkee.\n\n\nEarly years\nBuilt in 1885, the ship was a steel-made, steam-powered vessel used for both cargo and passenger services. At the time of launch the vessel was fitted with all modern appliances, including accommodation for 40 first-class passengers and room to carry cattle on the main deck and lower decks. In October 1892, while on a voyage from Glasgow to Cork with about 250 tons of goods, the ship developed a heavy list after meeting heavy storms and arrived in Cork harbour nearly keeling over.\n\n\nCollision with the Maggie\nOn 29 December 1891, the Inishtrahull was involved in a collision with an Irish sailing vessel from Dublin named the Maggie. The collision occurred in the Irish Sea, just off the Kish Bank. It was found in an investigation afterwards that the fault laid squarely in the hands of the second officer of the Inishtrahull, who left the bridge without a competent officer in charge (a carpenter was left alone on the bridge). After the collision the second officer was suspended from duty for two years. As all the crew had been evacuated and the vessel was taking on water, the Maggie was believed to have sunk somewhere around the Kish Lighthouse around 52°41.4′N 09°40.6′W.\n\n\nSinking\nLeaving Glasgow Port on the morning of 28 December 1894, the ship was scheduled to arrive in Limerick on 30 December. After being missing for six days it was assumed that due to the storms blowing on the 28th, the ship had taken shelter and wasn't in a position to telegraph its whereabouts. On 3 January 1895, however, a section of a port bow from a ship with a brass plate marked \"Glasgow\" was picked up by the Kilkee coastguards near the town and reported to the Receiver of Wrecks in Limerick. This was not proven to be from the missing ship until 8 January when The Clyde Shipping Company abandoned the search for the ship and released the names of those thought to be aboard, coming to 26 including the captain, Thomas Whip.\n\n\nSee also\nEdmond, \"coffin ship\" that sank in a storm in Kilkee Bay in 1850\nFulmar, coal ship from Scotland to Limerick, sank in a gale up the coast from Kilkee in 1886\nList of maritime disasters\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Bumble is a mobile app for online dating and social networking. It was founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd and was launched in December 2014. Profiles of potential matches are displayed to users, who can \"swipe left\" to reject a candidate or \"swipe right\" to indicate interest; if two users both indicate interest in each other, communication can begin. Bumble is operated by Bumble Inc., which also owns Badoo.\nThe app has over 2.8 million paying users, and, as of June 2024, Bumble was the most downloaded dating application in the United States with 735,000 downloads. \n\n\nHistory\nThe Bumble app was founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd. It was launched in December 2014, owned by Wolfe Herd and European dating app Badoo, including infrastructure from Badoo's London headquarters. Badoo founder and CEO Andrey Andreev contacted Wolfe Herd in 2014 about forming a partnership.\nIn August 2015, Wolfe Herd stated that within the app's first eight months, it saw 5 million unique conversations initiated.\nIn March 2017, Bumble had more than 800 million matches and 10 billion swipes per month and was the second most popular Lifestyle app in the Apple App Store.\nIn November 2019, when private equity firm Blackstone Inc. purchased a majority stake in Bumble's parent company MagicLab, Bumble was valued at $3 billion.\nBadoo and Bumble rolled under a parent company named MagicLab, which was renamed Bumble Inc. after the purchase from Blackstone. By July 2020, Bumble had been downloaded over 100 million times.\nBumble offers free courses from Bloom, an online provider of support for sexual assault survivors.\nIn January 2025, founder Whitney Wolfe Herd announced that she would be returning as Bumble Inc.'s CEO in March 2025.\n\n\nOperation\n\n\nMatching users\nUsers swipe right to \"like\" a potential match and left to reject them. In matches between a man and a woman, the woman must initiate the conversation with their match or the matches disappear within 24 hours unless the woman has set an opening question, to which the man can respond. In a same-sex match, either person can reach out first or set an opening question.\nUsers can sort conversations, make calls, and send photo messages.\nThrough BFF mode, introduced in March 2016, users can match with platonic friends of the same sex, in the same way as matching for dates.\nIf a user is messaged after matching with a potential partner and does not respond within 24 hours, the match disappears; this requirement was implemented in April 2016 to combat ghosting. Before the update, men were allowed unlimited time to respond to a message from women. An update was also launched for same-sex matches, with either party allowed to initiate and the other having to respond within 24 hours.\nOver time, the app introduced a wider range of gender identity options for users to identify as genderqueer or transgender.\nIn August 2024, 61% of Bumble users were men and 37% of users were female. In April 2018, 85% of users were \"looking for marriage or a boyfriend/girlfriend\", while 4% of men and under 1% of women were \"looking for a hookup\" and 25% of users had gone on a first date with someone they found on the app within the previous month.\nBumble is currently developing a chatbot to act as a wingman and help users with flirting.\n\n\nContent moderation\nStarting in October 2016, the app banned mirror selfies, obscured faces, and photos of users in underwear among others.\nIn August 2017, Bumble partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to remove users who display hate speech or symbols in their profiles.\nIn March 2018, Bumble banned photos of users posing with guns following the Parkland high school shooting.\nIn 2023, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that many content moderators working for Bumble suffered from mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD associated with their work, with concerns about professional mental health support, productivity targets, and understaffing.\nFake profiles and photos using artificial intelligence are prohibited and may be reported. In April 2019, Bumble launched Private Detector, an image classifier that uses artificial intelligence to automatically detect and blur nude images. It allows users to decide if they want to view, block or report the unsolicited image. Bumble made the tool open source in October 2022. In February 2024, Bumble introduced Deception Detector, a machine learning model that detects fake user profiles. Of those accounts identified as spam/scam profiles, Bumble Inc.’s testing showed that Deception Detector was able to block up to 95% these accounts automatically. That March, Bumble collaborated with Phaedra Parks, Parvati Shallow and Peter Weber of the Peacock reality show The Traitors to launch the feature.\n\n\nUser verification\nOriginally, Bumble users were required to log in via Facebook when signing up. In April 2018, Bumble added an option to sign up using only a phone number, following the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal. For users who sign up with Facebook, information from their account is used to build a profile with photos and basic information, including the user's college and job.\nBumble launched a photo verification tool in September 2016 to ensure that users of the app were the same people in their profile pictures. To be verified, users are asked to submit a selfie of them performing a specific pose; the picture is reviewed by a real person who ensures the user is the person in the profile pictures. Bumble was the first dating app to include photo verification in the US. In 2025, the app also included an option to become ID-verified.\n\n\nFilters\nIn 2020, Bumble announced a temporary feature that allowed users to expand their distance filters to match with anyone in the same country. Previously, the app only allowed people to connect within a 100-mile (160 km) range. Daters could also add a \"virtual dating\" badge to their profile to indicate that they are willing to date over video calls.\nOn January 15, 2021, Bumble temporarily suspended the option to filter matches by political preference to \"prevent misuse\". The move came after several women allegedly used Bumble to gather information from people involved in the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and then forwarded that information to the FBI. Bumble was criticized by many of its users for being perceived to \"protect terrorists\" by suspending the filter. Bumble announced that it would be reinstating the option to filter by political preferences later that day.\n\n\nPaid features\nIn August 2016, Bumble introduced paid features including Beeline, a list of users who have liked the user; Rematch, which keeps expired matches in a user's queue for 24 additional hours; and Extend, which allows users unlimited 24-hour extensions for matches.\n\n\nOther features\nIn June 2016, the app began allowing users to connect their Spotify accounts to their Bumble profiles to show their music interests.\nIn 2017, the company launched a career networking app, Bumble Bizz. It also uses a woman-first interface.\nIn September 2018, a \"snooze\" feature was added to allow users to pause activity and avoid using the app for some time.\nIn June 2019, Bumble introduced in-app voice and video calls. Bumble's vice president of strategy reported \"an 84 percent increase in video calls that were placed between users\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnother feature allows women to share details about their dates, including: who they’re meeting, and the time and location of the meeting, with a contact for safety reasons.\n\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities\nIn June 2021, Stripe software engineer Robert Heaton found a security vulnerability in Bumble that allows an attacker to obtain the exact location of its users via trilateration. Bumble fixed the vulnerability three days later and paid Heaton a bug bounty of $2,000.\nIn August 2024, researchers at KU Leuven in Belgium found that several dating apps, including Bumble, had vulnerabilities that would allow bad actors to obtain users' locations via trilateration.\n\n\nAdvocacy\n\n\nCyberflashing\nBumble was the first dating app to explicitly moderate for unsolicited nude images, known as cyberflashing. In 2019, the app launched Private Detector, a feature that uses artificial intelligence to automatically detect and blur nude images. In October 2022, Bumble released an open-source version of Private Detector model.\nIn 2019, Bumble pushed for passage of House Bill 2789 in Texas, a law that makes electronic transmission of sexually explicit material a punishable offense, after users of Bumble complained about receiving unsolicited nude images. Bumble influenced Virginia to pass Senate Bill 493, which prescribes civil penalties for an adult who knowingly sends another adult sexually explicit images without their consent in April 2022.\nBumble launched the #CyberFlashingIsFlashing ad campaign in the UK to support the Online Safety Act 2023 , which was passed in March 2022.\nIn 2024, Bumble backed the CONSENT Act, a federal bill which \"aims to provide protection for recipients of sexually explicit images, including images manipulated by artificial intelligence or machine learning.\"\n\n\nReproductive rights\nBumble led an amicus brief in both Zurawski v. State of Texas (2023) and Moyle v. United States (2024), arguing in favor of reproductive rights.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nFeminist label\nBumble has been described as a \"feminist Tinder\". Its founder has confirmed this identity, calling the app \"100 percent feminist,\" although she has attempted to distance the app from Tinder in interviews. Wolfe Herd shared in an interview with Vanity Fair the concept behind the app: \"If you look at where we are in the current heteronormative rules surrounding dating, the unwritten rule puts the woman a peg under the man—the man feels the pressure to go first in a conversation, and the woman feels pressure to sit on her hands... If we can take some of the pressure off the man and put some of that encouragement in the woman's lap, I think we are taking a step in the right direction, especially in terms of really being true to feminism. I think we are the first feminist or first attempt at a feminist dating app.\"\nIn June 2016, Bumble blocked a user for sexist behavior after he had an outburst at a female user who asked him what he did for a living.\nIn August 2017, the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer encouraged its readers to harass Bumble's staff to protest the company's support of women's empowerment.\nIn August 2018, Bumble launched the Bumble Fund to support women-led startups. Following the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh, Bumble ran the “Believe Women” ad campaign and donated to RAINN.\nBumble launched a three-year partnership with the National Domestic Violence Hotline in 2020.\nIn September 2021, Bumble set up a relief fund for those affected by the Texas Heartbeat Act.\nIn response to the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, Bumble made additional donations to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood.\nIn February 2023, writer Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz wrote that \"it often seems like that feminist twist is more marketing fodder than meaningful change to how our apps run our love lives.\"\n\nIn a 2025 interview with The New York Times, Wolfe Herd stated that she perceived Bumble as a “love company”: \"I think we’re just back to connection and we’re back to relationships. I’m staying out of all the fodder and all the ickiness of the world and I just want to focus on love. I genuinely just want to drive a love company. That might sound cheesy and ridiculous, but that’s where I’m at.\"\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn March 2018, Match Group sued Bumble arguing that it was guilty of patent infringement and of stealing trade secrets from Tinder. In June 2020, an undisclosed settlement was reached between Match Group and Bumble to settle all litigations.\nIn 2020, Bumble agreed to pay $22.5 million in a settlement over plaintiffs' claims that the company's auto-renewal processes were unfair and that it charged consumers without their consent.\n\n\nAnti-celibacy advertising\nIn May 2024, Bumble faced major backlash after launching a marketing campaign that entailed putting up billboards with captions such as: \"You know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer\". Users accused the campaign of shaming women who were not sexually active. Bumble responded with a public apology, wherein the company said it would remove the ads and donate to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n\n\nSee also\n\nComparison of online dating services\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nBusiness data for Bumble Inc.:",

Then the f(y) factor of the spatial dimension becomes the effect of time that in words of Einstein \"curves space\". How it curves space will define one or other solution to a space-time world. For that reason, different models of space-time use warped geometries.\nMany basic solutions of the Einstein field equations are warped geometries, for example, the Schwarzschild solution and the Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker models.\nAlso, warped geometries are the key building block of Randall–Sundrum models in string theory.\n\n\nSee also\nMetric tensor\nExact solutions in general relativity\nPoincaré half-plane model\n\n\nReferences",

Where, during the election, 300 citizens of North Ossetia attempted to vote, mostly in favor of Bibilov, compared to the village's population of just 178 of which only 65 claimed to have voted.\nIkoev would be elected to the Parliament of South Ossetia during the 2019 election, as an independent, however, affiliated himself with Bibilov, stating he would follow United Ossetia's \"course\" and \"support\" the party, while not officially joining. Ikoev stated that he ran as an independent to promote bi-partisanship and that he would support \"any party\" and \"any faction\" if it was in the best interest of the South Ossetian people and his constituents.\nFollowing the sacking of Uruzmag Dzhagayev as Prosecutor General of South Ossetia due to his role in the Murder of Inal Djabiev, Bibilov chose Sochi based Vitaly Savchenko as his replacement. However, in a rare instance of opposition, Parliament rejected Savchenko's nomination to the post due to his lack of South Ossetian citizenship. Ikoev, alongside vice-speaker Peter Gasssiev, dramatically walked out of parliament and abstained, which allowed the rejection vote to narrowly pass.\nIn December 2022 Ikoev was on the committee that implemented the integration of South Ossetia's tariffs to be in accordance with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), despite not officially being a member of the EEU, by implementing its tariff rates the South Ossetian government hopes to open up trade to other countries, and reduce its dependence on Russia, which accounts for 95% of all imports into South Ossetia.\nIn November 2023, Ikoev, alongside Zaza Driaev, went on a state visit to North Ossetia to meet with their parliament over implementing matching laws on \"Physical Culture and Sports\" in both North and South Ossetia.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

Sangay is bullied in school, partially for her father's profession. Sangay is having an affair with a married man named Passa (Singye) whose occupation as a butcher means his status in the society is very low. Passa is initially kind to Sangay, but he eventually starts to berate her when she hesitates to run away to the capital city, Thimphu, with him. Sangay is withdrawn and depressed, she is fed up with phalli, school and life. She does not study well and is four years behind her peers. The psychologist calls Sangay's father Atsara to school and tells him to separate Sangay and her lover. Atsara quarrels with Passa and almost kills him. Sangay wants to leave, but he can't mentally. The butcher then rapes Sangay during their meeting. Then she endures humiliation from him for a long time and then kills him with a board.  Arriving home, when her father was not at home, she smashes all the wooden phalli and then kills herself. It can be seen that the phalli are dripping with blood.\n\n\nRelease and reception\nThe film was shown in several international film festivals. Tashi Gyeltshen decided not to release the film in Bhutan after Bhutan's censor board cut 12 minutes of the film. The film was picked up by Asian Shadows for international distribution.\n\n\nCritical reception\nVariety critic Richard Kuipers said that \"[t]hough a tad slow at times, \"Phallus\" leaves a lasting impression\". He also praised Tshering Euden's performance as the lead character. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Clarence Tsui described the film as a \"taut and gripping debut.\" Davide Abbatescianni of Cineuropa criticized the performance of the male leads, character development and the rhythm of the narration but praised the sound design and \"visual rigour\" of the film. Alexander Knoth of Asian Movie Pulse praises the film as a \"courageous feature mastering a gritty atmosphere\" and the crew, writing \"[t]he whole crew did an amazing job capturing the feeling of the environment and turning it into a metaphor for the cruel interpersonal proceedings that take place.\" In his review of the film for Eastern Kicks, Andrew Heskins gave it three out of five stars, calling it \"[a]chingly beautiful but equally as slow\".\n\n\nAccolades\nThe film won the FIPRESCI award at the 23rd Busan International Film Festival and was nominated for the 2019 Best International Feature Film in Edinburgh International Film Festival.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Red Phallus at IMDb\nThe Red Phallus on Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Red Phallus on Chinese Shadows",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9267447",
    "text": "The Gittins index is a measure of the reward that can be achieved through a given stochastic process with certain properties, namely: the process has an ultimate termination state and evolves with an option, at each intermediate state, of terminating. Upon terminating at a given state, the reward achieved is the sum of the probabilistic expected rewards associated with every state from the actual terminating state to the ultimate terminal state, inclusive. The index is a real scalar.\n\n\nTerminology\nTo illustrate the theory we can take two examples from a developing sector, such as from electricity generating technologies: wind power and wave power. If we are presented with the two technologies when they are both proposed as ideas we cannot say which will be better in the long run as we have no data, as yet, to base our judgments on. It would be easy to say that wave power would be too problematic to develop as it seems easier to put up many wind turbines than to make the long floating generators, tow them out to sea and lay the cables necessary.\nIf we were to make a judgment call at that early time in development we could be condemning one technology to being put on the shelf and the other would be developed and put into operation. If we develop both technologies we would be able to make a judgment call on each by comparing the progress of each technology at a set time interval such as every three months. The decisions we make about investment in the next stage would be based on those results.\nIn a paper in 1979 called Bandit Processes and Dynamic Allocation Indices John C. Gittins suggests a solution for problems such as this. He takes the two basic functions of a \"scheduling Problem\" and a \"multi-armed bandit\" problem and shows how these problems can be solved using Dynamic allocation indices. He first takes the \"Scheduling Problem\" and reduces it to a machine which has to perform jobs and has a set time period, every hour or day for example, to finish each job in. The machine is given a reward value, based on finishing or not within the time period, and a probability value of whether it will finish or not for each job is calculated. The problem is \"to decide which job to process next at each stage so as to maximize the total expected reward.\" He then moves on to the \"Multi–armed bandit problem\" where each pull on a \"one armed bandit\" lever is allocated a reward function for a successful pull, and a zero reward for an unsuccessful pull. The sequence of successes forms a Bernoulli process and has an unknown probability of success. There are multiple \"bandits\" and the distribution of successful pulls is calculated and different for each machine. Gittins states that the problem here is \"to decide which arm to pull next at each stage so as to maximize the total expected reward from an infinite sequence of pulls.\"\nGittins says that \"Both the problems described above involve a sequence of decisions, each of which is based on more information than its predecessors, and these both problems may be tackled by dynamic allocation indices.\"\n\n\nDefinition\nIn applied mathematics, the \"Gittins index\" is a real scalar value associated to the state of a stochastic process with a reward function and with a probability of termination. It is a measure of the reward that can be achieved by the process evolving from that state on, under the probability that it will be terminated in future.  The \"index policy\" induced by the Gittins index, consisting of choosing at any time the stochastic process with the currently highest Gittins index, is the solution of some stopping problems such as the one of dynamic allocation, where a decision-maker has to maximize the total reward by distributing a limited amount of effort to a number of competing projects, each returning a stochastic reward.  If the projects are independent from each other and only one project at a time may evolve, the problem is called multi-armed bandit (one type of Stochastic scheduling problems) and the Gittins index policy is optimal.  If multiple projects can evolve, the problem is called Restless bandit and the Gittins index policy is a known good heuristic but no optimal solution exists in general.  In fact, in general this problem is NP-complete and it is generally accepted that no feasible solution can be found.\n\n\nHistory\nQuestions about the optimal stopping policies in the context of clinical trials have been open from the 1940s and in the 1960s a few authors analyzed simple models leading to optimal index policies, but it was only in the 1970s that Gittins and his collaborators demonstrated in a Markovian framework that the optimal solution of the general case is an index policy whose \"dynamic allocation index\" is computable in principle for every state of each project as a function of the single project's dynamics. In parallel to Gittins, Martin Weitzman established the same result in the economics literature.\nSoon after the seminal paper of Gittins, Peter Whittle\ndemonstrated that the index emerges as a Lagrange multiplier from a dynamic programming formulation of the problem called retirement process and conjectured that the same index would be a good heuristic in a more general setup named Restless bandit.  The question of how to actually calculate the index for Markov chains was first addressed by Varaiya and his collaborators with an algorithm that computes the indexes\nfrom the largest first down to the smallest and by Chen and Katehakis who showed that standard LP could be used to calculate the index of a state without requiring its calculation for all states with higher index values.\nLCM Kallenberg   provided a parametric LP implementation to compute the indices for all states of a Markov chain.   Further, Katehakis and Veinott demonstrated that the index is the expected reward of a Markov decision process constructed over the Markov chain and known as Restart in State and can be calculated exactly by solving that problem with the policy iteration algorithm, or approximately with the value iteration algorithm. This approach also has the advantage of calculating the index for one specific state without having to calculate all the greater indexes and it is valid under more general state space conditions. A faster algorithm for the calculation of all indices was obtained in 2004 by Sonin as a consequence of his elimination algorithm for the optimal stopping of a Markov chain. In this algorithm the termination probability of the process may depend on the current state rather than being a fixed factor. A faster algorithm was proposed in 2007 by Niño-Mora  by exploiting the structure of a parametric simplex to reduce the computational effort of the pivot steps and thereby achieving the same complexity as the Gaussian elimination algorithm. Cowan, W. and Katehakis (2014), provide a solution to the problem, with potentially non-Markovian, uncountable state space reward processes, under frameworks in which, either the discount factors may be non-uniform and vary over time, or the periods of activation of each bandit may be not be fixed or uniform, subject instead to a possibly stochastic duration of activation before a change to a different bandit is allowed. The solution is based on generalized restart-in-state indices.\n\n\nMathematical definition\n\n\nDynamic allocation index\nThe classical definition by Gittins et al. is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n

The mean completion time of jobs under a Gittins index schedule can be determined using the SOAP approach. Note that the dynamics of the queue are intrinsically Markovian, and stochasticity is due to the arrival and service processes. This is in contrast to most of the works in the learning literature, where stochasticity is explicitly accounted through a noise term.\n\n\nFractional problems\nWhile conventional Gittins indices induce a policy to optimize the accrual of a reward, a common problem setting consists of optimizing the ratio of accrued rewards. For example, this is a case for systems to maximize bandwidth, consisting of data over time, or minimize power consumption, consisting of energy over time.\nThis class of problems is different from the optimization of a semi-Markov reward process, because the latter one might select states with a disproportionate sojourn time just for accruing a higher reward. Instead, it corresponds to the class of linear-fractional markov reward optimization problem.\nHowever, a detrimental aspect of such ratio optimizations is that, once the achieved ratio in some state is high, the optimization might select states leading to a low ratio because they bear a high probability of termination, so that the process is likely to terminate before the ratio drops significantly. A problem setting to prevent such early terminations consists of defining the optimization as maximization of the future ratio seen by each state. An indexation is conjectured to exist for this problem, be computable as simple variation on existing restart-in-state or state elimination algorithms and evaluated to work well in practice.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nScully, Ziv and Harchol-Balter, Mor and Scheller-Wolf, Alan (2018). \"SOAP: One Clean Analysis of All Age-Based Scheduling Policies\".

    "summary": "The Gittins index is a measure of the reward that can be achieved through a given stochastic process with certain properties, namely: the process has an ultimate termination state and evolves with an option, at each intermediate state, of terminating. Upon terminating at a given state, the reward achieved is the sum of the probabilistic expected rewards associated with every state from the actual terminating state to the ultimate terminal state, inclusive. The index is a real scalar.",

    "text": "Gao Huan (simplified Chinese: 高欢; traditional Chinese: 高歡; pinyin: Gāo Huān) (496 – 13 February 547), Xianbei nickname Heliuhun (賀六渾), formally Prince Xianwu of Qi (齊獻武王), later further formally honored by Northern Qi initially as Emperor Xianwu (獻武皇帝), then as Emperor Shenwu (神武皇帝) with the temple name Gaozu (高祖), was the paramount general and a minister of the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty and its branch successor state Eastern Wei dynasty. Although he was an ethnic Han, Gao was deeply influenced by Xianbei culture and was often considered more Xianbei than Han by his contemporaries. During his career, he and his family became firmly in control of the Eastern Wei court. Eventually, in 550, his son Gao Yang forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, establishing the Gao clan as the imperial house of a new Northern Qi dynasty.\n\n\nBackground\nGao Huan was born in 496, at Northern Wei's northern garrison town Huaishuo (懷朔鎮, near Guyang in modern Baotou, Inner Mongolia).  He was ethnically Han, but his family, having resided at Huaishuo ever since his grandfather Gao Mi (高謐) was exiled there for faults while serving as a Northern Wei official, had largely been acculturated in the Xianbei ways. (Gao Huan's nickname Heliuhun was a Xianbei name.)  His father was Gao Shusheng (高樹生), and his mother was Han Qiji (韩期姬), Gao Shusheng's wife, died soon after his birth, and he was raised at the house of his older sister Gao Loujin (高娄斤) with her husband, Wei Jing (尉景).  In his young days, his family was poor, and he became a servant at the old Northern Wei capital Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi).  While serving at Pingcheng, Lou Zhaojun an ethnic Xianbei, and the daughter of a wealthy house, saw him and was impressed with his appearance and behavior, and she married him despite her parents' opposition. It was only after this marriage that Gao had sufficient money to buy a horse, and he became a courier for the Pingcheng defense headquarters, often delivering official mail to and from the capital Luoyang.\nIn 519, Gao happened to be at Luoyang when a mob of soldiers, angry over the minister Zhang Yi (張彝)'s new policy of excluding soldiers from civil service, sieged Zhang's house and then killed him. The regent Empress Dowager Hu (Emperor Xiaoming's mother) did not dare to punish them, but largely pardoned them except for eight leaders.  Gao was unimpressed by Empress Dowager Hu's actions and believed that Northern Wei was on the verge of collapse.  When he returned to Pingcheng, he sold his properties and used the funds to gather associates around him, stating that if disturbances occurred, the property might not be his any more anyway.  His associates around this time included people from diverse ethnic backgrounds such as Xianbei, Chinese and Xiongnu, in addition to his brother-in-law Wei Jing, Sima Ziru (司馬子如), Liu Gui (劉貴), Jia Xianzhi (賈顯智), Sun Teng (孫騰), Hou Jing (侯景), and Cai Jun (蔡儁).  Together they were often in the countryside, and when they saw injustices, they would seek to correct them.\nIn 525, in the midst of the Rebellion of the Six Frontier Towns (Chinese: 六镇之乱) against Northern Wei's rule, Gao and his associates joined one of the major Xianbei and Turkic rebel leaders, Du Luozhou (杜洛周).  However, Gao soon became unimpressed with Du's behavior, and he escaped from Du's army.  He then joined another rebel leader, Ge Rong, but eventually went to the Northern Wei general and Xiongnu tribal leader Erzhu Rong.  By this time, Liu Gui, a Xiongnu descendant and close friend of Gao Huan was already serving under Erzhu, and he often praised Gao's talent, but when Erzhu met Gao, he was not initially impressed as Gao was poor, and looked haggard and unconfident.  However, when Gao was able to tame a very wild horse, Erzhu became impressed, and they became closer and closer, with Gao pointing out that with the empire in disarray, it would be a good opportunity for Erzhu to seize power.\n\n\nEthnic identity\nGao Huan was descended from a Han Chinese family, at least paternally. However, at the same time he maintained a very public culturally Xianbei appearance. He claimed the Bohai Chinese Gao clan (渤海高氏) as his ancestors and Bohai his ancestral land, but had become de-Sinicized. It was recorded that he would make speech to his soldiers only in the Xianbei language instead of Chinese, unless one of his most fiercest generals - Gao Aocao was at the scene, he would then switch his use of language from Xianbei to Chinese, Gao Aocao was one of the few ethnic Chinese whom had earned respect from Gao Huan. Gao Huan was also reported as having frequently said to his soldiers in Xianbei language that the native  Chinese \"are your slaves,\" \"they bring you supplies and clothing\", while simultaneously telling the native Chinese that the Xianbei \"are your clients\" and \"they fight for you and enable you to have peace and order\". He had become Xianbeified as his clan had lived in Xianbei cultural region for some time after being relocated from what is now modern Hebei (Bohai).  The Eastern Wei enfeoffed the land of Bohai to Gao Huan, and he became \"Prince of Bohai\" or \"King of Bohai\". Before Gao's death, he sang the \"Song of the Chile\" (敕勒歌; considered by many scholars as a military song for all Xianbeified soldiers) together with his trusted Chile general Hulü Jin in front of most of his major Xianbei, as well as Xianbeified Xiongnu, Chile and Chinese generals, and wept bitterly. He also pointed out that his powerful Chinese general Hou Jing was capricious, cunning and could not be trusted, who will rebel after his death, he then appointed several Xianbei and Chile generals whom he considered to be both upright and talented to be on guard of Hou Jing. In the end Hou did rebel against Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng, but the rebellion was successfully put down by Eastern Wei's senior general Murong Shaozong.\n\n\nUnder the Erzhus\nErzhu Rong was impressed with Gao Huan's talents, and he made Gao one of his military commanders.  In 528, Emperor Xiaoming, displeased at the hold on power that Empress Dowager Hu's lover Zheng Yan (鄭儼) and Zheng's associate Xu Ge (徐紇) had, entered into a conspiracy with Erzhu to have Erzhu advance on the capital to force Empress Dowager Hu to kill Zheng and Xu.  Erzhu therefore began to march on the capital, and he made Gao his forward commander.  On the way, however, Emperor Xiaoming ordered him to stop, but the news of the conspiracy still leaked, and Empress Dowager Hu poisoned Emperor Xiaoming to death and declared his distant toddler nephew Yuan Zhao emperor.\nErzhu refused to recognize Yuan Zhao as emperor, and he continued his march on Luoyang, declaring Yuan Ziyou the Prince of Changle emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhuang).  Luoyang's defenses collapsed, and Erzhu arrested and threw Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao into the Yellow River to drown.  Believing that the imperial officials would never obey him, he massacred a large number of them (including Emperor Xiaozhuang's brothers), and Emperor Xiaozhuang, fearing what would come next, offered to yield the throne to Erzhu.  Gao suggested that Erzhu accept the offer, but Erzhu hesitated and ultimately ruled against it.  His general Heba Yue, who opposed Erzhu's taking of the throne, suggested Erzhu that Gao should be executed to show his good faith, but Erzhu ruled against it.  In fact, for Gao's contributions to the campaign, Emperor Xiaozhuang created him the Count of Tongdi.\nErzhu subsequently carried out a number of campaigns against agrarian rebels to try to reunify the empire.  Gao thereafter participated in the campaigns against Ge Rong and Xing Gao, as well as the rebel general Yang Kan, serving with distinction.  On one occasion, when Erzhu Rong was asking his commanders for opinions on who could succeed him as the commanding general of the army if he were no longer there, most  opined that Erzhu Zhao could, but Erzhu Rong himself opined that Gao Huan was the only one capable of doing so, and he warned Erzhu Zhao, \"You are no match for Gao Huan, and one day he will surely pierce through your nose.\"  Erzhu Rong thereafter made Gao the governor of Jin Province (晉州, roughly modern Linfen, Shanxi), and while governor, Gao gathered much wealth, intending for use later.\nIn 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang, believing that Erzhu would eventually seize the throne, ambushed and killed him in the palace.  The Erzhus, led by Erzhu Zhao and Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Shilong, fought against Emperor Xiaozhuang, and Erzhu Zhao was thereafter marching on Luoyang, declaring Erzhu Rong's wife the Princess Beixiang's nephew Yuan Ye emperor.  Erzhu Zhao summoned Gao to aid him, but Gao declined, using the excuse that he needed to fight against local agrarian rebels.  Erzhu Zhao was displeased, but for the time being did not act against Gao.  Later in the year, Erzhu Zhao captured Luoyang and arrested Emperor Xiaozhuang, delivering Emperor Xiaozhuang to his headquarters at Jinyang (晉陽, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).  Gao wrote a letter to Erzhu Zhao urging him not to harm the emperor, but Erzhu Zhao refused to answer, and subsequently strangled Emperor Xiaozhuang to death.\nDespite this, Gao remained nominally under the Erzhus' command structure, and when, around the new year, the general Gedouling Bufan (紇豆陵步番), loyal to Emperor Xiaozhuang, attacked Erzhu Zhao and initially defeated him, approaching Jinyang, Gao came to Erzhu Zhao's aid, and together they defeated and killed Gedouling.  After the battle, Erzhu Zhao and Gao swore themselves to be brothers.  Erzhu Zhao, trusting Gao, commissioned him with Ge Rong's former troops (largely Xianbei) and, accepting his suggestion, allowed him to take his new troops east of the Taihang Mountains to seek food.\nIn spring 531, Gao Huan was posturing to attack his distant relative Gao Gan (高乾), who had declared a rebellion at Xindu (信都, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), against the Erzhus.  However, Gao Gan and Li Yuanzhong (李元忠) were able to persuade him that the Erzhus, because of their corruption, were hated by the people, and he could overthrow them.  Gao Huan thereafter stirred his troops by forging orders from Erzhu Zhao that indicated that Erzhu Zhao was about to turn them into servants for his own troops.  Gao Huan's troops believed the forged orders, and when he declared a rebellion in summer 531, they supported him.\n\n\nRebellion against the Erzhus\n\nInitially, Gao Huan's rebellion formally continued to recognize Emperor Jiemin, whom Erzhu Shilong had made emperor in spring 531 to replace Yuan Ye (whose distant imperial lineage made him appear inappropriate as emperor).  However, at Sun Teng's urging, in fall 531, Gao declared another distant member of the imperial Yuan clan, Yuan Lang, emperor.\nDespite Gao's reputation for being a capable soldier, his army was still weak, and initially, most key members of the Erzhu clan did not take him seriously, except Erzhu Shilong.  Soon, Erzhu Shilong's brother Erzhu Zhongyuan and another cousin Erzhu Dulü, as well as Erzhu Zhao, converged against Gao, but Gao successfully spread rumors to make the Erzhus suspicious of each other, due to existing conflicts that Erzhu Zhao and Erzhu Shilong already had, and Erzhu Zhongyuan and Erzhu Dulü subsequently withdrew. Gao then defeated Erzhu Zhao at Guang'a (廣阿, in modern Xingtai, Hebei) in winter 531, forcing Erzhu Zhao to withdraw as well.  In spring 532, Gao captured the important city Yecheng, and used it as a base for subsequent operations.\nThe Erzhus soon reconciled, and soon, Erzhu Zhao, Erzhu Zhongyuan, Erzhu Dulü, and Erzhu Tianguang converged on Yecheng.  However, despite the Erzhus' numerical superiority, Gao defeated them at Hanling (韩陵; northeast of present-day Anyang, Henan), forcing Erzhu Zhao to flee back to Jinyang and Erzhu Zhongyuan back to his base Dong Commandery (東郡, in modern Anyang, Henan).  Erzhu Tianguang and Erzhu Dulü tried to retreat to Luoyang, but at this time, the general Husi Chun rebelled against the Erzhus in Luoyang itself, killing Erzhu Shilong and another brother of Erzhu Shilong, Erzhu Yanbo (爾朱彥伯), and he also captured Erzhu Dulü and Erzhu Tianguang in battle, delivering them to Gao.  Erzhu Zhongyuan soon abandoned Dong Commandery and fled to rival Liang Dynasty, leaving Erzhu Zhao as the only major surviving member of the Erzhu clan.  Gao marched toward Luoyang, then controlled by Husi, with Yuan Lang.\nHowever, Gao was beginning to believe that Yuan Lang, due to his lineage's being distant from recent emperors, to be an inappropriate choice to be emperor as well.  He toyed with the idea of allowing Emperor Jiemin to remain emperor, but decided against it after his generals Wei Lan'gen (魏蘭根) and Cui Ling (name not in Unicode) advised him that Emperor Jiemin would be difficult to control in the future.  He also considered Emperor Xiaowen's son Yuan Yue (元悅) the Prince of Huai'nan, and he welcomed Yuan Yue back from Liang, but he subsequently heard that Yuan Yue was arbitrary in his actions, and so decided against it as well.  Instead, he offered the throne to Emperor Xiaowen's grandson Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang, and Yuan Xiu accepted, taking the throne as Emperor Xiaowu.  Gao became the paramount general of the empire, although the imperial government became largely run by Husi Chun and Emperor Xiaowu's associate Wang Sizheng.\n\n\nDuring Emperor Xiaowu's reign\nEmperor Xiaowu initially deferred to Gao Huan, who continued to command the largest army of the state and took over Erzhu Rong's old headquarters at Jinyang as his own, on most decisions, and Emperor Xiaowu married Gao's daughter as his empress in late 532.  He also created Gao the Prince of Bohai, a title that Yuan Lang had initially created Gao in 531 but Gao continuously declined until winter 533.  However, the relationship between Emperor Xiaowu and Gao soon deteriorated, over Emperor Xiaowu's suspicions that Gao had designs on the throne, and over Emperor Xiaowu's desires to reassert imperial authority.  Emperor Xiaowu therefore tried to align himself with independent generals, the brothers Heba Yue, who controlled the western provinces, and Heba Sheng, who controlled the southern provinces.  Gao tried to remain deferential to Emperor Xiaowu outwardly, but was becoming increasingly displeased with the emperor's independence.\nGao tried to undermine Emperor Xiaowu's allies.  In winter 533, he sent his associate Zhai Song (翟嵩) to persuade Heba Yue's lieutenant Houmochen Yue to betray Heba, while in spring 534 ambushing a major tribal leader, Gedouling Yili (紇豆陵依利), whom Emperor Xiaowu had also made overtures to, taking over Gedouling's troops.  Soon thereafter, Homouchen assassinated Heba Yue, but Homouchen missed an opportunity to take over Heba Yue's troops.  Subsequently, those troops supported Heba Yue's assistant Yuwen Tai as their leader, and Yuwen soon defeated Houmochen, who committed suicide.  Emperor Xiaowu subsequently entered into an alliance with Yuwen.  When Gao tried to make overtures to Yuwen, Yuwen arrested his messengers and delivered them to Emperor Xiaowu.\nEmperor Xiaowu soon prepared a campaign against Gao, and he, trying to catch Gao by surprise, issued a secret edict to Gao claiming to be actually planning to attack Yuwen and Heba Sheng.  Gao, however, saw through Emperor Xiaowu's plot, and marched toward Luoyang.  Wang Sizheng, believing that the imperial troops were not strong enough to resist Gao's, suggested Emperor Xiaowu to flee to Yuwen's territory, and Emperor Xiaowu decided to do so, rejecting Husi Chun's offer to take one final stand at Luoyang, particularly when Heba Sheng failed to come to the emperor's aid and when Yuwen's troops failed to arrive quickly.  It took Gao only a month to reach Luoyang, and Emperor Xiaowu fled west, encountering Yuwen's troops on the way, and had them escort him back to Yuwen's headquarters at Chang'an, where he reestablished the imperial government and made Yuwen prime minister.\nMeanwhile, Gao Huan took over the Luoyang region, and soon also defeated Heba Sheng, taking over his territory and forcing him to flee to Liang.  Gao then wrote repeated petitions to Emperor Xiaowu, requesting that he return to Luoyang and indicating that he was willing to return to the status quo ante. Emperor Xiaowu did not respond to any of Gao's overtures. Gao therefore made Yuan Shanjian, the son and heir apparent of Emperor Xiaowu's cousin Yuan Dan (元亶) the Prince of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing) and moving the capital from Luoyang to Yecheng, thus formally dividing the empire into two (Eastern Wei under Emperor Xiaojing and Western Wei under Emperor Xiaowu), albeit with each claiming to be the rightful one.\n\n\nDuring Emperor Xiaojing's reign\nEastern Wei's territorial size and military strength was far stronger than Western Wei's, and Gao made a number of attempts to try to end the division by conquering Western Wei, but the battles largely proved to be inconclusive, allowing Western Wei to stand.  Periodically, Western Wei generals who had prior relationships with Gao would defect to Eastern Wei, and Gao at times carried out campaigns deep within Western Wei territory.  However, Western Wei was able to portray Gao as a renegade general who expelled the emperor, and often during campaigns, local populace would assist Western Wei troops because they believed Western Wei's characterization.  During this period, Gao also tried to foster harmony between the ethnic Xianbei and Chinese, persuading the Xianbei that they needed the Chinese to practice agriculture to be fed, and persuading the Chinese that they needed the Xianbei's military aptitude to protect them.  He saw Emperor Xiaowu's flight as a blot on his personal history, so he treated Emperor Xiaojing with great formal respect, deferring to Emperor Xiaojing in all public occasions.\nin spring 535, Gao Huan learned that around the new year 535, Emperor Xiaowu, who had a falling out with Yuwen Tai over Yuwen's refusal to condone his incestuous relationships with his cousins, had been poisoned to death by Yuwen.  Gao suggested that an official mourning period be held for Emperor Xiaowu, and while there were disagreements, eventually a mourning period was held.\nAlso in spring 535, a sex scandal affected Gao's household.  Gao's heir apparent Gao Cheng, born of his wife Princess Lou, had an affair with Gao Huan's concubine Zheng Dache (鄭大車), and the affair was discovered.  Gao Huan caned Gao Cheng and put him under house arrest, and refused to meet with Gao Cheng's mother Princess Lou.  He also considered replacing Gao Cheng as heir apparent with Gao You (高浟), the son of his concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the daughter of Erzhu Rong who had previously been Emperor Xiaozhuang's empress.  After intercession by Gao Huan's friend Sima Ziru, who reminded him how much Princess Lou had done for him before he had accomplished great things and who used violent methods to force the servant girls who were witnesses to the affair to recant, Gao Huan calmed down and did not replace Gao Cheng.\nAround the new year 536, Gao Huan tried to make an alliance with Rouran against Western Wei, by marrying a princess to Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiulü Anagui.  However, Yujiulü Anagui soon took a Western Wei princess as consort as well, and the alliance did not materialize.\nIn spring 536, Gao made a deep incursion into Western Wei territory, capturing Xia Province (夏州, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi), while also rescuing his ally Cao Ni (曹泥) the governor of Ling Province (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), who had been trapped behind Western Wei lines.  The Western Wei general Moqi Pu (万俟普), his son Moqi Shouluogan (万俟受洛干), and other generals Chigan Baole (叱干寶樂) and Poliuhan Chang (破六韓常), who were stationed in the western Western Wei territory, also joined Gao and returned to Eastern Wei with him.\nAlso in spring 536, Gao Huan, at Gao Cheng's request, made Gao Cheng the Eastern Wei prime minister, despite the fact that Gao Cheng was only 14 at this point.  Gao Cheng was sent to Yecheng, and he took over actual reign of the Eastern Wei imperial government.\nIn spring 537, Gao Huan launched a major attack three-pronged on Western Wei, commanded by himself and his key generals Dou Tai and Gao Aocao, intending to draw Yuwen's troops to himself while having Dou advance deep into Western Wei territory.  Yuwen, pretending to be ready to abandon Chang'an to withdraw to modern eastern Gansu, instead launched a surprise attack on Dou's troops, slaughtering most of them.  Dou committed suicide.  Gao Huan and Gao Aocao were forced to withdraw.  In counterattacks, Western Wei took modern western Henan and southwestern Shanxi.\nIn winter 537, after hearing news that the Guanzhong region (the heart of the Western Wei state) was suffering from a major famine, Gao Huan launched another major attack on Western Wei.  He encountered Yuwen at the Battle of Shayuan (沙苑, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and, believing that he had overwhelming numerical advantage, rejected the strategy of Hulü Qiangju (斛律羌舉) to bypass Yuwen and make a direct attack on Chang'an, and his own initial inclination to set fire to the grass fields at Shayuan to have it burn Yuwen's troops, instead directly engaging Yuwen in battle.  Yuwen's troops, however, fought hard, one of Yuwen's key generals Li Bi, led about 600 elite cavalry, charged through Gao's 200,000 soldiers and broke their formation. They defeated Gao's troops, forcing Gao to withdraw.  In light of his defeat, the southern provinces and Luoyang area largely rebelled and declared allegiance to Western Wei, but in spring 538 Gao sent Hou Jing against the southern provinces, recapturing them.\nIn 538, after Emperor Wen of Western Wei married Yujiulü Anagui's daughter as his empress, Yujiulü Anagui cut off relations between Rouran and Eastern Wei.\nIn fall 538, Gao Huan, assisted by Hou Jing and Gao Aocao, put Luoyang under siege.  Yuwen and Emperor Wen led the Western Wei troops to aid Luoyang's defender, the general Dugu Xin, and a largely inconclusive battle with heavy losses on both sides occurred—with Western Wei being able to kill Gao Aocao, and Yuwen nearly killed in the battle as well.  However, eventually Western Wei troops were forced to abandon Luoyang and withdraw, and at the same time, the Eastern Wei general Zhao Qingque (趙青雀), who had been captured by Western Wei in the Battle of Shayuan, rebelled against Western Wei at Chang'an, forcing the Western Wei officials who remained in Chang'an to escort the crown prince Yuan Qin out of Chang'an.  However, Gao Huan was unable to take advantage of the disturbance that Zhao caused, and Yuwen was able to return to Chang'an to suppress Zhao's rebellion.  Meanwhile, Western Wei also recaptured some of the southern provinces.  For the next few years, while there continued to be border battles, no major campaigns was initiated by either Eastern Wei or Western Wei.\nIn summer 539, Gao Huan gave his second daughter to Emperor Xiaojing in marriage as Emperor Xiaojing's wife and empress.\nIn winter 541, Gao Huan had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict standardizing measurement units for cloth, to avoid the populace's being unfairly taxed.\nIn winter 542, Gao Huan launched a major attack on the Western Wei border city of Yubi (玉壁, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but the Western Wei defence was held successfully and  Gao was forced to withdraw.\nIn spring 543, another sexual wrongdoing by Gao Cheng would lead to a new campaign between Eastern Wei and Western Wei.  The official Gao Zhongmi (高仲密, Gao Aocao's brother), already fearful over his situation because one of Gao Cheng's major assistants, Cui Xian (崔暹), had tried to pick his faults after he divorced Cui Xian's sister, was further aggravated when Gao Cheng tried to rape his second wife, Li Changyi (李昌儀).  He therefore surrendered the important garrison of Hulao (虎牢, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) to Western Wei.  Yuwen led his troops to try to come to Gao Zhongmi's aid and further again seize the entire Luoyang region, but was repelled in a major battle near Luoyang, during which both Yuwen and Gao Huan were nearly killed in battle, with Heba Sheng, then a Western Wei general, nearly killing Gao with a spear.  (In retaliation, Gao Huan later had all of Heba's sons who remained in Eastern Wei territory executed.)  By summer 543, the Western Wei forces had withdrawn, and the entire Luoyang region was again under Eastern Wei control.\nin 544, with Gao Huan believing that four key officials who were close to him—Sun Teng, Sima Ziru, his cousin Gao Yue (高岳), and his sworn \"brother\" Gao Longzhi (高隆之) -- were wielding too much power, he gave the 22-year-old Gao Cheng additional authorities, and Gao Cheng increasingly asserted authorities over these officials and others.  For example, once when Sun visited Gao Cheng but was acting insufficiently deferentially, Gao Cheng had his attendants throw Sun on the ground and pound him with the sword hilts.  Gao Cheng also made one of his close assistants, Cui Jishu (崔季舒, Cui Xian's uncle) an assistant to Emperor Xiaojing, in order to keep a closer eye on Emperor Xiaojing.  Gao Cheng soon greatly enhanced the authorities of both Cui Xian and Song Youdao (宋遊道) and charged them with the responsibilities of stamping out corruption among officials—which Gao Huan himself had been reluctant to do so.  Based on Cui Xian's and Song's recommendations, Sima was arrested and reduced to commoner rank, while Yuan Tan (元坦) the Prince of Xianyang was relieved of all governmental posts.\nIn spring 545, Erzhu Ying'e's brother Erzhu Wenchang (爾朱文暢) and Zheng Dache's brother Zheng Zhongli (鄭仲禮), along with Ren Zhou (任冑), conspired to assassinate Gao Huan and support Erzhu Wenchang as leader, but the conspiracy was discovered, and the conspirators were put to death, along with their families.  However, because of Gao Huan's favors for Erzhu Ying'e and Zheng Dache, he spared their brothers.\nLou Zhaojun supported and assisted Gao Huan when he married more women, wanting to expand his power.\nIn fall 545, due to an alliance between Western Wei and Rouran to attack Eastern Wei, Gao Huan sued for peace with Rouran by requesting a marriage between a daughter of Yujiulü Anagui and Gao Cheng.  Yujiulü Anagui refused, stating that it would only be sufficient if Gao Huan himself married her.  Gao Huan himself initially refused, but Princess Lou, Gao Cheng, and Wei Jing all persuaded him otherwise, and he married Yujiulü Anagui's daughter, referring to her as the Princess Ruru. To facilitate this marriage, Princess Lou moved out of the mansion, but Gao Huan and Princess Lou were not formally divorced.\nIn fall 546, Gao Huan launched another major attack on Western Wei, apparently to make one final attempt to destroy it.  He put Yubi under siege, intending to attract Western Wei forces to Yubi in order to destroy it, but Western Wei did not respond.  Yuwen' Chinese general in charge of defending Yubi, Wei Xiaokuan, however, defended against all kinds of siege tactics that Gao Huan tried, for 50 days, and Eastern Wei forces suffered 70,000 deaths from the battle and the illnesses.  Gao Huan himself was physically and emotionally drained, and he became ill, and he was forced to withdraw.  Western Wei subsequently declared that Wei had killed Gao Huan with a powerful crossbow, and Gao Huan, in order to dispel the rumor, appeared before his army to sing the \"Song of the Chile\" with Hulü Jin in front of his generals.  As he did, he wept bitterly.\nGao's illness continued to progress once he returned to Jinyang, and he recalled Gao Cheng to Jinyang to give him final instructions.  Gao Cheng became increasingly concerned that the powerful Chinese general Hou Jing, who was then defending Luoyang and in charge of the provinces south of the Yellow River, would rebel, particularly after Hou refused a recall order.  Gao Huan left Gao Cheng instructions not to announce his death, gave a list of ethnic Xianbei, Xiongnu and Chile generals that he could depend on such as Shedi Gan and Hulü Jin, and orders to put Murong Shaozong -- a capable general that Gao Huan had intentionally not promoted in order to allow Gao Cheng to do so—in charge of an army against Hou.  He died in spring 547, and while a false casket was buried publicly, he was buried at a secret location in Cheng'an (成安, in modern Handan, Hebei).\n\n\nFamily\nConsorts and Issue:\n\nEmpress Wuming, of the Lou clan (武明皇后 婁氏; 501–562), personal name Zhaojun (昭君)\nGao Cheng, Emperor Wenxiang (文襄皇帝 高澄; 521–549), first son\nFirst daughter\nMarried Yuan Xiu of Henan (河南; 510–535) in 532\nMarried Yuan Shao of Henan, Duke of Pengcheng (河南 元韶; d. 559) in 535\nPrincess Taiyuan (太原公主), second daughter\nMarried Yuan Shanjian of Henan, Prince Zhongshan (河南; 524–552) in 539\nMarried Yang Yin (511–560) in 551\nGao Yang, Emperor Wenxuan (文宣皇帝 高洋; 526–559), second son\nGao Yan, Emperor Xiaozhao (孝昭皇帝 高演; 535–561), sixth son\nGao Yu, Prince Jing of Xiangcheng (襄城景王 高淯; 536–551), eighth son\nGao Zhan, Emperor Wucheng (武成皇帝 高湛; 538–569), ninth son\nGao Ji, Prince Wenjian of Boling (博陵文簡王 高濟; d. 569), 12th son\nPrincess Ruru, of the Yujiulü clan (蠕蠕公主 鬱久閭氏; 530–548)\nLady, of the Erzhu clan (爾朱氏; d. 556)\nGao You, Prince Jingsi of Pengcheng (彭城景思王 高浟; 533–564), fifth son\nGao Ning, Prince Huashan (華山王 高凝), 13th son\nLady, of the Han clan (韓氏; 504–551), personal name Zhihui (智輝)\nGao Huan, Prince Gangsu of Shangdang (上黨剛肅王 高渙; 533–558), seventh son\nLady, of the Erzhu clan (爾朱氏)\nGao Jie, Prince of Rencheng (任城王 高湝; 538–577), tenth son\nLady, of the You clan (遊氏)\nGao Shi, Prince Kangmu of Gaoyang (高陽康穆王 高湜; 538–560), 11th son\nLady, of the Zheng clan of Xingyang (滎陽鄭氏), personal name Dache (大車)\nGao Run, Prince Fengyi (馮翊王 高潤; 543–575), 14th son\nLady, of the Wang clan (王氏)\nGao Jun, Prince Jianping of Yong'an (永安簡平王 高浚; d. 558), third son\nLady, of the Mu clan (穆氏)\nGao Yan, Prince Jingyi of Pingyang (平陽靖翼王 高淹; 531–564), fourth son\nLady, of the Feng clan (馮氏)\nGao Qia, Prince Jinghuai of Hanyang (漢陽敬懷王 高洽; 542–554), 15th son\nPrincess Fuyang (浮陽公主)\nUnknown\nPrincess Zhaoshun of Changle (長樂昭順公主; 525–557), personal name Zheng (徵), third daughter\nMarried Liu Honghui, Prince Pingliang(劉洪徽) in 533\nPrincess Yingchuan (潁川公主)\nMarried Duan Yi of Wuwei, Prince of Pingyuan (武威 段懿)\nPrincess Dongping (東平公主)\nMarried Kezhuhun Tianhe, Duke of Boling (可朱渾 天和; d. 560)\nPrincess Donghai ,personal name Naye (那耶)，who married Sima Xiaonan of Henei (河內 司馬消難)\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\nHolcombe, Charles. \"Chinese Shogun: GAO Huan (496-547).\" The Historian 76.2 (2014): 217-36.

Although he was an ethnic Han, Gao was deeply influenced by Xianbei culture and was often considered more Xianbei than Han by his contemporaries. During his career, he and his family became firmly in control of the Eastern Wei court. Eventually, in 550, his son Gao Yang forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, establishing the Gao clan as the imperial house of a new Northern Qi dynasty.",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=264648",
    "text": "Brian Patrick Lenihan (17 November 1930 – 1 November 1995) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served in a number of ministerial positions spanning four decades from the 1960s to 1990s, and was Tánaiste from 1987 to 1990. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1961 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1995, and was a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1957 to 1961 and 1973 to 1977. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Oireachtas from 1973 to 1977. In the 1990 presidential election, he unsuccessfully stood as Fianna Fáil's presidential candidate.\nHe was a member of a family political dynasty; his father, Patrick Lenihan, and sister both followed him into Dáil Éireann; his sister Mary O'Rourke sitting in cabinet with him. Two of his sons, Brian Lenihan Jnr and Conor Lenihan, became TDs in the 1990s. Brian Lenihan Jnr served as Minister for Finance and Conor was Minister of State in the government of Taoiseach Brian Cowen. Two phrases associated with Lenihan Snr, No problem and On mature recollection, entered the Irish political lexicon.\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Dundalk, County Louth, Lenihan was the son of Patrick Lenihan and Anne Scanlon. His father had been active in the Irish Republican Army, which saw action during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. He had been an admirer of Michael Collins and took the pro-Treaty side in 1922, before later returning to his studies and qualifying as a teacher.\nLenihan, who was one of five children, grew up in Athlone. He was educated at Marist College in the town before later studying law at University College Dublin (UCD), where he was actively involved in the Law Society as a Committee Member, and also played football for UCD, scoring against Sligo Rovers in the 1952–1953 FAI Cup. He later qualified as a barrister from King's Inns. He then practised law for a few years before becoming a full-time politician.\n\n\nPolitical career\n\n\nBeginnings\nLenihan first entered politics in 1954, when he ran as a Fianna Fáil candidate in Longford–Westmeath in that year's general election. Of the four Fianna Fáil candidates, Lenihan was the only one not to be elected.\nThree years later Lenihan contested the 1957 general election, this time in the Roscommon constituency. Although he received more first preferences than any of the other Fianna Fáil candidates, he lost out on a Dáil seat once again. In spite of this, he was elected to the Seanad for the Industrial and Commercial Panel in 1957\nAfter four years as a senator, Lenihan finally secured a seat in Dáil Éireann, following his success at the 1961 general election in Roscommon. He had the distinction of being made a Parliamentary Secretary on his first day in the Dáil as a TD, serving under both Minister for Lands Mícheál Ó Móráin and Minister for Justice Charles Haughey.\n\n\nMinister for Justice\nA cabinet reshuffle saw Lenihan join the cabinet of Seán Lemass in 1964, as Minister for Justice. His predecessor in the office, Charles Haughey, systematically reviewed, repealed or amended Acts dating back 700 years in the single largest reform of the Irish civil and criminal code ever undertaken. Lenihan carried the legislative programme, covering everything from repealing mediæval laws to granting succession rights to married women. As Minister, it was Lenihan who repealed Ireland's notorious censorship laws. Controversially he also suggested that Ireland should rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations, though it is unclear whether that suggestion actually reflected his opinion or whether he was simply raising the issue at Lemass's request to gauge public reaction.\n\n\nMinister for Education\nIn 1968, Lemass's successor Jack Lynch appointed Lenihan as Minister for Education. As Minister, he controversially proposed the merger of Dublin's (then) two universities, Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and University College Dublin (UCD). The scheme was abandoned after mass opposition, Lenihan famously being forced to flee student protests in Trinity through a toilet window. Lenihan was also Minister during a 19-day secondary teachers' strike in February 1969.\n\n\nMinister for Transport and Power\nFollowing the 1969 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to power for a fourth successive term of office. Lenihan had hopes of further promotion within the cabinet, however, his appointment as Minister for Transport and Power was largely seen as a demotion.\n\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs\nIn 1973, Patrick Hillery was appointed as Ireland's European Commissioner, upon the Irish entry to the European Economic Community. Lenihan then finally secured his much sought-after portfolio, that of Minister for Foreign Affairs. His tenure was short-lived, as the government fell and a new Fine Gael-Labour Party government took office, following the 1973 general election.\n\n\nPolitical return\nLenihan also dramatically lost his Roscommon–Leitrim seat. He once again became a Senator, becoming his party's leader in the upper house. In 1973, he was appointed a member of the second delegation from the Oireachtas to the European Parliament.\nHe moved his political base from rural Roscommon to Dublin West, where he was elected as a TD at the 1977 general election, which saw a landslide victory for Fianna Fáil. Jack Lynch appointed him Minister for Forestry and Fisheries.\nAt Lynch's retirement in 1979, Fianna Fáil saw a leadership battle between Charles Haughey (the radical republican candidate) and George Colley (the party establishment candidate and mild republican). Lenihan dismissed the choice as being between a \"knave and a fool\". He also described himself as being the \"x in Oxo\". He was believed to have backed Colley. Years later he claimed he had actually supported Haughey, but not everyone accepted this assertion.\nHaughey, seeking to weaken the faction supporting Colley, appointed Lenihan as Minister for Foreign Affairs, a post he held until Fianna Fáil lost power in 1981. His period in Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by a comment made after an Anglo-Irish summit between Haughey and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, when he spoke of Britain and Ireland being able to bring about Irish unity within ten years, a comment which infuriated the British and Northern Ireland unionists and which undid much of the goodwill achieved by the summit. His comments, at a time of major problems within Northern Ireland, with the Provisional IRA and Irish National Liberation Army campaigns in full swing along with Ulster Defence Association and other loyalists conducting reprisals were widely criticised in the Irish media as insensitive, especially as Irish unity had not even been on the agenda of the summit. One newspaper columnist commented simply \"there goes Brian, pointlessly talking himself into trouble again\". In 1982, when Fianna Fáil regained power for what would prove only ten months, Lenihan was appointed Minister for Agriculture, the announcement in the Dáil being greeted by a sustained round of laughter on the opposition benches.\n\n\nAnglo-Irish Agreement opposition\nIn opposition, Lenihan and Haughey attracted some international criticism when, against the advice of senior Irish-American politicians Senator Edward Kennedy and Speaker Tip O'Neill, they campaigned against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which the government of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had signed with the British government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The agreement gave Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In 1987, Fianna Fáil returned to power and Lenihan was for the third and final time appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the additional post of Tánaiste (deputy prime minister). In power Haughey and Lenihan reversed their opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Lenihan attending meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference which the Ireland's Foreign Minister and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland co-chaired.\n\n\nLiver transplant\nLenihan's last period as Minister for Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by his serious ill-health. A long-standing liver problem had developed into a life-threatening issue requiring a liver transplant. Lenihan, previously a large-framed man, had been reduced to a bone-thin jaundiced-looking shadow of his former self, so ill-looking that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, said afterwards that on seeing Lenihan at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting, he had speculated as to whether Lenihan would die at the meeting. In May 1989, Lenihan underwent the liver transplant at Mayo Clinic in the United States. In his absence he was re-elected to the Dáil in the 1989 general election for Dublin West, after which, while remaining Tánaiste, he was made Minister for Defence. Lenihan returned to Irish politics with a new lease of life. When he entered the Dáil chamber he received an ovation, an indication of his personal cross-party popularity.\nIt was revealed subsequently that Lenihan's operation was partly paid for through fundraising by Taoiseach Charles Haughey, from businessmen with Fianna Fáil links. In evidence to the Moriarty Tribunal investigating Haughey's finances, it was established that much of the money raised but not ultimately needed for the operation was redirected by Haughey into his own personal bank account. Haughey was revealed in the 2006 tribunal report to have been engaged in numerous acts of corruption, to finance a lifestyle considerably in excess of his earnings as a politician.\n\n\nPresidential candidate\n\nIn January 1990, leaks to the media suggested that Lenihan was considering seeking the Fianna Fáil nomination in the 1990 presidential election, which was due in November 1990. Speculation abounded that this was part of a plan to discourage other parties from running candidates in the belief that Lenihan would prove unbeatable and so get the office unopposed. Labour Party leader Dick Spring indicated that Labour would run a candidate for the presidency, even if he had to stand himself. Ultimately, Labour chose former Senator Mary Robinson as its candidate.\nLenihan was generally perceived as an unbeatable candidate, though he did receive a late challenge for the nomination from cabinet colleague John Wilson. However, in September 1990, Lenihan was formally nominated as his party's candidate. The main opposition party, Fine Gael chose Austin Currie, a TD and former Northern Ireland cabinet minister, to be its candidate.\n\n\nThe Lenihan tape\n\nThe issue of Lenihan's trustworthiness became the central issue of the second half of the presidential campaign.\nIn January 1982, Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had asked President Patrick Hillery, a former government colleague of Lenihan's, to dissolve the Dáil, a request which Hillery granted. If President Hillery had refused a dissolution, Charles Haughey as Leader of the Opposition, could have formed an alternative government and strengthened his own embattled position as leader of Fianna Fáil. Subsequently, it was reported in books by authors Stephen O'Byrnes and Raymond Smith, and by many political journalists in newspaper articles (some of whom had Lenihan as their source) that Lenihan had been one of the people who had made phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin, the President's official residence, on the night in question, in order to persuade or pressure Hillery to refuse a dissolution. Lenihan himself never denied his involvement in the incident. Indeed, in May 1990, he confirmed his participation in an on-the-record interview with a postgraduate student and journalist, Jim Duffy. In September 1990, The Irish Times carried a series of articles on the presidency, one of which mentioned in passing the role of Lenihan, Sylvester Barrett, and Charles Haughey in making the calls. The article in question was sourced from Duffy's interview.\nIn October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, Lenihan suddenly changed his account. In an interview in the Irish Press and on RTÉ's Questions and Answers programme, he insisted that he had had \"no hand, act or part\" in efforts to pressure President Hillery. The Irish Times, which was aware that Lenihan himself was Duffy's source for the original article claim, published, with Duffy's agreement, a newspaper story confirming that Lenihan had indeed made the controversial phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin. When Lenihan's campaign manager, Bertie Ahern, named Duffy on radio as someone who had interviewed Lenihan back in May, a political storm erupted in which the journalist was put under siege by the media and Fianna Fáil, leading to his reluctant decision, after consulting with lawyers, to release the portion of the tape in which Lenihan talked about the events of January 1982.\n\n\n\"On mature recollection\"\n\nLenihan's reaction severely damaged his credibility. He appeared on a live TV news bulletin, and, looking into the camera, pleaded with the Irish people to believe him, stating that \"on mature recollection\" he had not phoned President Hillery and his account to Duffy had been wrong. He then requested an audience with President Hillery to seek his confirmation that he made no phone calls. No audience was granted, and his campaign manager Bertie Ahern withdrew the request – though, in a sign of the chaos enveloping the campaign, Lenihan told journalist Charlie Bird that the request was still there until the journalist played back his interview with Ahern, after which Lenihan recorded a new soundbite explaining why the request had been withdrawn.\nAt this point, the opposition put down a motion of no confidence in the government. The Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil's coalition partner, told Taoiseach Charles Haughey that unless Lenihan was either dismissed or an inquiry set up into the events of January 1982, it would pull out of government, support the opposition motion and force a general election. Though insisting that he would put no pressure on Brian Lenihan, \"my friend of thirty years\", Haughey drew up a letter of resignation for Lenihan's signature. Lenihan refused to sign, and Haughey formally advised President Hillery to dismiss Lenihan from the government – which Hillery, as was required constitutionally, duly did, despite grave personal concerns. Many in Fianna Fáil were disgusted with what they saw as Haughey's betrayal of his old friend, and argued that the Progressive Democrats' threat to bring down the government was a mere bluff. This would be the first in a series of events generating discontent in Fianna Fáil with Haughey's leadership, culminating in his downfall in early 1992.\n\n\nPádraig Flynn's attack on Mary Robinson\n\nLenihan's dismissal led to an immediate collapse in his popularity (from mid 40% to 31% almost overnight), though his standing in the polls subsequently improved. A personal attack by former cabinet colleague Pádraig Flynn on Mary Robinson, in which he accused her of showing a \"new-found interest\" in her family, backfired and destroyed Lenihan's campaign. Women voters rallied to Robinson and abandoned the Lenihan campaign in droves.\n\n\nThe result\nIn spite of his troubled campaign, Lenihan won the largest number of first-preference votes. However, most of the votes that initially went to Austin Currie, the third-placed candidate, transferred to Mary Robinson on the second count, in what was widely seen as a pact between Fine Gael and the Labour Party. As a result, Lenihan became the first Fianna Fáil candidate to lose an Irish presidential election.\n\n\nOut of government\nLenihan remained active in politics right up to his death in 1995. Bitter at what he saw as his betrayal by the Progressive Democrats, he campaigned for Fianna Fáil to go into coalition with the Labour Party instead, something which happened after the 1992 general election. He also occasionally reviewed books, which showed an intellect that he had suppressed in his public persona as a politician.\n\n\nDeath\nBrian Lenihan's health again deteriorated and he died in 1995, at the age of 64. The resulting by-election was won by his son Brian Lenihan Jnr.\nIn the 1997 general election another son, Conor Lenihan, was elected to Dáil Éireann.\n\n\nBrian Lenihan Memorial Lecture\nA Brian Lenihan Memorial Lecture is delivered annually in the Irish Institute of European Affairs. The first guest speaker was the late Roy Jenkins (formerly British Home Secretary and President of the European Commission). In 2001, the lecture was given by Chris Patten, former British Conservative Party Minister and MP, former Governor of Hong Kong and current British European Commissioner.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBruce Arnold, Jack Lynch, Hero in Crisis (Merlin, 2001) ISBN 1-903582-06-7\nJames Downey, Lenihan: His Life and Loyalties (New Island Books 1998) ISBN 1-874597-97-9\nFergus Finlay, Snakes and Ladders (New Island Books, 1998) 1874597766\nJoe Joyce and Peter Murtagh, The Boss: Charles J.

    "text": "The Temple at Uppsala was long held to be a religious centre in the Norse religion once located at what became Gamla Uppsala (Swedish \"Old Uppsala\"), Sweden attested in Adam of Bremen's 11th-century work Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum and in Heimskringla, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Uppsala has for long been exposed to fanciful theories about the implications of these descriptions of the temple and of the findings of archaeological excavations in the area, including findings of extensive wooden structures and log lines from the 5th century which allegedly played a supporting role to activities at the site, including ritual sacrifice. According to sources from the later Middle Ages the temple was destroyed by King Inge the Elder in the 1080s, but there are no contemporary sources to support that.\n\n\nAdam of Bremen\n\n\nDescription\n\nIn Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, Adam of Bremen provides a description of the temple. Adam records that a \"very famous temple called Ubsola\" exists in a town close to Sigtuna. Adam details that the temple is \"made out of gold\" and that the people there worship statues of three specific gods that sit on a triple throne. Thor, whom Adam refers to as \"the mightiest,\" sits in the central throne, while Wodan (Odin) and Fricco (Freyr) are seated on the thrones to the sides of him. Adam provides information about the characteristics of the three gods, including that Fricco is depicted with an immense erect penis, Wodan in armour (\"as our people depict Mars,\" Adam notes) and that Thor has a mace, a detail which Adam compares to that of the Roman god Jupiter. Adam adds that, in addition, \"they also worship gods who were once men, whom they reckon to be immortal because of their heroic acts [...].\". Adam says that the three gods have a priest appointed to them each who offer up sacrifices to the deities from the people. If famine or plague occurs, a sacrifice is made to Thor; if there is war, a sacrifice is made to Wodan; if a marriage is to be held, a sacrifice is made to Fricco. Adam continues that \"every nine years there is a communal festival of every province in Sweden held in Ubsola; and those already converted to Christianity have to buy themselves off from the ceremonies.\"\nAdam details sacrificial practices held at the temple; Adam describes that nine males of \"every living creature\" are offered up for sacrifice, and tradition dictates that their blood placates the gods. The corpses of the nine males are hung within the grove beside the temple. Adam says that the grove is considered extremely sacred to the heathens, so much so that each singular tree \"is considered to be divine,\" due to the death of those sacrificed or their rotting corpses hanging there, and that dogs and horses hang within the grove among the corpses of men. Adam reveals that \"A Christian seventy-two years old\" informed him that he had seen cadavers of differing species hanging within the grove. Adam expresses disgust at the songs they sing during these sacrificial rites, quipping that the songs are \"so many and disgusting that it is best to pass over them in silence.\"\nAdam describes that near the temple stands a massive tree with far-spreading branches, which is evergreen both in summer and winter. At the tree is also a spring where sacrifices are also held. According to Adam, a custom exists where a man, alive, is thrown into the spring, and if he fails to return to the surface, \"the wish of the people will be fulfilled.\"\nAdam writes that a golden chain surrounds the temple that hangs from the gables of the building. The chain is very visible to those approaching the temple from a distance due to the landscape where the temple was built; it is surrounded by hills, \"like an amphitheatre.\" The feasts and sacrifices continue for a total of nine days, and during the course of each day a man is sacrificed along with two animals. Therefore, in a total of nine days twenty-seven sacrifices occur, and, Adam notes, these sacrifices occur \"about the time of the spring equinox.\"\n\n\nViews\n\nRudolf Simek says that, regarding Adam of Bremen's account of the temple, \"Adam's sources for this information are of extremely varying reliability, but the existence of a temple at Uppsala is undisputed.\" The question is if this temple was pagan or Christian. Simek says that details of Adam's accounts have been cited as potentially influenced by the description of Solomon's Temple in the Old Testament. Simek notes, at the same time, similar chains as described by Adam appear on some European churches dating from the 8th to 9th centuries, although the description of the temple chain having been made of gold may be an exaggeration. Simek says that the numerous attempts at reconstructing the temple based on the postholes may overestimate the size of the temple, and notes that \"more recent\" research indicates that the site of the 11th-century temple probably adjoined the choir of the church standing there today, while the postholes discovered by Lindqvist may instead point to an earlier, burnt-down temple at the same site.\nBuilding on previous critical discussions about Adam of Bremen's description of the temple by the archaeologists Harald Wideen and Olaf Olsen, Henrik Janson in his fundamental study on the European background of Adam's work, came to the conclusion that Adam used the case of Uppsala to display some of the more prominent lines of conflict at the outbreak of the investiture controversy. These lines of conflict reached deep into Scandinavia. Papacy and Empire were competing about the control of the Northern parts of Europe, and the Empire, through the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, claimed subjugation of the Scandinavian kingdoms under the Imperial church. These rights were however challenged by some political actors in the North, and a particularly strong resistance came from the kingdom of the Swedes where another Church, called Gallicana ecclesia by Pope Gregory VII, had the support of the Papacy. This Church can be connected to the Mälar-region and indeed Uppsala. It is not totally clear where the representatives of this \"Gallican Church\" came from, but one part of these influences can certainly be recognized in later Swedish saint lives remembering bishops from England, connected to the Cluniac reform movement, active in the Mälar-region in the 11th century - obviously in opposition to the Imperial Church of Hamburg-Bremen for which Adam of Bremen was trying to build up divine historical legitimacy. An important part of the picture is the fact that in these years it became feasible to accuse opponents of paganism even if it was obvious that they were perfectly good Christians. The key concepts here were faith, fides, meaning faithfulness, and obedience, obedientia, as was explicitly stated by Gregory VII in precisely these years: \"anyone falls into the sin of heathenism [paganitas] who, while claiming that he is a Christian, disdains to obey the apostolic see\". Previously these measures had mainly been directed against socially inferior groups – e.g. the Saxons against the Slavs and for that matter Scandinavians – but now this theological weapon was fired against the highest representatives of the Imperial Church. The first one to be hit was Archbishop Liemar of Hamburg Bremen, in whose service and defense Adam of Bremen was writing his work. Pointing to the lack of sources that could confirm Adam's description about a pagan temple in Uppsala, and bringing forth other sources, such as the over one thousand Christian rune stones in the area, showing that Christianity was well established there when Adam was writing, Janson concluded that the Uppsala Temple was nothing but a Christian church resisting The Sacred Roman Empire, with support from the Papacy and enemies of Henry IV that gathered around Gregory VII at the very outbreak of the Investiture contest.\nOrchard (1997) states that \"it is unclear to what extent Adam's description has a basis in historical fact rather than lurid fiction\" yet that Adam's account contains \"a good deal of useful information (as well as considerable speculation).\" Orchard points out that Adam's description of the temple has often been questioned \"on several levels\" and that Thietmar of Merseburg produced a considerably less detailed but similar account of sacrifices held in Lejre, Denmark earlier in the 11th century. Thietmar's account, however, concerns the religious situation in Denmark in the early 10th century, almost a century before he was writing, and he actually states that these pagan rites were extinguished in the 930's. Thus, there are good reasons to doubt that he could \"give a fair representation of pre-Christian rituals\" in Scandinavia.\n\n\nHeimskringla\n\nIn the Ynglinga saga compiled in Heimskringla, Snorri presents a euhemerized origin of the Norse gods and rulers descending from them. In chapter 5, Snorri asserts that the æsir settled in what later became Sweden and built various temples. Snorri writes that\n\"Odin took up his residence at the\nMaelare lake, at the place now called Old Sigtun.  There he erected a large farm shrine (hof), where there were offerings (blót) according to the customs of the Asaland people.  He appropriated to himself the whole of that district, and called it Sigtun.  To the shrine spirits (hofgoðunum) he gave also dwelling places.  Njörðr dwelt in Nóatún, Frey in Upsal, Heimdal in the  Himinbergs, Thor in Thrudvang, Balder in Breidablik; to all of them he gave good estates.\"\nIn chapter 10, after Njörðr has died, his son Freyr comes to power and \"he was called the king of Swedes and received tribute from them.\" Freyr's subjects loved him greatly, and he was \"blessed by good seasons like his father.\" According to the saga, Freyr \"erected a great shrine at Uppsala and made his chief residence there, directing it to all tribute due to him, both lands and chattels. This was the origin of the Uppsala crown goods, which have been kept up ever since.\"\n\n\nArchaeological record\nIn 1926, Sune Lindqvist conducted archaeological investigations in Gamla Uppsala and discovered postholes beneath the church in Gamla Uppsala. These postholes may be lined up with the result of concentric rectangles, and subsequently various attempts at reconstructions of the temple have been attempted based on this discovery.\n\nPrice and Alkarp (2005) have been among those who dispute the 1926 interpretation:  Though still maintained today in school textbooks and elsewhere, this conclusion is clearly erroneous as the postholes can be shown stratigraphically to belong to several different phases of construction. \nUsing ground penetrating radar and other geophysical methods, Price and Alkarp found the remains of what they interpreted as a wooden construction located directly under the northern transept of the medieval cathedral, and two other buildings, one of them a Bronze Age building, and the other possibly a Viking Age feasting hall.\nOrchard (1997) says that archaeological digs in the area \"have failed to reveal anything on the scale proposed for the temple\" yet that three burial mounds at the location reveal the importance of the site.\nIn 2013, the remains of two lines of large wooden poles were discovered. One line is approximately a kilometer long consisting of 144 poles and the other half a kilometer with each pole being separated by 5–6 meters. The line probably continues but was not excavated due to lack of funds. The shorter line is perpendicular to the first, located a kilometer to the south and broken into a corner which indicates that if the lines mark an enclosure, as the one at Jelling Denmark, the enclosed area would be gigantic and by far the biggest structure north of the Alps at this time. The poles were very wide and have been estimated to be at least 7 meters in length. The construction, however, belongs to the mid-5th century. It was consequently gone for many centuries when Adam of Bremen described the Uppsala temple. There is nothing to suggest a connection between these posts and Adam's temple, but the interpretations they have provoked are illustrative of how everything around Uppsala still tends to be interpreted in the shadow of his description.\n\n\nSee also\n\nDomalde\nFyrisvellir\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "In theoretical linguistics, mirror theory refers to a particular approach to the architecture of the language organ developed by Michael Brody, who claims his theory to be purely representational (unlike most of the current generative theories that are either derivational or combining derivation and representation).\n\n\nPhrase structure\nThere are several important respects in which mirror theory is different from more traditional theories of phrase structure in generative linguistics such as X-bar theory or bare phrase structure. The first principle, called mirror, states that the syntactic relation 'X complement of Y' is identical to an inverse-order morphological relation 'X specifier of Y'. Thus, the notions of 'syntactic' and 'morphological' specifiers and complements are crucial for the linearisation of syntactic structure and its mapping to the morphological component.\nWhen the structure is pronounced, it linearises in the following order: specifiers precede heads, and heads precede their complements. So when a sentence like that in the diagram below is pronounced, 'John' precedes the V-v-T chain, which in turn precedes 'Mary', the latter being the specifier of V. However, English is a VO language, which means that the morphological word 'loves' associated with the V-v-T chain is spelled in v, deriving the correct word order.\n\nAdger, D., Harbour, D., and Watkins, L. Mirrors and Microparameters: Phrase Structure beyond Free Word Order  \nBrody, M. Mirror Theory\n\n\nThe mirror principle in distributed morphology\nSimilar to mirror theory is the mirror principle of the distributed morphology framework which deals primarily with issues of affix ordering. In the model of Distributed Morphology, the underlying assumption is such that all morphemes in a morphologically complex word are effectually \"leaves\" on a syntactic tree. These syntactic \"leaves\" undergo operations that lead to the build-up of words, meaning that word-formation is subject to the same principles that govern the syntactic build-up of sentences. The mirror principle surmises that a complex word is generated in a derivation where the root of a given word merges lower than all subsequent suffixes that attach to that word. These suffixes immediately c-command the root word and are ordered in accordance with the principle of semantic scope. To generate the proper linear structure, left-head movement is applied recursively to include the morphemes that c-command a given root.\n\nEmpirical arguments for the Mirror Principle are provided by Baker's (1985) account for the distribution of a number of valence changing operations in Mohawk, showing that the linear order of morphemes is related to the syntactic hierarchy in that morphemes are linearized in a reverse order to how they appear in a syntactic structure. His findings are summarized in The Mirror Generalization, which states:  Morphological derivations must directly reflect syntactic derivations (and vice versa).The generalization is observed in Baker's (1988) account for applicatives and passives in Chichewa:\nMbidzi zi-na-perek-a mpiringidzo kwa mtsikana\nzebra SP-PST-hand-ASP crowbar to girl\n\"The zebras handed the crowbar to the girl.\"\nMbidzi zi-na-perek-er-a mpiringidzo mtsikana\nzebra SP-PST-hand-APPL-ASP crowbar girl\n\"The zebras handed the girl the crowbar.\"\nMpiringidzo u-na-perek-edw-a kwa mtsikana ndi mbidzi\ncrowbar SP-PST-hand-PASS-ASP to girl by zebras\n\"The crowbar was handed to the girl by the zebras.\"\nMtsikana a-na-perek-er-edw-a mpiringidzo ndi mbidzi\ngirl SP-PST-hand-APPL-PASS-ASP crowbar by zebras\n\"The girl was handed the crowbar by the zebras.\"\n*Mtskikana a-na-perek-edw-er-a mpiringidzo ndi mbidzi\n*girl SP-PST-hand-PASS-APPL-ASP crowbar by zebras\nThe above examples attest the ordering of the applicative morpheme and the passive morpheme in Chichewa. In this language, applicatives may be passivized, however, passives can not be made into applicatives. Applying the Mirror Principle to this set of data, we assume that in the underlying deep structure of the syntax, all affixes that occur to the right of the lexical root perek are projected above this root in the syntax. These affixes are then adjoined to the lexical root via head-movement.\n\n\nAlternative accounts for affix ordering\nNumerous observations in languages are also available, apart from the mirror principle. Yupik, for example, is able to account for affix order appealing entirely to semantic scope. However, semantic scope and the mirror principle are not mutually exclusive ways to account for affix ordering\nChallenges to the Mirror Principle have been offered in analyses of the morpheme orders of Navajo and Cupeño by Harley (2009).\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The gens Obellia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome, known almost entirely from inscriptions.\n\n\nOrigin\nThe only clue to the origins of the Obellii is an inscription from Samnium, naming Saluta Obellia, daughter of Ovius.  Both Saluta and Ovius are Oscan names, and several other Obellii are mentioned in inscriptions from Samnium, suggesting that the Obellii were Samnites, or at least of Oscan origin.  The nomen Obellius might be derived from a cognomen Ovillus, from an adjective that means \"pertaining to sheep\", suggesting that an ancestor of the family was a shepherd.  Another possibility is that Obellius could be a variation on the Oscan name Ofilius or Ofellius.\n\n\nPraenomina\nThe principal names of the Obelii were Manius and Gaius.  Gaius was among the most common of all praenomina, while Manius was considerably more distinctive, although not actually rare.  A number of Obellii used other common praenomina, including Lucius, Marcus, Publius, Quintus, Sextus, and Titus.  There was at least one Spurius Obellius, mentioned in an inscription from Philippi, and from an Oscan inscription, we know of an Ovius Obellius, and his daughter, Saluta.\n\n\nMembers\nThis list includes abbreviated praenomina.

    "text": "French immersion is a form of bilingual education in which students who do not speak French as a first language will receive instruction in French. In most French-immersion schools, students will learn to speak French and learn most subjects such as history, music, geography, art, physical education and science in French.\nThis type of education, in which most of the students are from the majority language community but are voluntarily immersed in the minority language is atypical of most language learning around the world, and was developed in Canada as a result of political and social changes in the 1960s, notably the Official Languages Act, 1969 which led many Anglophones (primarily urban or suburban and middle class) to put their children in to French programs to ensure they could succeed in the increasing number of jobs in the federal government and private sector that required personal bilingualism.\nMost school boards in Canada offer French immersion starting in grade one and others start as early as kindergarten. At the primary level, students may receive instructions in French at or near a hundred percent of their instructional day, called \"total immersion\", or some smaller part of the day (\"partial immersion\"). In the case of total immersion, English instruction is introduced in perhaps grade three (Alberta) or grade four (Ontario), and the minutes of English instruction per day will increase throughout their educational career with up to fifty percent of English/French instruction daily.\nAs of 2020, 12% of Canadian students (excluding in Quebec) were enrolled in a French immersion program, compared to 34% who took conventional French classes in an otherwise-English school environment. As of 2021, 483,000 students were enrolled in French immersion programs only in public elementary and secondary schools in Canada outside Quebec and Nunavut.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nCanadian context\nIn many countries around the world, students are educated in two or more languages: often all students learn at least one foreign language, perhaps the language of a former colonizer (e.g. French in West Africa, English in South Asia, etc.); commonly minorities learn the majority language, often this is required by law or is simply thought of as an economic necessity; and occasionally two or more language communities in the same country learn each other's languages. The Canadian model differs from most countries in that it is a wealthy and politically influential sub-set of the majority language community that has voluntarily decided to demand that local governments offer their children an intensive immersion in the language of a minority. This would have been unthinkable before the constitutional and societal consequences of the Quiet Revolution (circa 1960s) in Quebec, and the passage of the Official Languages Act, 1969 by the federal parliament and the Official Language Act (Bill 22) in Quebec in 1974, which together mandated that tens of thousands of jobs in government and industry including high-paying professional and managerial work now required French.\nThe idea of using immersion as a language-learning tool is not a new one globally. However, it needed influential English-Canadian champions who were able to convince others both that French was worth learning and that immersion was the correct method before it spread in Canada.\nThe University of Western Ontario began offering a language home-stay program for young adults in Trois-Pistoles 1933, for example, because of the advocacy of Western's president, Dr. William Sherwood Fox, who had learned French by traveling in Quebec in 1900.\nThe \"founding mothers\" of elementary school French immersion in Canada are generally cited as Olga Melikoff, Valerie Neale, and Murielle Parkes from Saint-Lambert, Quebec, three English-speaking housewives who wanted to see their children learn French to a higher standard than was usually achieved in the English schools in Quebec at the time. Unable to convince the school authorities, they hired a teacher and ran their own kindergarten on the principals of early immersion. The promising results of the experiment in Saint-Lambert were studied and endorsed by researchers at McGill University, Wallace E. Lambert and Wilder Penfield. After this endorsement, the school board adopted the program and it was quickly copied by other boards across Canada. As the number of French immersion schools grew, larger academic studies showed the students had very good, though not native-level French, and had no major delay in English.\nThe founding of the advocacy group Canadian Parents for French in 1977 represented the mainstreaming of the program across Canada.\n\n\nDesign of the earliest school programs\nFrench immersion in the Canadian context differs markedly from other language programs aimed at teaching minorities the language of the majority (sometimes called \"submersion\" instead of immersion by critics). Researcher Marjorie Bingham Wesche offers the following contextual characteristics of the original Canadian model:\n\nLearners were majority language speakers, and there was no sense of \"threat\" against the status of English in their home communities.\nLearners were all in the \"same boat\" all learning French as true beginners, so teachers adjusted to their level (i.e. used Comprehensible Input)\nThe program was optional, and learners were thus \"volunteers\" whose parents enthusiastically encouraged their learning.\nBoth languages were valued by parents, the immediate community, and the larger society.\nThe two languages were related, and have many cognates and loanwords.\nSchool funding and decision making was under local political control, so the parents could pressure the board to take up their ideas.\nNative speaker teachers of the immersion language were widely available and were willing to teach to children from the other language community.\nSource material was easily accessible. French-medium textbooks and other materials were already available in Canada in a way that would have been very different for any other target language.\nBesides these contextual factors, the program's design also had a few key features:\n\nThe earliest possible school starting age (Kindergarten or Grade 1, aged four to six years).\nIntensive L2 exposure over an extended period.\nUse of the L2 to teach the entire school curriculum.\nMany variations have emerged since the earlier programs were designed; however, the original model (now called \"early immersion\") has produced good results and is still one of the most popular in Canada.\n\n\nTypical features\nFrench immersion education remains optional and not compulsory; parents have the choice of sending their children to schools that offer such programs. Students are encouraged to begin communicating in French as consistently as possible. Teachers in French immersion schools are competent in speaking French, either having acquired specific French as-a-second-language qualifications or already being fluent in French and having a teaching certification. Classroom communication of French in French immersion programs is meaningful and authentic for students. Learning French becomes subconscious and there is a strong focus on understanding before speaking. Most students that enroll in French immersion programs are not experts in French and lack experience in it. Students in French immersion programs complete the same core curriculum subjects as students in the English-language program.\nThe French immersion concept was designed to: (a) capitalize on children's ability to learn language naturally and effortlessly; (b) take advantage of their social ability and open attitudes to language and culture; (c) reflect on the building blocks of language by emphasizing the use of languages for communication and (d) not stopping the children from participating in native language development, academic achievement or general cognitive development.\n\n\nFormats\n\n\nPrograms\nFrench Immersion: French as the language of instruction\nExtended French: available only in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia; French as the language of instruction for one or two core subjects in addition to French Language Arts\nIntensive French: a more recent program which started in 1998 in Newfoundland and Labrador and branched out to six other provinces and the Northwest Territories; intensive period of French instruction for one-half of the school year (70% of school day in French)\n\n\nAge\nThe age an individual begins the French immersion program varies:\n\nEarly Immersion: Kindergarten or Grade One\nMiddle Immersion: Grade Four or Five\nLate Immersion: Grade Six, Seven, or Eight\n\n\nTime\nThe amount of time French immersion students spend in immersion varies:\n\nTotal: commences with 100% immersion in the second language and continually decreases to 50%\nPartial: commences with close to 50% immersion and remains at this level\n\n\nBenefits\nA study shows that French immersion might improve academic performance.\nStudents participate in French immersion programs to gain employability-related skills and to increase job opportunities.\nStudents in French immersion demonstrate a superior level of mental flexibility, which is an ability to think more independently of words and to have a higher awareness of concept formation as well as a more diversified intelligence than students in the regular program.\nData illustrates that students in French immersion programs also have a linguistic advantage as they are able to adopt two different perspectives, offering alternative ways to look at the same information.\nFrench immersion students also have a deeper appreciation and respect for various cultures. In addition, they also gain more fulfillment in learning a new language.\nStudents in French immersion programs also have greater opportunity to understand their own culture or their own nation. For example, Canada's identity is based on the fact that it holds two official languages, English and French. French immersion students have the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of what it means to be Canadian through the French immersion program.\n\n\nChallenges\nMany challenges in participating in French immersion programs persist. For example, many French immersion students do not reach native-like language proficiency in French. This could be due, in part, to the fact that there is a lack of willingness on the part of French immersion students to communicate in French outside of the classroom. This lack of willingness may stem from students not feeling prepared or equipped to practice the language.\nAccess to special education resources is often restricted to students in French immersion and as such, it is often suggested to parents that they switch their children to a regular English stream in order to access the support that their child requires. Nevertheless, such students still benefit from the French immersion program and resources aren't completely absent. French immersion teachers could go through professional development training and courses about special education integration for their programs, while, with parental involvement, create referral processes for special education in French immersion. However, where special education resources are insufficient, student outcomes may be less favourable.\nFrench immersion students from elementary schools often experience difficulties when entering a high school which provides the full curriculum in English only. This often leads to problems with \"both language and subject matter gaps in their learning\", according to a Toronto Star report. Students who do have access to a high school with French instruction may feel overwhelmed with having to learn heavy content in mathematics and science in their second language. Teachers in such schools can be equally overwhelmed with being restricted to using only French in these contexts, and may experience guilt when English is used in their classrooms to reinforce vocabulary and complex concepts. Some experts recommend debate within school boards and ministries about allowing the use of English in French immersion contexts when teaching complex concepts in mathematics and science.\nIt is extremely difficult for school boards in Canada to hire teachers who are fully fluent in French and also have experience and evidence of excellent teaching skills in the various subjects that they must teach in elementary schools, for example. As early as 1982, school boards in Winnipeg had to cap enrolment in French immersion due to high demand. A school board in the Greater Toronto Area reported in 2017 that 80% of principals recently reported finding it extremely difficult to hire French-speaking teachers of the same calibre as the English-speaking staff. In fact, in November 2017, the Halton Catholic District School Board was considering an end to their French immersion program for this reason. Some experts have suggested that research be conducted to seek strategies for French teacher recruitment to alleviate staff shortages in Canadian schools. Scholarship and bursary programs for prospective Bachelor of Education students to gain French teaching qualifications are also suggested to alleviate these shortages. The province of Ontario planned to open its first university where classes will be taught exclusively in French and this may alleviate the staffing problems eventually. By late 2017, the final recommendations from a planning board had been submitted to the government. The Université de l'Ontario français began accepting students in 2021.\nA report, by a PhD candidate scholar in educational policy at the University of Toronto, also discussed concerns about French immersion creating a dual track academic stream in many schools. She referred to a system \"where the smart, motivated kids are funnelled into French, and everyone else gets left behind in English\" which can become viewed as the \"de facto low track stream\". The author discussed a study at a Vancouver school, published in the British Journal of Sociology of Education, which concluded that \"French immersion programmes operate as a 'cream-skimming' phenomenon ... [that] allows white, middle class parents to access markers of higher social status and prestige.\" Similarly, a 2019 report from the Toronto District School Board found that French immersion programs had a higher percentage of students who have parents with a very high socio-economic status, raising fears of a two-tier school system.\nA report by the Canadian Council on Learning spoke on the failure of many students to learn French: \"Although most Canadian school children are taught English or French as a second language in school, these lessons often fail to yield functional bilingualism. For example, New Brunswick's French Second Language Commission recently reported that fewer than 1% of the students who enrolled in \"core French\" in 1994 had met the provincial minimum goal by 2007. And fewer than 10% of students who enrolled in early-French immersion in 1995 had attained the provincial goal by 2007.\"\n\n\nUse of French immersion programs\nFrench immersion programs were introduced into Canadian schools in the 1960s to encourage bilingualism across the country. Now immersion programs provide an alternative education stream for many students. Since their implementation, French immersion programs have become increasingly popular across Canada and school districts have seen significant increased enrolment in their French immersion student population over the years.\n\n\nK–12 education\nFrench immersion programs are offered in most Anglophone public school districts. French immersion is also done in some private schools and preschools.\n\n\nHigher education\nGenerally, colleges and universities in Canada teach in only one of the two official languages. Students must pass linguistic entrance exams to study in a language they did not complete their schooling in. All universities and many colleges will offer traditional language learning in the other official language; however, these are not immersion in the sense used in schools. A few institutions have both French and English faculties in the same university, but admission to individual courses still requires preexisting language skills. The University of Ottawa briefly offered specialized science classes for students studying in their second language during the 1980s, but these was phased out in favour of traditional language courses.\nTrue immersion occurs at summer programs that are part of the Explore program funded by the federal government, based on the Trois-Pistoles program at Western founded in 1933 (see above).\n\n\nRegional discrepancies\nFrench-immersion programs were offered in all ten Canadian provinces until 2022 when New Brunswick announced plans to abolish the program. The popularity of French immersion and \"core French\" differ by province and region. Note that these numbers refers to anglophone and allophone pupils: it does not include francophone mother-tongue students, who are enrolled in a separate school system altogether. Historically, enrolment in French immersion was proportionally highest in Quebec and New Brunswick, both provinces that have their own provincial language laws, above and beyond the federal Official Languages Act, which made knowledge of French even more valuable in the local job markets. French immersion enrolment in lowest in Western Canada and the North, where job requiring French are more rare. However all regions except New Brunswick (where the rules on eligibility were changed) experienced growth in proportionate and absolute terms between 2000 and 2012.\n\n\nCore French\n\n\nControversy\nOften, because French immersion is a \"program of choice\" and not a required part of the curriculum, school boards charge parents busing fees to have their children attend a school other than the one in their own neighbourhood. This is a financial barrier of a kind that is usually not accepted in Canada's culture of universal, public education.\nSince French immersion was designed for anglophone children learning French as a second language, it did not meet the needs of francophone children living in minority communities outside of Quebec. This problem was addressed by the creation of separate francophone school systems in the 1990s.\nIn 2008, an editorial in the Vancouver Sun criticized French immersion programs for having become a way for higher socioeconomic groups to obtain a publicly funded elite track education. Since lower socioeconomic groups and children with learning and behavioural problems have lower rates of participation in French immersion, a situation has developed in which ambitious families might prefer French immersion more for its effective streaming than for the bilingual skills it gives to students.\nEnrolment in French immersion programs has become difficult for immigrants to Canada, because it is argued by school administrators and board professionals that learning English as a second language presents enough of a challenge for students. The lack of accessibility to French immersion programs for English language learners is very similar to that for students with special needs.\nAs a result, the media places blame on Canada's immigrants for the declining number of Canadians who are able to speak English and French, while the immigrant community continues to pursue opportunities to become fluent in both official languages of Canada. It is suggested that Canada's education system provide more opportunities to immigrants to become proficient in English and French in order to increase the number of Canadians who have knowledge of both official languages.\n\n\nAttempted abolition in New Brunswick\nCritics argued that success of French immersion programs gave an unfair advantage to those students over other Anglophone students who only took \"core French\" (non-immersion, traditional language courses). This led to several attempts at reforms. In 2008, the government announced that the earliest possible starting year for full immersion would be raised to grade 6, but in the face of protests and court challenges later moved this to grade 3. Then in 2017 immersion starting in grade 1 was brought back.\n\nNew Brunswick is the only province with constitutionally-enshrined official bilingualism based on a model of perfect equality between the languages. Every ten years, the government of New Brunswick commissions a report on the status of bilingualism in that province. The 2022 report written by provincial court Judge Yvette Finn and former deputy education minister John McLaughlin found that while 90% of French of immersion students were conversant in French, less than 10% of students in the regular English stream were. This was considered a major problem by Premier Blaine Higgs as he has stated personal bilingualism for all New Brunswickers should be the goal of the education system. The report summarized its recommendations on the topic thusly:Our consultation and research have led us to one overwhelming conclusion: New Brunswick needs one strong, authentic, and engaging French second-language program of studies for all students in the Anglophone sector.As a result, Premier Higgs announced that while existing student in French immersion would be able to continue, new intakes of French immersion would cease in 2023 to be replaced by a yet-to-be-designed French curriculum for all non-Francophone students. Subsequently, the education minister resigned and the teachers' union protested that the timeline was much too quick for such a radical change.\nIn the face of intense backlash from parents, the Higgs government announced on February 17, 2023, that it would no longer proceed with the plan.\n\n\nOutside Canada\n\nThe Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger (AEFE) runs or funds 470 schools worldwide, with French as the primary language of instruction in most schools.\n\n\nAustralia\nFrench immersion is used in Australian schools such as Benowa State High School and The Southport School; teaching mathematics, SOSE, science and French, entirely in French.\nThere is also a French immersion program offered at Methodist Ladies' College and Mansfield State High School teaching a variety of subjects over three years in French.\nTelopea Park School in Canberra is a bilingual French–English school.\nThe program is also offered at The Glennie School in Toowoomba, Queensland.\nLycée Condorcet in Maroubra, Sydney, teaches almost entirely in French and conforms to the French government system, enabling students to easily transition to and from France to the school.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nWalker Road Primary School, Aberdeen, Scotland, started an early partial immersion program in 2000. Also, Judgemeadow Community College, Evington, in Leicester, has been using a French immersion course in one form group a year for the last four years. Pupils answer the register in French, and their French, IT and PHSE lessons are all in French. The Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle (originally Lycée Français de Londres) is a French school transported to England and as such the vast majority of the teaching is in French and caters to French curricula and indeed, as far as quatrième (at the age of 13–14), all pupils are taught entirely in French.\n\n\nUnited States\n\nPrivate French language immersion schools in the United States have existed since at least the 1950s. Most of these schools receive help from the AEFE. There are currently almost 40 of these schools in the United States.\nPublic school districts have run French immersion programs since 1974.\n\nMontgomery County, Maryland (since 1974)\nMilwaukee French Immersion School (since 1978)\nHolliston, Massachusetts (since 1979)\nLouisiana (since 1984) – 26 immersion programs in 9 parishes, supported by CODOFIL, a department of Louisiana's government that preserves Louisiana French culture within the state.\nPrince George's County, Maryland (since 1984)\nEugene, Oregon (since 1984)\nPortland, Oregon (since 1979)\nLake Charles, Louisiana (since 1985)\nMiami (since 1986)\nKansas City, Missouri\nMilton, Massachusetts (since 1987)\nColumbus, Ohio (since 1987)\nEdina, Minnesota (since 1991)\nSan Diego, California (since 1994)\nMadawaska, Maine (since 1995)\nSt. Paul, Minnesota (since 1996)\nNew York (since 2007)\nFairfax County, Virginia\nHenrico County, Virginia – High school French immersion program\nSanta Rosa, California (since 2012)\nFrank D. Parent Elementary School – French immersion program, West LA, Inglewood, California (since 2017)\nThe southern part of Louisiana has a strong French heritage extending back to colonial times. During the mid-twentieth century, however, the number of native French speakers plunged as French was banned in public schools and children were punished for speaking it. The social stigma associated with speaking French was strong enough that many parents did not teach the language to their children, so generations born in the second half of the century rarely spoke French in the home. As a result, French immersion is today viewed by parents and educators as a way to save the French language in Louisiana, where there are more French immersion programs than in any other state.\n\n\nSee also\n\nLanguage immersion\nStructured English Immersion\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nExternal links\nCanadian Parents for French\nFrench Immersion statistics\nSummer Camp in France",
    "summary": "French immersion is a form of bilingual education in which students who do not speak French as a first language will receive instruction in French. In most French-immersion schools, students will learn to speak French and learn most subjects such as history, music, geography, art, physical education and science in French.\nThis type of education, in which most of the students are from the majority language community but are voluntarily immersed in the minority language is atypical of most language learning around the world, and was developed in Canada as a result of political and social changes in the 1960s, notably the Official Languages Act, 1969 which led many Anglophones (primarily urban or suburban and middle class) to put their children in to French programs to ensure they could succeed in the increasing number of jobs in the federal government and private sector that required personal bilingualism.\nMost school boards in Canada offer French immersion starting in grade one and others start as early as kindergarten. At the primary level, students may receive instructions in French at or near a hundred percent of their instructional day, called \"total immersion\", or some smaller part of the day (\"partial immersion\"). In the case of total immersion, English instruction is introduced in perhaps grade three (Alberta) or grade four (Ontario), and the minutes of English instruction per day will increase throughout their educational career with up to fifty percent of English/French instruction daily.\nAs of 2020, 12% of Canadian students (excluding in Quebec) were enrolled in a French immersion program, compared to 34% who took conventional French classes in an otherwise-English school environment. As of 2021, 483,000 students were enrolled in French immersion programs only in public elementary and secondary schools in Canada outside Quebec and Nunavut.",

He was secretary of the Second Hand Club and was instrumental in the merger of the British hand surgery organisations to become the British Society for Surgery of the Hand.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHugh Stack was born in Bristol on 7 December 1915, the third son of Edward H. E. Stack FRCS, an ophthalmic surgeon at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and his wife Caroline, née Kennedy. He was educated at Clifton College, following which he received a scholarship to study chemistry at Bristol University. Three years later he switched career and enrolled at St Bartholemew's Hospital in London, to study medicine.\nHe married Lorna Cooke MRCP, in 1955. They had a daughter, Caroline, and a son, Charles, who became an anaesthetist.\n\n\nCareer\nStack first worked as a house surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital and the Miller General Hospital, Greenwich, after which he served for two years in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He was then honorary demonstrator in anatomy at King's College, London, and subsequently a surgical registrar at the North Middlesex Hospital. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1951 and from then on practised as an orthopaedic surgeon.\nHe then held appointments at the Miller Hospital and St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the Albert Dock Orthopaedic and Fracture Hospital, and the Harold Wood and Brentwood District Hospitals. It was while he was at St Bartholomew's that he became interested in reconstructive surgery of the hand in which he was influenced by Jackson Burrows, Osmond Clark, Norman Capener and Guy Pulvertaft.\nIn 1969, he wrote an influential article which highlighted the importance of naming the fingers (thumb, index, middle, ring, little) rather than numbering them (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), to avoid surgery on the wrong finger. In 1973, he was secretary of the Second Hand Club and was instrumental in the merger of the British hand surgery organisations to become the British Society for Surgery of the Hand. He was the first editor of The Hand, the forerunner of the Journal of Hand Surgery. He devised a splint - known as the Stack Splint - for the management of soft tissue mallet fingers.\nIn 1970, he was elected Hunterian Professor by the Royal College of Surgeons of England.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nStack died on 28 May 1992.

    "title": "Alphonso Ford",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=984324",
    "text": "Alphonso Gene Ford (October 31, 1971 – September 4, 2004) was an American professional basketball player. A 1.92 m (6 ft 3 3⁄4 in) tall, 98 kg (216 lbs.) shooting guard, he was one of the greatest scorers in college basketball history. After a short stint in the NBA, he played professionally in Europe.\nFord confirmed his tremendous scoring ability in the EuroLeague, and became a reference in the matter, notwithstanding his chronic health issues.\nHe was the EuroLeague Top Scorer twice (2001, 2002), and earned an All-EuroLeague selection three times. The competition's leading scorer award bears his name, in his honor.\n\n\nEarly years\nFord was a high school star player for Amanda Elzy High School in Greenwood, Mississippi. Upon entering college basketball at Mississippi Valley State University, Ford led the entire NCAA Division I in freshman scoring, during the 1989–90 season, with a 29.9 points per game average. In his sophomore year, he averaged 32.7 points per game. He became the first player in NCAA Division I history to average 25 points per game in four straight seasons. With 3,165 career points scored in the NCAA Division I, he is 5th on the all-time scoring list, behind only Pete Maravich, Freeman Williams, Lionel Simmons, and Chris Clemons. Ford was a four-time All-Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) selection; a feat that only he and Harry Kelly accomplished.\n\n\nProfessional career\n\n\nNBA and CBA\nFord played five games in the 1994–95 NBA season for the Philadelphia 76ers, who selected him 32nd overall in the 1993 NBA draft. Before that, he had played six games for the Seattle SuperSonics, in 1993–94. During both the 1993–94 and 1994–95 NBA seasons, Ford played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) for the Tri-City Chinook. He averaged 22.8 points per game in his rookie year with the Chinook and he was selected to the All-CBA First Team and named Rookie of the Year. Ford averaged 24.0 points per game during the 1994–95 season with the Chinook.\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nFirst steps towards European stardom\nIn the 1995–96 season, Ford signed with Spanish first division club Peñas Huesca. However, although he played great basketball and averaged 25.1 points per game in the Spanish League, he could not prevent the team's relegation. The next season was for Ford the opportunity to show his skills, in what was at the time Europe's most competitive national domestic league, the Greek Basket League. He spent the season with Papagou, and led the team to a ninth-place finish, while also being the Greek competition's leading scorer, with 23.9 points per contest. Nevertheless, glory at the European-wide level turned out to be a little bit more far away than the great scorer thought. Before the beginning of the 1997–98 season, he was diagnosed with leukemia, thus obliging Papagou to break his contract. The treatment cost Ford the whole season, but he was convinced that he had a lot more to contribute. He signed a one-year deal with Sporting, a traditional Greek club that was struggling to remain in Greece's top basketball scene. The gifted shooting guard helped the team finish in a decent eleventh-place finish, but most importantly, he defied his disease, in an utterly remarkable way.\nFord agreed to a two-year deal with the Greek club Nikas Peristeri, before the Greek Basket League 1999–2000 season, experiencing the game, within a team with considerably higher ambitions than any of the ones he had played for in the past. Needless to say, the challenge was accepted by the player, who would become a reference in the club's history. Ford averaged 22.7 points per game in the Greek League, leading Peristeri to a fifth-place finish in the league. Also, he made his first appearance in a European-wide competition, by playing in the European-wide 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup's 1999–2000 season, where he scored 20.7 points per game, and reached the competition's top 16 with his team, before they lost to Adecco Estudiantes.\n\n\nThe biggest scorer in EuroLeague's modern era\nThe real breakout season for Ford though, was going to be his second one with Peristeri, in 2000–01. The team contended for the Greek Basket League 2000–01 season title, and ended up in the league's third-place position, while he was named the league's MVP. In parallel, the club also took part in Euroleague Basketball's EuroLeague 2000–01 season, and Ford shined, while playing for the first time at the highest European-wide league level. He was the EuroLeague Top Scorer, averaging 26 points per game, and had a memorable 41-point outburst against Tau Ceramica in the competition's playoffs, scoring more than half of his team's 79 points that night. Tau qualified for the quarterfinals, sweeping the playoff series between the two teams, by two games to none, but Ford's performance is now part of the EuroLeague legend. Finally, his nomination to the All-EuroLeague 2000–01 First Team, was at the same time, a huge recognition, and an official introduction to superstar status.\nIn the 2001–02 season, the Greek EuroLeague powerhouse, Olympiacos, offered Ford a $1 million net income single-year contract. His mission was to bring a team that had not won anything since the triple crown in 1997, back to the top. Ford signed the deal, and the results were immediate: he led the Reds to a Greek Cup trophy, with 20 points, 7 assists and 3 rebounds, in the cup's semifinal against Bodiroga's Panathinaikos, and 24 points, 10 rebounds and 3 assists, in the cup's final game, to defeat Maroussi, by a score of 66–74. In the EuroLeague 2001–02 season, Olympiacos made it to the competition's Top 16 stage, and fell one game short of reaching the EuroLeague Final Four. Ford could actually not prevent an 85–89 home loss to Olimpija Ljubljana, although he had a solid performance that night, with 21 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. He was once again the EuroLeague's Top Scorer, at 24.8 points per game, and was selected to the All-EuroLeague 2001–02 Second Team. The season ended with a loss in the Greek League's championship finals series to AEK, with Ford missing the last two crucial games of the series, due to an injury.\nOlympiacos changed for the EuroLeague 2002–03 season. The major Greek EuroLeague clubs were forced to reduce their budgets, due to the renovation of their arenas for the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens. They therefore became considerably less competitive in the league. Ford's contract with Olympiacos was subsequently not renewed, and he signed a new contract with the Italian league's EuroLeague contender, Mens Sana Siena. Ford had a quick adaptation period to his new team, and although his scoring average in the EuroLeague dropped to 17.9 points per game, he was selected to the All-EuroLeague 2002–03 First Team, after Siena qualified to the 2003 EuroLeague Final Four. Unfortunately, Ford had one of his worst shooting nights ever, in the semifinal against Benetton Treviso: he scored 15 points, making only 5 of his 19 shots. His 7 rebounds and 2 steals did not allow his team to overcome Benetton's obstacle, as they lost 62–65 in a highly intense game. In the Italian League 2002–03 season, Ford averaged 19.1 points per game, and Siena finished in fourth place in the league.\n\n\nFinal season and death\nDespite his leukemia being in an advanced stage, Ford played the Italian League 2003–04 season with Scavolini Pesaro. Averaging 22.2 points per game in the Italian League, Ford, in his final season, helped Scavolini finish in fourth place in the Italian League, which meant the team qualified to the next season's EuroLeague, and to the Italian Cup's runner-up position, despite being near death.\nLess than two weeks after announcing his retirement from the EuroLeague, Ford died from leukemia, at age 32.  He is survived by his wife Paula, their daughter Quekenshia, and their sons Karlderek, Alphonso Jr. In Ford's honor, the EuroLeague named its trophy for the leading scorer of the year, the Alphonso Ford EuroLeague Top Scorer Trophy. The player who replaced Ford on Scavolini Pesaro, following his death, Charles Smith, would win the award the very next season.\nIn 2021, a documentary dedicated to the life of Alphonso Ford, titled Alphonso Ford: Score Until The Last Day, premiered at the Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival, receiving critical acclaim.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nCollege\n\n\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I men's basketball career scoring leaders\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nAlphonso Ford at nba.com\nAlphonso Ford at basketballreference.com\nAlphonso Ford at euroleague.net\nAlphonso Ford at fibaeurope.com\nAlphonso Ford at acb.com (in Spanish)\nAlphonso Ford at legabasket.it (in Italian)\nAlphonso Ford at esake.gr (in Greek)\nAlphonso Ford at baskethotel.com",

The play was altered on 1 February 1732 and this revised edition was seen as a great improvement.\n\n\nBackground\nAfter Fielding returned to work for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery. It was a companion piece, in the form of ballad opera, that first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside of Addison's Cato. The piece contained 19 songs and was a collaboration with \"Mr Seedo\", a musician. It is uncertain as to when Seedo first started working with Fielding, but he may have started with Fielding during 1730 at the Little Haymarket theatre.\nThe play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. Fielding altered the play on 1 February 1732 by removing four songs and adding seven midway through the play. The revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The play was published 7 January 1732 by Watts.\n\n\nCast\nCast of characters:\n\nLovemore – Charles Stoppelar\nChloe – played by Kitty Clive\nJack Stocks – played by Theophilus Cibber\nTicket Renter – played by John Harper\n\n\nPlot\nFielding's prologue begins with his definition of various genres and his understanding of \"Farce\", even though many of his works are more ballad opera than actual farce:\n\nAs Tragedy prescribes to Passion Rules,\nSo Comedy delights to punish Fools;\nAnd while at nobler Game she boldly flies,\nFarce challenges the Vulgar as her Prize.\nSome Follies scarce perceptible appear\nIn that just Glass, which shews you as you are.\nBut Farce still claims a magnifying Right,\nTo raise the Object larger to the Sight,\nAnd shew her Insect Fools in stronger Light.\nLovemore loves a girl named Chloe. Instead of accepting him as a suitor, Chloe travels into London with the hope that she will win a 10,000 pound lottery prize. She convinces herself so much of this fate that she begins to boast of having a fortune already. Jack Stocks, a man wanting that fortune, takes on the identity of Lord Lace and seeks her in marriage. It is revealed that the ticket was not a winner. Lovemore, a man who has romantically pursued her through the play, offers Stocks 1,000 pounds for Chloe's hand, and the deal is made.\nIn the revised edition of the play, more characters are added who desire to win the lottery and there is a stronger connection made between Chloe and Lovemore. The revised version ends with Jack, her husband at the time, being paid off to no longer have claim to Chloe as his wife even though everyone knows that she did not win.\n\n\nThemes\nThe Lottery pokes fun at the excitement surrounding the lottery held during the fall of 1731. In particular, Fielding mocks both those who sell or rent tickets and those who purchase the tickets. The portrayal of the ticket vendors emphasised the potential for deceit and the amount of scams that were possible. It also attacked how the vendors interacted with each other in a competitive spirit. Fielding expects that his audience understands how the lottery operated and focused on how gambling cannot benefit gamblers.\nOthers, such as Hogarth in The Lottery (1724), rely on similar images of Fortune as in Fielding's plays. However, Fielding differs from Hogarth by adding a happy ending to the portrayal of the lottery system. This was not the only time Fielding relies on the lottery system; he also includes ticket vendors in his play Miss Lucy in Town and in his novel Tom Jones.\n\n\nSources\nThe lottery that the play is directly connected to took place during November–December 1731. It was part of the State Lottery that was in place since 1694. The system continued to be lucrative for the British Parliament over the 18th-century. The system in place during 1731 consisted of 80,000 tickets sold with only 8,000 connected to prizes. The top prize, of which there were two available, was 10,000 pounds. The drawing of the numbers lasted for forty days and consisted of numbers being picked from a large container that are then determined as either a winner or a \"blank\", which means that no prize would be received. This lottery system came under fire because, it was argued, they promoted gambling and took advantage of people. Problems grew worse when second hand vendors began to sell the tickets at high prices.\n\n\nResponse\nThe play was a success and earned Fielding a great deal of money. F. Homes Dudden believed that \"The Lottery, with its well-drawn leading character, its clever little songs, and its humorous yet biting criticism of lottery abuses, scored an immediate success, and, indeed, for many years continued to be a favourite with the public.\" Edgar Roberts emphasises the importance of The Lottery as the play that \"set the pattern for his ballad operas during the next three years at Drury Lane: happy, lightly satirical, and for the most part nonpolitical.\" Robert Hume believes that the play was a \"rollicking little ballad\" and that the revised version \"is a major improvement\".\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBattestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

    "text": "The Arab sign-language family is a family of sign languages spread across the Arab Middle East. Its extent is not yet known, because only some of the sign languages in the region have been compared.\nA language planning project for a single Arabic Sign Language is being conducted by the Council of Arab Ministers of Social Affairs (CAMSA), with much of the vocabulary voted on by regional Deaf associations. However, so far only a dictionary has been compiled; grammar has not been addressed, so the result cannot be considered a language.\n\n\nLinguistics\nUnlike spoken Arabic, Arabic sign languages (ArSLs) are not diglossic. This means that there is one version of an Arabic sign language used by a community, rather than two versions, i.e. colloquial and formal, as is the case with the Arabic language.\n\n\nGrammar\nThe sentence structure of ArSLs is relatively flexible, similar to spoken and written Arabic. One sentence can be signed in different word orders, such as Verb-Subject-Object (V-S-O), Subject-Verb-Object (S-V-O), Object-Verb-Subject (O-V-S) and Verb-Object-Subject (V-O-S.)\nThe tense (present, future or past) of a sentence is usually referred to in the beginning of that sentence, except when they need to be changed during a conversation. In this case, the tense can be shifted towards the middle or the end of the sentence.\n\n\nVocabulary\nAccording to M.A. Abdel-Fattah, a linguistic scholar, the vocabulary of ArSLs could originate from:\n\nLoan words from both Europe and America,\n\"Creations\"; having existing gestures for verbal words, whether written or spoken,\n\"Miming\" physical objects or actions,\nCompounding two or more signs to create a unique sign, such as \"dentist\" which is a combination of \"doctor\" and \"teeth\".\nIn ArSLs, just like other sign languages, the context of the word depends on the shape of the hand, alongside its position and movement relative to the body. To aid in the meaning of the sign, facial expressions and facial movements are also used.\nMost signs in ArSLs are limited to nouns and verbs, but for prepositions and intensifiers, it is the execution of the sign which indicates the two. For example, in Libyan Sign Language, the sign \"every day\" involves touching the nose with the index finger and repeating it three times.\nAccording to Abdel-Fatteh, certain vocabulary in ArSLs are synosigns, antosigns, homosigns and compounds.\n\n Synosigns are two distinct signs with the same meaning. In ArSLs, these are uncommon. An example of a synosign is in Jordanian Sign Language, where the sign for 'girl' can be done in two different ways.\nAntosigns are two signs corresponding to opposite words; with both signs having opposite movements. An example of antosigns are the signs for \"morning\" and \"night\", where the sign for \"night\" is movement-wise the reverse of the sign for \"morning.\"\nA homosign is a sign that can be used for multiple words and the interpretation of which depends on the topic of the conversation.\nCompounds are signs that use two or more existing signs to convey an idea. The words for which signs need to be compounded don't typically have corresponding signs. For example, the signs for \"doctor\" and \"teeth\" would need to be compounded to sign \"dentist.\"\n\n\nVarieties\nDespite having many sign language varieties in the Middle East under the broader \"Arabic Sign Language\", it is unlikely that any of these languages are related to each other. Among the national sign languages which may be related are the following, listed in alphabetical order:\n\n\nEgyptian Sign Language\nEgyptian Sign Language is used by the deaf community in Egypt.\n\n\nEmirati Sign Language\nEmirati Sign Language is a unified sign language for the deaf community in the UAE.\n\n\nIraqi Sign Language\nIraqi Sign Language is used by the deaf community in Iraq.\n\n\nKuwaiti Sign Language\nKuwaiti Sign Language is the sign language used by the hearing-impaired people of Kuwait.\n\n\nLevantine Arabic Sign Language\nLevantine Arabic Sign Language is utilized by the people residing in the Levant region and includes Jordanian Sign Language (LIU) and Palestinian Sign Language, among others.\n\n\nLibyan Sign Language\nLibyan Sign Language is the sign language of the deaf community in Libya.\n\n\nOmani Sign Language\nOmani Sign Language\n\n\nQatari Sign Language\nQatari Sign Language is a unified sign language for the deaf community in Qatar.\n\n\nSaudi Sign Language\nSaudi Sign Language is used by the deaf community in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nYemeni Sign Language\nYemeni Sign Language is the sign language used in Yemen.\nOther languages of the region appear to not be related. Moroccan Sign Language derives from American Sign Language, and Tunisian Sign Language from Italian Sign Language. There are numerous local Sudanese sign languages which are not even related to each other, and there are many other Arab village sign languages in the region, such as Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language and Ghardaia Sign Language, which are not related to the national languages.\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\"Unified\" Arabic Sign Language\nTo unify the Arab World with one distinct sign language that can be understood throughout the MENA region, a dictionary for a standard Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) has been produced in 2004 by the Council of Arab Ministers of Social Affairs (CAMSA). This dictionary consists of a combination of signs from a wide range of mostly unrelated Arab sign languages such as Egyptian Sign Language and Jordanian Sign Language.  \nThis \"Standardized\" Arabic Sign Language has been applied by interpreters in news outlets like Al-Jazeera in their news broadcasting, including simultaneous interpreting.\nHowever, the introduction of ArSL has been met with backlash by the deaf community, because it is not the native sign language of any country in the region. There are also wide disparities between the vocabulary of the standardized version and the national sign languages. As a result, it is difficult for the deaf community in the Middle East to understand the Standardized version and so use it.\n\n\nAccess to Services\nAn international survey was conducted by Hilde Haualand in 2009, which investigated the accessibility of sign language interpreters, as well as the training and support the Deaf community receives. This survey included the MENA region. Regions that were investigated in the survey included Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE and Yemen.\nA participant representing each country in the survey answered five yes/no questions, which included:\n\nIf the deaf could access government services\nIf there is a \"Sign Language interpreting service\" in their country\nIf Interpreters have any interpreting qualifications\nif there is a Code of Ethics for Interpreters\nIf the government was responsible for their salaries\nA yes response to each of these questions yields one point, with five points being the maximum for any country. Qatar was the only country in the survey that had five points, meaning they satisfied all the aforementioned five criteria relating to accessibility. Bahrain and Kuwait satisfied the first four questions. Oman, Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and UAE had three points, meaning they had answered \"yes\" to the first three questions. Algeria, Morocco and Lebanon had two points and Yemen had one point.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAl-Fityani, K. (2007). \"Arab Sign Languages: A lexical comparison\".

    "title": "Arab–Islamic nationalism",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=79210356",
    "text": "Arab–Islamic nationalism (Arabic: القومية العربية الإسلامية) is a political and religious ideology that fuses Arab nationalism, which is otherwise generally secular in nature, with Islamism. It is prevalent among some Arab Muslims on the basis of the early Muslim conquests and the accompanying socio-cultural changes across West Asia and North Africa and beyond. It may be closely associated with pan-Arabism, as evidenced by the pan-Arab colours that are derived from the legacy of the caliphates during the spread of Islam: black and white for the Rashidun, Abbasids, and Umayyads; green for Islam; and red for the Hashemites. \n\n\nEarly instances\nElements of the ideology emerged after the Muslim conquest of Persia. Many Arab Muslims, including some leaders, held nationalistic tendencies in their approach to the Persians. This continued during the First Fitna in 656, which replaced the Rashidun Caliphate with the Umayyad Caliphate. There were strong tensions between Arabs and Persians.\nMistreatment of non-Arabs became a general rule under the Umayyad Caliphate. They were denied any positions in the government under Umayyad rule. Non-Arab Muslims had to pay taxes which were not imposed on Arab Muslims. Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ordered the non-Arabs to speak Arabic, and it was sometimes enforced.\nAfter the Second Fitna, the Umayyads launched a campaign of simultaneous Islamization and Arabization. Arabic became the sole official language of the Umayyad state. Umar ibn Abdulaziz introduced some reforms to improve the situation of non-Arab Muslims, also referred to as mawali. Since non-Arabs who converted to Islam were no longer required to pay jizya, the Umayyads did not encourage conquered nations to accept Islam, and attempted to limit Islam to Arabs.\nNon-Arab Muslims later joined the Abbasid Revolution, officially ending the Umayyad Caliphate. In the Umayyad hierarchy, Arab Muslims were first, followed by Non-Arab Muslims, followed by Dhimmis, followed by slaves. The Umayyads initiated Arabization campaigns in the Levant, Mesopotamia, Persia, the Maghreb, Iberia, and Central Asia.\nThe Umayyads later became a symbol of Arab nationalism. The white in pan-Arab colors represents the Umayyads.\n\n\nHistory\nThe ideology officially emerged as an organized ideology towards the end of the Ottoman Empire. Early Arab nationalists believed that the Arabs existed as a nation prior to the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, and that the Arabic language and Islam were pillars of the Arab nation. In the 1860s, Arab nationalist literature in the Mashriq strongly criticised Ottoman Turks for \"betraying Islam\" and Arabs. They claimed that the Ottomans had deviated from Islam and thus suffered decline. They also criticized the Ottomans adopting certain Western policies, and accused the Ottomans of putting Islam in the bad situation it was in. Arab nationalist rejection of Ottoman authority was first seen in the 1860s, although it was limited since the ideology was small and new. Many Arab scholars viewed the Ottoman claim to the caliphate as an usurpation of Arab-Islamic leadership after the Ottomans captured Cairo from the Mamluks in 1517, abolishing the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Arab-Islamic nationalists regularly made similar claims about Turks. Sati' al-Husri, a pan-Arabist and a Muslim, wrote of how non-Arab peoples, especially the Turks, seized control of Islam after its initial Arab leadership. He claimed that the moment Turks converted to Islam, Islam became a tool of Turkish rule rather than Arab civilization. Michel Aflaq, despite being Christian, often claimed that the Islam practiced by Turks was incorrect, and that Turks did not understand Islam, using it only as a took of imperialism. Arab nationalists in the French Mandate of Syria regularly expressed regret over the Arab conquests of Central Asia, claiming that if Turks never converted to Islam, the caliphate would have still existed in Mecca. Iraqi educational texts during the rule of Saddam Hussein portrayed the Ottoman Turks as foreign imperialists who ruined Arab unity. In several cases, official rhetoric claimed that the Arabs should not have spread Islam to Turks, and that the Turks would later rule over the Arabs with tyranny and ignorance. Muhammad Jalal Kishk argued that Turkish domination over Islam after the Abbasid decline resulted in the spread of irrational Sufism, absolutism, and cultural stagnation, saying. He also stated that the moment Arabs lost the Islamic leadership, the Turks kept Islam alive by name yet destroyed its meaning.\nThe Association of Algerian Muslim Ulama, founded in 1931, also adhered to the ideology. Its motto was \"Islam is our religion, Algeria is our homeland, Arabic is our language\". It emphasized on Algeria being a fully Arab and Islamic nation. Its founder, Abdelhamid ibn Badis, stated that the three main components of the Algerian national character consisted of Islam, Arabism, and nationalism.\nAmin al-Husseini was another advocate of the ideology. Rashid Rida called for a restored Arab-led caliphate, believing that only the Arabs could faithfully lead the ummah. Hasan al-Banna emphasized that the Islamic revival in Egypt was inseparable from the Arab character of Egypt, and saw Arab lands as the natural heart of the ummah. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, particularly during the 1970s–80s, framed its opposition to the Assad government as both an Islamic and Arab-nationalist struggle.\nThe Arab–Israeli conflict strengthened the role of Islam as a defining feature of Arab nationalism. The humiliation felt by the Arabs in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War strengthened Pan-Arabism. Pan-Arabism was initially a secular movement. Arab nationalists generally rejected religion in politics, and believed that Arabs were Arabs regardless of religion. However, with Islam being the majority religion among Arabs, it was obvious that Islam would assert some influence on Arab nationalism. Michel Aflaq, a Christian, viewed Islam as an example of the \"Arab genius\", and once stated that \"Muhammad was the epitome of all the Arabs. So let all the Arabs today be Muhammed.\" They claimed that Islam had given Arabs a \"glorious past\", unlike the \"shameful present\".\nAlbert Hourani noted that a significant amount of Arab Muslims remained attached to the idea that Arab leadership in Islam was both natural and providential because of the language of the Quran and the origin of Muhammad.\nThe ideology declined in Iraq under Abdul-Karim Qasim, who was against both Arab nationalism and Islamism. Nationalism was unpopular among Shia Arabs in Iraq, and they saw Arab nationalism as \"a Sunni project\" to establish \"Sunni hegemony\", due to the movement being dominated by Sunnis.\nThe relationship of Arab nationalism and Islam worsened, and Arab nationalism declined after the Israeli victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, in which the Arab nationalist movement faced an \"irreversible\" shift to \"political marginality\". During the Arab Spring, secular Arab nationalism further declined. As many Arabs were disgusted by the corruption of secular Arab nationalists, there was an \"increasingly violent competition between the state and political Islam for the loyalty, as well as for the hearts and minds of the Arab citizen\".\nAfter the decolonization of Morocco, there was a growing movement aiming for the official implementation of \"Arabo-Islamic culture\". When the Istiqlal Party took power, it was successfully implemented.\nIn October 1963, Ahmed Ben Bella released the Algerian constitution, which asserted that Islam was the state religion, Arabic was the sole national and official language, Algeria was an integral part of the Arab world, and that Arabization was the first priority of the country to reverse French colonization. While trying to build an independent nation-state, the Algerian government under Ahmed Ben Bella began a policy of Arabization, motivated by Islam and nationalism. Algeria relied on Egyptian teachers belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood for religious education, due to the lack of Quranic Arabic speakers in Algeria. Houari Boumédiène drafted a new Algerian constitution in 1976, also dedicating it to Arab nationalism and Islam. He imposed Arab socialism as the state ideology and Islam as the state religion, and was more effective than Ahmed Ben Bella.\nOmar al-Bashir advocated for the ideology, and implemented it during his rule in Sudan. Abdul Salam Arif, one of the leaders of the Ramadan Revolution, also adhered to the ideology. Khairallah Talfah drew criticism when he stated that \"Islam without Arabism is Shu'ubiyya\". Saddam Hussein was another advocate of the ideology, especially after June 1993, in which he launched the Faith Campaign with much help from Izzat al-Douri. The campaign aimed to promote Islamism and encourage religiosity in Iraqi society. The Iraqi Ba'ath Party was Islamized, although it maintained its Arab nationalism and continued to encourage it. This was described as a \"full-scale politicisation of Islam\" by Saddam Hussein, and marked a shift away from the secular rule of the 1980s and 1970s. Saddam Hussein viewed Islam as being synonymous to the Arab nation, stating that Arabs would decline without Islam, and Islam would decline without Arabs. He claimed that a \"Muslim who hates the Arabs cannot be a Muslim, because the Arabs are the leading force of Islam as they are of all heavenly religions.\" Saddam Hussein and his supporters referred to the Iran–Iraq War as \"Saddam's Qadisiyyah\" (قادسية صدام, Qādisiyyat Ṣaddām), in reference to the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, in which the Arabs defeated the Sasanians. Iraqi general Maher Abdul Rashid used chemical weapons on Iran, and referred to Iranians as \"majusi insects\".\n\n\nViews on other nations\nSome Arab Muslims did not welcome Persian converts and saw them as usurpers. The Umayyads encountered the Turkic peoples during the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana led by Qutayba ibn Muslim. There were tensions between the Umayyads and the local Turks, and the Umayyad policies delayed the Turkic conversions to Islam. When the Abbasids emerged, Turks began converting to Islam on larger levels. Turks also sided with the Abbasids against the Tang dynasty.\nKurds formed alliances with Persians and revolted many times against the Umayyads. Kurdish communities became significant participants in the major uprising led by Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Ash'ath against Umayyad rule under Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Historical records indicate that ibn al-Ash'ath formed a coalition with Kurdish groups from the Saburan region of Fars province in 83 AH (702 CE). Several years later, in 90 AH (708 CE), the Iraqi provincial governor Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf took punitive action, including military campaigns against the Kurdish population of Fars in response to the disturbances they had caused throughout the province. By 117 AH (735 CE). However, the relations of the Umayyads with the Kurds greatly improved under Marwan II, who was born to a Kurdish mother. When the Umayyads collapsed, some of them were given refuge by the Kurds. Among them was a direct descendant of Marwan II, Adi ibn Musafir, the founder of Adawiyya, a heterodox tariqa which eventually evolved into Yazidism.\nHassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, while rejecting nationalism and discrimination, believed that the real reason Islam declined was because of the transfer of authority from Arabs to non-Arabs.\nThe Umayyads began the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb led by Uqba ibn Nafi. The Umayyads faced strong resistance from the Berbers, led by Kahina and Kusaila in the 680s. In 687 AD Arab reinforcements arrived under Zuhayr ibn Qays, where they defeated and killed Kusaila in 688 AD at the Battle of Mamma. the Arabs under Hasan ibn al-Nu'man, defeated and killed Kahina at the Battle of Tabarka. Arab migrations to the Maghreb significantly increased, and by the 7th century, the Arabs overwhelmed the Berbers, gradually converting the Berbers to Islam and capturing the Maghreb. Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik continued the Arabization and stated \"I will not leave a single Berber compound without pitching beside it a tent of a tribesman from Qays or Tamim\". Berbers went on to launch the Berber Revolt. After Algerian independence, Ahmed Ben Bella implemented Arab nationalist and Islamist policies in his decolonization campaign, and repressed Berber cultural rights. In 1968, under Houari Boumediene, the Arabization and Islamization was extended. Berber opposition to the Arabization continued, and some Berbers, like the Kabyles, feared for their ancestral culture and language. After the Algerian Civil War, the government tried to further enforce the use of Arabic. In 2002, the state recognized the Berber language. However, the Algerian government continued the Arabization, citing the literary, religious, and symbolic advantage of the Arabic language, as well as Arabic being a single language as opposed to the diverse Berber languages which were not standardized. Although Islamism generally disapproved of nationalism, Islamists in Algeria often held Anti-Berber views.\nOmar al-Bashir implemented Arab nationalist and Islamist policies, which included the arming of the Janjaweed and Muraheleen, who were motivated by the ideology during the Darfur genocide.\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "Arab–Islamic nationalism (Arabic: القومية العربية الإسلامية) is a political and religious ideology that fuses Arab nationalism, which is otherwise generally secular in nature, with Islamism. It is prevalent among some Arab Muslims on the basis of the early Muslim conquests and the accompanying socio-cultural changes across West Asia and North Africa and beyond. It may be closely associated with pan-Arabism, as evidenced by the pan-Arab colours that are derived from the legacy of the caliphates during the spread of Islam: black and white for the Rashidun, Abbasids, and Umayyads; green for Islam; and red for the Hashemites.

    "text": "The Green Party of Alaska (GPAK) is a political party in the U.S. state of Alaska. It was the Alaska affiliate of the Green Party of the United States from 2001 until 2021. Alaska was the first state in which the Green Party gained ballot access when Jim Sykes ran for governor of Alaska in 1990. Sykes had previously filed a ballot access lawsuit, citing an earlier case, Vogler v. Miller.\nIn 2020, the leadership of the Green Party of Alaska refused to place Green Party nominees Howie Hawkins and Angela Nicole Walker on the ballot and instead draft-nominated a ticket with Jesse Ventura for president and Cynthia McKinney for vice-president. McKinney accepted the vice-presidential nomination. Because of this, the Green Party of the United States national committee voted in January 2021 to decertify the GPAK.\n\n\nIssues\nThe Green Party of Alaska is opposed to industrial oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It supports the development of alternative fuels and energy sources such as wind power and solar power.\nThe party supports a national single-payer healthcare system.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEarly history (1990–2020)\n\n\nBallot status\nThe Green Party first gained ballot access in 1990, but lost its Recognized Political Party status in 2002. Ballot access was regained in 2003 based on a court order, lost again in 2005, and regained in February 2006 when Superior Court Judge Stephanie Joannides issued a preliminary injunction against the State of Alaska, preventing the state from denying access to the Green Party. On June 3, 2007 a lower Alaska state court upheld Alaska's new definition of \"political party\" and the Green Party of Alaska was removed from the ballot. The judge wrote that she had to uphold the new definition of \"political party\", because the Alaska Supreme Court had upheld the old definition of \"political party\" on November 17, 2006.\nIn 2005, the party sued the State of Alaska over the issue of joint primary ballots and won in the Supreme Court of Alaska.\nIn 2012, the Alaska Green party put forth a statewide petition, seeking status as a \"limited political party\" which would allow them to put names on the ballot for presidential and vice-presidential candidates. A total of 3,273 signatures is needed in Alaska to qualify as a limited political party. The Alaskan Greens submitted approximately 4,500 signatures.\n\n\nDecertification by GPUS (2020–present)\nIn late 2020, the Alaska Green Party broke from the Green Party of the United States and nominated former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura and former U.S. Representative and 2008 Green Party presidential nominee Cynthia McKinney for president and vice president respectively, instead of Howie Hawkins and Angela Nicole Walker. The Ventura–McKinney ticket received 2,673 (0.74%) votes.\nIn January 2021, as the result of breaking with the GPUS, the GPAK was officially decertified, and as a result is no longer the Alaskan state party chapter of the GPUS. The GPUS has begun the process of replacing it with a new GPAK.\n\n\nOrganization\n\n\nElections\nThe Green Party of Alaska has gained more than 10% of the votes in past presidential and congressional elections.  The most notable example was in 2000, when Alaska voters gave presidential candidate Ralph Nader his highest state percentage.  Nader made headlines when he carried the Girdwood precinct, located at the extreme southern end of Anchorage corporate limits.  In 1996, the party's U.S. Senate nominee Jed Whittaker came in second, out-polling Democratic nominee Theresa Obermeyer, who had been disowned by her party.\nThe first election victory associated with the Alaska Green party was in 1991, when environmentalist Kelly Weaverling was elected mayor of Cordova, then a town of about 2,500. Weaverling had previously drawn national attention for his work in the aftermath of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Prince William Sound. Municipal elections in Alaska are nonpartisan, though Weaverling's association with the party was highly publicized at the time.\n\n\nSee also\nList of State Green Parties\nPolitics of Alaska\nGovernment of Alaska\nElections in Alaska\nPolitical party strength in Alaska\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nAlaska Division of Elections.

    "text": "Isabelle Yasmine Adjani (born 27 June 1955) is a French actress and singer. She has received various accolades, including five César Awards and a Lumière Award, along with nominations for two Academy Awards. Adjani was made a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur in 2010 and a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2014.\nAdjani has won a record five Césars for Best Actress for Possession (1981), One Deadly Summer (1983), Camille Claudel (1988), La Reine Margot (1994), and La Journée de la jupe (2009). Her other César-nominated roles were in The Story of Adèle H. (1975), Barocco (1976), Subway (1985), and The World Is Yours (2018). Other notable films include The Slap (1974), The Tenant (1976), The Driver (1978), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), All Fired Up (1982), Deadly Circuit (1983), Ishtar (1987), Diabolique (1996), Adolphe (2002), Bon voyage (2003), French Women (2014), and Peter von Kant (2022).\nAdjani came to international prominence for her portrayal of Adèle Hugo in The Story of Adele H., for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress at age 20, becoming the youngest nominee in the category at the time. She later collected a second Best Actress nomination for portraying Camille Claudel in Camille Claudel, thus becoming the first French actress to receive two Academy Award nominations for foreign-language films. Adjani also won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actress Award for her performances in Possession and Quartet (1981), which makes her the only actress to win a joint award for two films in the same competition slate, and the Berlinale's Silver Bear for Best Actress for Camille Claudel.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nIsabelle Yasmine Adjani was born on 27 June 1955 in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, to  Mohammed  Cherif Adjani, an Algerian Muslim from Constantine, and Emma Augusta \"Gusti\" Schweinberger, a German Catholic from Bavaria.\nAdjani's parents met near the end of World War II, when her father was in the French Army and stationed in Germany. They married and her mother returned with him to Paris, despite not speaking a word of French. She asked him to take Cherif as his first name as she thought it sounded more \"American\".\nIsabelle grew up bilingual, speaking French and German fluently, in Gennevilliers, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where her father worked in a garage. After winning a school recitation contest, Adjani began acting by the age of 12 in amateur theater. She successfully passed her baccalauréat and was auditing classes at the University of Vincennes in 1976.\nAdjani had a younger brother, Éric, who was a photographer. He died on 25 December 2010, aged 53.\n\n\nActing career\n\nAt the age of 14, Adjani starred in her first motion picture, Le Petit Bougnat (1970). She first gained fame as a classical actress at the Comédie-Française, which she joined in 1972. She was praised for her interpretation of Agnès, the main female role in Molière's L'École des femmes. She soon left the theatre to pursue a film career.\nAfter minor roles in several films, she enjoyed modest success in the 1974 film La Gifle (The Slap), which François Truffaut saw. He immediately cast her in her first major role in The Story of Adèle H. (1975), a project that he had finished writing five years prior but had waited to cast the right actress for the part. Critics unanimously praised her performance, with the American critic Pauline Kael describing her acting talents as \"prodigious\".\nOnly 19 when she made the film, Adjani was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, becoming the youngest Best Actress nominee at the time (a record she held for almost 30 years). She quickly received offers for roles in Hollywood films, such as Walter Hill's 1978 crime thriller The Driver. She had previously turned down the chance to star in films like The Other Side of Midnight. She had described Hollywood as a \"city of fiction\" and said, \"I'm not an American. I didn't grow up with that will to win an award.\" Truffaut on the other hand said, \"France is too small for her. I think Isabelle is made for American cinema.\" She agreed to make The Driver because she was an admirer of Hill's first film Hard Times. Adjani said:\n\nI think he is wonderful, very much in the tradition of Howard Hawks, lean and spare. The story is contemporary but also very stylized, and the roles that Ryan and I play are like Bogart and Bacall. We are both gamblers in our souls and we do not show our emotions or say a lot. For us, talk is cheap. I am really quite a mysterious girl in this film, with no name and no background. And I must say that it is restful not to have a life behind me; this way, I don't have to dig deep to play the part. All I know is that life for me is gambling and I am a loser. I have what people call a poker face.\nThe film was seen more than 1.1 million times in Adjani's native France but did not do as well in the US.\nShe played Lucy in the German director Werner Herzog's 1979 remake of Nosferatu which was well-received critically and performed well at box offices in Europe. Roger Ebert loved the film, calling Herzog's casting of Adjani one of his \"masterstrokes\" in the film. He wrote that she \"is used here not only for her facial perfection but for her curious quality of seeming to exist on an ethereal plane.\" The cast and the crew filmed both English- and German-language versions simultaneously upon request of 20th Century Fox, the American distributor, as Kinski and Bruno Ganz could act more confidently in their native language.\nIn 1981, she received a double Cannes Film Festival's Best Actress award for her roles in the Merchant Ivory film Quartet, based on the novel by Jean Rhys, and in the horror film Possession (1981). The following year, she received her first César Award for Possession, in which she had portrayed a woman having a nervous breakdown.\nIn 1983, she won her second César for her depiction of a vengeful woman in the French blockbuster One Deadly Summer, and starred with Michel Serrault in the black diamond thriller Deadly Circuit directed by Claude Miller. That same year, Adjani released the French pop album Pull marine, written and produced by Serge Gainsbourg. She then starred in a music video for the hit title song, Pull Marine, which was directed by Luc Besson.\nAdjani also drew controversy at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival when she refused to attend a traditional photocall after the press conference for One Deadly Summer. Adjani was annoyed at the time by the intrusion of photographers into her private life. The photographers in Cannes boycotted Adjani upon her arrival on the red carpet for the premiere, at which point they put down their cameras and turned their backs to her.\nIn 1988, she co-produced and starred in a biopic of the sculptor Camille Claudel. She received her third César and second Oscar nomination for her role in the film, becoming the first French actress to receive two Oscar nominations. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nShe received her fourth César for the 1994 film Queen Margot, an ensemble epic directed by Patrice Chéreau.  She received her fifth César for Skirt Day (2009), the most that any actress has received. The film features her as a middle school teacher in a troubled French suburb who takes her class hostage when she accidentally fires off a gun she found on one of her students. It was premiered on the French Arte channel on 20 March 2009, attaining a record 2.2 million viewers) and then in movie theaters on 25 March 2009. The film was her return to the cinema after eight years of absence.\nIn 2010, she made an appearance in the social comedy Mammuth, from directors Benoît Delépine and Gustave Kervern, and in which she played the phantom of Gérard Depardieu's first love. The same year, she lent her voice to the character of Mother Gothel in the French version of the animated film Tangled. In 2011, she co-starred in De Force, the first film directed by Frank Henry. She embodied the commander Clara Damico, head of the brigade for the repression of banditry.\nShe became the first French actress to star in a Bollywood film, playing the mother of Preity Zinta in the 2013 romantic comedy Ishkq in Paris, directed by Prem Soni and alongside Shekhar Kapur.\nShe joined the comedy The World Is Yours, playing the eccentric Dany, directed by Romain Gavras alongside Vincent Cassel, which entered into the Directors' Fortnight during the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2022, she played the movie star Sidonie von Grassenabb in the comedy drama Peter von Kant, tribute to Rainer Werner Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, directed by François Ozon alongside Denis Ménochet, which entered as the opening film into the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn 2023, Adjani released her second French pop album Bande originale, written and produced by Pascal Obispo, and arranged by Cécile DeLaurentis. She also joined the Netflix action film Wingwomen, directed by Mélanie Laurent, and then, the Netflix miniseries The Perfect Couple directed by Susanne Bier, alongside Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1979, Adjani had a son, Barnabé Saïd-Nuytten, with the cinematographer Bruno Nuytten. She later hired Nuytten to direct her project Camille Claudel, a biopic of the sculptor who was the lover of Rodin.\nDuring the mid-eighties, she had a relationship with Warren Beatty. He convinced her to appear with him in the epic comedy Ishtar, directed by Elaine May, co-starring Dustin Hoffman, and shot in Morocco.\nFrom 1989 to 1995, she had a relationship with Daniel Day-Lewis, which ended before the birth of their son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, in 1995.\nAdjani was later engaged to the composer Jean-Michel Jarre; they broke up in 2004.\nOn 14 December 2023, Adjani was handed a two-year suspended sentence for tax fraud.\n\n\nPolitical views\nAdjani has been vocal against anti-immigrant and anti-Algerian sentiments in France. In 2009, she criticized statements by Pope Benedict XVI, who claimed that condoms are not an effective method of AIDS prevention.\nIn September 2009, she signed a petition in support of Roman Polanski, calling for his release after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his sexual abuse case.\nIn 2017, Adjani was interviewed by Vincent Josse on the French public radio station France Inter. During the interview, she expressed her vaccine hesitancy and opposition to mandatory vaccination.\nIn 2018 Adjani signed a letter calling to act \"firmly and immediately\" for stopping climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\n\nPerformances and works\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nAs lead artist\n\n\nAs featured artist\n\n\nAs guest appearance\n\n\nTheater\n\n\nDiscography\n1983: Pull Marine (Mercury/Universal)\n1983: Journal by Alice James (Audiobook Éditions des Femmes)\n1986: Princesse au petit pois / Léon dit (Mercury)\n2003: Bon voyage (original film soundtrack Bon voyage by Jean-Paul Rappeneau)\n2004: On ne sert à rien, by and with Pascal Obispo (album Sidaction, Ensemble contre le Sida, 10 ans ensemble)\n2005: Je ne peux plus dire je t'aime, by and with Jacques Higelin (album Higelin Entre 2 Gares) (EMI)\n2008: Wo wo wo wo, by and with Christophe (album Aimer ce que nous sommes)\n2018 : Albert Camus et Maria Casarès, Correspondance (1944-1959) with Lambert Wilson (Audiobook Gallimard)\n2018: D'accord, by and with Pascal Obispo, with Youssou N'Dour (album Obispo)\n2019: Meet me by the Gates, by and with The Penelopes\n2021: Revolution #49 (album Hey Clockface / La Face de pendule à coucou by Elvis Costello)\n2021: Sous le soleil exactement (album Les Pianos de Gainsbourg by André Manoukian)\n2021: Quelques mots, by and with Malik Djoudi (album Troie)\n2022: The Last Goodbye, with The Penelopes\n2022: Jeder tötet was er liebt (original film soundtrack Peter von Kant by François Ozon)\n2023: Adjani, Bande Originale (Warner Music International)\n\n\nBibliography\n2024: Du côté de chez Marilyn, written with Olivier Steiner (L'Observatoire)\n\n\nAccolades and honours\nAdjani was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 14 July 2010 for her contributions to the arts.

    "text": "Goeppertia allouia (syn. Calathea allouia), known as lerén or lairén in Spanish, and also known in English as Guinea arrowroot, and sweet corn root, is a plant in the arrowroot family, native to northern South America and the Caribbean. The name \"allouia\" is derived from the Carib name for the plant. Lerén is a minor food crop in the American tropics, but was one of the earliest plants domesticated by pre-historic Amerindians in South America.\n\n\nDistribution\nGoeppertia allouia is native to Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. It is reportedly naturalized in Jamaica.\nLerén has been introduced as a minor root crop in tropical regions around the world.\n\n\nDescription\n\nLerén is a perennial plant, approximately 1 metre (39 in) in height. It produces egg-shaped tuberous roots 2 centimetres (0.79 in) to 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long at the end of fibrous roots. The leaves are large, up to 60 centimetres (24 in) long and 20 centimetres (7.9 in) wide.  Indigenous people of the Americas have used the durable leaves to make traditional medicines and as baby clothing. Lerén usually reproduces itself through rhizomes which produce shoots and new plants.\n\n\nCultivation\nLerén is adapted to a tropical climate with alternating rainy and dry seasons.  It sprouts with the first rains and grows rapidly, forming tubers which are harvested as the foliage begins to die back eight or nine months after the initial sprouting.  The rhizomes, harvested at the same time, are tolerant of both drying and flooding, and divided and replanted again at the onset of the rainy season.  Frequent irrigation is necessary during dry periods.  Lerén is often planted in shade or partial shade but can grow in full sun with adequate moisture and nutrients.\nLerén is traditionally cultivated on a small scale.  Its cultivation is declining as it has been replaced by other crops.\n\n\nFood\n\nLerén is usually cooked by boiling the tubers for 15 to 60 minutes,  As food, lerén is often compared to water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) because lerén, like the water chestnut, retains its crispness despite being cooked. Boiled lerén has a taste similar to sweet corn, hence one of its common English names. The cooked tuber is covered with a thin, edible skin which is most easily peeled after cooking. Lerén is mostly eaten as an hors d'oeuvre or appetizer. Lerén tubers can be stored at room temperatures for up to three months, but do not tolerate refrigeration well.\nThe nutritional value of lerén has not been thoroughly studied, but the tubers have a starch content of 13-15 percent and a protein content of 6.6 percent.\n\n\nPrehistoric domestication\nArchaeologists have discovered that lerén was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Lerén, along with arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), squash (Cucurbita moschata), and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) were being eaten and possibly cultivated in Colombia by about 9000 BCE. It appears that the cultivation of lerén spread to places where it was not likely native.  For example, the people of the Las Vegas culture on the arid and semi-arid Santa Elena Peninsula of Ecuador likely grew lerén by about 9000 BCE. Lerén was being grown to be eaten raw, dried, or ground into flour.\n\n\nReferences",

It has been confused with Cistus clusii, which it resembles, resulting in some uncertainty in its distribution. It is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula (in southern Portugal and southwestern Spain).\n\n\nDescription\nCistus libanotis is a prostrate or less often erect shrub, up to 80–120 cm (2 ft 7 in – 3 ft 11 in) tall. It leaves are dark green, long and thin in shape, usually 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) long by 2–5 mm (0.08–0.20 in) wide and with turned under (revolute) margins. The upper surfaces of the leaves have only a few stellate hairs, particularly on the margins and the veins; the lower surfaces have a conspicuous vein and two dense bands of short stellate hairs. The flowers are arranged in cymes or whorls, the top group forming an umbel of three or four flowers. Each flower has three striped reddish sepals, 7–9 mm (0.3–0.4 in) long by 4–5 mm (0.2–0.2 in) wide, and five white petals with a yellow spot at the base, 10–13 mm (0.4–0.5 in) long by 9–12 mm (0.4–0.5 in) wide. The stamens are unequal in length, longer than the pistil. The style is short. The fruiting capsule is 6–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long, with relatively large seeds up to 1.8 mm (0.07 in) in diameter.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nCistus libanotis is native to the southwestern Iberian Peninsula (southern Portugal and south-west Spain) where it is commonly found in dry, sandy coastal areas from Campo de Gibraltar to Cape St. Vincent and between Alcácer do Sal and Grândola, but it can also be found as far inland as Paradas, Seville. There are records of this species in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, although these may belong to Cistus libanotis auct. non L., i.e. C. clusii.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nCistus libanotis was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1759. A different but similar species, Cistus clusii, has regularly been mis-identified as this species.

    "text": "Hidulf (died 707) was an abbot, founder of Moyenmoutier Abbey, and reputed bishop of Trier. He is a Catholic and Orthodox saint. His feast day is 11 July.\n\n\nNarrative\n\nThere are three biographies (Vitae Hidulphi), all from the 11th century, which contradict each other on a number of points. There is little doubt about his founding of Moyenmoutier, but the three subsequent hagiographies are suspect in the eyes of historians. While acknowledging that some authors place Hidulf's birthplace in Belgium or Bavaria, hagiographer John O'Hanlon lists him with the Irish saints.\nHidulf was born sometime in the early 6th century to a noble family, possibly in Bavaria. He is said to have had two brothers, Saints Albert and Erhard of Regensburg. Hidulf was sent to Regensburg to complete his studies.\nHidulf went to Trier, where he became a monk at the Abbey of Saint Maximin.\nHe was a friend of Saint Deodatus, who had previously been bishop of Nevers in France, but had since retired to solitude. Deodatus had founded a monastery for Augustinian canons, which was later named Saint-Dié (Sancti Deodati). After his death, Hidulf took over as abbot of the monastery. Many scholars believe that this connection is unlikely.\nMany traditions say that in 665 he was elected bishop of Trier after Saint Numerian. He is said to have built the Johanniskirche in Trier and endowed it with the relics of some martyrs of the Theban Legion, and in 667 he brought relics of the city's saints, Saints Maximin, Agritius, Nicetius and Basinus over to the abbey church of Saint Maximin.\nA contemporary view is that he was not a diocesan bishop, nor abbot of Saint-Dié Abbey. Some sources believe that he was probably not a diocesan bishop, but a chorepiscopus, that is, an auxiliary bishop without a fixed episcopate, but associated with the monastery of St Maximinus in Trier, which is perhaps more likely. This type of bishop was common in the mission areas of Germany in the seventh century and played a significant role in the evangelization of the country.\nAfter five years, Hidulf handed over the office to Basinus and retired to a hermitage in the Vosges. Hidulf founded the monastery of Moyenmoutier soon after 671. He himself called the monastery Monasterium Medium or Mittelmünster (Moyenmoutier) due to its location in the middle of a group of four other monasteries. Hidulf became the first abbot and held office until his death. At first he followed a rule partly based on Saint Benedict 's and partly on that established by Saint Columban. As a crowd of monks soon gathered around him, he had to move some of them to several sub-monasteries. In total, he is said to have had almost 300 monks under his leadership in the various foundations. His foremost disciples were Saint Spinulus (fr: Spinule; locally Spin) and the two holy twin brothers Benignus and Johannes. As was common in this group of monasteries, Hidulf emphasized the importance of manual labor, and it was said that he himself always did some work every day, except in his last years.\nHidulf is said to have been present and participated in the miracle that his brother Erhard wrought with Saint Odilia of Alsace(ca. 660-ca. 720) when she was baptized.  At his death he was abbot of both Moyenmoutier and Bonmoutier (Galilaea, later called Saint-Dié).\n\n\nVeneration\n\nLegend has it that Hidulf was buried in a sandstone sarcophagus in Moyenmoutier, and it can still be seen in the old chapel of Saint-Grégoire in this commune. His relics were moved a number of times, and from 1854 they have been venerated in a side chapel in the former abbey church of Moyenmoutier. St Hidulf's casket in carved and gilded wood from the 18th century, is kept in the treasury in Moyenmoutier. It was classified as a historical monument in 1965.\nIn 1600, the prior of the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Vanne outside the city walls of Verdun, Dom Didier de La Cour, began a thorough reform of the monastery, and it, together with Moyenmoutier, became the center of a group of reformed monasteries in Lorraine, Champagne and Burgundy. In 1604 they officially merged into a new congregation, de Saint-Vanne et Saint-Hydulphe, named after Hidulf and Saint Vitonus of Verdun, (which was dissolved during the French Revolution).\nHidulf was invoked in nervous diseases. He is listed in the Martyrologium Romanum (2004) for July 11.\n\n\nSee also\nErhard of Regensburg\nOdile of Alsace\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

They were tested in 1942 and 1943 against the Belgian Fort d'Aubin-Neufchâteau.\n\n\nAircraft delivered bombs\n\n\nWorld War II\n\n\nGermany\nIn World War II the Luftwaffe developed a series of unguided rocket-propelled armor-piercing bombs for use against shipping and fortifications.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn World War II, the British designer Barnes Wallis, already famous for inventing the bouncing bomb, designed two bombs that would become the conceptual predecessors of modern bunker busters: the five tonne Tallboy and the ten tonne Grand Slam. These were \"Earthquake\" bombs—a concept he had first proposed in 1939. The designs were very aerodynamic, allowing them to exceed the speed of sound as they fell from 22,000 ft (6,700 m). The tails were designed with offset fins causing the bombs to spin as they fell. Using the same principle as a spinning top, this enabled them to resist being deflected, thereby improving accuracy. They had casings of high grade steel, much stronger than the typical World War II bomb so that they would survive hitting a hardened surface, or penetrate deep into the ground.\nThough these bombs might be thought of as \"bunker busters\" today, the original \"earthquake\" theory was more complex and subtle than simply penetrating a hardened surface. The earthquake bombs were designed not to strike a target directly, but to impact beside it, penetrate under it, and create a 'camouflet', or large buried cavern, at the same time as delivering a shock wave through the target's foundations. The target then collapses into the hole, no matter how hardened it may be. The bombs had strong casings because they needed to travel through rock rather than reinforced concrete, though they could perform equally well against hardened surfaces. In an attack on the Valentin U-Boat pens at Farge, two Grand Slams went through the 15 ft (4.5 m) reinforced concrete hardening—equalling or exceeding the best current penetration specifications.\nThe British Disney bomb (officially \"4500 lb [2,000 kg] Concrete piercing/Rocket Assisted Bomb\", also known as the \"Crab\") was a World War II device designed to be used against U-boat pens and other super-hardened targets. Devised by Captain Edward Terrell RNVR of the Admiralty's Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development, it had a streamlined hardened case and weighed about 4,500 lb (2,000 kg) including the rocket assembly. The actual explosive content was about 500 lb (230 kg).\nFor accuracy, the bombs had to be dropped precisely from a pre-determined height (usually 20,000 ft (6,100 m)). They would free-fall for around 30 seconds until, at 5,000 ft (1,500 m), the rockets were ignited, causing the tail section to be expelled. The rocket burn lasted for three seconds and added 300 ft/s (91 m/s) to the bomb's speed, giving a final impact speed of 1,450 ft/s (440 m/s; 990 mph), approximately Mach 1.29. Post-war tests demonstrated that the bombs were able to penetrate a 14-foot-8-inch (4.47 m) thick concrete roof, with the predicted (but untested) ability to penetrate 16 feet 8 inches (5.08 m) of concrete.\n\n\nUnited States\nPost war, the US added a form of remote guidance to the Tallboy to create the Tarzon, a 12,000 lb (5,400 kg) bomb deployed in the Korean War against an underground command center near Kanggye.\n\n\nModern\n\nThe US BLU-109 bomb is intended to penetrate concrete shelters and other hardened structures before exploding. It entered service in 1985. Israeli F-15I fighter jets are believed to have used BLU-109s in the strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on 27 September 2024.\nDuring Operation Desert Storm (1991), there was a need for a deep penetration bomb similar to the British weapons of World War II, but none of the NATO air forces had such a weapon. As a stop-gap, some were developed over a period of 28 days, using old 8 inch (203 mm) artillery barrels as casings. These bombs weighed over two tons and carried 647 lb (293 kg) of high explosive. They were laser-guided and were designated \"Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28)\". It was proven effective for the intended role.\nAn example of a Russian bunker buster is the KAB-1500L-Pr. It is delivered with the Su-24M and the Su-34 aircraft. It is stated to be able to penetrate 10–20 m of earth or 2 m of reinforced concrete. The bomb weighs 1,500 kg (3,300 lb), with 1,100 kg (2,400 lb) being the high explosive penetrating warhead. It is laser guided and has a reported strike accuracy of 7 m (23 ft) CEP.\nThe US has a series of custom made bombs such as the Paveway series of laser-guided bombs to penetrate hardened or deeply buried structures:\n\nTurkey is another country known to be developing bunker busters, such as the SARB-83 and NEB-84.\n\n\nFuzing\nThe traditional fuze is the same as a classic armor-piercing bomb: a combination of timer and a sturdy dynamic propeller on the rear of the bomb. The fuze is armed when the bomb is released, and detonates when the propeller stops turning and the timer has expired.\nModern bunker busters may use a conventional fuze, but some also include a microphone and microcontroller. The microphone listens, and the microcontroller counts the number of floors until the bomb breaks through the desired numbers of floors.\nNorthrop Grumman is working on the Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF), an electronic and cockpit programmable fuze capable of destroying deeply buried targets. It provides multiple delay arming and detonation times, as well as a void-sensing capability, which allows for precision activation of the fuze for 2,000-and-5,000-pound (910 and 2,270 kg) weapons to explode when they reach an open space in a deeply buried bunker.\n\n\nMissiles\n\nThe extra speed provided by a rocket motor enables greater penetration of a missile-mounted bunker buster warhead. To reach maximum penetration (impact depth), the warhead may consist of a high-density projectile only. Such a warhead carries more energy than a warhead with chemical explosives (kinetic energy of a projectile at hypervelocity).\n\n\nNuclear\n\nThe nuclear bunker buster is the nuclear weapon version of the bunker buster. The non-nuclear component of the weapon is designed to greatly enhance the penetration into soil, rock, or concrete to deliver a nuclear warhead to a target. These weapons would be used to destroy deeply buried hardened, underground military bunkers. In theory, the amount of radioactive nuclear fallout would be reduced from that of a standard, air-burst nuclear detonation because they would have relatively low explosive yield. However, because such weapons necessarily come into contact with large amounts of earth-based debris, they may, under certain circumstances, still generate significant fallout. Warhead yield and weapon design have changed periodically throughout the history of the design of such weapons. An underground explosion releases a larger fraction of its energy into the ground, compared to an explosion at or above the surface which releases most of its energy into the atmosphere.\n\n\nSee also\nDisney bomb\nImpact depth\nRochling shell\nT-12 Cloudmaker\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nAir Proving Ground Command Eglin Field (31 October 1946).

    "text": "George Habash (1 August 1926 – 26 January 2008) was a Palestinian politician and physician who was the founder and first general-secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) from 1967 to 2000.\nHabash was born in Lydda, Mandatory Palestine, in 1926. In 1948, while he was a medical student at the American University of Beirut, he returned to his hometown of Lydda during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The city's Arab Palestinian population, including his family, was forcibly driven out in an event known as the Lydda Death March, which led to the death of his sister. In 1951, after graduating first in his class from medical school, Habash worked in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and ran a clinic in Amman. He later relocated to Syria and Lebanon.\nIn 1967, after being sidelined in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) by Yasser Arafat, he founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist–Leninist group opposing the existence of Israel and advocating for a one-state solution in the entire region. In the 1970 Dawson's Field hijackings, Habash masterminded the hijackings of four Western airliners to Jordan, which led to the Black September conflict and his subsequent exile to Lebanon. Habash remained opposed to a two-state solution even after the PLO signed the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993. He resigned as secretary-general of the PFLP due to ill health in 2000, dying of a heart attack in 2008.\nHe was also known by his kunya as \"al-Hakim\" (Arabic: الحكيم, romanized: Al-Ḥakīm, lit. 'The Wise Man'  or 'The Doctor').\n\n\nEarly life\n\nHabash was born in Lydda, Mandatory Palestine to a Greek Orthodox Christian Palestinian family in 1926. As a child, he sang in the church choir. In 1948, 19-year-old Habash, a medical student at the American University of Beirut (AUB), went to his home town of Lydda during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War to help his family. While he was there, the Israel Defense Forces attacked the city and as a result, most of its civilian population was forced to leave in what became known as the Lydda Death March. They marched for three days without food or water until they reached the Arab armies' front lines, which led to his sister's death. Habash and his remaining family became refugees and were not allowed to return home. He later finished his education at the AUB and graduated in 1951.\nPolitical thinkers who were influences on Habash at this period included Constantin Zureiq, whose lectures at AUB on 'Arab nationalism and the Zionist danger' in the late 1940s and early 1950s Habash had attended, and Sati' al-Husri an Arab Muslim intellectual who emphasized national cohesiveness, territorial patriotism, and loyalty to the state, and gave priority to Arab unity over Islamic unity.\nIn 1951, after graduating first in his class from medical school, Habash worked in refugee camps in Jordan and ran a clinic with Wadie Haddad in Amman. He firmly believed that the state of Israel should be ended by all possible means, including political violence. In an effort to recruit the Arab world to this cause, Habash founded the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) in 1951 and aligned the organization with Gamal Abdel Nasser's Arab nationalist ideology.\nHe was implicated in the 1957 coup attempt in Jordan, which originated among Palestinian members of the National Guard. Habash was convicted in absentia after having gone underground when Hussein of Jordan proclaimed martial law and banned all political parties. In 1958, he fled to Syria (then part of the United Arab Republic [UAR]) but was forced to return to Beirut in 1961 by the tumultuous breakup of the UAR.\nHabash was a leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organization until 1967 when he was sidelined by Fatah leader Yasser Arafat, with whom he had a complex relationship described as a mix of \"camaraderie and rivalry\" and \"a love-hate relationship\". In response, Habash founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\n\nPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\n\nIn 1964 he began reorganizing the ANM, regrouping the Palestinian members of the organization into a \"regional command.\" After the Six-Day War in 1967, disillusion with Nasser became widespread. This prompted the foundation, led by Habash, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) as a front of several Palestinian factions, like the \"heroes of return\" and \"Palestinian Liberation Front\", along with the ANM on 11 December, when he also became its first secretary-general. Habash was arrested by Abd al-Karim al-Jundi and briefly imprisoned in Syria under the accusation of plotting to overthrow the Baathist ruling party in 1968 but escaped with the help of Wadie Haddad who with four others extracted Habash from a maximum security prison whilst disguised as military police. In the same year, he also came into conflict with long-time ally Wadie Haddad, but both remained in the PFLP.\nAt a 1969 congress, the PFLP re-designated itself a Marxist movement. Its pan-Arab leanings have been diminished since the ANM days, but popular support for a united Arab front has remained, especially in regard to Israeli and western political pressures. It holds a firm position regarding Israel, demanding its complete eradication as a racist state through military struggle and promotes a one-state solution (one secular, democratic, non-denominational state).\n\nThe 1969 congress also saw an ultra-leftist faction under Nayef Hawatmeh and Yasser Abd Rabbo split off as the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), later to become the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). During Habash's time as secretary-general, the PFLP became known as one of the most radical and militant Palestinian factions and gained world notoriety after a string of aircraft hijackings and attacks against Israel affiliated companies as well as Israeli ambassadors in Europe mostly planned by Haddad. The PFLP's pioneering of modern international terror operations brought the group, and the Palestinian issue, onto newspaper front pages worldwide, but it also provoked intense criticism from other parts of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1970, Habash was evicted from Jordan due to the key role of the Popular Front in the Black September clashes. In 1974, the Palestinian National Council adopted a resolution recognizing a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Habash, who opposed this, formed the Rejectionist Front from several other opposition parties.\nHabash aligned the PFLP with the PLO and the Lebanese National Movement, but stayed neutral during the Lebanese Civil War in the late 1970s. After a stroke in 1980, when he was living in Damascus, his health declined and other PFLP members rose to the top.\nAfter the Oslo Agreements, Habash formed another opposition alliance of Rejectionists, including Islamist organizations such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, that became prominent during the First Intifada. In 2000, he resigned from his leadership post of the PFLP due to poor health and was succeeded by Abu Ali Mustafa. He continued to be an activist for the group until 2008 when he died of a heart attack in Amman.\n\n\nBlack September\n\nThe PFLP ignored tensions with the mainstream leadership of Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, and instead focused on bringing about revolutionary change in Jordan. Habash expressed the opinion that what proceeded was not \"only military but also psychological warfare\" and one had to \"hold the Israelis under permanent pressure\".\nIn the 1970 Dawson's Field hijackings, Habash masterminded the hijackings of four Western airliners over the United States, Europe, the Far East and the Persian Gulf. The aircraft were forced to fly to a World War II airfield in Jordan, the passengers and crews were disembarked and the planes were then blown up.\nThe Dawson's Field hijackings were instrumental in provoking the Black September crackdown, which came close to destroying the PLO. The hijackings led Hussein of Jordan to carry out a major offensive against militant strongholds in his kingdom resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. In autumn 1970, Habash visited Beijing. After Black September, the PLO fedayeen relocated to Lebanon.\nIn 1972, Habash experienced failing health and gradually began to lose influence within the organization. The Palestinian National Council's (PNC) adoption of a resolution viewed by the PFLP as a two-state solution in 1974, prompted Habash to lead his organization out of active participation in the PLO and to join the Iraqi-backed Rejectionist Front. Only in 1977 would the PFLP opt to rejoin, as the Palestinian factions rallied their forces in opposition to Anwar Sadat's overtures towards Israel, pro-U.S. policies and fragmentation of the Arab world. During the Lebanese Civil War that broke out in 1975, PFLP forces were decimated in the battle against Syria. Later, the PFLP would draw close to Syria, as Syria's government shifted, but PFLP involvement in the Lebanese war remained strong until the US-negotiated evacuation of PLO units from Beirut in 1982 and continued on a smaller scale after that.\n\n\nOslo Agreements\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993, Habash and the PFLP again broke completely with Arafat, accusing him of selling out the Palestinian revolution. The group set up an anti-Arafat and anti-Oslo alliance in Damascus, for the first time joined by non-PLO Islamist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which had grown to prominence during the First Intifada. After finding the position sterile, with Palestinian political dynamics playing out on the West Bank and Gaza areas of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Habash carefully sought to repair ties to Arafat, and gain a hold in post-Oslo politics without compromising PFLP principles. However, there is no indication that he ever accepted the two-state solution. This balancing act could not save the PFLP from being eclipsed by the militant Islamist factions on the one hand, and the resource-rich Fatah with its PNA patronage network on the other. The significance of the PFLP in Palestinian politics has diminished considerably since the mid-90s. The PFLP participated in the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006 as Ahmad Sa'adat won 4.2% of the popular vote.\nIn the late 1990s, Habash's medical condition worsened. In 2000 he resigned from the post as secretary-general, citing health reasons. He was succeeded as head of the PFLP by Abu Ali Mustafa who was assassinated by Israel during the Second Intifada. Habash went on to set up a PFLP-affiliated research center, but he remained active in the PFLP's internal politics. Until his death he was still popular among many Palestinians, who appreciate his revolutionary ideology, his determination and principles, the rejection of the Oslo Agreements and his intellectual style.\n\n\nDeath\n \nHabash died on 26 January 2008, at the age of 81 of a heart attack in the Jordan Hospital, Amman, where Habash was a cancer patient. The President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of national mourning. Habash was buried in a suburban cemetery of Amman with the obsequies of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Abbas said Habash was a \"historic leader\" and called for Palestinian flags to be flown half-mast. Abdel Raheem Mallouh, PFLP deputy secretary-general, called Habash a \"distinguished leader... who struggled for more than 60 years without a stop for the rights and the interests of his people\". Hamas leader and dismissed Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh sent his condolences, saying Habash \"spent his life defending Palestine\".\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nA balance-sheet of the Intifada, an interview with George Habash, 1990\nA Visit With : Still the Prophet of Arab Nationalism and Armed Struggle Against Israel, By Grace Halsell, Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, September 1998, pages 49, 136\nBBC Obituary\nObituary in The Times, 28 January 2008\nObituary in The Guardian, 29 January 2008\nGeorge Habbash, short overview on auhrenia.com – dead link checked Sept 21, 2014",

    "text": "Sonia Evans (born 13 February 1971), known mononymously as Sonia, is an English pop singer from Liverpool. She had a 1989 UK number one hit with \"You'll Never Stop Me Loving You\" and became the first female UK artist to achieve five top 20 hit singles from one album. She represented the United Kingdom in the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, where she finished second with the song \"Better the Devil You Know\". \nBetween 1989 and 1993, she had 11 UK top 30 hits, including \"Listen to Your Heart\" (1989), \"Counting Every Minute\" (1990) and \"Only Fools (Never Fall in Love)\" (1991). In 1994, she starred as Sandy in a West End revival of the musical Grease, while on television she appeared as Bunty in the 1998 BBC comedy series The Lily Savage Show.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nEverybody Knows and breakthrough (1990–1993)\nSonia was signed to Chrysalis Records after badgering Pete Waterman to listen to her sing outside his recording studio in Liverpool. Waterman called her bluff and asked her to sing live on his weekly radio show. Sonia's debut single, \"You'll Never Stop Me Loving You\", composed and produced by the songwriting and music production trio Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman (Stock Aitken Waterman) was released in June 1989. \"You'll Never Stop Me Loving You\" peaked at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks the following month. At 18, Sonia became one of the youngest female British singers to achieve this feat. The single also topped the Irish chart and reached the top 10 of the US dance chart.\nSonia's debut album, Everybody Knows, was released in April 1990. The album peaked at number 7 in the UK, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. All five singles released from the album became top 20 hits in the UK, making Sonia the first British solo female artist to achieve this. Sonia achieved a sixth top 20 hit in the UK in 1990 with \"You've Got a Friend\", recorded with the group Big Fun, and released as a charity single for Childline.\nSonia left her record label and released her second, self-titled album in 1991, produced by Nigel Wright. The first single released from it, \"Only Fools (Never Fall in Love)\" became Sonia's third UK top 10 hit, although the album was less successful than her debut. Sonia also contributed to two charity singles, Band Aid II's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" in 1989 (peaked at number 1 in the UK) and Gulf Aid's \"As Time Stood Still\" in 1991.\n\n\nEurovision and Better the Devil You Know (1992–1993)\nIn 1993, Sonia represented the United Kingdom in the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, singing the Dean Collinson and Brian Teasdale composition \"Better the Devil You Know\". She was placed second in the contest. Her third album, also titled Better the Devil You Know was released that year and reached number 32 in the UK. Sonia performed the song again on Saturday, 13 May 2023, during the interval at the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool, 30 years after her first appearance. The day before, she also appeared in Hollyoaks (see TV appearances below) performing her iconic Eurovision entry to the cast at an on-screen Eurovision party.\nIn 1994, Sonia replaced singer Debbie Gibson as Sandy in the West End musical Grease. A cover of \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" was released as a tie-in single, but it only peaked at number 61 in the UK. In 1995, Sonia released a cover of \"Wake Up Everybody\", which did not enter the UK top 100. It was to be the lead single of her fourth album, the soul covers album Love Train – The Philly Album, but Sonia was unhappy with it and it only received a promotional release. Sonia performed a vocal part in Italian Eurobeat singer Nuage's \"I'm Never Gonna Let You Down and Forget You\", released in Japan in 2004, produced by Dave Rodgers.\n\n\nTheatre and acting (1993–2010)\n\nPrior to her music career, around 1988, Evans appeared as an extra in Channel 4's soap opera Brookside, and also appeared in an episode of the BBC1 situation comedy Bread, where she played Ellia, a short-term girlfriend of Adrian Boswell, in episode 11 of series 4. In 1990, Sonia co-hosted children's game show The Wetter the Better as a scoreboard person with main quizmaster Ross King, which was part of the Saturday morning children's magazine show 8:15 from Manchester. In 1993, Sonia made her theatre debut in the musical Slice of Saturday Night, alongside Dennis Waterman. The following year she replaced singer Debbie Gibson as Sandy in a West End revival of Grease, where she stayed for a year. In 1997, she returned to the stage on the musical What A Feeling!, which also included fellow 1980s stars Luke Goss and Sinitta. An accompanying soundtrack album was released.\nShe has also played alongside Lily Savage as her wayward daughter Bunty Savage, both on the BBC series The Lily Savage Show and live shows.\nAlso in 1993, Sonia represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. It was held in Millstreet, county Cork in Ireland. She sang \"Better the Devil You Know\" and finished second. In 2003, Sonia appeared in the ITV1 reality show Reborn in the USA, where former pop stars including Leee John from the band Imagination, Michelle Gayle, Gina G, Elkie Brooks and pop duo Dollar performed American hits. The show saw the artists touring America and each week one artist was eliminated from the show. Sonia came sixth out of the nine participants. In January 2007, she starred in the pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk as Jack in Horsham, West Sussex, alongside Mark Curry. Sonia also starred in the pantomime Cinderella in December 2010 / January 2011 as the Wicked Queen Edwina at the Stiwt Theatre in Wrexham, North Wales, alongside Big Brother star Dale Howard.\nLate 2007 saw the release of Sonia's Greatest Hits album. However, this compilation only featured recordings from Sonia's two albums released on BMG. In 2007, prior to Sonia's Greatest Hits release, she recorded two Motown-influenced songs, \"Dancing in the Driver's Seat\" and \"Your Heart or Mine\", both of which were written by Barry Upton and U.S. songwriter Gordon Pogoda. However, her record label decided to include no new songs on Greatest Hits so both tracks remained unreleased until 2018. In 2008, Sonia recorded a cover of the Beatles' \"She Loves You\" for the Liverpool – The Number Ones Album. On 1 June 2009, Sonia released her first single in 14 years, \"Fool for Love\".\n\n\nTelevision and re–issues (2010–2023)\nIn October 2010, the Everybody Knows album was remastered and re-issued in expanded form, containing two additional tracks, extended versions of her first four singles, and a demo version of \"You'll Never Stop Me Loving You\". Also in 2010, Sonia's cover version of \"You've Got a Friend\", a duet with Big Fun, was released on a reissue of the group's debut album. On 21 December 2012, Sonia performed at the Stock Aitken Waterman \"Hit Factory Live\" reunion concert at The O2 in London, along with many other former SAW acts, including Kylie Minogue. In summer 2018, in conjunction with her appearance in the Channel 5 program Celebrity 5 Go Caravanning, Sonia's recording of \"Dancing in the Driver's Seat\", written by Barry Upton and Gordon Pogoda, was released. Another song recorded with Upton and Pogoda in 2007, \"Your Heart or Mine\", was released in 2018 as its follow-up. Sonia signed a new record deal with Energise Records in 2019, and a new single, \"A Night That's Never Ending\", was released in November 2019.\nShe appeared on series 5 of Hacker Time. In 2018, Sonia appeared alongside Todd Carty, Tony Blackburn, Colin Baker and Sherrie Hewson in Channel 5's Celebrity 5 Go Caravanning. Sonia made a significant guest appearance as herself in Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks, in the episode aired Friday, 12 May 2023. In the storyline, Sonia is an old school friend of Diane O'Connor, played by Alexandra Fletcher, and the two are part of an in-joke where Sonia remarks Diane \"doesn't look a day over 50\" (a reference to the age discrepancy between the two, Fletcher was born in 1976, and Sonia in 1971), and then Sonia asks Diane if her father is still running 'The Moby'. This is a reference to Fletcher's previous long-running role in Brookside, as Jacqui Dixon (from 1990 to 2003, produced by the same production company, and in which, Sonia herself was an extra in 1988), whose father, Ron, ran a mobile mini-market from a blue van with a white whale painted down the side called The Moby Dick. Sonia performed her 1993 Eurovision Song Contest song, \"Better The Devil You Know\", at a party while Diane danced as one of her backing singers.\n\n\nEurovision and Now! Musical (2023–present)\n \nSonia was a prominent advocate and supporter for Liverpool's bid to host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest. The city was announced as the winner in October 2022, beating the largest city in Scotland, Glasgow, who finished runner up. Ahead of the 2023 contest, Sonia was a prominent feature in the promotion of the contest being held in Liverpool, including a \"Spot Sonia\" competition held throughout the city, giving the public a chance to win tickets to the contest. During the Grand Final, Sonia performed her 1993 UK Eurovision entry \"Better the Devil You Know\" as the interval act.\nIn 2024, it was announced that Sonia was cast as a special guest in the musical theatre production Now! That's What I Call a Musical which was directed and choreographed by Craig Revel Horwood. She featured as the sole special guest star on the Scottish dates of the production at the King's Theatre in Glasgow between 18–22 February 2025. Sonia did not feature as the guest in some of the dates, instead, singer Sinitta was cast as the special guest for some performances.\n\n\nPersonal life\nSonia married Mark Moses in 1998 and the couple have a daughter, who was born in 2010.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nCompilations\n\n\nBox sets\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nSonia discography at Discogs\nSonia at IMDb",

    "text": "Joseph Chamberlain  (8 July 1836 – 2 July 1914) was a British statesman who was first a radical Liberal, then a Liberal Unionist after opposing home rule for Ireland, and eventually was a leading imperialist in coalition with the Conservatives. He split both major British parties in the course of his career. He was the father, by different marriages, of Nobel Peace Prize winner Austen Chamberlain and of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.\nChamberlain made his career in Birmingham, first as a manufacturer of screws and then as a notable mayor of the city. He was a radical Liberal Party member and an opponent of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict. c. 75) on the basis that it could result in subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money. As a businessman, he had never attended university and had contempt for the aristocracy. He entered the House of Commons at 39 years of age, relatively late in life compared to politicians from more privileged backgrounds. Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation, he served as President of the Board of Trade in the Second Gladstone ministry (1880–85). At the time, Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury, and in the 1885 general election he proposed the \"Unauthorised Programme\", which was not enacted, of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers, including the slogan promising \"three acres and a cow\". Chamberlain resigned from the Third Gladstone ministry in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule. He helped to engineer a Liberal Party split and became a Liberal Unionist, a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham.\nFrom the 1895 general election, the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party, under Chamberlain's former opponent Lord Salisbury. In that government Chamberlain promoted the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies, promoting a variety of schemes to build up the British Empire in Asia, Africa, and the West Indies. He had major responsibility for causing the Second Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa and was the government minister most responsible for the war effort. He became a dominant figure in the Unionist Government's re-election at the \"Khaki Election\" in 1900. In 1903, he resigned from the Cabinet to campaign for tariff reform (i.e. taxes on imports as opposed to the existing policy of free trade with no tariffs). He obtained the support of most Unionist MPs for this stance, but the Unionists suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 general election. Shortly after public celebrations of his 70th birthday in Birmingham, he was disabled by a stroke, ending his public career.\nAlthough never prime minister, Chamberlain was one of the most important British politicians of his day, as well as a renowned orator and municipal reformer. Historian David Nicholls observes that his personality was not attractive, as he was arrogant and ruthless and much hated. He never succeeded in his grand ambitions but was a highly proficient grassroots organiser of democratic instincts. He is most famous for setting the agenda of British colonial, foreign, tariff, and municipal policies, and for deeply splitting both major political parties. In his Great Contemporaries, future Prime Minister Winston Churchill remarked that despite never being prime minister, Chamberlain \"made the [political] weather\".\n\n\nEarly life, business career, and family life\nChamberlain was born on Camberwell Grove in Camberwell to Joseph Chamberlain (1796–1874), a successful shoe manufacturer, and Caroline (1806–1875), daughter of cheese (formerly beer) merchant Henry Harben. His younger brother was Richard Chamberlain, later also a Liberal politician. Raised at Highbury, a prosperous suburb of North London, he was educated at University College School 1850–1852, excelling academically and gaining prizes in French and mathematics.\nThe elder Chamberlain was not able to provide advanced education for all his children, and at the age of 16 Joseph was apprenticed to the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers and worked for the family business (their warehouse having been at Milk Street, London, for three generations) making quality leather shoes. At 18 he joined his uncle's screw-making business, Nettlefolds of Birmingham, in which his father had invested. The company became known as Nettlefold and Chamberlain when Chamberlain became a partner with Joseph Nettlefold. During the business's most prosperous period it produced two-thirds of all metal screws made in England, and by the time of Chamberlain's retirement from business in 1874 it was exporting worldwide.\nIn 1859, with the Volunteer movement in full swing, Chamberlain attempted to raise a Volunteer Rifle Company in Birmingham from the Edgbaston Debating Society, but his offer was not accepted by the County.\n\n\nMarriages and children\n\nIn July 1861 Chamberlain married Harriet Kenrick, the daughter of holloware manufacturer Archibald Kenrick, of Berrow Court, Edgbaston, Birmingham; they had met the previous year. Their daughter, Beatrice Chamberlain, was born in May 1862. Harriet, who had had a premonition that she would die in childbirth, became ill two days after the birth of their son, Austen, in October 1863, and died three days later. Chamberlain devoted himself to business while the children were brought up by their maternal grandparents.\nIn 1868 Chamberlain married Harriet's cousin Florence Kenrick, daughter of Timothy Kenrick.\nChamberlain and Florence had four children: the future Prime Minister Neville in 1869, Ida in 1870, Hilda in 1871 and Ethel in 1873. The teaching of these four children was taken on by their elder half sister, Beatrice, who was destined to make her mark as an educationalist. On 13 February 1875 Florence gave birth to their fifth child, but she and the child died within a day. Though a Unitarian during his lifetime, the experiences Chamberlain endured with losing both wives in childbirth resulted in him losing personal faith, rejecting religious creeds and not requiring religious adherence of any of his children.\nChamberlain met his third wife, Mary Crowninshield Endicott, the 23-year-old daughter of United States Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott, while leading a British delegation to Washington, D.C., to resolve the Newfoundland fisheries dispute in 1887. He described her as \"one of the brightest and most intelligent girls I have yet met.\" Before he left the United States in March 1888, Chamberlain proposed, and they married at St John's Episcopal Church in New York City, wearing white violets rather than Chamberlain's trademark orchid. Mary became a faithful supporter of his political ambitions and eased his acceptance into upper-class society in the second half of his career. They had no children. She survived Chamberlain, to later marry, in 1916, Anglican clergyman William Hartley Carnegie (1859–1936).\n\n\nEarly political career\n\n\nCalls for reform\nChamberlain became involved in Liberal politics, influenced by the strong radical and liberal traditions among Birmingham shoemakers and the long tradition of social action in Chamberlain's Unitarian church. There was pressure to redistribute parliamentary seats to cities and to enfranchise a greater proportion of urban men. In 1866, Earl Russell's Liberal administration submitted a Reform Bill to create 400,000 new voters, but the bill was opposed by the \"Adullamite\" Liberals for disrupting the social order, and criticised by Radicals for not conceding the secret ballot or household suffrage. The bill was defeated and the government fell. Chamberlain was one of the 250,000, including the mayor, who marched for Reform in Birmingham on 27 August 1866; he recalled that \"men poured into the hall, black as they were from the factories...the people were packed together like herrings\" to listen to a speech by John Bright. Lord Derby's minority Conservative administration passed a Reform Act in 1867, nearly doubling the electorate from 1,430,000 to 2,470,000.\nThe Liberal Party won the 1868 election. Chamberlain was active in the election campaign, praising Bright and George Dixon, a Birmingham MP. Chamberlain was also influential in the local campaign in support of the Irish Disestablishment bill. In the autumn of 1869, a deputation headed by William Harris invited him to stand for the Town Council; and in November he was elected to represent St. Paul's Ward.\nChamberlain and Jesse Collings had been among the founders of the Birmingham Education League in 1867, which noted that of about 4.25 million children of school age, 2 million children, mostly in urban areas, did not attend school, with a further 1 million in uninspected schools. The government's aid to Church of England schools offended Nonconformist opinion. Chamberlain favoured free, secular, compulsory education, stating that \"it is as much the duty of the State to see that the children are educated as to see that they are fed\", and attributing the success of the US and Prussia to public education. The Birmingham Education League evolved into the National Education League, which held its first Conference in Birmingham in 1869 and proposed a school system funded by local rates and government grants, managed by local authorities subject to government inspection. By 1870, the League had more than one hundred branches, mostly in cities and peopled largely by men of trades unions and working men's organisations.\nWilliam Edward Forster, vice-president of the Committee of Council on Education, proposed an Elementary Education Bill in January 1870. Nonconformists opposed the proposal to fund church schools as part of the national educational system through the rates. The NEL was angered by the absence of school commissions or of free, compulsory education. Chamberlain arranged for a delegation of 400 branch members and 46 MPs to visit the prime minister William Ewart Gladstone at 10 Downing Street on 9 March 1870, the first time the two men had met. Chamberlain impressed the Prime Minister with his lucid speech, and during the bill's second reading Gladstone agreed to make amendments that removed church schools from rate-payer control and granted them funding. Liberal MPs, exasperated at the compromises in the legislation, voted against the government, and the bill passed the House of Commons with support from the Conservatives. Chamberlain campaigned against the Act, and especially Clause 25, which gave school boards of England and Wales the power to pay the fees of poor children at voluntary schools, theoretically allowing them to fund church schools. The Education League stood in several by-elections against Liberal candidates who refused to support the repeal of Clause 25. In 1873, a Liberal majority was elected to the Birmingham School Board, with Chamberlain as chairman. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the church component of the school board agreeing to make payments from rate-payer's money only to schools associated with industrial education.\nChamberlain espoused enfranchisement of rural workers and a lower cost of land. In an article written for the Fortnightly Review, he coined the slogan of the \"Four F's: Free Church, Free Schools, Free Land and Free Labour\". In another article, \"The Liberal Party and its Leaders\", Chamberlain criticised Gladstone's leadership and advocated a more Radical direction for the party.\n\n\nMayor of Birmingham\nIn November 1873 the Liberal Party swept the municipal elections and Chamberlain was elected mayor of Birmingham. The Conservatives had denounced his Radicalism and called him a \"monopoliser and a dictator\" while the Liberals had campaigned against their High church Tory opponents with the slogan \"The People above the Priests\". The city's municipal administration was notably lax with regards to public works and many urban dwellers lived in conditions of great poverty. As mayor, Chamberlain promoted many civic improvements, promising the city would be \"parked, paved, assized, marketed, gas & watered and 'improved'\".\nThe Birmingham Gas Light and Coke Company and the Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas Light Company were locked in constant competition, in which the city's streets were continually dug up to lay mains. Chamberlain forcibly purchased the two companies on behalf of the borough for £1,953,050, even offering to purchase the companies himself if the ratepayers refused. In its first year of operations the new municipal gas scheme made a profit of £34,000.\nThe city's water supply was considered a danger to public health – approximately half of the city's population was dependent on well water, much of which was polluted by sewage. Piped water was supplied on only three days per week, compelling the use of well water and water carts for the rest of the week. Deploring the rising death rate from contagious diseases in the poorest parts of the city, in January 1876 Chamberlain forcibly purchased Birmingham's waterworks for a combined sum of £1,350,000, creating Birmingham Corporation Water Department, having declared to a House of Commons Committee that \"We have not the slightest intention of making profit... We shall get our profit indirectly in the comfort of the town and in the health of the inhabitants.” Despite this noticeable executive action, Chamberlain was mistrustful of central authority and bureaucracy, preferring to give local communities the responsibility to act on their own initiative.\nIn July 1875 Chamberlain tabled an improvement plan involving slum clearance in Birmingham's city centre. Chamberlain had been consulted by the Home Secretary, Richard Assheton Cross, during the preparation of the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, during Disraeli's social improvement programme. Chamberlain bought 50 acres (200,000 m2) of property to build a new road, (Corporation Street), through Birmingham's overcrowded slums. Overriding the protests of local landlords and the commissioner of the Local Government Board's inquiry into the scheme, Chamberlain gained the endorsement of the President of the Local Government Board, George Sclater-Booth. Chamberlain raised the funds for the programme, contributing £10,000 himself. However the Improvement Committee concluded that it would be too expensive to transfer slum-dwellers to municipally built accommodation, and so the land was leased as a business proposition on a 75-year lease. Slum dwellers were eventually rehoused in the suburbs and the scheme cost local government £300,000. The death rate in Corporation Street decreased dramatically – from approximately 53 per 1,000 between 1873 and 1875 to 21 per 1,000 between 1879 and 1881.\nDuring Chamberlain's tenure of office, public and private money was used to construct libraries, municipal swimming pools and schools. Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery was enlarged and a number of new parks were opened. Construction of the Council House was begun, while the Victoria Law Courts were built on Corporation Street.\nThe mayoralty helped make Chamberlain a national as well as local figure, with contemporaries commenting upon his youthfulness and dress, including \"a black velvet coat, jaunty eyeglass in eye, red neck-tie drawn through a ring\". His contribution to the city's improvement earned Chamberlain the allegiance of the so-called Birmingham caucus for the rest of his public career.\nHis biographer states:\n\nEarly in his political career, Chamberlain constructed arguably his greatest and most enduring accomplishment, a model of \"gas-and-water\" or municipal socialism widely admired in the industrial world. At his ceaseless urging, Birmingham embarked on an improvement scheme to tear down its central slums and replace them with healthy housing and commercial thoroughfares, both to ventilate the town and to attract business. This scheme, however, strained the financial resources of the town and undermined the consensus in favour of reform.\n\n\nNational politics\n\n\nParliament and National Liberal Federation: 1876–80\nChamberlain was invited to stand for election as an MP by the Sheffield Reform Association, an offshoot of the Liberal Party in the city, soon after starting as mayor. Chamberlain's first Parliamentary campaign in 1874 was a fierce one; opponents accused him of republicanism and atheism and even threw dead cats at him on the speaking platform. Chamberlain came in third—a poor result for a leading urban Radical—and rejected the possibility of standing in Sheffield again. Instead, he stood unopposed for a Birmingham constituency by-election in 1876, after George Dixon resigned. Following his nomination, Chamberlain denounced Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli as \"a man who never told the truth except by accident.\" After Chamberlain came under heavy attack for the insult, creating anxiety for the Liberals, he apologised publicly. Upon his election, Chamberlain resigned as mayor and was introduced to the House of Commons by John Bright and Joseph Cowen. On 4 August 1876, Chamberlain made his maiden speech during a debate on elementary schools, using his experience on the Birmingham School Board. He spoke for twenty minutes on the maintenance of clause 25 with Disraeli present.\nAlmost immediately upon entry to the House of Commons, Chamberlain began to organise the Radical MPs into a coherent parliamentary group, with the intent to displace Whig dominance of the Liberal Party. Early difficulties within Parliament led Chamberlain to favor a grassroots approach instead, organising local chapters as the foundation of an effective national movement.\nTo gain footing for the Radicals, Chamberlain sought to close ranks with Gladstone to profit from the leader's increasing popularity and harness popular opposition to Disraeli's aggressive foreign policy, beginning with outrage over Ottoman atrocities in Bulgaria and the resulting Russo-Turkish War. Chamberlain joined Gladstone in arguing Disraeli's policy diverted attention from domestic reform, but unlike many Liberals, Chamberlain was not an anti-imperialist; although he berated the government for its Eastern policy, the Second Afghan War, and the Anglo-Zulu War, he supported Disraeli's purchase of Suez Canal Company shares in November 1875. At this stage of his career, Chamberlain was eager to see the protection of British overseas interests but placed greater emphasis on a conception of justice in the pursuit of such interests.\nOn 31 May 1877, the National Liberal Federation (NLF) was founded at Bingley Hall, with Gladstone offering the inaugural address, Chamberlain as its president, and Birmingham politicians playing a dominant part in its organisation. The NLF enhanced Chamberlain's party influence and gave him a national platform. Through the NLF, Chamberlain tightened party discipline and campaigning, enlisted new party members, organised political meetings and published posters and pamphlets. Contemporary commentators drew often-disparaging comparisons between the Federation and the techniques of American political machines, with Chamberlain serving the role of a political boss. Chamberlain joined the Liberal denunciations of the government's foreign policy in the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister.\n\n\nPresident of the Board of Trade: 1880–85\n\nDespite having sat in Parliament for only four years, Chamberlain hoped for a Cabinet position, and told Sir William Harcourt that he was prepared to lead a revolt and field Radical candidates in borough elections. Although Gladstone did not hold the NLF in high regard, he was eager to reconcile Chamberlain and other Radicals to the mainly Whig cabinet, and he invited Chamberlain to become President of the Board of Trade on 27 April 1880.\nAfter his success in municipal politics, Chamberlain was frustrated at his inability to introduce more creative legislation at the Board of Trade. Between 1880 and 1883, the government was preoccupied with Ireland, the Transvaal, and Egypt. Chamberlain introduced bills for the safer transportation of grain, for enabling municipal corporations to establish electricity supplies, and for ensuring a fairer system of payment for seamen. After 1883, Chamberlain was more productive and expanded the scope of his authority; he introduced bills establishing a Board of Trade Bankruptcy Department for inquiring into failed business deals and subjecting patents to Board of Trade supervision. Chamberlain also sought to end the practice of over-insuring coffin ships, but despite endorsements by Tory Democrats Lord Randolph Churchill and John Eldon Gorst, the government was unwilling to grant Chamberlain its full support and the Bill was withdrawn in July 1884.\n\n\nIreland\nAs President of the Board of Trade, Chamberlain took a special interest in Ireland. Chamberlain strongly opposed the Irish Home Rule movement on the belief that home rule would lead to the eventual break-up of the empire; he declared, \"I cannot admit that five millions of Irishmen have any greater right to govern themselves without regard to the rest of the United Kingdom than the five million inhabitants of the metropolis\". In an effort to quiet agitation in Ireland through appeasement, Chamberlain supported calls for a Land Bill and opposed Chief Secretary William Edward Forster's tactics of lethal force and mass imprisonment. In April 1881, Gladstone's government introduced the Irish Land Act, but Charles Stewart Parnell encouraged tenants to withhold rents. As a result, Parnell and other leaders were imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol on 13 October 1881.\nChamberlain supported the imprisonment and used it to bargain the informal Kilmainham Treaty in 1882. Under the informal agreement, the government released Parnell in return for his co-operation in implementing the Land Act. Forster resigned, but his successor, Lord Frederick Cavendish, was murdered by members of the Irish National Invincibles on 6 May 1882, leaving the treaty almost useless. Many, including Parnell, believed that Chamberlain would be offered the Chief Secretaryship, but Gladstone appointed Sir George Otto Trevelyan instead. Nevertheless, Chamberlain maintained an interest in Irish affairs and proposed to the Cabinet an Irish Central Board that would have legislative powers for land, education and communications, which was rejected by the Whigs in Cabinet on 9 May 1885.\n\n\nElectoral reform\nEarly in the Gladstone ministry, Chamberlain unsuccessfully suggested the extension of the franchise; the Prime Minister deferred until 1884, when the Liberals proposed a Third Reform Bill which gave the vote to hundreds of thousands of rural labourers. Chamberlain and the Radicals campaigned to capture the new voters with public meetings, speeches and articles written in the Fortnightly Review. The Third Reform Act of 1884 was followed by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, negotiated by Gladstone and Conservative leader Lord Salisbury.\n\nDuring debate on the 1884 County Franchise Bill, Chamberlain famously declared that Salisbury was \"himself the spokesman of a class — a class to which he himself belongs — who toil not neither do they spin.\" In response, Salisbury branded Chamberlain a \"Sicilian bandit\" and Stafford Northcote called him \"Jack Cade\". When Chamberlain suggested that he would march on London with thousands of Birmingham constituents to protest against the House of Lords' powers, Salisbury remarked that \"Mr. Chamberlain will return from his adventure with a broken head if nothing worse.\"\n\n\n1885 election\nIn 1885, Chamberlain sought to \"utterly destroy the Whigs, and have a Radical government before many years are out.\" To that end, Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke privately presented their resignations to Gladstone on 20 May, after the Cabinet had rejected Chamberlain's proposed Irish plan and his scheme for the creation of National Councils in England, Scotland, and Wales. The resignations were not made public, but the opportunity came for Chamberlain to present his Radicalism to the country after the Gladstone budget failed on 8 June, triggering a new general election with a dramatically expanded, redistributed electorate.\nIn July 1885, Chamberlain wrote the preface to the Radical Programme, the first campaign handbook in British political history. It endorsed land reform, more direct taxation, free public education, the disestablishment of the Church of England, universal male suffrage, and greater protection for trade unions. Chamberlain drew inspiration from his friend Frederick Maxse's 1873 pamphlet The Causes of Social Revolt. Chamberlain's proposal to separate free education for every child from the religious question was rejected by groups on all sides, including the NLF, Nonconformists, Catholics and more generally, taxpayers. The Programme earned the scorn of Whig Liberals and Conservatives alike.\nChamberlain began his election campaign at Hull on 5 August, in front of large posters declaring him to be \"your coming Prime Minister.\" Until the campaign's end in October, he denounced opponents of the Programme and used the slogan \"Three Acres and a Cow\" to endorse the cause of the rural labourers, offering to make smallholdings available to them by using funds from local authorities. Chamberlain's campaign attracted large crowds and enthralled the young Ramsay MacDonald and David Lloyd George, but disturbed leading Liberals like George Goschen, who called it the \"Unauthorised Programme\". The Conservatives denounced Chamberlain as an anarchist, with some even comparing him to Dick Turpin.\nIn October 1885, as the campaign came to a close, Chamberlain visited Gladstone at Hawarden Castle to reconcile their respective electoral programmes. The meeting, although good-natured, was largely unproductive, and Gladstone neglected to tell Chamberlain of his ongoing negotiations with Parnell over Irish Home Rule. Chamberlain was informed their existence by Henry Labouchere, but, did not press the issue, unsure of the precise nature of Gladstone's offer.\nThe Liberals won a plurality in November 1885 but fell just short of a majority against the Conservatives. The Irish Nationalists held the balance of power between the two parties.\n\n\nLiberal split\nOn 17 December, Herbert Gladstone revealed that his father, needing Nationalist support, was prepared to implement Home Rule. At first, Chamberlain was reluctant to anger his Radical followers by joining forces with the anti-Home Rule Whigs and Conservatives. While saying little about the topic publicly, Chamberlain privately damned Gladstone and Home Rule to colleagues, believing that maintaining the Conservatives in power for a further year would make the Irish question easier to settle.\nChamberlain declined Gladstone's offer of the office of First Lord of the Admiralty; Gladstone in turn rejected Chamberlain's request for the Colonial Office and eventually appointed him President of the Local Government Board. Their personal relationship worsened after a dispute over the amount to be paid to Collings, Chamberlain's Parliamentary Secretary, although Chamberlain still hoped that he could alter or block Gladstone's Home Rule proposal in Cabinet and renew his scheme for National Councils, but the topic was never discussed.\nOn 13 March 1886, Gladstone's proposals for Ireland were revealed. Chamberlain argued that the details of the accompanying Land Purchase Bill should be made known in order for a fair judgment on Home Rule. When Gladstone stated his intention to give Ireland a separate Parliament with full powers to deal with Irish affairs, Chamberlain resolved to resign and wrote to inform Gladstone of his decision two days later. In the meantime, Chamberlain consulted with Arthur Balfour over the possibility of concerted action with the Conservatives and contemplated similar co-operation with the Whigs. His resignation was made public on 27 March 1886.\n\n\nLiberal Unionist: 1886–93\nImmediately after his resignation from Cabinet, Chamberlain launched a ferocious campaign against Gladstone's Irish proposals. His motivations combined imperial, domestic, and personal themes: imperial because the proposal threatened to weaken Parliament's control over the United Kingdom, domestic because they downplayed the Radical programme, and personal because they weakened his own standing in the party.\nOn 9 April, Chamberlain spoke against the Irish Home Rule Bill in its first reading. Chamberlain's chances of displacing Gladstone as party leader declined dramatically and in early May, the National Liberal Federation declared its loyalty to Gladstone. On 14 May, Chamberlain attended a meeting of Liberal Unionists, from which arose the Liberal Unionist Association, an ad hoc alliance to demonstrate the unity of anti-Home Rulers. Meanwhile, to distinguish himself from the Whigs, Chamberlain founded the National Radical Union to rival the NLF. During its second reading on 8 June, the Home Rule Bill was defeated by the combined opposition of Chamberlain radicals, Conservatives, and Whigs. In all, 93 Liberals voted against Gladstone.\n\n\n1886 election and Unionist government\nParliament was dissolved, and in the July 1886 general election, the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists, led by Lord Salisbury and Lord Hartington, agreed to an alliance. Chamberlain's position in the alliance was awkward; unlike Hartington, he was intensely mistrusted by and unable to influence the Conservatives, and he was also despised by the Gladstonians. Gladstone himself observed, \"There is a difference between Hartington and Chamberlain, that the first behaves like and is a thorough gentleman. Of the other, it is better not to speak.\" The general election was dominated by Home Rule, and Chamberlain's campaign was both Radical and intensely patriotic. The Unionist alliance took 393 seats in the House of Commons and a comfortable majority.\nChamberlain did not enter the Unionist government, aware of Conservative hostility and not wishing to alienate his Radical base. The Liberal mainstream cast Chamberlain as a villain, shouting \"Judas!\" and \"Traitor!\" as he entered the House of Commons. Unable to associate decisively with either party, Chamberlain sought concerted action with a kindred spirit from the Conservative Party, Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Randolph Churchill. In November 1886, Churchill announced his own programme at Dartford, borrowing much from Chamberlain's, including smallholdings for rural labourers and greater local government. The next month, Churchill resigned as Chancellor over military spending; when the Conservative mainstream rallied around Salisbury, Churchill's career was effectively ended, and so too was Chamberlain's hope of creating a powerful cross-party alliance of Radicals. The appointment of George Goschen to succeed Churchill isolated Chamberlain further and symbolised the strong relationship between non-Radical Liberal Unionists and the Conservatives.\nIn January 1887, Chamberlain, Trevelyan, Harcourt, John Morley and Lord Herschell participated in a series of Round Table Conferences to resolve the Liberal Party's Irish policy. Chamberlain hoped an accord would enable him to claim the Liberal leadership and influence over the Conservatives. Although a preliminary agreement was made concerning land purchase, Gladstone was unwilling to compromise further, and negotiations ended by March. In August 1887, Lord Salisbury invited Chamberlain to lead the British delegation to resolve a fisheries dispute between the United States and Newfoundland. The visit to the United States renewed his enthusiasm for politics and enhanced his standing with respect to Gladstone.\nUpon his return to Britain, Chamberlain and Radicalism experienced new political success. He extracted his supporters from the Liberal Party and created the Liberal Unionist Association in 1888, associated with his National Radical Union. The Salisbury ministry implemented a number of Radical reforms as well. Between 1888 and 1889, democratic County councils were established. By 1891, measures for the provision of smallholdings had been made, and the free, compulsory education was extended to the entire country. Chamberlain wrote, \"I have in the last five years seen more progress made with the practical application of my political programme than in all my previous life. I owe this result entirely to my former opponents, and all the opposition has come from my former friends.\"\n\n\n1892 election and return to minority\nIn the 1892 general election, Gladstone returned to power with a Liberal-Irish Nationalist coalition. The Liberal Unionists did well in Birmingham and made gains in the neighbouring Black Country, and Chamberlain's son Austen entered the House of Commons unopposed for East Worcestershire. However, the Liberal Unionists were reduced to 47 seats, falling behind in an age of well-organized mass national politics, and Chamberlain's standing was accordingly weakened. Gladstone made no effort to reunite with Chamberlain, and the Liberal Unionists drew closer to the Conservatives. When Hartington took his seat in the House of Lords as the Duke of Devonshire, Chamberlain assumed leadership of the Liberal Unionists in the House of Commons, beginning a productive relationship with Arthur Balfour, Conservative leader in the Commons.\nGladstone introduced a Second Home Rule Bill in February 1893. Although the Bill passed the House of Commons, the Lords rejected Home Rule by a huge margin. With his party divided, Gladstone prepared to dissolve Parliament on the issue of the House of Lords' veto, but was compelled to resign in March 1894 by his colleagues. He was replaced by Lord Rosebery, who neglected the topic of Home Rule. Chamberlain continued to form alliances with the Conservatives.\n\nChamberlain became concerned about the threat of socialism during this period, although the Independent Labour Party had only one MP, Keir Hardie. He sought to divert collectivist energy toward Unionism and continued to propose radical reforms to the Conservatives. In his 1893 \"Memorandum of a Programme for Social Reform\", Chamberlain made a number of suggestions to Salisbury, including old age pensions, the provision of home loans to the working class, an amendment to the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875 to encourage street improvements, compensation for industrial accidents, reduced train fares for workers, tighter border controls, and shorter working hours. Salisbury was guardedly sympathetic. Chamberlain also wrote an unpublished 1895 play, The Game of Politics, characterising socialists as the instigators of class conflict.\nOn 21 June 1895, the Liberal government was defeated on a motion that criticised the Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Secretary of State for War, for shortages of cordite, and Salisbury was invited to form a government.\n\n\nStatesman: 1895–1903\n\n\nColonial Secretary\n\nHaving agreed to a set of policies, the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists formed a government on 24 June 1895, with Liberal Unionists granted four Cabinet positions. Salisbury and Balfour offered Chamberlain any Cabinet position except Foreign Secretary or Leader of the House of Commons which they reserved for themselves respectively. To their surprise, Chamberlain asked for the Colonial Office, declining the Exchequer, for unwillingness to be constrained by Conservative spending plans, and Home Secretary. Chamberlain's choice to enter the cabinet in a subordinate role was the result of an adjustment in his political strategy following a lost dispute over a seat at Leamington Spa putting his program of social reform on the back burner. Chamberlain took formal charge of the Colonial Office on 1 July 1895, with a Unionist victory assured in the upcoming general election. He would remain in the position for eight years.\nTo further surprise, Chamberlain used the Colonial Office to become one of the dominant figures in British politics and a statesman of global consequence. His ministerial portfolio included control of numerous colonies, notably excluding India and Canada. Once an outspoken anti-imperialist, Chamberlain's unionism had by 1895 led him to fully embrace Imperial Federation as an alternative, with support from Conservative backbenchers. He sought to foster closer relations between Great Britain and the settler colonies, expand the Empire in Africa, the Americas, and Asia, and reorder imperial trade through preferential tariffs. His proposals faced opposition from the settler colonies themselves, which sought greater autonomy under the Crown.\nIn addition to a policy of imperial unity, Chamberlain aggressively pursued development projects in each colony. Chamberlain stated confidently, \"I believe that the British race is the greatest of the governing races that the world has ever seen... It is not enough to occupy great spaces of the world's surface unless you can make the best of them. It is the duty of a landlord to develop his estate.\" Accordingly, he advocated investment in underdeveloped possessions, especially Africa and the West Indies, which earned him the nickname \"Joseph Africanus\" among the press. He also recognised the need to handle the unfamiliar tropical diseases that ravaged Britain's subject peoples. With Chamberlain's support, Patrick Manson founded the London School of Tropical Medicine, the world's second medical facility dedicated to tropical medicine, in 1899.\n\n\nWest Africa\n\nSome of Chamberlain's development and colonial expansion efforts were centered on West Africa, in light of the region's economic potential and ongoing colonial gamesmanship with the French which centered there. Though Salisbury was willing to sacrifice West African claims in favour of a Cape-to-Cairo strategy, Chamberlain sought expansion on both fronts.\nIn 1895, Chamberlain sanctioned the conquest of the Ashanti Confederacy and its annexation to the Gold Coast. Using the emergency funds of the colonies of Lagos, Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, he ordered the construction of a railway for the newly conquered area. The Colonial Office's aggressive strategy brought it into conflict with the Royal Niger Company. The Company, chaired by Sir George Goldie, possessed title rights to large stretches of the Niger River but had yet to assume governing responsibilities. With the area open to incursion, the French sent small garrisons to the region. In 1897, Chamberlain was dismayed to learn that the French had expanded from Dahomey to Bussa, a town claimed by Goldie. Further French expansion threatened to isolate Lagos; Chamberlain therefore argued that \"even at the cost of war\" Britain should \"keep an adequate Hinterland for the Gold Coast, Lagos & the Niger Territories.\"\nInfluenced by Chamberlain, Salisbury sanctioned British Ambassador in Paris Sir Edmund Monson to take an assertive diplomatic stance. Subsequent concessions by the French encouraged Chamberlain, who arranged for a military force commanded by Frederick Lugard to occupy the region. In a risky 'chequerboard' strategy, Lugard's forces occupied French claims to counterbalance the French garrisons in British territory. At times, French and British troops were stationed merely a few yards from each other, threatening war. Nevertheless, Chamberlain correctly assumed French officers were ordered to avoid conflict. In March 1898, the French proposed a settlement: Bussa was returned to Britain in exchange for the town of Bona, imposing British control over the Niger and the inland territories of Sokoto; the region was later consolidated as Nigeria.\nIn 1898, the Mende and Temne tribes of Sierra Leone launched the Hut Tax War against inland colonial expansion. Chamberlain appointed Sir David Patrick Chalmers as a special commissioner to investigate the violence. Chalmers blamed the tax, but Chamberlain disagreed and blamed African slave traders. Chamberlain used the revolt to promote his aggressive \"constructive imperialism\" in West Africa.\n\n\nInvolvement in Jameson Raid: 1895–96\n\nIn November 1895, Prime Minister of the Cape Colony Cecil Rhodes assembled the private army of the British South Africa Company (of which he was also managing director) on land along the border with the South African Republic. Rhodes, who shared Chamberlain's desire to extend British dominion to all of South Africa, hoped to encourage the primarily British Uitlanders to revolt against the Afrikaner republic and overthrow its government. He placed the army under the command of Leander Starr Jameson.\nOn Boxing Day, Chamberlain informed Salisbury that a rebellion was expected, though he said he remained uncertain of its date. In fact, Chamberlain had requested his Assistant Under-Secretary to encourage Rhodes to \"hurry up\" (given the deteriorating Venezuelan situation). Upon learning of the Jameson Raid's initiation on 31 December (two days after it began), Chamberlain remarked, \"If this succeeds, it will ruin me. I'm going up to London to crush it\". He ordered Governor Hercules Robinson to repudiate the raid and warned Rhodes that his implication in the raid would endanger the Company's charter. The raid ultimately failed, and the raiders, including Jameson, were arrested and tried in London.\nDuring the trial, Rhodes' solicitor claimed that cablegrams between Rhodes and his agents in London, including Chamberlain's urge to \"hurry up,\" demonstrated that the Colonial Office \"influenced the actions of those in South Africa\" who had participated in the raid. The solicitor further alleged that Chamberlain had transferred the land to the Company to facilitate the raid. In June 1896, Chamberlain showed Salisbury one or more of the cablegrams and offered his resignation. Salisbury refused, possibly reluctant to lose the government's most popular figure, and aggressively supported Chamberlain by endorsing his threat to withdraw the Company's charter if the cablegrams were revealed. Accordingly, Rhodes withheld them. As no evidence was produced, a select committee absolved Chamberlain of responsibility.\nChamberlain's involvement in the planning and ultimate failure of the raid remain controversial, as do his and Salisbury's subsequent efforts to obscure the extent of that involvement. In 2002, The Van Riebeeck Society published Secret History of the Jameson Raid and the South African Crisis, 1895–1902, a contemporary insider account by Robinson's secretary, Sir Graham Bower. Bower suggests that the Colonial Office covered up Chamberlain's own involvement and knowledge of the raid. In a 2004 review for The Historian, Alan Cousins commented, \"A number of major themes and concerns emerge, perhaps the most poignant being Bower's accounts of his being made a scapegoat in the aftermath of the raid: 'since a scapegoat was wanted, I was willing to serve my country in that capacity.'\"\nCousins further writes:\n\n[Bower] believed that, as he had given Rhodes his word not to divulge certain private conversations, he had to abide by that, while at the same time he was convinced that it would be very damaging to Britain if he said anything to the parliamentary committee to show the close involvement of Sir Hercules Robinson and Joseph Chamberlain in their disreputable encouragement of those plotting an uprising in Johannesburg. ... In his reflections, Bower has a particularly damning judgement on Chamberlain, whom he accuses of 'brazen lying' to Parliament, and of what amounted to forgery in the documents made public for the inquiry. In the report of the committee, Bower was found culpable of complicity, while no blame was attached to Joseph Chamberlain or Robinson. His name was never cleared during his lifetime, and Bower was never reinstated to what he believed should be his proper position in the colonial service: he was, in effect, demoted to the post of Colonial Secretary in Mauritius.\n\n\nAttempts at Anglo-German alliance: 1898–99\n\nOn 29 March 1898, at a period of Anglo-German tensions following the Jameson Raid and Kruger Telegram, Chamberlain met the German Ambassador, Paul von Hatzfeldt, in London. The conversation was strictly unofficial, ostensibly to discuss colonial matters and China. Chamberlain surprised Hatzfeldt by assuring him that Britain and Germany had common interests and that a defensive alliance should be formed with regards to China. From the German perspective, prospects for even a limited alliance were dim. The Reichstag was debating Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz's First Navy Bill, which characterised Britain as a threat to Germany. Foreign Minister Bernhard von Bülow preferred an alliance with Russia, reasoning that democracy in Britain rendered any alliance unstable, given that a new Parliament and new Cabinet could quickly reverse the diplomatic commitments of its predecessors. Hatzfeldt was therefore instructed to make an agreement appear likely without ever conceding to Chamberlain. On 25 April, Hatzfeldt asked for colonial concessions as a precursor to a better relationship. Chamberlain rejected the proposal, thereby terminating the talks. Though Salisbury was unsurprised, Chamberlain was disappointed and spoke publicly of Britain's diplomatic predicament at Birmingham on 13 May, saying that \"We have had no allies. I am afraid we have had no friends... We stand alone.\"\nA second round of talks opened with Chamberlain in complete control, Salisbury having taken leave in July 1899 to attend to his dying wife. The predicate for negotiations was the death of King Malietoa Laupepa of Samoa, a tripartite protectorate of Britain, Germany, and the United States. The ensuing succession was contested by a German proxy, Mata'afa Iosefo, leading to civil war; the three powers thus attempted to negotiate a truce. Chamberlain, smarting from his talks with Hatzfeldt, refused an offer which would result in British withdrawal from Samoa for concessions elsewhere, remarking dismissively, \"Last year we offered you everything. Now it is too late.\"\nWhen British forcefulness incensed German official and public opinion, Chamberlain made efforts to improve relations by facilitating a visit by Kaiser Wilhelm II and von Bülow. During the visit, Chamberlain reiterated his desire for an agreement to both men. The Kaiser spoke optimistically but feared tensions with Russia and indicated that Salisbury's strategy of \"splendid isolation\" rendered any alliance unreliable. At a subsequent meeting with von Bülow, Chamberlain argued that Britain, Germany, and the United States should combine to check France and Russia. Von Bülow thought British assistance would be of little use and suggested that Chamberlain should speak positively of Germany in public. Chamberlain inferred from von Bülow's statement that he would reciprocate in the Reichstag.\nOn 30 November, the day after the Kaiser and von Bülow departed, Chamberlain spoke at Leicester of \"a new Triple Alliance between the Teutonic race and the two great trans-Atlantic branches of the Anglo-Saxon race which would become a potent influence on the future of the world.\" Though the Kaiser was complimentary, Friedrich von Holstein described Chamberlain's speech as a \"blunder,\" and The Times attacked Chamberlain for using the term \"alliance\" without inhibition. On 11 December, von Bülow spoke in support of von Tirpitz's Second Navy Bill, and made no reference to an agreement with Britain, which he described as a declining nation jealous of Germany. Chamberlain was startled and irritated, but von Hatzfeldt assured him that von Bülow's motivation was to fend off opponents in the Reichstag, and Chamberlain's hopes for an alliance remained alive.\n\n\nBoer War: 1899–1902\n\nAfter the failed Jameson Raid and the growing wealth of the Transvaal following the discovery of gold, British hopes for the federation of South Africa under the Crown waned. By 1897, it appeared certain that any future union of the Southern African states would be as a Boer-dominated republic outside the British Empire. Nevertheless, Chamberlain directed a steady upkeep of military pressure on the Transvaal and Orange Free State, ostensibly to protect the civil rights of the Uitlanders. In April 1897, Chamberlain asked the Cabinet to increase the British garrison in South Africa by three to four thousand men; forces grew over the next two years. In August 1897, the government appointed Sir Alfred Milner High Commissioner for Southern Africa and Governor of the Cape Colony to pursue the issue more directly. Within a year, Milner concluded that war was inevitable and worked with Chamberlain to publicise the cause of the Uitlanders to the British people.\n\nIn May 1899, Milner met with State President of the South African Republic Paul Kruger but failed to resolve tensions; the Boers left the conference convinced that the British were determined to use force. By now, British public opinion supported war in support of the Uitlanders, allowing Chamberlain to successfully request further reinforcements. By October 1899, nearly 20,000 British troops were based in the South African colonies with thousands more en route. On 9 October, Kruger issued an ultimatum for the withdrawal of British troops from the borders and the return of any troops destined for South Africa. On 12 October, the South African Republic and Orange Free State declared war.\nChamberlain directed the war from the Colonial Office; Salisbury rubber-stamped his decisions. Early fighting favored the Boers. Boer regular army units outnumbered the British 3:1 on the front lines and quickly besieged the towns of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. Some ten thousand Cape Afrikaners joined the Boers. In mid-December 1899, the British Army suffered reverses at the battles of Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso in what came to be known as \"Black Week.\"\nChamberlain privately criticized the Army's performance and was exasperated by Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War. When the Boers bombarded Ladysmith with Creusot ninety-four pounder siege guns, Chamberlain asked for the dispatch of comparable artillery to the war. Landsdowne argued that such weapons required platforms that needed a year of preparation, even though the Boers operated theirs without elaborate mountings. Chamberlain was also resistant to Milner's desire to suspend the constitution of the Cape Colony, an act that would have given Milner autocratic powers and threatened to deepen internal divisions between British and Afrikaner subjects.\nThroughout the war, Chamberlain worked to strengthen bonds between Britain and her self-governing colonies under the slogan \"One Flag, One Queen, One Tongue.\" Over 30,000 troops from Canada, Australia and New Zealand served in the war. In particular, the contributions of mounted men from the settler colonies helped fill the Army's mounted infantry shortfall. Chamberlain also managed the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act through the Commons, hoping that the newly established federation would adopt a positive wartime attitude towards imperial trade.\nAs the government's foremost defender of the war, Chamberlain was denounced by many prominent anti-war personalities, including his former admirer, David Lloyd George. When the government faced a vote of censure in the House of Commons concerning the management of the war, Chamberlain conducted the defence. On 5 February, Chamberlain spoke effectively in the Commons for over an hour. He defended the war, espoused the virtues of a South African federation and promoted the Empire. The censure was subsequently defeated by 213 votes. British fortunes changed after January 1900 with the appointment of Lord Roberts to command British forces in South Africa. Bloemfontein was occupied on 13 March, Johannesburg on 31 May and Pretoria on 5 June.\nWhen Roberts formally annexed the Transvaal on 3 September, the Salisbury ministry, emboldened by an apparent victory, asked for the dissolution of Parliament, with an election set for October.\n\n\nWorkmen's Compensation Act and pension proposal\n\nDespite his focus on foreign policy as Colonial Secretary, Chamberlain had not abandoned his long dedication to social reform. His Workmen's Compensation Act 1897, which adapted the German model, was a key domestic achievement of the Unionist government. It cost the Treasury nothing since compensation was paid for by insurance that employers were required to take out. The system operated from 1897 to 1946.\nChamberlain also attempted to design an old age pension programme but failed to gain Conservative approval. Further opposition came from friendly societies, which were funded by their own private members' pension program.\n\n\nZenith of power: 1900–03\n\n\nKhaki Election of 1900\n\nIn the 1900 election Salisbury, in mourning for his wife and ill himself, made no speeches and Balfour made few public appearances. In their stead Chamberlain dominated the Unionist campaign to the point that some referred to it as \"Joe's election”. He ensured that the Boer War featured as the campaign's single issue, arguing that a Liberal victory would result in defeat in South Africa and lending the election its ‘khaki election’ sobriquet, after the colour of the new uniforms worn by British troops.\nThe Unionists controversially tied their Liberal opponents direct to the enemy using the phrase \"Every seat lost to the government is a seat sold to the Boers\"; some posters portrayed Liberal MPs praising Kruger and helping him to haul down the Union Jack. Chamberlain himself made personal use of such tactics, declaring in a speech, \"We have come practically to the end of the war... There is nothing going on now but a guerrilla business, which is encouraged by these men—I was going to say those traitors, but I will say instead these misguided individuals.\" Some Liberals resorted to retaliatory tactics, with Lloyd George in particular accusing Chamberlain's son and brother of war profiteering. Though many Liberals rejected Lloyd George's claims and Chamberlain dismissed them as unworthy of reply, the charges troubled him more than he was prepared to make evident in public.\nLeveraging the cause of imperialism to devastating effect and splitting the Liberals over the war, the Unionists won a huge 219-seat majority in the House of Commons. Though the mandate was not as comprehensive as Chamberlain had hoped, it strengthened the government and his own standing within it, allowing him to pursue his vision for the Empire.\nA twenty-six-year-old Winston Churchill, already famous for his wartime correspondence for The Morning Post and escape from a prisoner-of-war camp, successfully stood as a Conservative candidate in Oldham. Chamberlain spoke on his behalf, and Churchill later recalled the experience:\n\nI watched my honoured guest with close attention. He loved the roar of the multitude, and with my father could always say 'I have never feared the English democracy.' The blood mantled in his cheek, and his eye as it caught mine twinkled with pure enjoyment.\nChurchill later wrote of the period, \"Mr. Chamberlain was incomparably the most live, sparkling, insurgent, compulsive figure in British affairs ... 'Joe' was the one who made the weather. He was the man the masses knew.\"\n\n\nThird failed attempt at Anglo-German alliance: 1900–02\nThe ailing Salisbury resigned as Foreign Secretary at the conclusion of the 1900 election, under pressure from Balfour and Queen Victoria. He was succeeded in that role by the relatively inexperienced Lord Lansdowne, but Chamberlain seized the initiative in British foreign affairs. His first goal was, yet again, to formulate an agreement with Germany.\nOn 16 January 1901, Chamberlain and Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire made it known to Baron Hermann von Eckardstein that Britain still planned to join the Triple Alliance. The news was received with some satisfaction in Berlin, although von Bülow continued to exercise caution. The Kaiser urged a positive response, but von Bülow wished to delay negotiations until Britain was made vulnerable by the ongoing war in South Africa. On 18 March, Eckardstein asked Chamberlain to resume negotiations, but he was unwilling to commit himself following von Bülow's 1899 rebuke. Instead, Eckardstein negotiated directly with the Foreign Secretary, Landsdowne, and Chamberlain was sidelined. A five-year Anglo-German defensive alliance was presented, to be ratified by Parliament and the Reichstag. When Lansdowne prevaricated, von Hatzfeldt presented a demanding invitation for Britain to join the Triple Alliance, committed to the defence of Austria-Hungary. Salisbury decided decisively against entering as a junior partner.\nOn 25 October 1901, as part of a defense of British Army tactics in South Africa, Chamberlain made a favorable comparison to the conduct of troops in the Franco-Prussian War, a statement directed at Germany. Despite outrage in the German press and von Bülow's demand for an apology, Chamberlain was unrepentant. This public dispute finally ended Chamberlain's hopes of an Anglo-German alliance, but Chamberlain's popularity in Britain soared, with The Times commenting, \"Mr. Chamberlain... is at this moment the most popular and trusted man in England.\" Still seeking an end to \"splendid isolation,\" Chamberlain sought to escalate negotiations with French Ambassador Paul Cambon (begun in March 1901 to settle colonial differences), though neither Lansdowne nor Cambon moved as quickly as Chamberlain would have liked. In February 1902, at a banquet at Marlborough House held by King Edward VII, Chamberlain and Cambon resumed their negotiations, with Eckardstein reputedly listening to their conversation and only successfully managing to comprehend the words \"Morocco\" and \"Egypt\". Chamberlain had contributed to making possible the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale that would occur in 1904.\n\n\nConclusion of the Boer War: 1900–02\nDespite Chamberlain's and popular belief throughout the general election campaign, the Boers had not been subdued, and the \"guerrilla business\" to which Chamberlain referred persisted through May 1902. As the war dragged on Chamberlain was caught between Unionists demanding a more effective military policy and many Liberals denouncing the conduct of the war.\n\n\nConcentration camps scandal\n\nPublicly, Chamberlain called for greater deference to Roberts's military judgment and administration, insisting upon the separation of civil and military authority. However public pressure on Chamberlain and the civilian government to intervene intensified following the exposition of concentration camps and the poor conditions therein. Chamberlain had originally questioned the wisdom of establishing the camps, intended to house refugee families, but tolerated them out of deference to the military.\nAs the scandal intensified in the autumn of 1901 Chamberlain strengthened civilian administration, though he refused to criticise the military publicly. He outlined to Milner the importance of making the camps as habitable as possible, asking whether the governor-general considered medical provisions adequate. Chamberlain also stipulated that unhealthy camps should be evacuated, overruling the Army where necessary. By 1902 the death rate in the camps had halved, ultimately falling below the usual mortality rate in rural South Africa.\n\n\nPeace\n\nDespite the concerns of Chancellor of the Exchequer Michael Hicks Beach over the increasing cost of the war, Chamberlain maintained insistence on unconditional surrender with the support of Salisbury. Though Lord Kitchener, commanding British forces in South Africa, was eager to make peace, Milner was content to wait until the Boers sought terms. In April 1902, Boer negotiators accepted Chamberlain's conditions, dissolution of the South African Republic and Orange Free State, in exchange for amnesty for Cape Afrikaner rebels and a payment of the republics' war debts. Chamberlain accepted over Milner's objection, arguing that the cost of continuing the war justified the expenditure. The Treaty of Vereeniging ended the Boer War on 31 May 1902. The end of war and the annexation of Boer territory presented Chamberlain an opportunity to remodel Britain's imperial system, though at a high cost: the British had put nearly 450,000 troops into the field and had spent nearly £200 million.\n\n\nSalisbury resignation and Balfour government: 1902\nThe end of the war allowed Salisbury to finally retire. Though the Prime Minister was keen to be succeeded by his nephew Balfour, Chamberlain's supporters felt the Colonial Secretary, as the most popular figure in the government, had a legitimate claim to the premiership. Leo Maxse argued forcefully in the National Review for Chamberlain as prime minister; Chamberlain himself was less concerned, assuring Balfour's private secretary, \"I have my own work to do and... I shall be quite willing to serve under Balfour.\"\nOn 7 July 1902, Chamberlain suffered a head injury in a traffic accident. Chamberlain had three stitches and was told by doctors to cease work immediately and remain in bed for two weeks.\nOn 11 July, Salisbury went to Buckingham Palace without notifying his Cabinet colleagues and resigned. The King invited Balfour to form a new government later that day. Before accepting, Balfour met Chamberlain, who said he was content to remain Colonial Secretary. Despite Chamberlain's organisational skills and immense popularity, many Conservatives still mistrusted his Radicalism, and Chamberlain was aware of the difficulties that would be presented by being part of a Liberal Unionist minority leading a Conservative majority. Balfour and Chamberlain were both aware that the Unionist government's survival depended on their co-operation.\n\n\nEducation Act 1902\n\nOne of Balfour's first acts as prime minister was the introduction of an Education Act, intended to promote National Efficiency. Though Chamberlain supported the cause, the Balfour Act abolished the 2,568 school boards established under the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict. c. 75) which remained popular with Nonconformists and Radicals and replaced them with local education authorities to administer a state centred system of primary, secondary and technical schools. The Bill would also give ratepayers' money to voluntary Church of England schools; opposition to that provision in the 1870 Act had spurred on Chamberlain's first involvement in politics.\nChamberlain was aware that the Bill would estrange Nonconformists, Radicals and many Liberal Unionists from the government, but could not oppose it without risking his cabinet post. In response to Chamberlain's warning and suggestion that voluntary Church schools receive funds from central rather than local government, Robert Laurie Morant replied that the Boer War had drained the Exchequer. Chamberlain did temporarily secure a major concession: local authorities would be given the discretion over the issue of rate aid to voluntary schools. Yet even this was renounced before the Act's passage in December 1902. Chamberlain wrote fatalistically, \"I consider the Unionist cause is hopeless at the next election, and we shall certainly lose the majority of the Liberal Unionists once and for all.\"\n\n\nZionism and \"Uganda Proposal\": 1902–03\n\nOn 23 October 1902, Chamberlain met with Theodor Herzl and expressed his sympathy to the Zionist cause. He was open to Herzl's plan for settlement on the Sinai Peninsula near Arish, but his support was conditional on approval from the Cairo authorities. On 24 April 1903, convinced that such approval would not come, Chamberlain offered Herzl a territory in British East Africa. The proposal came to be known as the Uganda Scheme, as Chamberlain saw the land as he was passing by on the Uganda Railway, though the territory in question was in Kenya. The proposal was rejected by both the Zionist Organization and British settlers in East Africa but was a major break-through for the Zionists, as Great Britain had engaged them diplomatically and recognised a need to find a territory appropriate for Jewish autonomy under British suzerainty.\n\n\nSouth African tour: 1902–03\n\nFrom 26 December 1902 to 25 February 1903, Chamberlain left Britain for a South African tour, seeking to promote Anglo-Afrikaner conciliation and integration into the British Empire. In Natal, Chamberlain was given a rapturous welcome. In the former Transvaal, he met Boer leaders who were attempting unsuccessfully to alter the peace terms. The reception given to Chamberlain in the former Orange Free State, (at the time renamed the Orange River Colony) was surprisingly friendly, although he engaged in a two-hour argument with General James Barry Munnik Hertzog, who accused the British government of violating three terms of the treaty.\nDuring his visit, Chamberlain became convinced that the Boer territories required a period of government by the British crown before being granted self-governance within the empire. In the Cape, Chamberlain found that the Afrikaner Bond was more affable regarding his visit than many members of the English speaking Progressive Party, now under the leadership of Jameson, who called Chamberlain \"the callous devil from Birmingham\". Chamberlain successfully persuaded the prime minister, John Gordon Sprigg, to hold elections as soon as possible, a positive act considering the hostile nature of the Cape Parliament since 1899. During the tour, Chamberlain and his wife visited 29 towns, and he delivered 64 speeches and received 84 deputations.\n\n\nTariff reform, Unionist split, and countrywide crusade: 1902–06\n\nAs an extension of Chamberlain's desire for Imperial Federation against a growing global shift towards the German Empire and the United States of America, he sought to unify and strengthen the imperial economy on the model of Otto von Bismarck's Zollverein and the American protective system. This desire was manifested in the policy of imperial preference, which imposed tariffs on foreign imports to favour imperial trade and generate revenue to finance social improvements. To do so, Chamberlain prepared to end the free trade consensus that had dominated British economics since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846.\n\n\nCorn tax and 1903 budget contest\nIn April 1902, Chamberlain dined with the Hughligans, a small parliamentary clique led by Lord Hugh Cecil. Winston Churchill, among its members in attendance, later recalled:\n\nAs [Chamberlain] rose to leave he paused at the door, and turning said with much deliberation, \"You young gentlemen have entertained me royally, and in return I will give you a priceless secret. Tariffs! They are the politics of the future, and of the near future. Study them closely and make yourself masters of them, and you will not regret your hospitality to me.\"\nIn the same month, Chancellor Michael Hicks Beach levied a small duty on corn imports to raise revenue for the War. Chamberlain was further encouraged in June by a report from Gerald Balfour, the president of the Board of Trade and the Prime Minister's younger brother, recommending reciprocal trade agreements with the colonies. In July, the Colonial Conference convened in London and passed a resolution endorsing Imperial Preference. Chamberlain was confident his proposals were gathering popularity, and he brought imperial preference before the Cabinet on 21 October before embarking on his South African tour. Despite vigorous opposition by the new chancellor, Charles Thomson Ritchie, the Cabinet was generally favourable towards the proposal. In November, the Cabinet agreed to remit the corn tax in favour of the self-governing colonies in the upcoming budget. Chamberlain thus departed for his tour thinking that he had gained the agreement of the Cabinet.\nWhile Chamberlain spent the winter in South Africa, Ritchie worked to reverse the Cabinet's decision. In March 1903, Ritchie asked Balfour to schedule a meeting to propose the budget to the Cabinet. Balfour refused and warned Chamberlain of Ritchie's continued opposition. Chamberlain arrived in Southampton on 14 March prepared to struggle with Ritchie for the maintenance of the corn tax, but he was shocked to find the majority of the Cabinet in agreement with Ritchie. Balfour chose not to oppose Ritchie, for fear of losing his chancellor on the eve of the budget. Chamberlain accepted defeat.\nOn 23 April, the Chancellor presented his free trade budget without opposition. Chamberlain bided his time and retaliated in a speech on 15 May at Bingley Hall, before which he remarked to the event's organiser, \"You can burn your leaflets. We are going to talk about something else.\" In his speech, he lamented the demise of the corn tax and insisted that imperial preference, which he hoped would dominate the next general election, was the only means to maintain the Empire. His impromptu speech stunned Balfour, who had just publicly insisted imperial preference could wait, and the Cabinet. On 28 May, Chamberlain reiterated his challenge in the House of Commons amidst cheers from many Unionists.\nTo defuse Chamberlain's rebellion, Balfour devoted the summer to the study of the question of imperial preference versus free trade. He publicly professed support for neither policy, earning him criticism from the Liberals. Serious debate was sidelined while the Board of Trade compiled statistics, but a Cabinet meeting on 13 August failed to agree, and a final decision was postponed until 14 September, which Balfour hoped would allow Chamberlain time to moderate his position. Content to lose die-hard free trade supporters, Balfour prepared a memorandum containing a number of radical economic reforms.\n\n\nResignation from cabinet and public campaign\nFive days in advance of the scheduled meeting, Chamberlain dramatically sent a letter of resignation to Balfour on 9 September, explaining his wish to campaign publicly for imperial preference outside the Cabinet. An hour before the meeting, Chamberlain and Balfour agreed that Chamberlain would publicly resign if the Cabinet could not be persuaded to adopt the new policy, and Austen Chamberlain would be promoted to chancellor to speak for his father inside the Cabinet. If Chamberlain's public campaign was successful, Balfour could endorse imperial preference at the next general election.\nWhen the Cabinet failed to endorse his proposals, Chamberlain resigned. Balfour did not tell the meeting about Chamberlain's letter, instead telling many members he believed that Chamberlain was not serious. He then forced the resignations of Ritchie and Lord Balfour of Burleigh. The next day, Lord George Hamilton resigned, as did Devonshire. After Devonshire's resignation, Chamberlain asserted his authority over the Liberal Unionists, and the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations declared majority support for tariff reform.\nOn 6 October 1903, Chamberlain began the campaign with a speech at Glasgow. With firm support from provincial Unionists and most of the press, Chamberlain extolled the virtues of imperialism and imperial preference to vast crowds. The newly formed Tariff Reform League received vast funding, allowing it to print and distribute large numbers of leaflets and even to play Chamberlain's recorded messages to public meetings by gramophone.\nChamberlain himself spoke at Greenock, Newcastle, Liverpool, and Leeds, within the first month. At Greenock, he argued free trade threatened British industry, declaring, \"Sugar is gone. Silk has gone. Iron is threatened. Wool is threatened. Cotton will go! How long are you going to stand it? At the present moment these industries... are like sheep in a field.\" At Liverpool, Chamberlain was escorted by mounted police amidst wild cheering. Intending to enlist the working class, Chamberlain assured his audience that tariff reform ensured low unemployment, campaigning with the slogan, \"Tariff Reform Means Work for All.\" When The Daily News countered that official import prices demonstrated a loaf of bread under tariff reform would be smaller than under free trade, Chamberlain arranged for two loaves to be baked based upon the respective prices. On 4 November 1903, Chamberlain put the loaves on display at Bingley Hall and, raising them aloft, asked the audience, \"Is it not a sporting question... as to which is the larger?\" While Chamberlain toured the country, Shadow Chancellor H. H. Asquith followed, preaching the virtues of free trade in the same venues only days later. Asquith's Liberals healed divisions to rally for free trade while Unionist divisions became more apparent.\nThe campaign had a brief intermission in February 1904, when Chamberlain, suffering from gout and neuralgia, took a two-month holiday. Around this time, he decided that the Unionists were likely to lose the next election and criticised Balfour, who had endorsed cautious protectionism but was unwilling to go further or announce an early general election, for delaying the inevitable. Chamberlain now hoped Balfour's guarded fiscal doctrine would fail, probably with a strategy of eventually leading the Unionists on a purely protectionist platform after their expected defeat in the general election. He wrote to his son Neville that \"The Free Traders are common enemies. We must clear them out of the party & let them disappear.\"\nBy the end of 1904, the Tariff Reform League's numerous branches rivaled the Conservative National Union, and Chamberlain attempted to secure the League's representation inside Conservative Central Office. Balfour maintained his programme of retaliatory tariffs and attempted to minimise the apparent differences between Chamberlain and himself. Publicly, Chamberlain claimed that Balfour's stance was a precursor to full imperial preference. Approaching seventy years of age in 1905, Chamberlain continued to campaign for tariff reform with zeal and energy. Reconciliation appeared imminent when Balfour agreed to a general election after the 1906 Colonial Conference, but Balfour rescinded the agreement after backbench opposition and demanded party unity. Chamberlain ignored his demand and intensified the campaign in November 1905, resulting directly in Balfour's resignation on 4 December.\n\n\n1906 general election\n\nThe Liberal Party won the 1906 general election by a landslide. The Unionists, divided and out of favour with many former supporters,  were reduced to just 157 seats in the House of Commons, though Chamberlain and his followers increased their majorities in the West Midlands.\nBalfour lost his seat in Manchester East, and although the Unionists were now out of government for the first time in a decade, Chamberlain's position among them was at its apex. With the support of approximately 102 of the remaining 157 Unionists, Chamberlain became acting Leader of the Opposition after the election, and it appeared that he might become permanent leader or win a major concession in favour of tariff reform. Chamberlain asked for a party meeting, and Balfour (returned to the Commons) agreed on 14 February 1906 in the \"Valentine letters\" to concede that,\n\nFiscal Reform is, and must remain, the constructive work of the Unionist Party. That the objects of such reforms are to secure more equal terms of competition for British trade, and closer commercial union within the Colonies.\nAlthough in opposition, it appeared that Chamberlain had successfully associated the Unionists with the cause of tariff reform, and Balfour would be compelled to accede to Chamberlain's future demands.\n\n\nStroke, decline, and death\n\nOn 8 July 1906 Chamberlain celebrated his seventieth birthday and Birmingham was enlivened for a number of days by official luncheons, public addresses, parades, bands and an influx of thousands of congratulatory telegrams. Tens of thousands of people crowded into the city for Chamberlain's passionate 10 July speech promoting the virtues of Radicalism and imperialism.\nOn 13 July Chamberlain collapsed while dressing for dinner in the bathroom of his house at Prince's Gardens. Mary found the door locked and called out, receiving the weakened reply, \"I can't get out.\" Returning with help, she found him exhausted on the floor, having turned the handle from the inside. He had suffered a stroke that paralysed his right side. After a month Chamberlain was able to walk a small number of steps and resolved to overcome his disabilities. Although unaffected mentally, his sight had deteriorated, compelling him to wear spectacles instead of his monocle. His ability to read was diminished, forcing Mary to read him newspapers and letters. He lost the ability to write with his right hand and his speech altered noticeably. Chamberlain's colleague William Hewins noted, \"His voice has lost all its old ring. ... He speaks very slowly and articulates with evident difficulty.\" Chamberlain barely regained his ability to walk.\nThough he lost all hope of recovering his health and returning to active politics, Chamberlain continued to follow and support the tariff reform campaign and his son Austen's career. He opposed Liberal proposals to remove the House of Lords' veto and gave his blessing to Unionist opposition to Home Rule for Ireland. In the two general elections of 1910 he was returned unopposed in his Birmingham West constituency. In January 1914 Chamberlain decided not to seek re-election.\n\n\nDeath, memorials, and burial\n\nOn 2 July 1914, six days before his 78th birthday, Chamberlain suffered a heart attack and died in his wife's arms, surrounded by his family.\n\nTelegrams of condolence arrived from across the world. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, Chamberlain's adversary a decade before, led the tributes in the House of Commons, declaring, In [Chamberlain's] striking personality, vivid, masterful, resolute, tenacious, there were no blurred or nebulous outlines, there were no relaxed fibres, there were no moods of doubt and hesitation, there were no pauses of lethargy or fear.\nHis family refused an offer of an official burial at Westminster Abbey and a Unitarian ceremony was held in Birmingham. He was laid to rest at Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley, in the same grave as his first two wives, close to that of his parents. On 31 March 1916 the Chamberlain Memorial, a bust created by sculptor Mark Tweed, was unveiled at Westminster Abbey. Among those present were Arthur Balfour, Bonar Law, Chamberlain's sons Austen and Neville (then Lord Mayor of Birmingham) and other members of the Chamberlain, Hutton and Martineau families.\n\n\nMemory and historiography\n\nWinston Churchill called Chamberlain \"a splendid piebald: first black, then white, or, in political terms, first fiery red, then true blue\". That is the conventional view of Chamberlain's politics – that he became gradually more conservative, beginning to the left of the Liberal party and ending to the right of the Conservatives. An alternative view is that he was always a radical in home affairs and an imperialist in foreign affairs, and that those stances were not in great conflict with each other – with both he rejected \"laissez-faire capitalism\". For instance, after leaving the Liberals he remained a proponent of workmen's compensation and old-age pensions.\nHistorian J. A. R. Marriott says that in the 1870–1905 period Chamberlain was:\n\nof all English statesman, the most representative and one of the most influential. Firmly convinced of the merits of parliamentary democracy, an ardent social reformer, though opposed to social revolution, above all, a whole-hearted believer in the Imperial mission of the British race, Chamberlain preeminently embodied the most vital of the most characteristic ideas of that epoch....[in Birmingham he was] A strong advocate of municipal enterprise, he stimulated the Corporation to purchase the gas-works, the water-works, the sewage farm, and by extensive scheme of slum clearance and rehousing, he transformed the outward aspect of the city is his adoption....[Once in Parliament,] from the [Liberal] Party point of view Chamberlain's support became increasingly indispensable but it was rendered with increasing reluctance.\nHistorian Dennis Judd says:\n\nThere is something so elemental and, in a way, timeless about the meteoric rise of Chamberlain: from his modest London Unitarian background, via his brilliant industrial and commercial career in Birmingham, to a position of almost supreme political power, where he could (and did) make and break the two major parties of late-Victorian and Edwardian England, destroy the immediate prospect of Irish Home Rule, reshape the British Empire, press for a restructuring of British economic policies and bestride the international stage as significantly as Rhodes or Bismarck.\nHistorian R. J. A. Adams writes:\n\nA great patriot who burned to guarantee his country's future, Chamberlain's brilliance and impatience guaranteed that he would be judged a political messiah to some, but an unstable destroyer to many more.\nA. J. P. Taylor states:\n\nJoseph Chamberlain was the greatest force in British politics between the decline of Gladstone and the rise of Lloyd George. He was a pioneer in social reform and municipal enterprise. He defeated Irish Home Rule. He inspired a new era in British Imperialism and directed its triumph in the Boer War... He challenged the accepted dogmas of Free Trade and launched the movement for Tariff Reform, which was to transform British economic life a generation after his death.  Despite these achievements, nothing went right with him.  He stands pre-eminent as a Splendid Failure... Chamberlain, it seems, was successful only in destruction, bringing ruin first to the Liberal, and then to the Unionist, party.\n\n\nMemorials\nHe is commemorated by the large Chamberlain Memorial in Chamberlain Square, in central Birmingham, erected in 1880; and by the large cast-iron Chamberlain Clock in the city's Jewellery Quarter, erected in 1903 (in both cases, therefore, during his lifetime). His Birmingham home, Highbury Hall, is now a civic conference venue and a venue for civil marriages, and is open occasionally to the public. Highbury Hall is situated in Moseley, two kilometres from Winterbourne House and Garden which was commissioned as a family home for Chamberlain's niece Margaret by her husband John Nettlefold: Winterbourne is now owned by the University of Birmingham.\nMidland Metro named an AnsaldoBreda T-69 tram in his honour. Joseph Chamberlain Sixth Form College in Birmingham is named after him. Chamberlain School, a pre-kindergarten-to-grade-12 public school in Grassy Lake, Alberta, Canada, is named in his honour: the name was chosen by William Salvage, a British immigrant and prosperous farmer, who donated land for its construction in 1910.\n\n\nUniversity of Birmingham\n\nThe University of Birmingham may be considered Chamberlain's most enduring legacy. He proposed the establishment of a university to complete his vision for the city, seeking to provide \"a great school of universal instruction\", so that \"the most important work of original research should be continuously carried on under most favourable circumstances\". He is regarded as the university's main founder and was its first chancellor. He was largely responsible for its gaining its royal charter in 1900, and for the development of the Edgbaston campus. The 100-metre tall Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower (\"Old Joe\") is named in his honour and is the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world.\nHis papers are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.\n\n\nHonours\nHonorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Grocers, 1 August 1902.\n\n\nPopular culture\nChamberlain is depicted, along with local Cape politicians and notables, in the 1899 artwork Holiday Time in Cape Town by James Ford.\nChamberlain was the subject of two parody novels based on Alice in Wonderland, Caroline Lewis's Clara in Blunderland (1902) and Lost in Blunderland (1903).\nErnest Thesiger portrayed him in The Life Story of David Lloyd George\nHenry Hallett portrayed him in Victoria the Great and Sixty Glorious Years\nGustaf Gründgens portrayed him in Ohm Kruger\nChamberlain was portrayed by Basil Dignam in the 1972 Richard Attenborough film Young Winston\nG.

    "summary": "Joseph Chamberlain  (8 July 1836 – 2 July 1914) was a British statesman who was first a radical Liberal, then a Liberal Unionist after opposing home rule for Ireland, and eventually was a leading imperialist in coalition with the Conservatives. He split both major British parties in the course of his career. He was the father, by different marriages, of Nobel Peace Prize winner Austen Chamberlain and of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.\nChamberlain made his career in Birmingham, first as a manufacturer of screws and then as a notable mayor of the city. He was a radical Liberal Party member and an opponent of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict. c. 75) on the basis that it could result in subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money. As a businessman, he had never attended university and had contempt for the aristocracy. He entered the House of Commons at 39 years of age, relatively late in life compared to politicians from more privileged backgrounds. Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation, he served as President of the Board of Trade in the Second Gladstone ministry (1880–85). At the time, Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury, and in the 1885 general election he proposed the \"Unauthorised Programme\", which was not enacted, of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers, including the slogan promising \"three acres and a cow\". Chamberlain resigned from the Third Gladstone ministry in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule. He helped to engineer a Liberal Party split and became a Liberal Unionist, a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham.\nFrom the 1895 general election, the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party, under Chamberlain's former opponent Lord Salisbury. In that government Chamberlain promoted the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies, promoting a variety of schemes to build up the British Empire in Asia, Africa, and the West Indies. He had major responsibility for causing the Second Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa and was the government minister most responsible for the war effort. He became a dominant figure in the Unionist Government's re-election at the \"Khaki Election\" in 1900. In 1903, he resigned from the Cabinet to campaign for tariff reform (i.e. taxes on imports as opposed to the existing policy of free trade with no tariffs). He obtained the support of most Unionist MPs for this stance, but the Unionists suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 general election. Shortly after public celebrations of his 70th birthday in Birmingham, he was disabled by a stroke, ending his public career.\nAlthough never prime minister, Chamberlain was one of the most important British politicians of his day, as well as a renowned orator and municipal reformer. Historian David Nicholls observes that his personality was not attractive, as he was arrogant and ruthless and much hated. He never succeeded in his grand ambitions but was a highly proficient grassroots organiser of democratic instincts. He is most famous for setting the agenda of British colonial, foreign, tariff, and municipal policies, and for deeply splitting both major political parties. In his Great Contemporaries, future Prime Minister Winston Churchill remarked that despite never being prime minister, Chamberlain \"made the [political] weather\".",

    "text": "S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia (abbreviated as STC), is a fee-paying Anglican selective entry boys' private school in Sri Lanka. Started as a private school by James Chapman, the first Anglican Bishop of Colombo, in 1851, it was founded as a college and cathedral for the new Diocese of Colombo of the Church of Ceylon, modelled on British Public school tradition. An old boy of Eton College, Bishop Chapman founded the college on the Etonian model, the school's motto of Esto perpetua being derived from that of Eton College.\nFollowing the public school tradition, S. Thomas' College is a partial boarding school, with some pupils living at the school seven days a week, and others residing in Day houses. Having been founded in 1851, it is among the oldest schools in Sri Lanka.\nWith a student body of approximately 2,800, S. Thomas' is considered as one of the most prestigious schools in Sri Lanka; a factor leading to its competitive rivalry with Royal College, Colombo. This rivalry has led to a Royal–Thomian tradition with the annual Royal-Thomian Big Match, the Royal-Thomian Rugby Match, the Royal-Thomian Water Polo Matches, and the Royal Thomian Regatta.\nThe college has educated prime ministers, world leaders, sportsmen and Booker Prize winners.  The alumni of S. Thomas' College are referred to as Old Thomians, and include D. S. Senanayake, the first prime minister of Ceylon, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and two other prime ministers.  Many of the prominent leaders of Sri Lanka's  independence movement in the early twentieth century were educated at the college.  These include Leslie Goonewardene, who founded Sri Lanka's first political party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and N. M. Perera, who served as leader of the opposition and the first Trotskyist to become a cabinet minister.\n\n\nCollege\n\n\nLocation\nS. Thomas’ College is situated in a quiet suburb approximately half an hour from the southern limits of the City of Colombo. The school's entrance is characterised by the Chapel of the Transfiguration. Built in 1923 and designed by P. A. Adams, the chapel, at 40 m (130 ft) long and 12 m (39 ft) high, had its foundation stone lain by Earnest Arthur Copleston, bishop of Colombo.\nThe main school body is modelled on that of the British public school model, comprising the primary quadrangle, the college hall, main buildings and library. The school's grounds reach the city of Mount Lavinia.\n\n\nAdministration\nHaving been managed by a board of governors since 1927, S. Thomas’ College is chaired by the Anglican Bishop of Colombo as ‘Visitor to the College’. The school's administration remains deeply rooted in Anglicanism, with a further chaplaincy for the aforementioned Chapel of the Transfiguration. The administration of the College itself is headed by a warden. Admission to the college is at the sole discretion of the warden.\nThe college is divided into the primary (grades 1–5), lower secondary (grades 6–9) and upper secondary schools (grades 10 and 11), followed by the senior school. These combined sectors amount to the college's student body of approximately 2,800 – stemming from varied faiths and ethnicities.\n\n\nMutwal\n\nS. Thomas’ College was founded by the first Bishop of Colombo, James Chapman, who had been educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. Chapman's vision included building as a college and cathedral for the new Diocese of Colombo of the Church of Ceylon, modelled on the British Public School system he was accustomed to. An old boy of Eton College, Bishop Chapman founded the college on the Etonian model, and even borrowed the school motto, Esto Perpetuas, from Eton.\nChapman's objective was to train a Christian clergy and to make children good citizens under the discipline and supervision of Christianity. In 1852 Bishop Chapman laid the foundation stone of the college chapel on a hill in the school grounds. The chapel became Christ Church Cathedral of the Colombo Diocese of the Church of Ceylon when it was dedicated on 21 September 1854.\n\n\nMount Lavinia\nIn 1918, the school moved away from the \"dusty environs\" of Mutwal, which was near the Colombo harbour, to a more picturesque location near the sea in Mount Lavinia. On 13 October 1923, the foundation stone for what would become the Chapel of the Transfiguration was laid by the Bishop of Colombo, Ernest Arthur Copleston, and the chapel was completed on 12 February 1927, when it was consecrated by the Bishop of Colombo Mark Carpenter-Garnier. In 1968,  David Paynter, the noted Sri Lankan painter, completed his mural of the Transfiguration of Jesus upon the interior of the east wall of the chapel, which included a then unusual \"beardless Christ\". In 1951, S. Thomas' became a private fee-levying school.\n\n\nSong\nThe \"Thomian Song\" was first introduced in the April issue of the College Magazine in 1916. The lyrics of the College Song were written by Mr. Edmund de Livera, a Royalist; and music was composed by Revd. W. A. Stone, 8th Warden of the College. The 5th line of the 2nd verse was amended in the time of Warden M. L. C. Illangakoon on a suggestion made by the late Mr. Mervyn Casie-Chetty, and ‘King’ was replaced by ‘State’.\n\n\nHouses\nThere are five houses at the college, four of which are \"day houses\", for those who do not live in the boarding house. From the college's inception, boarders were admitted under a dormitory system, under which each dormitory had a master after whom the dormitory was named. Around 1900, it was proposed that the college have a permanent house system introduced, however this was rejected. The shift to a permanent house system was only to take place with the move to Mount Lavinia. The houses were named Claughton, Chapman, Read, Copleston and Miller. There was also a small, rather short-lived Winchester House (although the present Primary School boarding facility is still known by this name). At the time, Miller and Copleston were senior houses.\nAn organised house system was introduced following the school's founding by Warden K. C. McPherson, with the aims to encourage boys to take part in extracurricular activities. In 1926, the day boys were divided first into 5 houses, namely Wood, Buck, Stone, Jermyn, and Baly.\n Boys were allotted in them according to the location of their residences. Wood house consisted of boys from Ratmalana, further south and from Nugegoda and Borella. Stone and Buck housed children from Mount Lavinia, the former consisting of those whose surnames starts from A to M, while the latter of the rest. Baly housed boys who lived in Wellawatte and Bambalapitiya. Children who were from Dehiwala, Slave Island & Fort were allotted in Jermyn House. This system was not found successful because there were insufficient numbers to divide fairly and equally among five day houses. By the end of the year, Jermyn and Baly houses were discontinued and the boys were reassigned into the remaining houses according to their form. The same happened to the boarding houses, and Read house was also discontinued.\nIn 1932, the boarding house system of two senior houses and two junior houses was discarded in favour of an alternative system.\n\n\nSports\n\nThe most prominent sports are those classified as the \"Royal-Thomian\". These sports take precedence because of the importance given to the clash between S. Thomas' oldest rival, the Royal College, Colombo.\nA cricket match between these colleges takes place in the first term of Lent every year. As the rains begin in Michaelmas Term, the rugby season has kicked off and the main encounter is the Royal-Thomian Rugby match. As the year ends with the term of Yuletide, the highlights are the Royal Thomian Regatta and the Boat Race for the oarsmen of the two Colleges and simultaneously the two leg Water Polo matches for the R.L. Hayman trophy.\n\n\nRoyal-Thomian Cricket Match\n\nThe Royal-Thomian is the annual cricket match between Royal College, Colombo, and S. Thomas' College, Mt Lavinia. It is the second longest uninterrupted cricket match series in the world and the first and oldest in Sri Lanka, even older than the Ashes cricket series, having been played for more than 140 years continuously. The original match was played between the Colombo Academy and S. Thomas' College, Mutwal, in 1879, with schoolmasters participating as well as schoolboys. From 1880 onwards, only schoolboys were allowed to play in the match. The match is played for the D.S. Senanayake Memorial Shield, which was first presented in 1928. From 1979 matches were played for 3 days except in 1985 which was a 2-day match. A limited overs match (50 overs) was introduced in 1975 and is played for the Mustangs Trophy.\n\n\nRoyal-Thomian Rugby Match\nThe Royal-Thomian rugby match held annually in the Michaelmas Term of S. Thomas. and between the two sessions of Bradby Shield Encounter of Royal since 1955. It is played for the Michael Gunaratne Trophy.\n\n\nRoyal-Thomian Rowing Regatta\n\nThe Royal-Thomian Regatta (or Boat Race) is the annual rowing encounter between the Royal College and S. Thomas' College rowing crews. Having begun in 1962 'the Regatta' is the third oldest sporting encounter between Royal College and S. Thomas' College, after the Battle of the Blues Cricket Match and the Royal-Thomian Rugby Match. As of now, the event consists of eight school-boy races which carry points and three exhibition races that carry no points. The most important event which is 'The Boat Race' carries twelve points. The races are rowed over a distance of 910 m (1,000 yd) and take place on the Beira Lake in Colombo. The regatta takes place in the Michaelmus term of S. Thomas' College, usually in the month of October and is traditionally held on the last Saturday of the month at the Colombo Rowing Club. The Royal Thomian Regatta is the oldest inter-mural rowing regatta in Sri Lanka. The overall winner is awarded the T. Noel Fernando Memorial Trophy.\n\n\nRoyal-Thomian Tennis Match\nThe Royal Thomian Tennis is the annual tennis tournament between Royal College and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. The victor is awarded the E. F. C. Pereira memorial trophy.\n\n\nRoyal-Thomian Water Polo Matches\nThe Dr. R.L. Hayman  Trophy is awarded to the winner of the annual two leg Water Polo fixture between Royal College, Colombo, and S. Thomas' College, Mt Lavinia. While Water Polo matches between the two schools have been held on and off through the annals of the two schools shared histories, the matches were made a permanent fixture as part of the two schools sporting calendars in 1992 as the Dr. R. L. Hayman Trophy Royal-Thomian Water Polo Matches. The event was initially played in home and away swimming pools. However, while it is still a two leg event, for the past several years it has been held at the Sugathadasa Stadium Swimming Pool allowing for much larger participation and making it the best patronised Water Polo matches in Sri Lanka and Asia.  As of 2019 the tally stands at S.Thomas' winning 16, Royal winning 8 and 3 matches drawn.\n\n\nWardens\nThe Warden of S. Thomas' College is appointed by the Board of Governors to run the day-to-day activities of the College. Shown below is the list of Wardens who have served the College:\n\nIn the early days of the College, acting Wardens served during interregnum periods whilst new Wardens were being chosen back in the United Kingdom, under whom Ceylon was a colony at the time.\n\n\nNotable alumni\n\nPast students of S. Thomas' are referred to as Old Thomians, and include many distinguished figures. The school produced the first prime minister of Sri Lanka, D. S. Senanayake, the Head Mudaliyar of Ceylon, Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, and three other prime ministers; Dudley Senanayake, Solomon Bandaranaike and Wijeyananda Dahanayake.\nMany of the prominent leaders of the independence movement in the early twentieth century were educated at the college. These include Leslie Goonewardene, who founded Sri Lanka's first political party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and N. M. Perera, who served as leader of the opposition and the first Trotskyist to become a cabinet minister.\n\n\nSee also\nList of schools in Sri Lanka\nBig Match\nBattle of the Blues\n\n\nBranches\nS.

    "text": "Elijah Embree Hoss, Sr (April 14, 1849 – April 23, 1919) was an American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, elected in 1902.  He also distinguished himself as a Methodist pastor, college professor, administrator, and editor.\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn on April 14, 1849, along Cherokee Creek, four miles from Jonesboro in Washington County, Tennessee, U.S.A., he was a son of Henry and Anna Maria (née Sevier) Hoss. His mother was a granddaughter of General John Sevier.  The family moved to Jonesboro before Elijah was two years old.  He was the second child and the first son of a family of eight children.  He professed faith in Jesus Christ and joined the M.E. Church, South, at Jonesboro when he was ten years old.\nElijah married Miss Abigail Belle \"Abbie\" Clark of Knoxville, Tennessee, on 19 November 1872 in Knox County, Tennessee, daughter of Edwin Reuben and Mary Ann (Sessler) Clark.  Elijah and Abbie had three children:  Mary Sevier \"Minnie\" (Headman), E.E. Jr., and Dr. Henry Sessler, M.D.  Mrs. Hoss died on 15 June 1918 in Muskogee, Oklahoma.\n\n\nEducation\nHoss was educated in the schools of Jonesboro, Tennessee.  He entered Ohio Wesleyan University in 1866, studying there for two years.  He then entered Emory & Henry College, earning his B.A. degree in 1869.  He had acquired the habit of reading widely in early life.  He was known in college for the range of his studies and the accuracy of his scholarship.  His memory was prodigious, so that accurate and wide information was at his ready command.\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nThe Rev. Hoss was honored in 1885 by his alma mater, Emory and Henry College, with the degree of Doctor of Divinity.  Emory and Henry similarly honored him in 1890 with the LL.D. degree, and Ohio Wesleyan University did the same in 1906.\n\n\nOrdained ministry\nElijah was licensed to preach in the M.E. Church, South, at Jonesboro on 8 February 1866.  He was admitted on trial to the Holston Annual Conference on 29 September 1869, and was ordained in 1870.  His first appointment was in Jonesboro (Jonesborough United Methodist Church).  The first person he received into church membership was his own father.  He was then appointed to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1870.\nIn July 1872 he transferred to California to attend the Pacific Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (M.E.C., S.).  He was appointed to San Francisco.  He then transferred to the Western North Carolina Annual Conference in 1875 and was appointed to Asheville.\n\n\nAcademic and editorial ministries\nThe Rev. Hoss became a professor at Martha Washington College (which later merged with Emory and Henry College) in 1876.  He was elected president of this institution in 1879.  He became a professor and vice president of Emory and Henry College in 1881 and was elected president in 1885.  In August 1885 the Rev. Hoss was elected to the Chair of Ecclesiastical History, Church Polity and Pastoral Theology at Vanderbilt University, serving there until 1890.\nIn May 1890 Rev. Hoss was elected the editor of the Nashville Christian Advocate, the primary weekly newspaper of the M.E. Church, South.  He held this position until his election to the episcopacy in 1902. Previous to this, he was a delegate to five general conferences of his denomination.  The final time he was elected, he lacked only six votes in the Holston Conference, besides his own, to being unanimously elected.\n\n\nEpiscopal ministry\nThe Rev. Dr. Elijah Embree Hoss was elected to the episcopacy of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, by the 1902 General Conference.  His Episcopal Residence was at 810 Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee.\nBishop Hoss was a fraternal representative of his denomination to nearly every Methodist Church in the world.  His last great mission of this kind was to Australia in 1915.  He was the presiding bishop of the M.E. South work in Brazil from 1905 to 1908 and in the Orient in 1910 and 1915.\n\n\nRetirement, death, and burial\nBishop Hoss was given a year's vacation in 1914–15.  He retired on account of feeble health in 1918.  He died on 23 April 1919 in Muskogee, Oklahoma, at the home of his son, Henry.  He was buried in Muskogee beside his wife.

    "text": "Kudos is a video game developed by British-based Positech Games (the makers of Democracy). Its gameplay is very similar to games like The Sims. The game spawned a sequel, Kudos: Rock Legend, in 2007. In October 2008, Kudos 2 was released, featuring much improved character art by comic artist Jamie McKelvie.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe basic principle of Kudos is that the player controls a 'virtual life' for ten years, starting at age 20, and ending at age 30. An accelerated calendar system plays out each day of those ten years (with only actually 7 days in each month). During each turn (which is a single day, or half-day on weekends) the player chooses from a range of solo and social activities, and responds to phone calls from friends regarding social invitations. The key to the game is that every single decision the player makes affects multiple aspects of their character's personality, mind and body. For example, going bowling may improve fitness and happiness, but reduce their level of energy, as well as have other subtler effects depending who else attended the event and the character's 'state' when they embark on the activity.\n\n\nSequels\n\nKudos: Rock Legend is a spinoff of the game Kudos. Unlike the previous Kudos game, however, this game allows the player to start their own rock/pop band.\nThe player begins as a vocalist with ambitions for becoming a rock star, setting a personal goal of achieving this in five years.  The player then must hold auditions for other bandmates, including a drummer, a bassist, and a guitarist (required to continue), as well as a keyboardist, and a saxophone player (optional) the player must write enough songs to fill a \"setlist\" allowing him to play \"gigs\" at a first limited but later expanded number of venues. Once a sufficient number of songs have been written, and enough money has been made, the player can create an album which can be sold at gigs, along with T-shirts, sweatshirts, and posters, for additional profit. Although the game is either won or lost after five years, gameplay is allowed to continue after that.\n\nKudos 2 is the sequel to Kudos. Its development began in January 2008 by Positech Games, and features many improvements over the previous game, including new 2D character art, more life choices, and an upgraded audio system.\nKudos 2 has many choices that affect both the player and the player's friends. The player can get a drink at the bar, go shopping, do housework, and even start dating. Unlocking some activities requires the player to have a specific relationship or item. While shopping, the player can shop in four different categories: music, general, pets, and books. The books and general section is greatly expanded from the original Kudos, including realistic images for magazines and over 60 books to buy. The player can socialize with friends and go see a movie of the player's choice, or even go to a restaurant, with a fully interactive menu and realistic prices. The player can also take educational courses for a small fee, including IT skills, Advanced Biology, and Public Speaking. With a good education and high IQ and confidence, the player can pursue in work over 200 different jobs in more than 10 fields including computing, sales, law, and medicine. The in-game dating system is similar to the original.\nPC Gamer UK described the game as a perfect time waster.\n\n\nReferences\n\nMetaCritic\n\n\nExternal links\nKudos 2 game homepage\nKudos at GameFAQs",

They play in the Primera B de Chile, after being relegated from the Chilean Primera División in 2023.\n\n\nHistory\nThe club was on October 27, 1897, with the name Atlético Escuela Normal F.C. In 1933 they became the first national champions of Chile. \nThey won a hat trick of titles in the formative years of Chilean football (1933, 1934 and 1935) but their last major title came in 1938. \nIn 2022 they won the Primera B championship and promotion to the top tier having not competed since 1986, they also won the Copa Chile for the first time in the same year which meant they qualified for the 2023 Copa Libertadores.\nMagallanes, adopting their official name in 1904, is one of the oldest clubs in the country. Since the year 2000, after accepting the regulations of the Chilean law 20019, the team has been managed by a limited sports company. \nIt is one of the eight founding clubs of the Nation Chilean Football League, the first football league established in the country, which also instituted the Premier Division (Primera Division) of Chile. \nIn this league, Magallanes won their first championship in 1933. In addition, they were the first club to win three consecutive professional championships in Chile.\n\n\nColours\nThe club adopted white and sky blue as their official colors in 1908. These colors are used in their sportswear as well as their logo, which depicts a Caravel on the ocean. \n\n\nStadium\nSince August 2015, Magallanes has practiced in their hometown of San Bernardo in the city stadium, which seats 3,500 spectators. \n\n\nRivalries\nThey often compete in the Metropolitan Classic against their longtime rival, Santiago Morning.

    "text": "NXT is a developmental brand of the American professional wrestling promotion WWE, serving as a training ground for wrestlers before they move to WWE's main roster on either Raw or SmackDown. Introduced on February 23, 2010, NXT features a separate roster of wrestlers who primarily appear on the brand's weekly television program, NXT. Unlike Raw and SmackDown, which are affected by WWE's brand extension, NXT operates as a developmental system regardless of whether a brand split is in effect.\nIn its original incarnation, NXT was a reality-based television show in which rookies competed to become a star in WWE. In 2012, NXT was relaunched as a separate brand and replaced the now-defunct Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) as WWE's developmental territory. Primarily holding its events in the Orlando, Florida area since its relaunch, the brand would be expanded upon over time, having embarked on national and international tours. Wrestling critics and fans came to view NXT as its own distinct entity during this period, with the brand's shows being praised for their high-quality matches and storylines. It is also praised for its increased focus on women's wrestling, as its women are presented as genuine wrestlers, eventually giving way to the WWE Women's Evolution. In September 2021, the brand relaunched under the \"NXT 2.0\" banner, reinstituting its original function as a developmental brand, and a year later reverted to its original \"NXT\" name.\nIn addition to NXT's main television program, the brand's wrestlers may also appear on the supplementary show, Evolve, the main program of NXT's subsidiary brand Evolve. Some NXT wrestlers also occasionally appear on Raw's supplementary program, Main Event, typically when they are in consideration to being promoted to the main roster, and on TNA Impact! due to the working relationship with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) that began in 2024. From 2014 to 2021, the brand held its major events under the NXT TakeOver series, but this event series was discontinued with the rebranding to NXT 2.0. WWE also operated a subsidiary brand under NXT called NXT UK, which was based in and produced for wrestlers in the United Kingdom; the brand is currently on hiatus and will relaunch at a later time as NXT Europe to become a Pan-European brand. After WWE's acquisition of AAA Wrestling in April 2025, it was reported that WWE was considering rebranding AAA to NXT Mexico. Another subsidiary brand, 205 Live, existed under NXT from 2019 until 2022 when 205 Live was dissolved.\nNXT also serves as the host of WWE's Speed championship series, open to challengers from NXT, Raw, SmackDown, and Evolve, as well as TNA, and AAA.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nLaunch\n\nNXT formed in 2010, following the dissolution of the ECW brand. The origins can be traced to 1992 when Eastern Championship Wrestling was created as a territory within the National Wrestling Alliance; but was renamed to Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1994 after its secession from the NWA. Though known for hardcore matches, ECW became one of the most successful cult followings in professional wrestling under Paul Heyman's leadership. After ECW was closed in 2001 due to bankruptcy, it briefly re-emerged as a leading force during the Invasion storyline. In 2003, the WWE acquired the assets of ECW and organized a number of One Night Stand reunion shows, which led to the relaunch of ECW on Sci Fi as a third brand. As the years went by, the ECW brand shifted from the original ECW alumni towards experimenting new and upcoming stars, which laid the ground work for NXT. \nInitially, a dispute occurred over the \"NXT\" trademark between WWE and Scotland's Scottish Wrestling Alliance (SWA), whose developmental division was called \"NXT\". WWE worked with SWA to secure the NXT trademark for their new series, and SWA renamed its developmental branch to \"SWA: Source\". Following the end of the final ECW episode on February 16, 2010, WWE debuted the NXT television program one week later on February 23, 2010 - it featured rookies from WWE's Tampa, Florida-based developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) competing to become members of WWE's main roster.\n\n\nEarly history as a developmental territory\nIn June 2012, WWE ceased operating FCW, and instead started running all of its developmental events and operations at Full Sail University under the NXT banner. The television show would also be revamped the same month to focus exclusively on developmental talent.\n\nOn February 27, 2014, NXT held a live, two-hour event, NXT Arrival, serving as the first live wrestling event for the newly launched WWE Network service. After the second live event in May 2014, NXT TakeOver, the \"TakeOver\" name would be used for future live NXT events airing on WWE Network.\nIn March 2015, NXT promoted its first live event outside of Florida with an event in Columbus, Ohio. On August 22, 2015, NXT held its first TakeOver event outside of Full Sail University, with NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn at New York City's Barclays Center—acting as a support event for SummerSlam. In December of the same year, NXT held its first TakeOver event outside of the United States with NXT TakeOver: London. By 2016, NXT was running approximately 200 shows per year between the United States and overseas.\n\n\nBill DeMott controversy\nIn late February and March 2015, several former NXT trainees previously working within WWE developmental system alleged misconduct by head trainer Bill DeMott, with Judas Devlin and Brandon Traven publicizing complaints which they claimed they had submitted to WWE management about DeMott back in March 2013 when they were still signed with WWE. Meanwhile, other ex trainees like Briley Pierce, Derrick Bateman and independent wrestler Terra Calaway also made allegations in 2015, while previous allegations made in 2013 by Chad Baxter and Chase Donovan were also noted. They accused DeMott of making trainees perform dangerous drills, physically assaulting and bullying trainees, using homophobic and racial slurs amongst other derogatory terms and condoning sexual harassment. WWE released statements regarding some of the claims that came to light in 2013 and 2015, saying that investigations were done and no wrongdoing was found. On March 6, 2015, DeMott denied the allegations, but resigned from WWE.\n\n\nThe Wednesday Night Wars\n\nOn August 20, 2019, it was announced that the NXT television series would move to USA Network and expand into a two-hour, live broadcast on Wednesday nights beginning September 18, 2019. The timing of the premiere coincided with SmackDown's move to FOX in October. As a result of the move, the show would compete with All Elite Wrestling (AEW)'s weekly show, Dynamite, on TNT; marking the beginning of the \"Wednesday Night Wars\".\nOn October 18, 2019, it was announced by Drake Maverick that NXT and the 205 Live brand and NXT would begin a talent exchange. In an interview with VultureHound Magazine on September 12, executive producer Triple H would confirm that both the 205 Live and NXT UK brands would essentially be subsidiaries to NXT, with their respective talents and personnel falling under the NXT banner.\nOn October 31, 2019, it was announced that NXT would take part in that year's Survivor Series, competing directly against Raw and SmackDown. In 2020, after winning that year's women's Royal Rumble match, Charlotte Flair chose to challenge Rhea Ripley for the NXT Women's Championship at WrestleMania 36, establishing that NXT championships were also options for Rumble winners to choose as they are guaranteed a world championship match of their choice at WrestleMania (this remained until 2022).\nDuring this time period, some at NXT referred to the promotion as WWE's 'third brand', although many journalists still referred to NXT as developmental, with Raw and SmackDown viewed as WWE's \"main roster\". WWE wrestler Matt Riddle called NXT a \"small ocean\", while \"when you get to the main roster you are in the ocean\". Reflecting on the Wednesday Night Wars in a 2022 interview, Levesque said, \"People put so much pressure on [this] 'competitive war'...it never was that. ... they beat our developmental system, good for them\". This effectively retracted the view that NXT was one of their top three brands during that time.\n\n\nMove to Tuesday nights\nThe Wednesday Night Wars came to an end in April 2021 when NXT was moved to Tuesday nights. After 12 NXT wrestlers were released from their contracts that August, Dave Scherer and Mike Johnson of Pro Wrestling Insider reported there had been internal talks of major changes to the brand, such as: \"a new logo, new lighting, a focus on younger talents and a different format to the TV shows.\" Dave Meltzer reported that NXT would likely go back to its developmental roots, with \"talent that are [sic] younger, bigger and that could someday main event at WrestleMania\". WWE President Nick Khan subsequently confirmed that NXT would undergo a \"complete revamp\" overseen by Levesque. However, due to undergoing heart surgery in September, Levesque stepped away from the brand and Shawn Michaels stepped in to oversee the creative aspect of the brand.\n\nDubbed NXT 2.0, the revamp began on the September 14 episode of NXT. NXT and 205 Live would emanate from a fully redesigned venue at the WWE Performance Center to coincide with the revamp, dropping the \"Capitol Wrestling Center\" name. The NXT TakeOver series would also be discontinued, with that year's WarGames event being the brand's first PPV to not be held under the \"TakeOver\" name. The 2021 WarGames was also NXT's last event to air on traditional PPV, as from 2022 onwards, the events only air via WWE's livestreaming platforms. Since its revamp, many of the NXT wrestlers were released en masse in November 2021 due to budget cuts and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that involved administrative staff, plant, and wrestlers. This fractured further in January 2022, several backstage workers were released, most of them known for their work with Levesque, including NXT General Manager William Regal and writer Ryan Katz. On February 15, PWInsider reported that WWE was ceasing the production of 205 Live episodes, replacing the series with a new supplementary show for NXT called Level Up, which premiered on Peacock and the WWE Network on February 18.\nBriefly in 2022, talents from NXT appeared on Monday Night Raw similar to the ECW talent exchange in 2007. Meltzer reported that Raw–NXT crossovers were a way to help boost the programs' ratings, since they both aired on the USA Network.\nIn September 2022, Michaels was promoted to Senior Vice President of Talent Development Creative, responsible for both creative and development at NXT, and for the expansion of NXT UK into NXT Europe at a later time. At the conclusion of the September 13, 2022, episode of NXT—which marked the one-year anniversary of the revamp—an updated logo for the brand was unveiled, dropping the \"NXT 2.0\" title and adopting a gold color scheme reminiscent of the original NXT branding.\nIn late-2022, after Triple H became chief content officer of WWE, NXT wrestlers began to increasingly make appearances on WWE's mid-card program Main Event. These crossovers came as part of efforts to increase the profile of NXT's talent, and evaluate their performances with members of WWE's main roster.\nIn 2024, WWE began a wider talent exchange with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Several TNA wrestlers would make appearances on NXT's weekly television series and livestreaming events and vice versa. A multi-year partnership between TNA and WWE was officially announced on January 16, 2025.\nOn August 24, 2025, at Heatwave, NXT general manager Ava announced that the men's WWE Speed Championship and the WWE Women's Speed Championship would be defended on the NXT brand going forward. The titles were previously exclusively defended on the online program Speed and available to wrestlers from Raw, SmackDown, and NXT. After Speed stopped airing new episodes after July 9, this effectively confirmed the end of that series.\n\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nThe colors and symbols indicate the brand of the champions (if they are not part of the NXT roster).\n\n\nCurrent championships\n\nThe WWE Women's Tag Team Championship is defended across Raw, SmackDown, and NXT. The Kabuki Warriors' home brand is Raw.\nThe Speed Championships were previously available to Raw, SmackDown, and NXT and exclusively defended on Speed, but following the cancellation of the program, the titles were moved to NXT on August 24, 2025.\n\n\nPrevious championships\n\n\nOther accomplishment(s)\n\n\nTelevision show\n\nThe WWE Network was the main broadcaster of NXT's eponymous television program in the United States from 2014 to 2019. Regular episodes ran for one-hour and aired on tape delay, while live NXT TakeOver events were produced periodically. Beginning on May 17, 2012, WWE began filming NXT at Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, with the venue being billed on air as \"Full Sail Live\".\nIn its original format from 2010 to 2012, the series was a seasonally-broadcast competition series that was filmed in large venues during the SmackDown tapings. The series saw \"NXT Rookies\" paired with \"WWE Pros\", with the pairs competing in challenges until one sole winner remained. As with WWE's main programming, the series followed scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters that built tension and culminated in a series of matches or challenges. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on the weekly series. Over the course of its five-season run, the winners of each season were Wade Barrett (Season 1), Kaval (Season 2), Kaitlyn (Season 3) and Johnny Curtis (Season 4). After NXT Redemption, the show's seasonal format was dropped.\n\n\nPay-per-view and WWE Network events\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWWE NXT at IMDb",
    "summary": "NXT is a developmental brand of the American professional wrestling promotion WWE, serving as a training ground for wrestlers before they move to WWE's main roster on either Raw or SmackDown. Introduced on February 23, 2010, NXT features a separate roster of wrestlers who primarily appear on the brand's weekly television program, NXT. Unlike Raw and SmackDown, which are affected by WWE's brand extension, NXT operates as a developmental system regardless of whether a brand split is in effect.\nIn its original incarnation, NXT was a reality-based television show in which rookies competed to become a star in WWE. In 2012, NXT was relaunched as a separate brand and replaced the now-defunct Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) as WWE's developmental territory. Primarily holding its events in the Orlando, Florida area since its relaunch, the brand would be expanded upon over time, having embarked on national and international tours. Wrestling critics and fans came to view NXT as its own distinct entity during this period, with the brand's shows being praised for their high-quality matches and storylines. It is also praised for its increased focus on women's wrestling, as its women are presented as genuine wrestlers, eventually giving way to the WWE Women's Evolution. In September 2021, the brand relaunched under the \"NXT 2.0\" banner, reinstituting its original function as a developmental brand, and a year later reverted to its original \"NXT\" name.\nIn addition to NXT's main television program, the brand's wrestlers may also appear on the supplementary show, Evolve, the main program of NXT's subsidiary brand Evolve. Some NXT wrestlers also occasionally appear on Raw's supplementary program, Main Event, typically when they are in consideration to being promoted to the main roster, and on TNA Impact! due to the working relationship with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) that began in 2024. From 2014 to 2021, the brand held its major events under the NXT TakeOver series, but this event series was discontinued with the rebranding to NXT 2.0. WWE also operated a subsidiary brand under NXT called NXT UK, which was based in and produced for wrestlers in the United Kingdom; the brand is currently on hiatus and will relaunch at a later time as NXT Europe to become a Pan-European brand. After WWE's acquisition of AAA Wrestling in April 2025, it was reported that WWE was considering rebranding AAA to NXT Mexico. Another subsidiary brand, 205 Live, existed under NXT from 2019 until 2022 when 205 Live was dissolved.\nNXT also serves as the host of WWE's Speed championship series, open to challengers from NXT, Raw, SmackDown, and Evolve, as well as TNA, and AAA.",

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 implemented most of the recommendations in the Wheatly Report.

A crossover event with Full Swing broadcast on Netflix in November 2023 called The Netflix Cup.\n\n\nProduction and concept\nOn 24 March 2018, Formula One announced that Netflix had commissioned a ten episode documentary-series giving an exclusive behind the scenes look at the 2018 Formula One World Championship. On 24 July 2019, Formula One announced that a second season would premiere in 2020 covering the 2019 Formula One World Championship, involving all 10 teams.\nThe series is executively produced by James Gay-Rees and Paul Martin for the production company, Box to Box Films. Sophie Todd is the production's showrunner.\nGay-Rees subsequently went on to reveal to The Fast Lane Podcast that Drive to Survive had originally been conceived as a series revolving solely around Red Bull Racing before it evolved into a series about F1 in general.\nFilming began for the 2020 season in March but was suspended until July due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nExperts\nWill Buxton\nJennie Gow (seasons 3-4)\nDanica Patrick (season 6)\nClaire Williams (season 7)\n\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nSeason 1 (2019)\n\n\nSeason 2 (2020)\n\n\nSeason 3 (2021)\n\n\nSeason 4 (2022)\n\n\nSeason 5 (2023)\n\n\nSeason 6 (2024)\n\n\nSeason 7 (2025)\n\n\nReception\nThe show has received recognition for the additional insight it offers fans, and is credited with attracting new audiences (particularly American) to the sport. The condensing of season-long themes into single-episode narratives has drawn praise for adapting \"the natural drama of a racing season into a narrative that can encourage a fan to tune into the real thing.\"\nHowever, Drive to Survive has been criticized for including fake or misplaced commentary and team radios, staging certain scenes, placing undue importance on test and practice sessions, and over-dramatizing or misrepresenting certain events and relationships within the Formula One paddock. The continued criticism from both audiences and drivers led to discussions between Netflix and team managers and between Formula One and drivers.\nMax Verstappen refused to participate in interviews for seasons 3 and 4 as he believed that the show dramatized some drivers by portraying them as villains and that the show manufactured fake rivalries. However, he participated again in season 5 after reaching an agreement with the producers to \"keep it real\".\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSpin-offs\nIn 2020, a series similar to Drive to Survive was released on F1 TV based on the 2019 Formula 2 Championship, called Chasing the Dream.

She was an early advocate of women's rights in Idaho, and she served as an Idaho State Librarian from 1907 to 1915. She worked with other women to implement the 19th Amendment in Idaho. She became the first woman to be appointed as the State Librarian in Idaho.\n\n\nBiography\nBorn in New Hampshire, United States, on February 29, 1864, Minnie Priest Dunton was the daughter of Silas S Priest (1814–1890) and his wife Nancy M Wilder (1822–1887).  She moved to Massachusetts and worked as a servant in the family of Charles D. Weston.  In 1883, she married Herbert W. Dunton, a district attorney for Boise, Idaho in the 1880s.\nDuring her lifetime, Minnie was an active member of the Rebekah Assemblies in Idaho. In 1894, she was appointed secretary and became its president in 1904. Through her position she started campaign in support of Women's suffrage.  In July 1896, she attended the Idaho's second Suffrage Convention in Lewiston, Idaho, as part of the press committee in which she served as a member.

    "text": "The Divine Equilibrium is a refinement of Perfect Bayesian equilibrium in a signaling game proposed by Banks and Sobel (1987). One of the most widely-applied refinements is the D1-Criterion.\nIt is a restriction of receiver's beliefs to the type of senders for whom deviating towards an off-the-equilibrium message could improve their outcome compared to the equilibrium payoff. In addition to the restriction suggested by the intuitive criterion, the divinity criterion considers only those types which are most likely to send the off-the-equilibrium message.\nIf more than one sender could benefit from the deviation, the Intuitive Criterion assigns equal probabilities for all the senders, whereas the D1-Criterion considers different probabilities.\n\n\nExample\nThe following example is adapted from the original Banks and Sobel (1987). \nConsider a case of sequential settlement. The defendant (sender of messages) has two types: t1 and t2. Type t1 is not negligent and type t2 is negligent. The defendant can offer a high settlement or low settlement (messages) to the plaintiff. The plaintiff (receiver of messages) can either accept or reject the settlement offer. The payoff is illustrated below.\n\nHere the payoff shows that if the plaintiff accepts the high settlement, the money transfer is larger (5 instead of 3 in the low settlement case). If the plaintiff rejects the offer, then the negligent type t2 receives a higher penalty from the court (-11 comparing with -6 for type t1). However, since the plaintiff does not know the type, he is better off to accept the settlement when the defendant is not negligent.\nConsider the prior probably to be half and half, meaning that before seeing the settlement offer the plaintiff believes that with 50 percent of the probability that the defendant is negligent. In this case, the game has two pooling equilibria. The first equilibrium (E1) is that both types of defendant choose a low settlement, and the plaintiff accepts the offer. The second equilibrium (E2) is that both types of defendant choose a high settlement, and the plaintiff accepts the offer. However, in order to support these equilibria, one also has to specify what are the beliefs if the plaintiff sees a different type of offer (commonly referred as off-equilibrium messages). \nFrom the payoff matrix we can see that under E1, the defendant is already getting his highest possible payoff (-3). Thus, regardless of what the plaintiff thinks, the defendant does not have incentive to deviate. This reasoning is not true if the equilibrium is E2. The idea of equilibrium refinement is indeed to provide a reasonable argument to select the most \"intuitive\" outcome.\nTo see how the refinement works, we first need to check what kind of beliefs can support E2. In this case, in order for the defendant not to have incentive to deviate to low settlement, the plaintiff has to respond with \"Reject\" if he sees a low settlement, which translates into that the plaintiff has to have a belief that the defendant is negligent (type t2) with probability larger than 60 percent (if this is true, then \"accept\" gives the plaintiff a payoff of 3, and \"reject\" gives the plaintiff a payoff of slightly more than 3=5*60%). Implicitly, the belief says that type t2 is more likely to deviate than t1. The D1 criterion (or the more advanced version of divinity) is built on the idea of deciding which type is actually more likely to deviate.\nIf we look again at the payoff matrix under the low settlement case, then regardless of how the plaintiff assigns his probability of choosing \"accept\" or \"reject\", the payoff for type t1 is higher than type t2 (for example, if the plaintiff plays a strategy of choosing equally between \"accept\" and \"reject\", then type t1 gets -4.5, whereas type t2 gets -7). Thus, comparing with the equilibrium payoff of -5 under E2, one can argue that whenever t2 wants to deviate, type t1 also wants to deviate. Thus, a reasonable belief should assign a higher probability to type t1. The D1 criterion pushes this type of reasoning to the extreme and requires that the plaintiff believes that the deviation (if observed) should come from t1. As a result, E2 is not plausible because it contradicts with the refinement.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Haroutiun Galentz, (Armenian: Հարություն Կալենց; March 27, 1910 in Kyurin - March 7, 1967 in Yerevan) also known as Kalents, was a prolific Armenian painter.\n\n\nBiography\n\nGalentz was born in Gürün, Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) on March 27 of 1910.  His father Tiratur owned a wool-dying factory which left a profound impression on young Galentz with its vats of bright colors.  In 1915, during the Armenian genocide, Galentz’ father was taken away by Turkish soldiers, never to be seen again. Galentz along with his three brothers and mother escaped to Aleppo, Syria.  A few days after their arduous trek into Aleppo, Galentz’ mother died of starvation and fatigue.  Galentz and his three brothers spent their childhood and youth in an Aleppo orphanage. Despite the hardships of life in the orphanage, Galentz began cultivating his passion for arts in part by encouragement from one of the orphanage sisters. He often escaped the orphanage to roam around the Aleppo markets and paint. French art historians called him \"The man who had no childhood\".\nIn 1922, at the age of 12, Galentz left the orphanage to become an apprentice to a lithographer and later received his primary artistic education from Onik Avetisyan in Aleppo. He then followed his brothers to Tripoli, Lebanon where they had opened a photo studio.  Galentz painted backgrounds to be used in the photo sessions.  From 1929-1933, French painter Claude Michulet was his teacher in Beirut Academy of Fine Arts, where he then taught painting until 1939.\nGalentz was awarded the Medal of Merit by the presidium of International Exhibitions in New York in 1939, and the honorary prize by the government of Lebanon for his bas-reliefs in the Pavilion of Lebanon presented at the New York International exhibition.\nIn 1938 he took into apprenticeship a young woman by the name of Armine Paronyan (Galentz), whom he later married on May 2, 1943.  Armine became a prominent Armenian painter alongside her husband. They had two sons, Armen and Saro (1946-2017).\nGalentz and family expatriated to Yerevan, Armenia in June 1946.  The next year he participated in a group show organized to exhibit the works of newly expatriated painters.  He participated in group exhibitions organized by the Artists Union, of which he was a member since 1947.  He held several solo shows both in Yerevan and in Moscow and was posthumously awarded Armenian Republic’s (SSR) State Prize in 1967.\nHis landscapes and still lifes are imbued with light. According to Henrik Igityan, \"looking at the radiant, cheerful paintings of Galents, remembering his kind uistful eyes, one finds it impossible to realize that this quiet sad man is the author of those bright optimistic poetic tales\".\nAlexander Gitovich dedicated one of his poems to Galentz. Galentz is one of the heroes of \"People without childhood\" by Antranig Dzarugian.\nGalentz’ house in Yerevan is now a museum.  His paintings are also in the collections of the National Gallery of Armenia (Yerevan), the Modern Art Museum of Yerevan, the Ministry of Culture in Armenia as well as in some private collections in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tbilisi, New York, Paris, Vienna, Beirut, Aleppo, Cambridge, San Francisco, Los Angeles, to list a few.\nOn April 27, 2010 Haroutiun and Armine Galentz Museum was opened in 18 Galents St., Yerevan.

    "text": "The monarchy of Belgium is the constitutional and hereditary institution of the monarchical head of state of the Kingdom of Belgium. As a popular monarchy, the Belgian monarch uses the title king/queen of the Belgians and serves as the country's head of state and commander-in-chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.\nThere have been seven Belgian monarchs since independence in 1830. The incumbent, Philippe, ascended the throne on 21 July 2013, following the abdication of his father Albert II.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nWhen Belgium gained independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830, the National Congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government. The Congress voted on the question on 22 November 1830, supporting monarchy by 174 votes to 13. In February 1831, the Congress nominated Louis, Duke of Nemours, the son of the French king Louis-Philippe, but international considerations deterred Louis-Philippe from accepting the honour for his son.\nFollowing this refusal, the National Congress appointed Erasme-Louis, Baron Surlet de Chokier to be the Regent of Belgium on 25 February 1831. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, since 1826 also called Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was designated as King of the Belgians by the National Congress and swore allegiance to the Belgian constitution in front of the Church of St. James on Coudenberg in Brussels on 21 July. This day has since become a national holiday for Belgium and its citizens.\n\n\nHereditary and constitutional\nAs a hereditary constitutional monarchy system, the role and operation of Belgium's monarchy are governed by the Constitution. The royal office of King is designated solely for a descendant of the first King of the Belgians, Leopold I.\nSince he is bound by the Constitution (above all other ideological and religious considerations, political opinions and debates and economic interests) the King is intended to act as an arbiter and guardian of Belgian national unity and independence. Belgium's monarchs are inaugurated in a purely civil swearing-in ceremony.\n\n\nLeopold I, Leopold II and Albert I\nKing Leopold I was head of Foreign Affairs \"as an ancien régime monarch\", the foreign ministers having the authority to act only as ministers of the king. Leopold I quickly became one of the most important shareholders of the Société Générale de Belgique.\n\nLeopold's son, King Leopold II, is chiefly remembered for the founding and capitalization of the Congo Free State  as a personal fiefdom. There was scandal when the atrocities in the Congo Free State were made public, causing the Free State to be taken over by the Belgian Government. Many Congolese were killed as a result of Leopold's policies in the Congo before the reforms of direct Belgian rule. The Free State scandal is discussed at the Museum of the Congo at Tervuren in Belgium.\nOn several occasions Leopold II publicly expressed disagreement with the ruling government (e.g. on 15 August 1887, and in 1905, against Prime Minister Auguste Beernaert) and was accused by Yvon Gouet of noncompliance with the country's parliamentary system.\nLeopold II died without surviving legitimate sons. The line now descends from his nephew and successor, Albert I of Belgium, who ruled while 90% of Belgium was overrun by the forces of Kaiser Wilhelm II and is notable for his forays into colonial rule of the Belgian Congo and later, abeyant Wilhelm, the League of Nations mandate in Ruanda-Urundi. In 1934, Albert died under mysterious circumstances as he climbed solo on the Roche du Vieux Bon Dieu at Marche-les-Dames.\n\n\nLeopold III and Baudouin\nLouis Wodon (the chef de cabinet of Leopold III from 1934 to 1940), thought the King's oath to the Constitution implied a royal position \"over and above the Constitution\". He compared the King to a father, the head of a family: \"Regarding the moral mission of the king, it is permissible to point to a certain analogy between his role and that of a father, or more generally, of parents in a family. The family is, of course, a legal institution as is the state. But what would a family be where everything was limited among those who compose it to simply legal relationships? In a family when one considers only legal relationships one comes very close to a breakdown in the moral ties founded on reciprocal affection without which a family would be like any other fragile association\" According to Arango, Leopold III of Belgium shared these views about the Belgian monarchy.\nIn 1991, towards the end of the reign of Baudouin, Senator Yves de Wasseige, a former member of the Belgian Constitutional Court, cited four points at which the Belgian Constitution lacks democracy:\n\nthe King chooses the ministers,\nthe King is able to influence the ministers when he speaks with them about bills, projects and nominations,\nthe King promulgates bills, and,\nthe King must agree to any change of the Constitution\n\n\nConstitutional, political, and historical consequences\nThe Belgian monarchy was from the beginning a constitutional monarchy, patterned after that of the United Kingdom. Raymond Fusilier wrote the Belgian regime of 1830 was also inspired by the French Constitution of the Kingdom of France (1791–1792), the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, and the old political traditions of both Walloon and Flemish provinces. \"It should be observed that all monarchies have suffered periods of change as a result of which the power of the sovereign was reduced, but for the most part those periods occurred before the development of the system of constitutional monarchy and were steps leading to its establishment.\" The characteristic evidence of this is in Great Britain where there was an evolution from the time when kings ruled through the agency of ministers to that time when ministers began to govern through the instrumentality of the Crown.\nUnlike the British constitutional system, in Belgium \"the monarchy underwent a belated evolution\" which came \"after the establishment of the constitutional monarchical system\" because, in 1830–1831, an independent state, parliamentary system and monarchy were established simultaneously. Hans Daalder, professor of political science at the Rijksuniversiteit Leiden wrote: \"Did such simultaneous developments not result in a possible failure to lay down the limits of the royal prerogatives with some precision—which implied that the view of the King as the Keeper of the Nation, with rights and duties of its own, retained legitimacy?\"\nFor Raymond Fusilier, the Belgian monarchy had to be placed—at least in the beginning—between the regimes where the king rules and those in which the king does not rule but only reigns. The Belgian monarchy is closer to the principle \"the King does not rule\", but the Belgian kings were not only \"at the head of the dignified part of the Constitution\". The Belgian monarchy is not merely symbolic, because it participates in directing affairs of state insofar as the King's will coincides with that of the ministers, who alone bear responsibility for the policy of government. For Francis Delpérée, to reign does not only mean to preside over ceremonies but also to take a part in the running of the State. The Belgian historian Jean Stengers wrote that \"some foreigners believe the monarchy is indispensable to national unity. That is very naive. He is only a piece on the chessboard, but a piece which matters\".\n\n\nList of kings of the Belgians\n\nThe monarchs of Belgium originally belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The family name was changed by Albert I in 1920, to the House of Belgium and the armorial bearings of Saxony from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were dropped from the Belgian royal coat of arms.\nIn 2019, King Phillippe codified the coats of arms of himself and those of his family through Royal Decree. The personal arms of the reigning monarch was modified to restore the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family were similarly modified. The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to their ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to Royal versions of the coat arms which removed these Saxon ties during the First World War. By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\". The coat of arms of Belgium remains unchanged, i.e. it does not incorporate the Saxon arms.\nSince the 2017 edition of the Carnet Mondain, the title \"Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha\", along with \"of Belgium\" were again in use for all descendants of Leopold I, with the exception of King Philippe, his wife, his sister and his brother,who keep their title \"of Belgium\"; therefore, the descendants of Astrid of Belgium do not bear this title, but that of \"of Austria-Este\" from their father.\nFor completeness, the family tree should include Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968). She is the legally acknowledged half-sibling of King Philippe of Belgium, and her children are also recognised as members of the royal family. \n\n\nTitle\nThe proper title of the Belgian monarch is \"King of the Belgians\" rather than \"King of Belgium\" as is common for other monarchies throughout Europe. The title is linked to a concept of popular monarchy as defined by Kingsley Martin in his work The Evolution of Popular Monarchy, published in 1936. According to Martin, the term is meant to emphasize the bond and connection to the people of the land over the territory the state controls. His work further implies that such a monarch is de facto appointed by the people as a nominal figurehead rather than being an authoritarian ruler.\nBelgium is the only extant European monarchy in which the heir to the throne does not ascend immediately upon the death or abdication of his or her predecessor. According to Article 91 of the Belgian constitution, the heir accedes to the throne only upon taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament. The joint session has to be held within ten days of the death or abdication of the previous monarch. The new Belgian monarch is required to take the Belgian constitutional oath, \"I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to maintain the national independence and the integrity of the territory,\" which is uttered in the three official languages: French, Dutch, and German.\nMembers of the Belgian royal family are often known by two names: a Dutch and a French one. For example, the current monarch is called 'Philippe' in French and 'Filip' in Dutch; the fifth King of the Belgians was 'Baudouin' in French and 'Boudewijn' in Dutch.\nIn contrast to King Philippe's title of \"King of the Belgians\", Princess Elisabeth is called \"Princess of Belgium\" as the title \"Prince of the Belgians\" does not exist. She is also Duchess of Brabant, the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Belgian throne. This title precedes the title \"Princess of Belgium\".\nIn the other official language of German, monarchs are usually referred to by their French names. The same is true for English with the exception of Leopold, where the accent is removed for the purpose of simplicity.\nBecause of the First World War and the resultant strong anti-German sentiment, the family name was changed in 1920, from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to van België, de Belgique, or von Belgien (\"of Belgium\"), depending upon which of the country's three official languages (Dutch, French, and German) is in use. It is this family name which is used on the identity cards and in all official documents by Belgium's royalty (e.g. marriage licenses). In addition to this change of name, the armorial bearings of Saxony were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms (see above). Other Coburgers from the multi-branched Saxe-Coburg family have also changed their name, such as George V, who adopted the family name of Windsor after the British royal family's place of residence. Only Simeon Sakskoburggotski kept his Saxony-Coburg family name, but he was ousted from the Bulgarian throne in 1946 at the age of nine.\nNevertheless, the Royal Decree published on 19 July and signed on 12 July 2019 by King Philip, reinstated the Saxonian escutcheon in the all royal versions of the family's coat of arms. The reinstatement of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha main royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of King Philip and Queen Mathilde to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle.\n\n\nConstitutional role\n\nThe Belgian monarchy symbolises and maintains a feeling of national unity by representing the country in public functions and international meetings.\nIn addition, the monarch has a number of responsibilities in the process of the formation of the Government. The procedure usually begins with the nomination of the \"Informateur\" by the monarch. After the general election the Informateur officially informs the monarch of the main political formations which may be available for governance. After this phase, the monarch can appoint another \"informateur\" or appoint a \"Formateur\", who will have the charge of forming a new government, of which he or she generally becomes the Prime Minister.\nArticle 37 of the Constitution of Belgium vests the \"federal executive power\" in the monarch. Under Section III, this power includes the appointment and dismissal of ministers, the implementation of the laws passed by the Federal Parliament, the submission of bills to the Federal Parliament and the management of international relations. The monarch sanctions and promulgates all laws passed by Parliament. In accordance with Article 106 of the Belgian Constitution, the monarch is required to exercise his powers through the ministers. His acts are not valid without the countersignature of the responsible minister, who in doing so assumes political responsibility for the act in question. This means that federal executive power is exercised in practice by the Federal Government, which is accountable to the Chamber of Representatives in accordance with Article 101 of the Constitution.\nThe monarch receives the prime minister at the Palace of Brussels at least once a week, and also regularly calls other members of the government to the palace in order to discuss political matters. During these meetings, the monarch has the right to be informed of proposed governmental policies, the right to advise, and the right to warn on any matter as the monarch sees fit. The monarch also holds meetings with the leaders of all the major political parties and regular members of parliament. All of these meetings are organised by the monarch's personal political cabinet which is part of the Royal Household.\nThe monarch is the Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces and makes appointments to the higher positions. The names of the nominees are sent to the monarch by the Ministry of Defence. The monarch's military duties are carried out with the help of the Military Household which is headed by a General office. Belgians may write to the monarch when they meet difficulties with administrative powers.\nThe monarch is also one of the three components of the federal legislative power, in accordance with the Belgian Constitution, together with the two chambers of the Federal Parliament: the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. All laws passed by the Federal Parliament must be signed and promulgated by the monarch.\nPreviously, children of the King were entitled to a seat in the senate (Senator by right) when they were 18. This right was abolished in 2014 as part of the Sixth Belgian state reform.\n\n\nInviolability\n\nArticle 88 of the Belgian Constitution provides that \"the King's person is inviolable, his ministers are responsible\". This means that the King cannot be prosecuted, arrested, or convicted of crimes, cannot be summoned to appear before a court, and is not accountable to the Federal Parliament. This inviolability was deemed incompatible, however, with Article 27 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court which states that official capacity shall not exempt a person from criminal responsibility under the statute.\n\n\nTraditions\nThe Court still keeps some old traditions, most famous is the tradition that the Reigning King of the Belgians becomes the godfather of a seventh son and the Queen the godmother of a seventh daughter. The child is then given the name of the Sovereign and receives a gift from the palace and Burgomaster of the city.\nSimilar traditions are attached to the Russian Tsar and the President of Argentina.\nAnother tradition is the centuries-old ceremonial welcome the new king receives in the country during the Joyous Entry; this tradition apparently dates back to the Dukes of Brabant.\n\n\nPopular support\nPopular support for the monarchy had historically been higher in Flanders and lower in Wallonia. The generally pro-monarchy Catholic Party and later Christian Social Party dominated in Flanders, while the more industrialised Wallonia had more support for the Belgian Labour Party and later Socialist Party. For example, the 1950 referendum saw Flanders voting strongly in favour of King Leopold III returning, whereas Wallonia was largely against. However, in recent decades these roles have reversed, as religiosity in Flanders has decreased and the King is seen as protecting the country against (Flemish) separatism and the country's partition.\n\n\nRoyal Household\n\nThe King's Household (Dutch: Het Huis van de Koning, French: La Maison du Roi, German: Das Haus des Königs) was reorganised in 2006, and consists of seven autonomous departments and the Court's Steering Committee. Each Head of Department is responsible for his department and is accountable to the King.\nThe following departments currently make up the King's Household:\n\nthe Department for Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs\nthe King's Cabinet\nthe King's Military Household\nthe King's Civil List\nthe Department for Foreign Relations\nthe Department of the Protocol of the Court\nthe Department of Petitions\nThe King's Chief of Cabinet is responsible for dealing with political and administrative matters and for maintaining the relations with the government, trade unions and industrial circles. In relation to the King, the Chief assists in keeping track of current events; informs regarding all aspects of Belgian life; proposes and prepares audiences; assists in preparing speeches and informs the King about developments in international affairs. The Chief of Cabinet is assisted by the Deputy and Legal Adviser, the Press Adviser and the Archivist. The incumbent Chief of Cabinet is Baron Frans Van Daele, former Chief of Cabinet of President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy.\n\nThe Head of the King's Military Household assists the King in fulfilling his duties in the field of defence. He informs the King about all matters of security, defence policy, the views of Belgium's main partner countries and all aspects of the Belgian Armed Forces. He organises the King's contacts with the Armed Forces, advises in the fields of scientific research and police and coordinates matters with patriotic associations and former service personnel. The Military Household is also responsible for managing the Palace's computer system. The Head of the Military Household is a General Officer, currently General Jef Van den put and assisted by an adviser, currently Lieutenant-Colonel Aviator Serge Vassart. The King's Aides-de-Camp and the King's Equerries are also attached to the Military Household.\nThe King's aides-de-camp are senior officers chosen by the monarch and charged with carrying out certain tasks on his behalf, such as representing him at events. The King's Equerries are young officers who take turns preparing the King's activities, informing him about all the aspects that may be important to him and providing any other useful services such as announcing visitors. The equerry accompanies the King on his trips except for those of a strictly private nature.\nThe Intendant of the King's Civil List is responsible for managing the material, financial and human resources of the King's Household. He is assisted by the Commandant of the Royal Palaces, the Treasurer of the King's Civil List and the Civil List Adviser. The Intendant of the Civil List also advises the King in the field of energy, sciences and culture and administers the King's hunting rights. The Commandant of the Royal Palaces is mainly in charge, in close cooperation with the Chief of Protocol, of the logistic support of activities and the maintenance and cleaning of the Palaces, Castles and Residences. He is also Director of the Royal Hunts.\nThe Chief of Protocol is charged with organising the public engagements of the King and the Queen, such as audiences, receptions and official banquets at the Palace, as well as formal activities outside of the Palace. He is assisted by the Queen's Secretary, who is mainly responsible for proposing and preparing the Queen's audiences and visits.\nThe Head of the Department for Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs advises the King in the economic, social and cultural fields. He is also responsible for providing coordination between the various Households and Services and for organising and minuting the meetings of the Steering Committee. The Head of the Department for Foreign Relations informs the King of developments in international policy, assists the King from a diplomatic viewpoint on royal visits abroad and prepares the King's audiences in the international field. He is also responsible for maintaining contacts with foreign diplomatic missions. The Head of the Department of Petitions is charged with processing petitions and requests for social aid addressed the King, the Queen or other members of the royal family. He is also responsible for the analysis and coordination of royal favours and activities relating to jubilees, and advises the King in the fields for which he is responsible.\nFor the personal protection of the King and the royal family, as well as for the surveillance of the royal estates, the Belgian Federal Police at all times provides a security detail to the Royal Palace, commanded by a chief police commissioner. The other members of the royal family have a service at their disposal.\n\n\nRoyal family\n\nMembers of the Belgian royal family, other than the monarch, hold the title of Prince or Princess of Belgium, with the style of Royal Highness. Prior to the First World War, they used the additional titles of Prince or Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke or Duchess of Saxony, as members of the House of Wettin.\nThe title Prince or Princess of Belgium is a specific noble title within the Belgian nobility reserved for members of the Belgian royal family. Originally the Royal Decree of 14 March 1891 reserved this title for all persons descending in the direct male line from king Leopold I. The royal decree also automatically granted the title to the princesses who joined the Belgian royal family by their marriage to a Prince of Belgium. This royal decree was amended by the Royal Decree of 2 December 1991, which reserved the title for the direct male and female descendants of Albert II and abolished the Salic Law with regards to its granting. The Royal Decree of 12 November 2015, published in the Belgian official journal on 24 November 2015, abolished the aforementioned Royal Decree of 1991, and restricts new grants of this title to the children and grandchildren of the reigning monarch, and to the children and grandchildren of the crown prince(ss). The spouse of a Prince or Princess of Belgium is no longer automatically granted the title but he or she can still be granted the title by royal decree on an individual basis. Prior to this, all descendants of Albert II were entitled to the title of prince or princess.\nKing Philippe (born 15 April 1960) is King of the Belgians. He married, on 4 December 1999, Jonkvrouwe Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, who was created Princess Mathilde of Belgium a day before their wedding, after which she also took the title Duchess of Brabant as the wife of the Duke of Brabant, and became, from 21 July 2013, Queen Mathilde of the Belgians. She is a daughter of Patrick d'Udekem d'Acoz (made a count prior to the wedding) and his wife, Countess Anna Maria Komorowska. They have four children:\n\nPrincess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, who will inherit the throne after her father due to a 1991 act of succession which established absolute (gender-neutral) primogeniture, altering the order of succession from \"eldest son\" to \"eldest child\".\nPrince Gabriel of Belgium\nPrince Emmanuel of Belgium\nPrincess Eléonore of Belgium\n\n\nOther members of the royal family\nKing Albert II (born 6 June 1934). He was the king between 1993 (following the death of his brother King Baudouin) and 21 July 2013, the Belgian National Day, when he abdicated in favour of his son Philippe, Duke of Brabant, because of ill health. On 2 July 1959, he married Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria (born 11 September 1937) in Brussels, who became HRH Princess Paola of Belgium, Princess of Liège, and after 1993, became Queen Paola of the Belgians. She is the daughter of Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda (1884–1946) and his wife, Luisa Gazelli dei Conti di Rossana e di Sebastiano (1896–1989). Together they have three children, the current king (see above), a daughter and another son:\nPrincess Astrid, Archduchess of Austria-Este (born 5 June 1962). She is the wife of Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, whom she married on 22 September 1984 and who was created a prince of Belgium in 1995. Princess Astrid, with her own descendants, is before her brother Laurent in the order of succession to the Belgian throne, due to the 1991 act of succession mentioned above. They have five children:\nPrince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este. He married Elisabetta Maria Rosboch von Wolkenstein on 5 July 2014. They have two daughters and one son:\nArchduchess Anna Astrid of Austria-Este\nArchduke Maximilian of Austria-Este\nArchduchess Alix of Austria-Este\nPrincess Maria Laura of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este. She married William Isvy on 10 September 2022. They have one son:\nAlbert Isvy\nPrince Joachim of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este\nPrincess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este\nPrincess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este\nPrince Laurent of Belgium (born 19 October 1963). He married Claire Coombs, an Anglo-Belgian former land surveyor, on 12 April 2003, who was created HRH Princess Claire of Belgium 11 days before their wedding. They have one daughter and two sons:\nPrincess Louise of Belgium\nPrince Nicolas of Belgium\nPrince Aymeric of Belgium\nPrincess Delphine of Belgium (born 22 February 1968). She is the non-marital daughter of King Albert II by his former mistress, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps. After winning a paternity case in 2020, she and her children were elevated to the rank of prince/princess of Belgium by a court ruling on 1 October 2020. She has been in a relationship with James O'Hare since 2000. They have one daughter and one son:\nPrincess Joséphine of Belgium\nPrince Oscar of Belgium\n\n\nOther descendants of Leopold III\nSource:\n\nPrincess Léa of Belgium (born 2 December 1951).

She is the eldest daughter of Leopold III and Lilian, Princess of Réthy, half-sister of both Kings Baudouin and Albert II and half-aunt of King Philippe. Her first marriage, to Paul Drucker (Toronto, Ontario, 1 November 1937 – 1 April 2008) in Coral Gables, Miami-Dade County, Florida, on 23 May 1981, lasted 40 days (though they weren't formally divorced till 1985); she subsequently married Jean-Paul Gourges in Los Angeles, California, on 28 September 1989.\nPrincess Marie-Esméralda, Lady Moncada (born 30 September 1956).

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=73718411",
    "text": "On May 1, 2023, in New York City, Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old black homeless man, was killed after being put in a chokehold by Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old white United States Marine Corps veteran while riding the New York City Subway. Neely boarded the car Penny was riding and reportedly began threatening passengers. After the train had left the station, Penny approached Neely from behind to apply the chokehold, and maintained it in a sitting position until Neely went limp a few minutes after the train had reached the next stop. First responders unsuccessfully attempted to revive Neely, who was declared dead after being transported to a hospital. Penny submitted to voluntary questioning at a police precinct office, and was released without charge later the same day. \nTwo days later, the medical examiner's office ruled that Neely's death was homicide by compression of the neck. A week after that, Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and released on bond. He was formally indicted by a grand jury, with a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide added on June 28. Penny pleaded not guilty to both charges, under which he faced up to 15 years in prison. His trial began in October 2024 and concluded that December. The manslaughter charge was dismissed on the request of the prosecution after the jury deadlocked. He was then acquitted on the remaining charge of criminally negligent homicide. A wrongful death suit by Neely's father remained pending as of December 2024. \nNeely's death and Penny's acquittal sparked controversy and division along partisan and racial lines, renewing debates about New York City's treatment of people with similar histories of homelessness and mental illness. Critics of Penny characterized him as a vigilante motivated by racism, whom authorities should have immediately arrested and charged with murder, but hadn't because of double-standards. Supporters of Penny highlighted his military service, calling him a Good Samaritan and hero seeking to protect other passengers. Donations to his legal defense totaled nearly $3 million. Neely's criminal record, which included several convictions for assault, was another source of controversy.\n\n\nIncident\nThe incident took place on the New York City Subway in Manhattan. Some time after 2:00 p.m. (EDT) on May 1, 2023, Neely boarded a northbound F train at the Second Avenue station just before it departed for the Broadway–Lafayette Street station. Penny was in the same train car, planning to go to a gym. Independent journalist Juan Alberto Vázquez, whose video of the chokehold was widely distributed by media, told The New York Times that Neely began screaming, \"I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up. I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die,\" which other witnesses largely corroborated. Vázquez also said that Neely was frightening but had not assaulted anyone. Other witnesses reported Neely throwing garbage at passengers, and a mother stated that she hid with her child behind a stroller after Neely charged at other passengers. About one minute after Neely boarded it, the train reached Broadway–Lafayette Street station. Most riders exited the car while a few others held open the train doors, preventing the train from leaving the station, and waited for police to arrive.\nStatements about the duration of the chokehold vary significantly. Vázquez initially told NBC New York, and posted on Facebook, that the chokehold lasted for 15 minutes, but later told CNN that \"the two men were on the floor for about seven minutes\" and that he \"started recording about three or four minutes after the chokehold began\". The video showed Penny continuously applying the hold for at least 3 minutes before releasing Neely. Even so, the 15-minute figure continued to be widely circulated, which Penny disputed at the time, saying it had only lasted 5. In Penny's criminal trial, prosecutors said that the chokehold began less than 30 seconds before the train arrived at the Broadway-Lafayette Street station, and lasted for 6 minutes.\nNeely struggled against the chokehold by kicking and trying to free his arms, which were being pinned by two other men. A witness said that it did not look like Penny had control of the situation due to the struggle.\nVázquez said that Penny asked other riders to call the police while he had the chokehold. Penny had learned the technique for restraint in basic training. Another witness said that at some point during the chokehold, Penny relaxed his grip on Neely, and Neely coughed up a wad of blood and mucus. The same witness noted that nobody on the train car was telling Penny to stop his chokehold, and that some passengers expressed hostile statements toward Neely and support for Penny's actions.\nAt 2:29 p.m., a passenger on the train warned that Neely had defecated on himself, a sign that he may be dying, saying, \"You don't want to catch a murder charge. You got a hell of a chokehold, man.\" One of the other men restraining Neely responded, saying that the excrement on Neely's pants was old. He also responded to the warning by saying that Penny had stopped \"squeezing\" Neely's neck.\nAbout 50 seconds after Neely became motionless, Penny and one man who was still restraining Neely's arms released their hold on him. Shortly thereafter, a man named Johnny Grima can be seen in the video saying, \"Don't put him on his back though, man. He might choke on his own spit.\" Penny placed Neely on his side, into a recovery position. Grima said that he put water on Neely's forehead, but was told to stop by Penny. Other passengers also checked on him, including an onlooker who warned Penny about killing Neely, who said, \"He's all right. He ain't gonna die.\"\nThe New York Police Department reportedly received a call at 2:27 p.m. about a fight on the train, and arrived before 2:30 p.m., administering first aid to an unconscious Neely. Another source says the first call was around 2:25 p.m. according to police. The NYPD issued a press release on May 4 which said they had responded at 2:27 p.m. to calls made before that time. The New York City Fire Department received a call for help at 2:39 p.m., arriving at 2:46 p.m. At least five 9-1-1 calls were made, with some initial reports describing a homeless man that some found to be threatening in his mannerisms and volume. An officer arriving at the scene asked how Neely ended up on the floor, and Penny said that he had \"put him out\". Responding officers testified that Neely had a faint pulse on their arrival, and was initially given Narcan and eventually CPR.\nNeely was pronounced dead after being transported to Lenox Hill Hospital.\n\n\nPeople involved\n\n\nJordan Neely\n\nJordan Maurice Caine Neely was a 30-year-old man who grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. Neely had an extensive criminal record, including 42 arrests for offenses such as petty larceny, theft, jumping subway turnstiles, and assaults. Between 2019 and 2021, he was involved in three unprovoked assaults on women in the subway.\nNeely was frequently homeless and had a history of mental health issues, including schizophrenia, depression, and PTSD. In 2007, when he was 14 years old, his mother was murdered by a man with whom she had been in an abusive relationship. Her body was found in a suitcase on the side of the Henry Hudson Parkway. Neely was called to testify at the trial. According to his aunt, Neely developed major depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder after the murder of his mother. He was placed in foster care as a youth.\nAs an adult, Neely was known for his performances as a Michael Jackson impersonator, performing in Times Square and subway stations. He was said to be a talented dancer. He was frequently homeless and had been involuntarily hospitalized for mental issues in the past. According to The Guardian, once Neely became homeless he slipped \"into a cycle of mental health crises, arrests and hospitalization that would continue until his death\". He had been a client of the Bowery Residents' Committee, which attempted to find him permanent shelter. From 2019 until the time of his death, he was included on what was informally known as the \"Top 50 List\", a city-maintained roster of homeless people considered to be most in need of assistance and treatment, to which they are often resistant.\nNeely's funeral was held on May 19 at Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem. At least 200 people were present, while a small group of peaceful protesters gathered outside. In addition to Neely's  family and friends, several Democratic politicians, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City public advocate Jumaane Williams, and Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, also attended.\nCivil rights activist and Baptist minister Al Sharpton delivered Neely's eulogy, in which he criticized what he saw as systematic abuse and criminalization of people with mental illness, and double standards of the police and criminal justice system on the basis of race. He objected to the characterization by some of Penny as a \"good Samaritan\", saying, \"A good Samaritan helps those in trouble, they don't choke him out.\"\nNeely was buried at Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County in a private service.\n\n\nDaniel Penny\nDaniel Penny is a former United States Marine Corps infantry squad leader who attained the rank of sergeant in his four years of service. He was raised in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. He was 24 years old the time of the incident, and was studying architecture and engineering at New York City College of Technology. His military combat training included how to render a person unconscious in a non-lethal manner with the chokehold he used on Neely.\nPenny joined U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance at the 2024 Army–Navy American football game as a \"guest of honor\" shortly after his acquittal. A few months later, Penny was hired by a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, as a \"deal partner\" in the division of the firm specializing in \"aerospace, defense, public safety, education, housing, supply chain, industrials, and manufacturing.\" According to The New York Times, firm outsiders and limited partners expressed private concerns about Penny's hiring, citing his lack of investment experience and the political controversy surrounding his trial. An internal memo obtained by the newspaper defended his hiring, saying that Penny's military experience would help build relationships with \"active-duty military, veterans, chiefs of police, sheriffs\" deals with in its public safety and defense businesses.\n\n\nLegal proceedings\n\n\nInvestigation and indictment\nPenny was interviewed by police first responders at the scene, then voluntarily at a precinct office by police detectives later that day. Penny told interviewers that Neely entered train while saying, \"I'm gonna kill everybody. I could go to prison forever, I don't care.\" He demonstrated the hold to the detectives, saying he was only trying to restrain Neely and deescalate the situation, not to kill him. Penny was released without charges a few hours later.\nOn May 5, 2023, Penny's attorneys released a statement offering his condolences to Neely's family, stating that he \"never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death\" and that \"[w]hen Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived.\" In the same video, Penny repeated what he had told police about Neely's behavior, disputed that he had been motivated by racism, and said that he had not applied the hold for 15 minutes as alleged by Vázquez: \"Between stops, it was only a couple of minutes, so the whole interaction, less than five minutes. Some people say I was trying to choke him to death – which is also not true. I was trying to restrain him. You can see in the video there's a clear rise and fall of his chest, indicating that he's breathing.\"\nThree days later, attorneys representing Neely's family released a statement about Penny's press release, saying it \"is not an apology nor an expression of regret. It is a character assassination and a clear example of why he believed he was entitled to take Jordan's life ... He never attempted to help him at all. In short, his actions on the train, and now his words, show why he needs to be in prison.\"\nOn May 3, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg confirmed that his office had begun an investigation into Neely's death. Also that day, the medical examiner's office determined the manner of death to be homicide, stating that Neely died from \"compression of neck (chokehold)\". On May 11, Bragg's office announced that Penny would be charged with second degree manslaughter, which carries a penalty of between five and 15 years in prison. On May 12, Penny turned himself in to police for arrest and was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court. Since he had not been indicted by a grand jury, he chose not to enter a plea, and was released from custody on $100,000 cash bail. He was required to surrender his passport and instructed to not leave New York without approval.\nA grand jury was impaneled on May 31 and indicted Penny on June 14. At a second arraignment on June 28, the grand jury's indictment was unsealed, revealing a lesser second charge of criminally negligent homicide. A second-degree manslaughter conviction requires the prosecution to prove the defendant knew the potential to cause death, and acted recklessly. A criminally negligent homicide conviction requires proof that the defendant's actions unjustifiably risked Neely's death, but without awareness of the danger.\nThe two other men who helped to restrain Neely were not charged.\nOn January 17, 2024, presiding judge Maxwell Wiley declined a defense motion for dismissal, citing the strength of video evidence and the medical examiner's cause of death finding.\n\n\nCriminal trial and acquittal\nJury selection began on October 21, 2024, during which nearly all prospective jurors reported having prior knowledge of the incident. \nOpening statements began on November 1, with prosecutor Dafna Yoran acknowledging that Penny acted to protect others, calling his intention \"laudable\" and without obvious intent to kill Neely, but that the chokehold became \"unnecessarily reckless\" and criminal when Penny maintained it for minutes after Neely had gone limp and ceased to be a threat. In his opening statement, defense attorney Thomas A. Kenniff referred to Neely as \"a seething, raging psychotic,\" whom Penny ignored until Neely menaced a woman protecting her son with a stroller and said, \"I will kill.\" Kenniff also said that Penny had not squeezed Neely's neck with enough force to kill him, and that drugs found in Neely's system and his sickle cell trait may have instead been the cause. Kenniff said that eyewitnesses at the scene and 911 callers did not identify Penny as the aggressor in the incident. \nDuring the trial the prosecution called over 30 witnesses. They argued that Penny ignored signs that Neely was nearing death. They cited grand jury testimony by doctor who had reviewed Vázquez's video of the struggle, who said that Neely exhibited \"twitching and the kind of agonal movement that you see around death.\" Prosecutors also pointed out that near the end of the video a passenger was heard warning Penny, \"If you don’t let him go now, you’re going to kill him.\"\nA number of passengers during the incident testified that they were scared of Neely and felt relieved by Penny moving to restrain Neely, including witnesses called by the prosecution. Alethea Gittings said Neely's actions \"scared the living daylights out of everybody\" and later thanked Penny for his intervention. Gittings and other passengers noted that Neely's actions were more frightening than other outbursts they had witnessed on the subway. Passenger Lori Sitro testified that Neely lunged at people within a foot of their faces, while Dan Couvreur described Neely as having his hands balled into fists. A passenger testified that Neely had made her fear for her life and she believed that he was \"most likely armed\", although she did not witness him with a weapon. Prosecutors used the witness testimony to assert that Neely did not directly target or hit a rider, or brandish a weapon, whereas defense attorneys stated that the prosecution's own witnesses were making the defense's case for them. 911 calls from passengers were also played in the courtroom, with one passenger relaying that Neely was \"trying to attack everybody\".\nA marine combat instructor, Joseph Caballer, who had trained Penny on the use of several restraining holds, testified for the prosecution that Penny had improperly applied the chokehold. Caballer said that the proper technique is to release the person being restrained once they become unconscious, and that he tells trainees, \"You don't want to keep holding on. This can result in actual injury or death.\" Asked by the defense how much pressure Penny was applying, Caballer answered that he could not exactly say, but that times it appeared Penny \"could possibly be cutting off maybe one of the carotid arteries.\" Jurors were shown a video of Penny demonstrating the technique to detectives during questioning at the precinct station on the day of the incident. In the video, Penny said, \"He had his back turned to me and I got him in a hold, got him to the ground, and he’s still squirming around and going crazy. He gets a burst of energy at one point and I did have to hold him a little more steady.\" In the same interview when asked if he had been applying pressure, Penny answered, \"No, I didn't, I wasn't, I just wanted to keep him from getting to people.\"\nA pathologist hired by the defense as an expert witness, Satish Chundru, testified that \"the combined effects\" of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, sickle cell trait, and Neely's exertion during the restraint, caused his death. Chundru said that the location and amount of bruising on Neely's neck, and the small number of petechiae (small red spots caused by burst blood vessels) on his eyelids, were inconsistent with Neely being choked to death.\nProsecutors argued that some details of Chundru's testimony—including his statements about petechiae—were at odds with his own prior testimony in other cases; Chundru said that those cases were not comparable. The prosecution also cited the American Society of Hematology, a professional organization whose members treat blood disorders such as sickle cell trait, which has said that deaths attributed to sickle cell crisis \"must be viewed with profound skepticism.\"\nThe city medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy, Cynthia Harris, said that Chundru's assessment was \"profoundly improbable,\" and that \"consensus was unanimous\" in her department that Neely died from asphyxia caused by the chokehold. She testified that sudden deaths from sickle cell crisis are \"exceptionally rare,\" typically take hours to a day rather than being \"instantaneous,\" and that the sickling observed in Neely's autopsy was likely caused by the chokehold. Harris added that video evidence of Neely's face turning purple, with bulging veins, indicated restricted blood flow between his head and body, and that the duration of the chokehold applied to Neely \"would have killed anyone\" by asphyxia.\nThe defense challenged Harris's decision to issue the cause of death without waiting for toxicology reports which showed the presence of K2, a synthetic cannabinoid, in Neely's system. She said that the video evidence showing Neely unresponsive prompted her to issue her finding. She also testified that K2 is \"two to 100 times more potent to standard natural occurring cannabinoids,\" but that testing can only detect the presence of the drug, not the quantity, because synthetic cannabinoids \"change like fashion trends.\"\nClosing arguments were delivered on December 2, 2024. On December 3, jury deliberations got underway. Jurors were instructed to consider the top charge of manslaughter before considering the charge of criminally negligent homicide. They were also instructed to determine whether Penny's actions were responsible for Neely's death, and if so, whether his actions were reckless and unjustified. During deliberation, jurors sent over 10 notes to the judge for further instructions. After a jury deadlock emerged on the manslaughter charge, Judge Wiley gave jurors Allen charge instructions, requesting that they reconsider differing opinions to reach an agreement.\nOn December 6, prosecutors successfully requested a dismissal of the manslaughter charge against Penny following the jury deadlock, which cleared the jury to deliberate on the lower charge of criminally negligent homicide. Penny was found not guilty of the remaining charge of criminally negligent homicide on December 9.\nAfter his acquittal, Penny said he found Neely to be \"extraordinarily strong\", was worried about Neely attacking him or someone else if he let go, and that he would take the same course of action again.\n\n\nCivil lawsuit\nOn December 5, a wrongful death suit was filed into the New York Supreme Court by Jordan Neely's father, Andre Zachary, on the grounds of negligence, assault, and battery.\n\n\nReactions and protests\n\n\nNeely's family and friends\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, spoke with the New York Daily News on May 5, 2023, stating, \"Obviously he was calling for help ... He wasn't out to hurt nobody. He was a good kid and a good man too. Something has to be done. That man, he's still walking around right now. My son didn't deserve to die because he needed help.\" The family asked Al Sharpton to deliver the eulogy at Neely's funeral. However, as a father, Zachery was mostly uninvolved in Neely's life throughout his childhood, according to a 2023 New York Magazine profile of Neely.\nMoses Harper, a dance instructor and performer and a friend and mentor of Neely from age 16 until his death said, \"when I think of Jordan Neely, I think of a gifted, kind, young soul who was trying to find some joy and peace in this world. He was looking for a reason to celebrate and engage in something positive. And it is painful to think that somebody treated him like he wasn't worth anything. He was priceless.\" Based on her years of outreach work at Rikers Island, Harper said that younger homeless men like Neely were frequently counseled by their elders to intentionally commit minor offenses for the purpose of getting a warm meal and bed in jail, or claim suicidal ideation to gain hospital admission, when no other options were available. The last time Harper saw Neely alive, she encouraged him to \"get clean and clean up.\"  Neely said, \"Don't worry, I am going to do it.\" \"But the system failed Jordan,\" said Harper.\n\n\nPublic officials and community\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams called Neely's death \"tragic\" and said \"there's a lot we don't know about what happened here\", and that Neely's mental health issues played a role in the killing. Later, without mentioning the circumstances of Neely's death, Adams said that death could have been prevented if Neely had received more mental health assistance. When asked about the issue of vigilantism in a May 4 interview with Abby Phillip, Adams replied that \"we cannot blanketly tell passengers what they should or should not do\". Adams later held a press conference calling for passage of the proposed Supportive Interventions Act, a bill that would lower the legal threshold at which a person can be involuntarily committed in New York.\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul called Neely's death \"deeply disturbing\" and called for \"consequences\". She described Penny's actions as a \"very extreme response\" to a person who did not appear to be a threat to others.  Metropolitan Transportation Authority chair Janno Lieber called the death \"really troubling and upsetting\" and urged riders to \"find a way to deescalate\" if challenges emerge on the subways.\nState Senator Julia Salazar called Neely's killing a lynching, arguing that Neely would not have been perceived as threatening if he were not black, referencing news and social media coverage demonizing the homeless and mentally ill. She tweeted, \"The constant demonization of poor people and people in mental health crisis in our city allows for this barbarism. It is making our city sick.\" Executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, Dave Giffen, said that political rhetoric has led to hatred and violence against homeless people. City Council member Tiffany Cabán said the killing was \"the inevitable outcome of the dangerous rhetoric of stigmatizing mental health issues, stigmatizing poverty and the continued bloated investment in the carceral system at the expense of funding access to housing, food and health\".\nMany left-leaning activists, including Democratic Party representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said Neely was murdered, pointing to what they say are deficiencies in the city's response to homelessness and mental illness. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: \"Jordan was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is raising rents and stripping services to militarize itself.\" She accused the Adams administration of \"trying to cut the very services that could have helped\" Neely. New York City comptroller Brad Lander said, \"We must not become a city where a mentally ill human being can be choked to death by a vigilante without consequence.\"\nMayor Adams rebuffed statements from Lander and Ocasio-Cortez as \"[not] very responsible at the time where we're still investigating the situation\" and called for officials to wait on investigations from Bragg and law enforcement officials.\nOther officials expressed frustration that DA Bragg's office had not already criminally charged Penny, claiming that if he had been black, the situation would have unfolded differently. City Council speaker Adrienne Adams stated, \"The initial response by our legal system to this killing is disturbing and puts on display for the world the double standards that black people and other people of color continue to face.\"\nNew York City media reported that residents were divided, with some supporting and others opposing Penny's actions. More than 59,000 online donations have been made to Penny's legal defense fund, totaling around $2.9 million, including $10,000 from  Vivek Ramaswamy, with some conservatives – including Republican politicians Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz – labeling him a hero and celebrating his actions. Republican politician Nikki Haley was very critical of the DA charging Penny, and said \"the governor needs to pardon Daniel Penny ... no question about it [...] right away\". Republican Nassau County, New York, executive Bruce Blakeman held a rally in support of Penny in Manhattan.\nOn May 25, Republican politician Andy Ogles proposed House Resolution 448 in the United States House of Representatives to \"recognize and honor Daniel Penny ... for his heroism and courage in apprehending a threat to public safety\". The resolution was supported by Marjorie Taylor Greene and other Republican representatives. The text of the resolution made reference to Neely's arrest record. On the same day, Ogles wrote on Twitter, \"In Democrat-run cities across the nation, crime is rampant, and the desperate cry for order is loud. Rather than take action to protect everyday citizens, Leftist government leaders prioritize political agendas over justice.\" Tennessee State Rep. Gloria Johnson responded to the resolution on Twitter, saying, \"Maga republicans sure love criminals.\" No further action was taken to advance the resolution.\nFormer NYC prosecutor Michael Bachner told NBC New York that Penny's status as a  Marine veteran could undermine an argument he acted in self-defense, saying, \"If he knew and was trained to use a chokehold, he would be no different than the training a police officer would get. The argument is going to be that he acted in a way that he should have known could result in death.\" \nShortly after Neely's death, Gabriel Murphy, a former marine with a service record similar to Penny's, started a petition at MoveOn saying, \"the individual who choked Mr. Neely to death should be prosecuted for murder.\" As of May 9, 2023, nearly 6,000 people had signed it. Murphy said that Penny had misused the technique and that, \"I don't think what he did was OK, and I don't think it's in line with anything the Marine Corps teaches.\" Former marine blackbelt Alex Hollings said in a June 28 interview with Insider that Penny was \"sloppy and excessive\" in his application of the chokehold, but that marine training doesn't \"place a heavy emphasis on knowing when to let up to ensure your opponent survives.\" Three other marine veterans were interviewed for the article, including two retired senior officers. There was disagreement among them as to whether Penny's actions were reckless or negligent; one of the former officers called him a hero.\n\n\nJournalists\nAbout a month after Neely's death, reporter Andy Newman, who had covered the Neely story for The New York Times, gave an interview to the Columbia Journalism Review. He said that he found the issues of homelessness and mental illness \"vexing to write about\" because they lack easy solutions, and that he thought many readers feel or assume that the answer is to \"just get these people to take their meds, and or just lock them away in a long-term psychiatric institution.\" Reflecting on his 25 years at the metro desk, he said:\n\nThe depressing thing about covering this stuff is that if you just look back at stories through the years, every single mayor has tried ways to fix this problem and to somehow prevent people who are severely mentally ill and maybe prone to violence from doing something terrible to other people or to themselves. And every mayor and every governor comes in with a bunch of plans and programs. And we write these stories about these plans and programs. And for one reason or another, it just always happens again.\nHuffPost reporter Matt Shuham wrote that local and national media villainized Neely almost immediately following his death by highlighting his history of homelessness and mental illness, as well as publishing details of his criminal record:\n\nThat record included dozens of arrests, some for assault and many for lesser charges like fare evasion. And police sources appeared to immediately leak Neely's rap sheet to news outlets after his death, despite Neely having just been killed in public. The practice of leaking criminal records to reporters after a public incident is a habit for the NYPD, deployed after the arrests of countless defendants – but not usually for homicide victims.\n\n\nProtests\n\nOn May 3, two days after Neely's killing, a vigil-turned-protest was held inside the Broadway–Lafayette Street station, during which the arrest and charging of the then-unnamed man who choked Neely were demanded. A protest in front of the Manhattan district attorney's office was set for May 4, and another May 4 protest was held in Brooklyn; after dark on May 4, a group of demonstrators marched from Brooklyn to Manhattan across the Manhattan Bridge, onto which they spray-painted slogans related to Neely's death. Several organizations, including Black Lives Matter, NAACP, and Amnesty International USA, have called for accountability in Neely's killing. On May 5, 2023, protests took place across the city, including locations such as the Broadway–Lafayette Street station, Washington Square Park, and outside the Manhattan district attorney's office, calling for criminal charges to be brought. Protests were again held on May 6, 2023, at various locations in Manhattan, including the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, where several protesters were arrested. On May 8, 2023, 11 protesters were arrested.\nOn June 23, the Manhattan district attorney's office dropped all misdemeanor charges related to the protests, which included resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. The office said that it was still seeking to prosecute three people who were arrested on felony charges, one for blocking subway tracks, one for pinning an NYPD inspector's arm in a door, causing \"bruising and substantial pain\", and one for striking the back of an officer's head multiple times.\n\n\nSee also\n\n1984 New York City Subway shooting – Shooting of four Black teenagers by Bernhard Goetz\n2022 New York City Subway attack – Mass shooting in New York, U.S.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",
    "summary": "On May 1, 2023, in New York City, Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old black homeless man, was killed after being put in a chokehold by Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old white United States Marine Corps veteran while riding the New York City Subway. Neely boarded the car Penny was riding and reportedly began threatening passengers. After the train had left the station, Penny approached Neely from behind to apply the chokehold, and maintained it in a sitting position until Neely went limp a few minutes after the train had reached the next stop. First responders unsuccessfully attempted to revive Neely, who was declared dead after being transported to a hospital. Penny submitted to voluntary questioning at a police precinct office, and was released without charge later the same day. \nTwo days later, the medical examiner's office ruled that Neely's death was homicide by compression of the neck. A week after that, Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and released on bond. He was formally indicted by a grand jury, with a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide added on June 28. Penny pleaded not guilty to both charges, under which he faced up to 15 years in prison. His trial began in October 2024 and concluded that December. The manslaughter charge was dismissed on the request of the prosecution after the jury deadlocked. He was then acquitted on the remaining charge of criminally negligent homicide. A wrongful death suit by Neely's father remained pending as of December 2024. \nNeely's death and Penny's acquittal sparked controversy and division along partisan and racial lines, renewing debates about New York City's treatment of people with similar histories of homelessness and mental illness. Critics of Penny characterized him as a vigilante motivated by racism, whom authorities should have immediately arrested and charged with murder, but hadn't because of double-standards. Supporters of Penny highlighted his military service, calling him a Good Samaritan and hero seeking to protect other passengers. Donations to his legal defense totaled nearly $3 million. Neely's criminal record, which included several convictions for assault, was another source of controversy.",

The couple had eloped when the earl, who was from a relatively poor Newcastle family, was training to be a clergyman. His occupation as a curate was inadequate to keep a wife and he trained instead as a lawyer.

    "text": "François St-Laurent (born 26 June 1977) is a Canadian ice hockey referee, currently working in the National Hockey League. In the summer of 1999, during a camp held by Ron Fournier, he told Réseau des Sports that his goal was to make it to the NHL. Said to have \"an exceptional talent\", he became a Level VI referee in the Hockey Canada Officiating Program during a seminar in November 2001, held in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nAfter wearing sweater number 38 since joining the league full-time in the 2009–10 NHL season (carrying it over from the American Hockey League after six seasons), St-Laurent changed to sweater number 8 in the 2019–20 NHL season.\n\n\nOfficiating career\n\n\nPre-junior league\nSt-Laurent began his career as an official at the age of fifteen. In 1998 and 1999, he worked the Coupe Dodge championship. He also participated in the 2000 Air Canada Cup, held in Montreal, Quebec.\n\n\nJuniors to professional career\n\n\nQuebec Major Junior Hockey League\nSt-Laurent joined the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1999, working thirty regular-season games and seven playoff games as a linesman. His first game in the league was on 10 September 1999, when he worked a game between the Val-d'Or Foreurs and Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. In the 2000-2001 season, he transitioned to a referee; the first regular-season game he worked as a referee came on 22 September 2000, as he worked the game between the Shawinigan Cataractes and Drummondville Voltigeurs. It would be the first of one hundred fifteen regular-season games he worked between the 00–01 and 02–03 seasons. St-Laurent would also work in twenty-four playoff games. He worked the President's Cup finals in both 2002 and 2003.\nHe worked the 2002 Memorial Cup, including the final game between the Victoriaville Tigres of the QMJHL and the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League.\nIn March 2019, TVA personality (and former official) Stéphane Auger created a list of the league's top fifty officials throughout its then-fifty year history. For the list, only former QMJHL officials were considered; nobody on the current roster was named. Auger, listing his choices by region, named St-Laurent as one of the league's best officials.\n\n\nAmerican Hockey League\n\nAs he began to work games in the QMJHL, St-Laurent was hired by the American Hockey League as a linesman for the 1999–00 AHL season. His first regular-season game in the AHL came on 22 November 1999, as the St. John's Maple Leafs faced off against the Quebec Citadelles. He spent four years working the lines in the AHL before he was hired by the NHL as a referee. While Quebec would be his home base, he would also work games in Ontario (Hamilton Bulldogs), New Brunswick (Saint John Flames), and Newfoundland (St. John's); all three of which came in the 2002–03 AHL season.\nHis first regular-season AHL game as a newly-hired referee came on 11 October 2003, in a game between the Providence Bruins and Worcester IceCats. During his stint in the AHL, St-Laurent worked the Calder Cup finals in 2008 and 2009. He also worked the AHL All-Star Classic in 2009, held in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nDuring the 2015–16 AHL season, St-Laurent worked two games as part of a rehabilitation assignment, marking his first appearance in the league since the summer of 2009. He had missed two and a half months for an undisclosed reason and returned to the NHL in February 2016.\n\n\nNational Hockey League\nSt-Laurent was hired by the National Hockey League in the fall of 2003, as one of six officials signed that year. The number he had been assigned was also in use by referee Craig Spada.\nAlthough he was hired in 2003, St-Laurent did not work in the NHL that season. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, his first regular-season National Hockey League game came on 10 November 2005, in a game between the Ottawa Senators and Boston Bruins. He worked in ten other games that season, bouncing back and forth between the NHL and the American Hockey League. After working in sixty-six regular-season games over the course of four seasons, he would make the jump to the NHL officiating roster full-time at the start of the 2009–10 NHL season. His first game as a full-time official came on 2 October 2009, in a game between the New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nIn October 2011, then-Director of Officiating Terry Gregson was asked to briefly assess St-Laurent, among other officials in the NHL at the time. Gregson said that St-Laurent was one of the \"very good young referees\" at the time of the evaluation.\nHis 1000th career regular-season game took place on 7 February 2024, in a game between the Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks, while the ceremony to celebrate the milestone was before the 7 March 2024 game between the Montreal Canadiens and Carolina Hurricanes.\n\n\nStanley Cup playoffs\nAfter working in the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs as a standby, St-Laurent was named to the main playoff roster each year from 2011 to 2022. He was assigned to first round games in twelve straight postseasons. He has made the second round six times in his career, picking up on-ice assignments for games between 2017 and 2022, and reached the third round in 2021.\n\n\nNotable games\nSt-Laurent worked the 2020 NHL All-Star Game, held at Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri on 25 January. He also helped work the Skills competition the night before, along with referee Justin St. Pierre and linesmen Michel Cormier and Bryan Pancich.\nHe has worked in two outdoor games during his NHL career: The 2015 NHL Winter Classic and the 2016 Heritage Classic. St-Laurent has also worked the 2018 NHL Global Series, including an exhibition game between Kölner Haie and the Edmonton Oilers.\n\n\nInjuries\nDuring the 2006–07 season, St-Laurent tore a ligament in his knee, which forced him to sit out a month's worth of AHL and NHL games. In a 2018 playoff game, he broke his collarbone after losing his balance and falling into the boards.\nBetween the 2017–18 and 2022–23 seasons, he left three games due to injury.\n\n\nControversies\n\n\nCapitals/Flyers line brawl\nSt-Laurent worked a game between the Washington Capitals and the Philadelphia Flyers on 1 November 2013. After a third period goal was scored by Washington's Joel Ward, a fight broke out between Capitals player Tom Wilson and Flyers player Wayne Simmonds. As the fight was taking place, Flyers goaltender Ray Emery skated down the ice to challenge Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby, which Holtby declined. When Emery said \"just protect yourself\", St-Laurent attempted to stop the fight, but couldn't when Emery began to punch Holtby. St-Laurent stopped various Capitals players from jumping in to stop Emery and did not stop the fight when Holtby fell to the ice.  Emery was assessed penalties for leaving the crease (2 minutes), instigating (2 minutes), fighting (5 minutes), a ten-minute misconduct, and a game misconduct for his actions.\nThrough the week after the fight, the opinions about St-Laurent's actions were varied from different members of the media. Yahoo's Greg Wyshynski called St-Laurent a \"joke\" on the Monday afterwards, saying that he was \"controlling the game\". Calmer opinions came from Elliotte Friedman (then of CBC), who said that St-Laurent \"tried to stop\" the two combatants, yet \"backed out\" when the fight happened; and Darren Dreger of TSN, who said that he \"couldn't rely on the linesmen\" because of the multiple fights.\n\n\nLightning/Canadiens, 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs\nOn 22 April 2014, St-Laurent worked Game Four of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series between the Montreal Canadiens and the Tampa Bay Lightning. During the second intermission, CBC's Ron MacLean spoke up about St-Laurent's participation in the game, saying that he \"would not have been a popular choice for the Tampa Bay Lightning\".  MacLean's comment stemmed from an incident in Game Three, where a goal for Tampa Bay was waved off by another French-Canadian referee. He had also said that due to Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper's comments about the call, St-Laurent was thrown into Game Four \"to send a message\", when he had been assigned to the game before the playoffs began. MacLean apologized for his comments later that night, also saying that he wouldn't have minded if St-Laurent had worked in a later game of the series.\n\n\nRelationship with Paul Maurice\n\n\nJets/Lightning, 2015–16 season\nLate in the second period of a game between the Winnipeg Jets and Tampa Bay Lightning, played on 18 February 2016, Anton Stralman delivered a questionable hit to Bryan Little. St-Laurent and partner Dan O'Rourke did not issue penalties on the hit. (Blake Wheeler and Stralman would get penalties for roughing, while Stralman would not be suspended. Little ended up missing the rest of the regular season because of a T6 vertebrae fracture.) Upon hearing that there would be no further penalties towards Stralman, Jets coach Paul Maurice took exception to what he had heard from the referees. Based on his comments, the Jets would receive a bench minor.\nUpon coming back to the bench for the start of the third period, Maurice would be sent back to the locker room, as he was ejected by St-Laurent. TSN, the network covering the game for the Jets, showed St-Laurent looking at the bench. Another shot showed what appeared to be him laughing about something; this gave the commentators the impression that the laughter stemmed from him ejecting Maurice. Said Maurice after the game: \"I would say that would then have been consistent with their overall demeanor regarding the incident.\"\n\n\nAftermath of original encounter\nA few days after the incident, Maurice was fined $5,000 for what he said about the referees. In September 2016, St-Laurent said that his laughter was unrelated to Maurice; Winnipeg's Dustin Byfuglien cracked a joke shortly after the ejection.\n\n\nPanthers/Leafs, 2022–23 season\nOn 17 January 2023, St-Laurent was assigned to a game between the Florida Panthers and Toronto Maple Leafs. The game was very penalty-heavy, with Toronto receiving seven power plays to Florida's three. After the game, Maurice criticized the officiating in his media scrum with reporters. In particular, he mentioned his relationship with St-Laurent, saying \"I just explained to them that it had nothing to do with my players. It had to do with me and a relationship that I have with one of the referees. That's what that was all about.\" Maurice was fined $25,000 for his comments a few days later.\n\n\nInternational tournaments\nDuring the 2002–03 ice hockey season, St-Laurent was assigned to work the 2003 IIHF World Championship Division 1A tournament, held in Budapest, Hungary. \n\n\nTelevision appearances\nBefore the 2005–06 NHL season, TVA's LCN en Bref interviewed St-Laurent. During the interview, he said that he was on a five-year contract, as he gained experience between the American Hockey League and the National Hockey League.\nIn a 2010 episode of HBO's 24/7 series involving the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals, St-Laurent was seen talking to Bruce Boudreau about penalties that were issued early in the first period of a preview of the teams' Winter Classic. The next year, during the 24/7 series involving the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers, a quick camera shot showed him giving Ryan Callahan a cross-checking penalty.\nA segment during an October 2015 episode of NESN's Behind the B followed St-Laurent through the course of the Boston Bruins' home opener against the Winnipeg Jets.\n\n\nOff-ice contributions\nIn the winter of 2007, St-Laurent took part in the first \"Zebras Care\" program that the National Hockey League Officials Association put together.\nAs part of the 40th anniversary of the NHLOA, a logo was created by St-Laurent to help commemorate the milestone.\nBetween 2013 and 2015, St-Laurent ran a summer development camp for referees. Camps were held in Saint-Constant, Quebec in 2014 and Brossard, Quebec in both 2013 and 2015. In the 2015 camp, the participants worked games in L’Expérience HockeySuprématie.com, a tournament with proceeds going towards various charities.\nDuring the summer of 2014, he was a speaker in Hockey Quebec's Provincial Elite Officials Program.\nFor the 2019-20 hockey season, St-Laurent (along with the other French-Canadian officials in the NHL) was featured in a video produced by Hockey Quebec, under a theme of \"no ref, no match\".\n\n\nPersonal life\nSt-Laurent was a goaltender in his youth, spending the late stages of his playing career on the bench as the backup. He has been based in the Raleigh, North Carolina area since 2010, upon his promotion to the full-time officiating roster.\n\n\nSee also\nList of NHL on-ice officials\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Hemoperfusion or hæmoperfusion (see spelling differences) is a method of filtering the blood extracorporeally (that is, outside the body) to remove a toxin. As with other extracorporeal methods, such as hemodialysis (HD), hemofiltration (HF), and hemodiafiltration (HDF), the blood travels from the patient into a machine, gets filtered, and then travels back into the patient, typically by venovenous access (out of a vein and back into a vein).\nIn hemoperfusion, the blood perfuses a filter composed of artificial cells filled with activated carbon or another microporous material. Small molecules in solution within the serum (such as the toxin) cross the membranes into the microporous material (and get trapped therein), but formed elements (the blood cells) brush past the artificial cells just as they brush past each other. In this way, the microporous material's filtering ability can be used without destroying the blood cells.\nFirst introduced in the 1940s, hemoperfusion was refined during the 1950s through 1970s, and then introduced clinically for the treatment of poisoning in the 1970s and 1980s. It is sometimes used to treat drug overdose, sometimes in conjunction with the other extracorporeal techniques previously mentioned.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines sorbent hemoperfusion as follows:\n″(a) Identification. A sorbent hemoperfusion system is a prescription device that consists of an extracorporeal blood system similar to that identified in the hemodialysis system and accessories (876.5820) and a container filled with adsorbent material that removes a wide range of substances, both toxic and normal, from blood flowing through it. The adsorbent materials are usually activated-carbon or resins which may be coated or immobilized to prevent fine particles entering the patient's blood. The generic type of device may include lines and filters specifically designed to connect the device to the extracorporeal blood system. The device is used in the treatment of poisoning, drug overdose, hepatic coma, or metabolic disturbances.″\n\nHemoperfusion is also used in the treatment of specific intoxications, such as valproic acid, theophylline, and meprobamate.\nDespite its availability, this technique is only infrequently utilized as a medical process used to remove toxic substances from a patient's blood.\n\n\nTypes\nTwo types of hemoperfusion are commonly used:\n\nCharcoal hemoperfusion, which has been used to treat liver (hepatic) failure, various types of poisoning, and certain autoimmune diseases when coated with antigens or antibodies.\nCertain resins (polystyrene - XAD series) are frequently more efficient at clearing lipid-soluble drugs than charcoal hemoperfusion.\n\n\nComplications\nComplications of hemoperfusion may include thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, hypoglycemia, and some reduction in clotting factors, with recovery typically occurring in 1–2 days. Risk of bleeding is also higher because of the high heparin dose and reduction in platelets and clotting factors.\n\n\nIndications for use\nDuring hemoperfusion, the blood passes through a column with absorptive properties aiming at removing specific toxic substances from the patient's blood. It especially targets small- to medium-sized molecules that tend to be more difficult to remove by conventional hemodialysis. The adsorbent substance most commonly used in hemoperfusion are resins and activated carbon. Hemoperfusion is an extracorporeal form of treatment because the blood is pumped through a device outside the patient's body.\nIts major uses include removing drugs or poisons from the blood in emergency situations, removing waste products from the blood in patients with kidney failure, and as a supportive treatment for patients before and after liver transplantation.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "The Battle of Harran took place on 7 May 1104 between the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch and the County of Edessa, and the Seljuk Turks. It was the first major battle against the newfound Crusader states in the aftermath of the First Crusade, marking a key turning point against Frankish expansion. The battle had a disastrous effect on the Principality of Antioch as the Turks regained territory earlier lost.\n\n\nBackground\nIn 1104 Baldwin II of Edessa had attacked and besieged the city of Harran. For his further support Baldwin sought help from Bohemond I of Antioch and Tancred, Prince of Galilee. Bohemond and Tancred marched north from Antioch to Edessa to join with Baldwin and Joscelin of Courtenay, accompanied by Bernard of Valence the Patriarch of Antioch, Daimbert of Pisa the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Benedict, the Archbishop of Edessa. \nThe Seljuks, under Jikirmish, governor of Mosul, and Sokman, the Artuqid lord of Mardin, gathered in the area of the Khabur, perhaps at Ras al-Ayn (Hellenistic Rhesaina). In May 1104 they attacked Edessa, perhaps to distract the crusaders from Harran, perhaps to take the city while the crusaders were elsewhere engaged.\n\n\nBattle\nAccording to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Tancred and Bohemund arrived at Edessa during the siege, but according to Chronicle of 1234 they arrived first at the gates of Harran. In any case, the Seljuks rode away from the crusaders, feigning a retreat and the crusaders followed.\nThe Seljuks feigned retreat in the preliminary skirmishes while the Crusaders continued their pursuit south. The contemporary chronicler Matthew of Edessa reports a pursuit of two days while Ralph of Caen reports three days. According to Ibn al-Athir, the main battle was fought twelve kilometres from Harran.\nMost historians accept the accounts of Albert of Aachen and Fulcher of Chartres, who located the battle on the plain (planitie) opposite the city of Raqqa, Raqqa being about two days away from Harran. \nBaldwin and Joscelin commanded the Edessan left wing while Bohemond and Tancred commanded the Antiochene right. Ralph of Caen says that the crusaders were caught unawares when the Seljuks turned to fight, so much so that Baldwin and Bohemond fought without armor. \nDuring the battle itself, Baldwin's troops were completely routed, with Baldwin and Joscelin captured by the Turks. The Antiochene troops along with Bohemond were able to escape to Edessa. However, Jikirmish had only taken a small amount of booty, so he purloined Baldwin from Sokman's camp. Although a ransom was paid, Joscelin and Baldwin were not released until sometime before 1108, and 1109 respectively.\n\n\nSignificance\nThe battle was one of the first decisive Crusader defeats with severe consequences to the Principality of Antioch. The Byzantine Empire took advantage of the defeat to impose their claims on Antioch, and recaptured Latakia and parts of Cilicia. Many of the towns ruled by Antioch revolted and were re-occupied by Muslim forces from Aleppo. Armenian territories also revolted in favour of the Byzantines or Armenia. Furthermore, these events caused Bohemund to return to Italy to recruit more troops, leaving Tancred as regent of Antioch.\nWilliam of Tyre wrote that there was no battle more disastrous than this. Although Antioch recovered by the next year, the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus imposed the Treaty of Devol on Bohemond, which would have made Antioch a vassal of the empire had Tancred agreed to it. Antioch was again crushed at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119. Edessa never really recovered and survived until 1144 but only because of divisions among the Muslims.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nBernard S. Bachrach and David S. Bachrach, 2005.

Lucker is placed in a private clinic where he awakens, murders an orderly and takes the man's clothes. Lucker exits the clinic and hijacks the orderly's car after killing the man's girlfriend and having sex with her body.\nThe next morning, Lucker listens to a radio broadcast discussing his escape, and Cathy Jordan, a survivor of Lucker three years ago. Lucker abandons his stolen car and walks into town while having flashbacks to his time with Cathy, which excite him to the point of prompting him to disembowel a female jogger in a parking garage.\nUsing a public phonebook and map, Lucker pinpoints Cathy's current address, which he gains entry to by soliciting a prostitute who lives there. Once in the building, Lucker shackles the hooker to her bed, stabs her in the throat and takes up residence in her apartment, which he spies on Cathy from.\nA month later, Lucker has sex with her severely decomposed corpse, cuts it up, places the pieces in garbage bags and goes to throw them out. On the way out, Lucker runs into Cathy's boyfriend whom he strangles and bludgeons while two women, Carolyn and Sharon, enter the building to visit the prostitute. After disposing of Carolyn and capturing Sharon, Lucker goes to Cathy's apartment and captures her as well.\nWhile Lucker rants and thrashes about, he guts Sharon in front of Cathy, who escapes her binds and stabs Lucker in the back with his own knife. The wounded Lucker pursues Cathy throughout the building and is seemingly killed when Cathy pushes him down an elevator shaft.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has tawny-coloured flowers, a dorsal sepal with a long thread-like tip and a labellum which is hidden inside the flower.\n\n\nDescription\nPterostylis fischii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of egg-shaped leaves, each leaf 5–18 mm long and 6–12 mm wide. Flowering plants have a single flower 20–25 mm long and 7–9 mm wide borne on a flowering stem 150–250 mm high with between three and five stem leaves wrapped around the stem. The flowers are green, white and brown. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \"galea\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward and downward with a thread-like tip 5–15 mm long.  The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have an erect, thread-like tip 15–30 mm long and a broad V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is 8–9 mm long, 3–4 mm wide, dark brown, blunt, and not visible in an intact flower. Flowering occurs from February to May.\n\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nPterostylis fischii was first formally described in 1950 by William Nicholls from a specimen collected near Woodside. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (fischii) honours the Fisch family of Doncaster who discovered the species in 1949.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nFisch's greenhood grows among grasses and low shrubs in woodland and forest, mainly in the highlands of New South Wales south from the New England National Park, less commonly in eastern Victoria and southern Queensland.\n\n\nReferences",

Boron monohydride shows no reaction with methane, but reacts with propane to give C3H7BH2. With nitric oxide (NO) it probably yields HBO and HBNO. Boron monohydride appears to add onto double bonds in unsaturated organic compounds. It also reacts with water.\nBoron monohydride can take on the form of solid poly-borane(1) which spontaneously inflames in air.\nSolid BH is predicted to take on an Ibam phase at pressures over 50 GPa and then become a metallic P6/mmm phase over 168 GPa.\n\n\nIons\nBoth a cation and a dication are known. The dication HB2+ can be supported by a σ-donating ligand framework with two links. The dianion can also be stabilized by an amine.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Wolston House is a heritage-listed museum and former homestead at 223 Grindle Road, Wacol, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1852 to 1860s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. It is now a historic house museum operated by the National Trust of Queensland.\n\n\nHistory\nWolston House comprises the homestead and garden from the Wolston Estate, a large pastoral property originally established by Dr Stephen Simpson in 1852 and extended during the 1860s by Matthew Goggs.\n\nStephen Simpson was appointed Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Moreton Bay District in 1842 when the area was first opened up for free settlement following the closure of the penal colony. He was a cultured man, a doctor of medicine, a Justice of the Peace, a Police Magistrate and a founding Member of the Queensland Legislative Council following Separation from New South Wales. His first home in the colony was at Woogaroo (now known as Goodna), situated between Brisbane and Ipswich on what was to become the site of the Wolston Park Hospital. In 1851, when the opportunity to buy land in the area arose, he purchased 640 acres (2.6 km2) to the east of his first house on land overlooking the Brisbane River.\nThe new property, which included stockyard, stables, outbuildings and a house and garden, was laid out by surveyor William Pettigrew in 1852. The garden was planned with care. Pettigrew recorded planting fruit trees there in his diary and Simpson was known for his interest in plants and gardening. It is possible that the fig trees at Wolston were planted by Simpson.\nThe house that Simpson lived in was much smaller than the Wolston homestead that now exists. He had arrived in Brisbane as a recent widower and lived simply, so that a large or formal dwelling would have been unnecessary to him. He constructed a two-room brick cottage over a sandstone basement. The house was shingled and had a detached kitchen. This cottage now forms the core of the house. The existing sandstone kitchen which adjoins this section may have been added by Simpson before he sold the house in 1860 or it may have been added by Goggs.\nAfter his wife and child died, Simpson had designated his nephew, John Ommaney (for whom Mount Ommaney is named) as his heir. On 11 March 1856 the young man, aged 20, was riding from Wolston station and was thrown from his horse. The horse returned to Wolson and a search was undertaken. Ommaney was found on the ground insensible and, despite medical attention, died. His body was taken by steamer to be buried in the Church of England cemetery at Paddington. This may have affected Simpson's commitment to remaining in the colony and a few years later, he put the Wolston estate up for sale and returned to England. According to the auction notice which appeared in the Moreton Bay Courier of 3 January 1860 the estate was by then well established with 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of fenced land, an extensive garden and orchards and 250 head of horses and 400 of cattle.\nWolston was purchased by Matthew Buscall Goggs in October 1860. He continued to operate the estate as a cattle and horse breeding station and extended the holding to 100,000 acres (400 km2). Goggs, who was a farmer's son, had emigrated to Australia in 1841 and took up land at Chinchilla with his first wife. He purchased Wolston following his second marriage to Anne Gedge and they had a family of ten children. Goggs built a sandstone extension to the house in the 1860s to accommodate the needs of his family and in the 1870s a cedar annexe was added containing children's bedrooms. Goggs died in 1882 and was buried in a mausoleum which he had had built in the grounds of the estate. This was damaged in the 1893 floods and the bodies of Goggs and two infants were reburied at Toowong Cemetery.\nFollowing Gogg's death, his eldest son, also named Matthew Buscall, ran the estate until around 1890 when he moved to Brisbane. A Mr Thomas Matthews is recorded in Post Office Directories as having lived at Wolston between 1890 and 1893 and may have leased the property from the Goggs family. Over the years the family had bought and sold land and by 1907 the Wolston property had been reduced to 650 acres (2.6 km2) of land around Wolston House.\n\nIn 1907 the Grindle family purchased the property. They built it up and operated a successful dairy, milking 120 cows a day and selling the milk to Brisbane. They covered the shingle roof with corrugated iron and rationalised the spacing of the verandah posts which had previously been irregularly spaced, reflecting the stages in which the house was extended.\nIn 1956 the estate was purchased by Robert Hurley. By this time the property had become run down and the house was inhabited by three elderly Grindle brothers who were no longer able to run the property. At the time this consisted of 117 acres (47 ha) of freehold land in poor condition. The Hurleys built up the property again establishing an intensive dairying business.\nIn 1960 the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock resumed the property to establish a tick research centre. They demolished the farm outbuildings and intended to demolish the homestead also, however this was saved following an intensive campaign by the Queensland Women's Historical Association, the Royal Historical Society of Queensland and the newly formed National Trust of Queensland. In 1965, the house was transferred to the National Trust and became their first property. Sir Raphael Cilento, who was to become the second president of the Trust between 1966 and 1971, and the architect Karl Langer, were prominent in the acquisition of the homestead and in its interpretation.\nThis interpretation rested on the occupation of the property by Dr Stephen Simpson and so it was decided to demolish the timber section at the rear, which was clearly of a later period. When acquired by the Trust, the house was in poor condition. Along with urgent repairs, extensive reconstruction was also carried out. While reflecting the philosophies of the early 1960s, this approach is not acceptable today. Current conservation philosophy, in line with the recommendations of the Burra Charter, favours minimal intervention and interpretation embraces the whole life of the house and its setting. Wolston House has now been owned by the Trust for over thirty years, and is still open to the public as a museum, so that the effects of changes in conservation philosophies and methods over this period can be studied.\n\n\nDescription\nWolston House is on a rural site between Brisbane and Ipswich overlooking the Brisbane River. The surrounding land is now occupied by Wacol Correctional Centre and the Department of Primary Industries and retains its pastoral aspect. The house is surrounded by a mature garden containing large trees, a well and a pump.\nThe house is constructed of sandstone and brick with a galvanised iron roof and has six rooms. Two cellars with attached lean-tos form a half basement accessed from the rear. The house is one room deep with the rooms disposed along a verandah supported by timber posts. The rooms are accessed by French windows without a formal entrance. These consist of a large double room divided by folding cedar doors, a bedroom, dining room and a kitchen which is set at a slightly lower level. Much of the joinery is original, however, much of the plaster wall finishes have been reconstructed and the ceilings, which were thought to have been pressed metal and plaster, have been rebuilt in second hand timber.\nTo the rear of the house, brick basement walls remain from the 1860s children's wing which was demolished in the 1970s. Wolston functions as a house museum and a modern caretaker's residence is situated to one side of the house. There is a modern toilet block behind the house and a timber railway building has been moved to the rear of the site as a store. The gate posts and part of the wall shown in 1930s photographs survives as do elements of original paving.\nThe collection, which has been developed to furnish the house, does not relate to it but contains some items associated with people who lived or worked on the property. It contains some significant early furniture and objects.\n\n\nHeritage listing\nWolston House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nIt is also associated with the formation of the National Trust of Queensland and with Sir Raphael Cilento and Karl Langer, who played major roles in the acquisition of Wolston House as the Trust's foundation property.\nThe place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\nWolston House is a rare surviving early homestead, mainly constructed in the 1860s but incorporating an 1852 cottage. The materials and workmanship which survive from these stages of building illustrate techniques not commonly found in small rural buildings of this period.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\nBy its form and the lack of a formal entry, the building demonstrates something of the way of life of the first European settlers of the district.\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\nThe nature of the building and its relationship with the landscape has considerable aesthetic appeal which is well liked by the community.\nThe place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.\nThe earliest part of the house is associated with Dr Stephen Simpson (1792–1869), a man prominent in public life during the first years of Brisbane. It is also associated with the formation of the National Trust of Queensland and with Sir Raphael Cilento and Karl Langer, who played major roles in the acquisition of Wolston House as the Trust's foundation property.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAttribution\n This Wikipedia article was originally based on \"The Queensland heritage register\" published by the State of Queensland under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 7 July 2014, archived on 8 October 2014).

    "text": "Larderello is a frazione of the comune of Pomarance, in Tuscany in central Italy, renowned for its geothermal productivity.\n\n\nGeography\nThe region of Larderello has experienced occasional phreatic eruptions, caused by explosive outbursts of steam trapped below the surface. The water is contained in metamorphic rocks where it is turned to steam which is then trapped beneath a dome of impermeable shales and clay. The steam escapes through faults in the dome and forces its way out in the hot springs. It possesses a dozen explosion craters 30–250 m in diameter. The largest is the Lago Vecchienna crater which last erupted around 1282, now filled by the Boracifero Lake.\nLarderello now produces 10% of the world's entire supply of geothermal electricity, amounting to 4,800 GWh per year and powering about a million Italian households. Its geology makes it uniquely conducive to geothermal power production, with hot granite rocks lying unusually close to the surface, producing steam as hot as 202 °C (396 °F).\nContrary to popular belief, Larderello is not a volcano as no eruptions of magma had occurred there at any point in history.\n\n\nHistory\nThe region was known from ancient times for its exceptionally hot springs. The Romans used its sulphur springs for bathing.\nDuring the 19th century it became one of the first places in the world where geothermal energy was exploited to support industry. In 1827, François Jacques de Larderel, a Frenchman, invented a way of extracting boric acid from the mud by using steam to heat cauldrons to separate the two. Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany was an enthusiastic supporter of Larderel's scheme and awarded him the title of Count of Montecerboli a decade later. A town, named Larderello in honour of Larderel's work, was founded to house the workers in the boric acid production factory.\nThe region was the site of a pioneering experiment in the production of energy from geothermal sources in 1904, when five light bulbs were lit by electricity produced through steam emerging from vents in the ground - the first ever practical demonstration of geothermal power.\nPrince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the Larderello dry steam field in Italy. It was a small generator that lit four light bulbs. In 1911, the world's first geothermal power plant was built in the Valle del Diavolo (\"Devil's Valley\"), named for the boiling water that rises there. It was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958, when New Zealand built a plant of its own in Wairakei. In recent years concerns have been expressed about the sustainability of its steam supply, as a 30% drop in steam pressure levels has been recorded from the maximum levels of the 1950s.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nTiwari, G.

This leguminous tree species is native to East Africa, Eastern DRC and southern Africa. In Zimbabwe its range overlaps with the similar Erythrina latissima.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe description of E. abyssinica has been complicated, because the first specimen of Erythrina from Ethiopia (Abyssinia) brought to Europe was actually a mix of the two species. The flowers and leaves belonged to E. brucei Schweinfurth (1868) and the pod and seeds to E. abyssinica Lam. ex DC (1825). In addition, the first three descriptions were invalid, i.e. not published correctly to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (syn. E. kuara James Bruce (1790), E. abyssinica Lam. (1786) and E. tomentosa Robert Brown (1814)). Furthermore, the species is variable with individuals with glabrous and hairy (tomentose) leaves which were described separately and after revision resulted in additional synonyms (syn. E. tomentosa R. Brown ex A.Rich. (1847)). The number of synonyms increased when a new genus was described from South Africa (Chirocalyx Meisn.), which later was considered synonymous with Erythrina (Ch. tomentosa Hochstetter and Ch. abyssinica Hochstetter). Finally, E. abyssinica was considered for some time the juvenile stage of E. brucei and hence synonymous with the latter species. The issue was settled in 1962 when the pods and seeds from E. brucei were collected which were different from those of E. abyssinica. Consecutively, the seeds planted revealed that seedlings and saplings of E. brucei did not resemble those of E. abyssinica.\n\n\nDescription\nThe flowers attract sunbirds. After it has finished flowering, it produces a seed capsule, which is long and cylindrical, and wood-like. It can be up to 30 cm long and contains bright red and black seeds.\n\n\nUses\nThe seeds are used as fish poison and decoratively in necklaces. The soft wood of the trunk has been used to carve small statues and animals. The wood is also used for making beehives and African drums or Tam Tam.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nDressler, S.; Schmidt, M. & Zizka, G. (2014). \"Erythrina abyssinica\".

    "text": "Henry IV of France's wives and mistresses played a significant role in the politics of his reign. Both Henry (1553–1610) and his first wife Margaret of Valois, whom he married in 1572, were repeatedly unfaithful to each other, and the collapse of their marriage led to their estrangement and living apart. Although Henry fathered children with a series of mistresses, his lack of a legitimate heir became a cause of concern, and his marriage was not annulled until 1599.  In 1600, at the age of forty-six, he married his second wife, Marie de' Medici. They had six children, including the future Louis XIII.  Henry was unfaithful to his second wife as well and insisted that she raise his illegitimate children along with her own.\nHenry's womanising became legendary, earning him the nickname of  Le Vert Galant. His sexual appetite was said to have been insatiable, and he always kept mistresses, often several at a time, as well as engaging in random sexual encounters and visits to brothels.  Even so, he tended to elevate one mistress above the others and shower her with money, honours, and promises. His two most famous mistresses of this type were Gabrielle d'Estrées, who died in 1599, and her successor, Henriette d'Entragues, who involved herself in plots against the crown. Henry promised marriage to each of them, exposing himself to a series of political problems.\n\n\nParents\nBorn in 1553, Henry was the son of Jeanne d'Albret, who became the Queen Regnant of Navarre two years after he was born. His father, Antoine of Bourbon, was constantly unfaithful to Jeanne. The couple also differed over religion: Jeanne became a staunch Huguenot, whereas Antoine wavered, for political reasons, between the Catholicism of his birth and the faith of his wife. His vacillating character earned him the epithet ondoyant (one whose mind changes, or undulates) from the essayist Montaigne, a description later sometimes applied to his son. The public squabbling between Jeanne and Antoine became scandalous during Henry's childhood, and in 1560, when he was seven, Jeanne took him to the French court. After Antoine ordered her back to her kingdom of Navarre in 1562, she left Henry behind, and she was reunited with him only in 1566 during the royal progress to the south. Among Henry's playmates at the French court were the future Henry III of France and Henry of Guise.\n\n\nMargaret of Valois\n\nAfter the signature of the peace of Saint-Germain, Catherine de' Medici, the powerful mother of King Charles IX, was convinced by François of Montmorency to marry her daughter Margaret with Henry. The match was in fact assumed almost thirteen years earlier by the late King Henry II. Catherine, who believed in dynastic marriage as a potent political tool, aimed to unite the interests of the Valois and the Bourbons, and create harmony between Catholics and Huguenots in the reign of France.\nBy all accounts, Margaret of Valois was deemed highly attractive, even sexually magnetic: \"The beauty of that princess is more divine than human, she is made to damn and ruin men rather than to save them\", said about her Don John of Austria came to court just to see her. Margaret had also an enterprising and flirtatious character. Shortly before this marriage plan with Henry of Navarre, she had been involved in a scandal: it was discovered that she encouraged the handsome Henry of Guise, who intended to marry her, entertaining a secret correspondence with him. When her family discovered it put an end to the crush between them and sent Henry of Guise away from court.\nSome sources claim the duke of Guise was Margaret's first lover, but this is highly unlikely. For political reasons, the duty of a Daughter of France was to be a virgin at the wedding and for this she was very guarded. If Margaret had really compromised her reputation, Jeanne d'Albret would not accept the marriage between her son and the princess. Although certainly after the wedding, Margaret was unfaithful to her husband, many of the extramarital adventures are the result of pamphlets that have had to politically discredit her and her family: the most famous  was Le Divorce Satyrique (1607), who described her as a nymphomaniac.\nMargaret complied with her mother's desire to marry Henry, provided she was not forced to convert to Protestantism. When Jeanne arrived at the French court after receiving numerous pressures from Catherine, she was extremely impressed by Margaret: \"She has frankly owned to me the favourable impression which she has formed of you. With her beauty and wit, she exercises a great influence over the Queen-Mother and the King, and Messieurs her younger brothers.\" The problems began when the Protestant Jeanne discovered that Margaret had no intention of abjuring Catholicism. Meanwhile the marriage negotiations were repeatedly impeded by the Pope and the King of Spain.\nTired of the duration of the negotiations, Charles IX decided that the wedding would be celebrated by the Cardinal of Bourbon even without papal dispensation, so Jeanne gave her consent to the wedding by promising that Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died, aged forty-four; and Henry succeeded her as the King of Navarre. Henry arrived in Paris in July 1572 and saw Margaret after six years of separation (they had spent their childhood together with the French court). Despite subsequent historiographic interpretations, contemporaries do not point out any mutual dissatisfaction between future spouses.\n\nThe controversial wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. After a nuptial lunch, four days of balls, masques and banquets ensued, only to be interrupted by the outbreak of violence in Paris. After the attempted assassination of the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny on 22 August 1572, Catherine and Charles IX, to forestall the expected Huguenot backlash, ordered the murder of the Huguenot leaders gathered in Paris for the wedding. The result was the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout the reign. \nMargaret later described in her Memoirs the chaos and bloodshed in the Louvre Palace, where she and her new husband were lodged. Henry found himself escorted to a room with his cousin Henry of Condé, and told to choose between death and conversion to Roman Catholicism. He chose the latter. After the massacre, the Queen-Mother proposed to her daughter that the marriage be annulled, but Margaret replied that this was impossible because she had already had sexual relations with Henry and was \"in every sense\" his wife. She wrote in her Memoirs: \"I suspected the design of separating me from my husband was in order to work some mischief against him.\"\n\nUntil 1576, Henry remained at court, siding with Margaret and her brother François of Alençon against Henry III, who became king in 1574. During this time, Henry of Navarre often ignored Margaret and instead slept with his mistress, Charlotte de Sauve. It appeared, in the words of Henry's biographer David Buisseret, as if \"the pleasure-loving and libidinous elements of his ancestry had finally gained the upper hand\". A rivalry developed between him and Alençon over the beautiful de Sauve, who was one of Catherine de' Medici's so-called \"flying squadron\", a group of \"court lovelies\" whom Catherine used to lure noblemen to court and, it was rumoured, as informants. According to Margaret's Memoirs, de Sauve \"treated both of them in such a way that they became extremely jealous of each other… to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman\". De Sauve may have been acting as a tool of Henry III and Catherine in their attempts to split the two men. Henry of Navarre's good judgement was already known to desert him when it came to women. He wrote to a friend:\n\nThis Court is the strangest place on earth. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throats…  All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [Alençon] and they have forbidden my mistress to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me… they say they will kill me, and I want to be one jump ahead of them.\nMargaret's behaviour was also the subject of scandal.  On one occasion in 1575, Catherine de' Medici was heard yelling at her, accusing her of taking a lover. In a separate incident, the king sent a band of assassins to murder Margaret's lover Bussy d'Amboise, a friend of Alençon's, who managed to escape. As Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda puts it: \"he then decided to leave the Court immediately citing health reasons, which happened to be nothing less than the truth\". In 1576, Henry III accused Marguerite of improper relations with a lady-in-waiting. Margaret claimed in her Memoirs that he would have killed her if Catherine had not stopped him. Despite their sexual infidelities, Margaret remained politically loyal to her husband during the early period of their marriage and helped him negotiate the complexities of the court. By 1575, however, their relations were no longer physical: \"I could not endure the pain that I felt\", she recalled in her Memoirs, \"and I stopped sleeping with the King my husband\".\nIn 1576, Henry managed to slip away while hunting and made for his kingdom, where he abjured the Catholic religion on 13 June. For a time, the abandoned Margaret found herself imprisoned, suspected of complicity, and was afterwards distrusted by her own family. Henry eventually demanded that she be brought to him. In 1578, therefore, Catherine de' Medici travelled south to Nérac and duly delivered Margaret to her husband. At first, in this new phase in their marriage, the couple managed a show of harmony, but strains were apparent. In 1580 a religious war, later called the \"Lovers' War\", broke out between the Huguenots and King Henry III. Although inaccurate, this name for the war relates to a series of scandals at the Navarre court and to the notion that Henry of Navarre took up arms in response to jibes about his love life from the French court. At this point, he was conducting a passionate affair with a mistress known as \"La Belle Fosseuse\", while Margaret was involved with one of his own commanders, the Vicomte de Turenne. Henry wrote to Margaret apologising for the state of affairs between them. He expressed \"extreme regret that instead of bringing you contentment… I have brought the opposite\".\nIn 1582, Margaret returned to the French court without her husband, who was still openly besotted with La Fosseuse. Before long, she began taking lovers again, such as Harlay de Champvallon, one of her brother François's retinue, and acting more scandalously than ever.  After a rumour that she had borne Champvallon a child, Henry III ordered her back to Navarre and then had her carriage searched and detained her in an abbey for questioning. \nHenry of Navarre at first refused to take Margaret back unless Henry III made a public statement asserting her innocence of all the charges against her. Catherine de' Medici sent Pomponne de Bellièvre south to smooth things over and arrange Margaret's return. In a letter, she spelled out to Margaret that a royal wife must bear her husband's affairs without complaint, recalling proudly that her own conduct as a wife had been impeccable, despite all provocation. Margaret was reunited with Henry on 13 April 1584, but she failed to heed her mother's words, even though the death of her brother François in June 1584 made her husband heir presumptive to the French throne.  Henry himself was under increased pressure to produce an heir. He was advised by his closest friend Philippe Duplessis-Mornay that it was now \"time to make love to France\".\n\nIn 1585, Henry embarked on a passionate love affair with a widow called Diane d'Andouins, nicknamed La Belle Corisande. Margaret found it impossible to ignore this particular lover of Henry's, since d'Andouins was pressing Henry to repudiate Margaret so that she could become queen of Navarre herself. Margaret responded by attempting to poison Henry, and then she shot at him with a pistol but missed. To escape his revenge, she fled the Kingdom of Navarre again, this time to her property at Agen. From there she wrote to her mother begging for money. Catherine sent her enough \"to put food on her table\" but was contemptuous.\nMargaret attempted to strengthen the fortifications at Agen, raise troops, and ally with the Catholic League against her husband.  Before long, however, the officials and people of Agen drove her out of the town. Retreating to her lofty and impregnable fortress of Carlat, and refusing her mother's pleas that she move to a royal manor, she there took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine's patience ran out, and she insisted that Henry III arrest \"this insufferable torment\" and act \"before she brings shame on us again\".\nOn 13 October 1586, therefore, the king had Margaret forcibly removed from Carlat and locked up in the Château d'Usson. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, as Catherine demanded, in front of Margaret. Catherine cut Marguerite out of her will. Margaret never saw her mother or brother again. Margaret assumed she was going to die and even employed a food taster at the château. In a \"farewell\" letter to her mother, she asked that after her execution a post-mortem be held to prove that she was not, despite gossip, pregnant with d'Aubiac's child. At this point, her luck took a turn for the better. Her gaoler, the Marquis de Canillac, whom she was rumoured to have seduced, suddenly switched from the royal side in the civil war to that of the Catholic League and released her in early 1587. Her freedom suited the League perfectly: her continued existence guaranteed that Henry of Navarre would remain without an heir. This problem became acute for Henry after he succeeded to the throne of France in 1589.\n\n\nGabrielle d'Estrées\n\nHenry IV was an energetic soldier who spent long periods at war. After military campaigns, he rewarded himself with bouts of idle pleasure, hunting during the day, gambling in the evening, and womanising at night. His companion in these leisure pursuits was often the banker Sébastien Zamet, who lent him vast sums of money and made his house available to the king for dalliances. One drawback to Henry's philandering, however, was a proneness to venereal diseases. In October 1598, he nearly died from an infection of the bladder, and an attack of gonorrhoea a few weeks later briefly brought on a heart problem. On 6 November, he wrote to the Duke of Sully that the illness \"has made me very depressed [tout chagrin], and I do everything that my doctors recommend, so keen am I to get better\".\nHenry's sexual appetite, said to have been insatiable, was often indiscriminate, but he always recognised a particular mistress as his first lady. One such was Gabrielle d'Estrées, whom he met at Cœuvres in 1590 and later made the duchess of Beaufort. This relationship was castigated by Henry's enemies in the church, particularly by the Capuchins. On one occasion, arriving at her apartments near the Louvre, Henry was stabbed in the face by a Jesuit  would-be-assassin called Jean Chastel, who slashed his mouth and broke one of his teeth. In June 1594, d'Estrées bore Henry a son, César, who was legitimized in Jan/Feb 1595. Henry's duchess had gradually risen in prominence, and she acted as her royal lover's hostess for diplomatic occasions, such as the surrender talks with the rebel Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, in 1596. In October of that year, an Italian observer reported that \"among the French nobility people begin to expect that the king intends to name as his successor the natural son born of Gabrielle\". Henry's advisers were deeply opposed to any such plan, however, which would guarantee a war of succession—but, for a while, Henry seemed determined. When the last of the Catholic League rebels, Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur, surrendered in 1598, Henry and Gabrielle's son, César, was ceremonially promised in marriage to Mercœur's daughter, though both were small children. The chronicler Pierre de L'Estoile records a vignette of Gabrielle d'Estrées' status at this time: \"The duchess of Beaufort [was] seated in a chair, and Madame de Guise brought her the various dishes with great ceremony. Gabrielle took what she most liked with one hand, and gave her other to be kissed by the king, who was near her\".\nBy early 1599, Henry's marriage to Marguerite of Valois looked likely to be annulled at last. And so, at the age of forty-six and still without a legitimate heir, Henry felt free to propose to Gabrielle d'Estrées. On Mardi Gras, Henry placed on her finger the ring with which he had \"married\" France at his coronation in 1593. During Holy Week, however, Gabrielle, who was pregnant at the time, fell ill; by Holy Saturday, to the relief of many in France, she was dead. Rumours flew that she had been poisoned, but in fact she died from eclampsia and a premature birth of a stillborn son. Though grief-stricken, Henry grasped that his fiancée's death had saved him from disaster: his plan to declare his two sons by d'Estrées heirs to the throne would have precipitated a major political crisis. The English agent Edmondes reported:\n\nAnd the King himselfe doth freelie confesse it, that albeit her death is a great grief unto him, in regard that he did so dearlie love her, and intending as he acknowledgeth to have married her, but that God having directlie manifested that he would not suffer him to fall into the danger of so great an error and inconvenience to himselfe and to his state, that he will not fail to make a lesson thereof.\nHenry provided Gabrielle d'Estrées with a grandiose funeral and drowned his sorrows with a sustained spree of womanising. Sir Henry Neville, the English ambassador, reported that Henry was spending time \"in secret manner at Zamet's house\", where \"la belle garce Claude\" was known to entertain, and that he was fervently courting Henriette d'Entragues, the daughter of Charles IX's former mistress, Marie Touchet. Royal accounts record that Henry was soon making large payments to \"Mademoiselle d'Entragues\", as well as to \"Mademoiselle des Fossez\". D'Entragues quickly replaced d'Estrées as Henry's principal mistress. She extracted from him, in Neville's words, \"100,000 crowns in ready money and an yearly pension\" as proof of his commitment. At about the same time, Henry began affairs with Marie Babou de la Bourdaisière and with two wives of Paris parlement members, madames Quélin and Potier.\n\n\nMarie de' Medici\nIn October 1599, the parlement of Paris officially petitioned that Henry marry a princess worthy of his dignity. Henry took note and began considering candidates from several foreign states. According to Sully, however, he ruled out a German wife, on the grounds that it would feel like going to bed with a wine-barrel. Henry was keenest on Maria de' Medici, the niece of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the daughter of the previous duke, Francesco I de' Medici. What he found particularly attractive about Maria was her enormous wealth.\n\nOn 17 December 1599, the Archbishop of Arles pronounced the annulment of Henry's marriage to Margaret of Valois. The Medici marriage contract was signed in April 1600, pledging a huge dowry of 600,000 écus, part of which was subtracted to pay Henry's debts to Ferdinando. Henry played his part by proclaiming undying devotion to Maria in a series of letters, though he was sending similar love letters to Henriette d'Entragues, telling her in one that he wanted to kiss her a million times. A proxy marriage took place in Florence in October 1600, and then Maria—to be known in France as Marie—sailed in great pomp for Marseille, where she disembarked on  3 November. Henry, on campaign in Savoy, rode to meet her at Lyon, where he found her at supper. He visited her afterwards in her chamber; according to Ralph Winwood, secretary to English ambassador Sir Henry Neville:\n\nShe met him at the door, and offered to kneel down, but he took her in his arms, where he held her embraced a long time ... He doth profess to the World the great Contentment he finds in her, how that for her Beauty, her sweet and pleasing carriage, her gracious behaviour, she doth surpass the relation which hath been made of her, and the Expectation which he thereby conceived.\nThe couple underwent a second marriage ceremony in Lyon; and Marie finally reached Paris on 7 February, already pregnant. She found her new home, the Louvre, so shabby that at first she thought Henry was playing a joke. She gave birth to a son, Louis, at the Palace of Fontainebleau on 27 September 1601, to the delight of Henry, who had rushed from military duties to her bedside to serve, he joked, as one of her midwives. The moment Henry was told that the child was a boy, he ushered two hundred courtiers into the chamber to share the euphoria. The baby was fed a spoonful of wine and handed over to a governess, Baroness Robert de Harlay, baron de Monglat, and to the physician Jean Héroard, an expert on the bone structure of horses. According to Winwood, the baby was a \"strong and a goodly prince, and doth promise long life\". The birth of a dauphin, as the first son of a French king was known, inspired rejoicing and bonfires throughout France.\nMarie believed that after bearing a son, she \"would begin to be a queen\". However, a few weeks later, Henriette d'Entragues also produced a son (Gaston Henri, Duc de Verneuil) and Henry not only made just as much fuss over this son but declared that he was better-looking, not fat and dark like Louis and the Medici. In the words of biographer David Buisseret, \"the royal couple was well embarked upon nine years of mutual recrimination and misunderstandings, in which the fault plainly lay with the king\".\nHenry had made Marie's position clear to her from the first. When she began by pressing him to accept the decrees of the Council of Trent, he told her to keep her nose out of state business and look after herself. Shortly after Marie's arrival in Paris, Henry had introduced Henriette d'Entragues to her, reportedly pushing Henriette further towards the ground when her curtsey was not low enough. He housed his senior mistress close to the Louvre and was seen dining with the queen and d'Entragues together. Marie also had to cope with a second public mistress, La Bourdaisière, as well as with Henry's continued visits to Zamet's house for services provided by \"la belle garce Claude\". In the next nine years, Marie bore Henry six children; but he also sired five more by d'Entragues, Jacqueline de Bueil, and Charlotte des Essarts. Nonetheless, Henry often wrote affectionate letters to Marie and in other ways treated her with respect.\n\nHenriette d'Entragues never reconciled herself to Henry's marriage, and she drove Marie to tears by calling her his \"fat banker\", claiming her own children were Henry's legitimate heirs and branding the dauphin a bastard. Henry's devotion to d'Entragues was tested during the revolt of Marshal Biron in 1602, in which her half-brother, Charles, Count of Auvergne, was implicated and she was compromised. Though Biron was executed, Henry released Auvergne to please Henriette. In 1604, she was at the heart of a Spanish-backed plot to install her son by the king as heir to the throne. Her father, the sieur d'Entragues, was involved in this plot, along with, again, her half-brother. Henriette d'Entragues was sentenced to confinement in a convent, but Henry was moved to spare her even that and  allowed her to retire to her estate at Verneuil Despite the king's clemency, Henriette d'Entragues may have continued to plot further against him. According to a government report of 1616, a former companion of d'Entragues, Mlle d'Escoman, had claimed in 1611 that d'Entragues had met François Ravaillac, Henry's assassin of 1610. However, this evidence is compromised by the fact that, at the time she made this accusation, Mlle d'Escoman was in prison on another charge.\nThe dauphin, Louis, turned out to be a difficult and temperamental child, and some historians have blamed this on his parents and the circumstances of his upbringing. He was raised just outside Paris at the château of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, not only alongside Marie's other children by Henry but, as Henry insisted, with several children of Henry's mistresses. Henry always seemed to get his mistresses pregnant at the same time as Marie. Just as Marie was in constant competition with Henry's mistresses, so her children were forced to compete with their children for his affection. The fact that Henry's three children by Gabrielle d'Estrées were older than the heir to the throne caused particular problems of rivalry.  César and Alexandre were later to rebel against Louis when he was king. He did not hesitate to throw them into prison.\nLouis shared his father's stubbornness, but he may have inherited his temper tantrums from his mother, who often gave Henry tongue-lashings in public. Although Marie has been accused of lacking affection for her children, a study of her letters reveals the contrary, though she was a stern disciplinarian. She wrote to the dauphin's governess, for example, asking her to avoid whippings when the weather was hot and to beat Louis only \"with such caution that the anger he might feel would not cause any illness\". On another occasion, she reprimanded her middle daughter, Christine, for being ill, accusing her of not following the advice of her doctors. Marie personally educated the children in practical matters, such as etiquette. After Henry's assassination in 1610, she became regent of France and retained influence over Louis XIII until he finally rejected her in 1617.\nHenry's last passion was for Charlotte of Montmorency, the fifteen-year-old wife of Henry, prince of Condé, First Prince of the Blood. The king had arranged Charlotte's marriage to Condé for his own convenience, in order to sleep with her himself when he pleased. To escape from this predicament, the couple fled to Brussels. The king was enraged and threatened to march into Flanders with an army unless the Habsburg governors returned Condé and his wife at once. At the time, he was also threatening war with the Habsburgs over the succession to the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, so historians are unsure how crucial in itself Charlotte's return was as a reason for war. Condé continued to provoke Henry from Flanders. When asked to drink to the queen of France, he replied that there seemed to be more than one queen of France, maybe as many as four or five.\n\n\nSee also\nList of French royal mistresses\n\n\nChildren\n\n\nLegitimate children\nOn 18 August 1572, Henry married Margaret of Valois; their childless marriage was annulled in 1599.

    "text": "A trade-dollar locket, also known as a box dollar or an opium dollar, is a type of locket created from two coins, typically trade dollars, that were hinged together to form a hidden compartment. As trade dollars circulated in Asia in the late 19th century, the lockets were popularly thought to be used to carry opium concealed in the secret compartment. An image could also be placed in the compartment of the coin making it a traditional locket.\n\n\nHistory\nThe United States minted trade dollars between 1873 and 1878 to facilitate trade with East Asia. Trade-dollar lockets were made by hinging together two such coins to form a compartment, which could be opened by pressing on the lid or edge. As the trade dollars circulated in East Asia, including China, trade-dollar lockets were thought to be used to conceal a small quantity of opium, but an 1896 advertisement marketing one as a \"secret locket\" suggests that it was not intended for use in drug trafficking. Experts are not sure if the coins were ever used to conceal opium, but the coins were widely used in trade between the United States and Orient which is where the majority of opium came from. An 1893 issue of Donahoe's Magazine described their locket as \"a pretty thing to have around\" to hide a \"dear face which no one else can discover\". In 1896, an illustrated catalogue titled Busiest House in America advertised a six-dollar \"secret locket\" made from trade dollars.\n\n\nFunction\nWhen closed the coin appeared to be an ordinary trade dollar. The lockets could also be used traditionally, to conceal an image. An 1896 publication which purports to be one manufacturer of the trade dollar locket suggests that the coin was not used to conceal opium.  Coin dealer B. Max Mehl suggested in his monthly periodical in 1919 that a locket could be \"skillfully made\" out of two coins for five to ten dollars.\n\n\nReferences",

It is the ninth-biggest convention center in Germany.\nThe new Messe Stuttgart site, completed in 2007, is right next to the A8  autobahn (highway). The center is accessible from Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe station on the local suburban railway network. Buses also travel to Messe Stuttgart from nearby Esslingen, Göppingen, Reutlingen and Tübingen. There are plans to link Messe Stuttgart and Stuttgart airport to the proposed Stuttgart–Wendlingen high-speed railway between Stuttgart and Ulm by 2019 as part of the Stuttgart 21 Project.\n\n\nParking garage\n\nOne of the most striking features of Messe Stuttgart is its huge parking garage, which spans the A8 Autobahn and can accommodate 4,200 vehicles on five levels. Display rights for the 4-ton logo on both sides of the garage's bridge were sold to Robert Bosch GmbH, which paid around 20 million euros for exclusive advertising space. The logo is the second-largest illuminated sign in the world and the biggest logo in the world after the unlit Hollywood Sign.\n\n\nBrief history\n\nBefore completion of the new site next to Stuttgart Airport, Messe Stuttgart had been based in the Killesberg suburb of Stuttgart for more than 50 years. As nearby housing estates encroached on the old site's parking and roads, it was closed down to make way for public housing for seniors and apartments.\n\n\nCriticism\nImmediately after opening, Messe Stuttgart was plagued by a number of unexpected teething problems, ranging from faulty barcode readers at the entrances to poor signage.\nConstruction of the new site, originally approved in 1993, was subject to repeated delays. First, local farmers refused to sell their land after successful lobbying by nearby residents. After compulsory repossession of land was approved by the Baden-Württemberg State Government, demonstrations led to a string of court cases between landowners and the company hired to build the new center. An agreement was eventually reached between the local government and landowners amid cries from local residents that the farmers had \"sold out\" to politicians and had only gone along with lobbyists in the first place to maximize returns on the sale of land.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nMesse Stuttgart maps (German)",

    "title": "USCGC Anthony Petit",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=63870167",
    "text": "USCGC Anthony Petit (WLM-558) is a Keeper-class coastal buoy tender of the United States Coast Guard. Launched in 1999, she has served her entire career maintaining navigational aids in Southeast Alaska.  She is assigned to the Seventeenth Coast Guard District.\n\n\nConstruction\nAnthony Petit was built by Marinette Marine Corporation in Marinette, Wisconsin. She was the eighth of the fourteen Keeper-class vessels completed. On 22 June 1993 the Coast Guard awarded the contract for the Keeper class vessels in the form of a firm contract for the lead ship and options for thirteen more. In February 1997, it exercised options for the 5th through the 10th vessels, including Anthony Petit. The ship was launched on 30 January 1999, into the Menominee River. Speakers at the christening ceremony included Alaska Senator Frank Murkowski, and Coast Guard Commandant Admiral James Loy.\nHer hull was built of welded steel plates. She is 175 feet (53 m) long, with a beam of 36 feet (11 m), and a full-load draft of 8 feet (2.4 m). Anthony Petit displaces 850 long tons fully loaded. Her gross register tonnage is 904, and her net register tonnage is 271. The top of the mast is 58.75 feet (17.91 m) above the waterline.\nRather than building the ship from the keel up as a single unit, Marinette Marine used a modular fabrication approach. Eight large modules, or \"hull blocks\" were built separately and then welded together.\n\nThe ship has two Caterpillar 3508 DITA (direct-injection, turbocharged, aftercooled) 8-cylinder Diesel engines which produce 1000 horsepower each. These drive two Ulstein Z-drives. Keeper-class ships were the first Coast Guard cutters equipped with Z-drives, which markedly improved their maneuverability.  The Z-drives have four-bladed propellers which are 57.1 inches (145 cm) in diameter and are equipped with Kort nozzles. They can be operated in \"tiller mode\" where the Z-drives turn in the same direction to steer the ship, or in \"Z-conn mode\" where the two Z-drives can turn in different directions to achieve specific maneuvering objectives. An implication of the Z-drives is that there is no reverse gear or rudder aboard Anthony Petit. In order to back the ship, the Z-drives are turned 180 degrees which drives the ship stern-first even though the propellers are spinning in the same direction as they do when the ship is moving forward. Her maximum speed is 12 knots.  Her tanks can hold 16,385 gallons of diesel fuel which gives her an unrefueled range of 2,000 nautical miles at 10 knots.\nShe has a 500 horsepower bow thruster. The Z-drives and bow thruster can be linked in a Dynamic Positioning System. This gives Anthony Petit the ability to hold position in the water even in heavy currents, winds, and swells. This advanced capability is useful in bringing buoys aboard that can weigh more than 16,000 lbs.\nElectrical power aboard is provided by three Caterpillar 3406 DITA generators which produce 285 Kw each. She also has a 210 Kw emergency generator, which is a Caterpillar 3406 DIT.\nThe buoy deck has 1,335 square feet (124.0 m2) of working area. A crane with a boom 42 feet (13 m) long lifts buoys and their mooring anchors onto the deck. The crane can lift up to 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg).\n\nThe ships' fresh water tanks can hold 7,339 gallons. She has three ballast tanks that can be filled to maintain their trim, and tanks for oily waste water, sewage, gray water, new lubrication oil, and waste oil.Accommodations were designed for mixed gender crews from the start. Crew size and composition has varied over the years. When she was commissioned in 1999, she had a crew of 23, commanded by a Chief Warrant Officer.\nAnthony Petit, as all Keeper-class ships, has a strengthened \"ice belt\" along the waterline so that she can work on aids to navigation in ice-infested waters. Not only is the hull plating in the ice belt thicker than the rest of the hull, but framing members are closer together in areas that experience greater loads when working in ice. Higher grades of steel were used for hull plating in the ice belt to prevent cracking in cold temperatures. Her bow is sloped so that rather than smashing into ice, she ride up over it and break it with the weight of the ship. Anthony Petit is capable of breaking flat, 9-inch thick ice at 3 knots.\nThe ship carries a cutter boat on davits. She was originally equipped with a CB-M boat which was replaced in the mid-2010s with a CB-ATON-M boat. This was built by Metal Shark Aluminum Boats and was estimated to cost $210,000. The boat is 18 feet (5.5 m) long and are equipped with a Mercury Marine inboard/outboard diesel engine.\nThe ship's namesake is U.S. Coast Guard Chief Boatswain's Mate Anthony Petit, the keeper of the Scotch Cap lighthouse on the west end of Unimak Island in the Aleutians. Petit and four other members of his crew were killed in a tsunami which destroyed the lighthouse on April 1, 1946.\n\n\nOperational history\n\nAfter her launch and sea trials, Anthony Petit sailed down the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and through the Panama Canal to reach Ketchikan, Alaska, her homeport for her entire career. She arrived in January 2000. The ship is stationed at Coast Guard Base Ketchikan. She replaced USCGC Planetree at this station. Her primary mission is maintaining 274 fixed and floating aids to navigation in Southeast Alaska.\nThe ship has also performed other Coast Guard missions. Anthony Petit participated in search and rescue activities as with the charter boat Fishin' Fool in 2002, fishing vessel Yvonne Denise in 2005, the ferry Lituya in 2009, and the fishing vessel Tsimshian Lady in 2017.\nAnthony Petit has trained extensively on oil spill containment. She has participated in several joint United States-Canada exercises to prepare for a possible spill in the Dixon Entrance area. She has deployed the vessel of opportunity skimming system (VOSS) several times in training.\n\n\nReferences",

He was described in  1940 as \"one of the greatest patrons of culture in nineteenth century Spain\". At the time of his death, his collection numbered some 12,600 pieces, mostly from the Old Master and Romantic periods - he had little interest in the Modernists.\n\n\nLife\n\nLázaro was born in 1862 in Beire, Navarre. He studied Law and Philosophy in Seville and Madrid before taking office in 1883 at the Bank of Spain in Barcelona. However, his talent and ability in art appreciation and journalism soon took his career in another direction. He befriended Emilia Pardo Bazán who introduced him to the leading Spanish intellectuals of the time. In 1889, he co-founded the review España Moderna with Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo and a number of leading Spanish critics. This was followed by the launch of the Revista Internacional; a review that featured Spanish, French, English and German writers.\nIn 1903, he married the glamorous Argentine Paula Florido (d. 1931) who shared his passion for art and advised him on many of his major acquisitions. She accompanied him on his frequent travels across Europe, Africa and North and South America seeking art objects. Lázaro was a member of the Athenæum of Madrid and served on the board of trustees at the Museo del Prado. In 1921, he was elected president of the International congress of History of Art. He spent the years of the Spanish Civil War in exile, first in Paris and later New York, where he continued to collect art works. He returned to Madrid following the end of the conflict.\n\n\nThe Lázaro Galdiano Museum\n\nSince Lázaro's death his home in Calle Serrano, a fashionable street in Madrid, has been adapted to serve as a museum to house his collections. The building was commissioned in 1903, the year of his marriage, and is in neo-Renaissance style. The museum is open to the public and includes works by Bosch, Velázquez, Goya, El Greco and Zurbarán.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nCook, Walter W. S. \"Jose Lázaro y Galdiano (1862-1947)\".

Inside, the column-free space can accommodate 1,500 prayer spaces over two levels — a large central hall and a mezzanine. Designed by the Riyadh-based architecture and engineering firm Omrania and Associates, the mosque is inspired by the form of the desert rose.\n\n\nDesign\nThe general concept of the KAFD Grand Mosque is inspired by the desert rose, a naturally occurring crystalline structure commonly found in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. The specific geometries of the building, however, are based on traditional Islamic patterns and provide integrated sun shading as well as a sculptural articulation that is consistent with the design principles of the KAFD master plan developed by Henning Larsen.The stone cladding and minimal glazing also protect the building from the environment while reinforcing the idea of the desert landscape.\nDesign firm Omrania stated in Middle East Architect magazine, \"A major challenge was to develop the geometry in such a way as to support a column free internal environment. All of the loads are transferred through the structural skin, and the skin supports a flying mezzanine by means of hanging supports.\" In 2019 Omrania's KAFD Grand Mosque was named the mosque one of the \"Top 10 contemporary mosques that challenge traditional Islamic architecture.\"\n\n\nSite\nThe site is located at the intersection of three large sunken pathways or urban “wadi” (valleys) surrounded by the skyscrapers. A new public plaza and outdoor prayer space elevates the mosque above the wadi but below the entrance to the skyscrapers. Two 60-metre-tall (200 ft) minarets mark the entrance to the mosque plaza. Because the building is highly visible from all directions and from above, the tessellated roof was designed as a “fifth elevation.”\n\n\nInteriors and symbolism\nThe interior is a single large, column-free space. The western side features a colored glass mihrab, whose triangular glazing represents abstracted muqarnas. Triangulated ceiling panels, also inspired by muqarnas, provide additional lighting and improve acoustics. At ground level, small windows are design with multiple layers of abstracted Arabic calligraphy of verses from the Quran.\n\n\nStructure and MEP\nTo create the column-free prayer space, the mosque is designed with a 2.8-metre-deep (9.2 ft) structural skin, which also supports a hanging mezzanine. The mechanical and structural systems are concealed beneath the mosque plaza or integrated into the mosque's enclosure.\n\n\nAwards\n2017 Finalist, religion - World Architecture Festival\n2019 Winner of Abdullatif Al Fozan Award for Mosque Architecture\n\n\nSee also\n\nIslam in Saudi Arabia\nList of mosques in Saudi Arabia\n\n\nReferences",

First published in the United States by Harper & Row with illustrations by William Pène du Bois, Allen & Unwin published the first U.K. edition in 1968. Later editions have been illustrated by Pat Marriott, Tony Ross, and Quentin Blake.\n\n\nSynopsis\nThe Magic Finger is narrated by an unnamed eight-year-old girl who is growing up on a remote rural farm in the English countryside, next door to the Gregg family who have a passion for hunting animals and birds. The titular \"Magic Finger\" is an ability the girl has that activates inadvertently whenever she gets angry: the finger itself shoots out a beam of electrical energy that apparently seeks out whoever has angered the girl, with unpredictable consequences. For example, when the girl's teacher, Mrs. Winter, shames her for misspelling the word \"cat\", the magic finger gives Mrs. Winter whiskers and a bushy tail, and the girl cryptically states that Mrs. Winter was never quite the same again.\nOne day, the girl sees Mr. Gregg and his two sons, Philip and William, returning home from a hunt with a deer that they have just killed, and they make fun of her and tell her to mind her own business when she shouts at them. In a rage, the girl puts the Magic Finger itself on the entire family; when they wake up the following morning they have shrunk to bird-size and developed \"ducks' wings\" in place of their arms and hands. While trying out their new wings, the Greggs fly out of their house, which is promptly occupied by four human-sized ducks with human arms and human hands, and they are all soon forced to build a nest in an old tree for the night.\nThe following morning, the Greggs all find that, in a major reversal of their habits, three out of four of the ducks are holding the Greggs' hunting guns in their hands. Desperately, Mr. and Mrs. Gregg both persuade the ducks not to shoot them, but the mother duck (the only duck who never holds a gun) taunts them about their own fondness for shooting, especially since the previous day, they somehow shot all six of the duck's children. Mr. Gregg tells the duck mother to give up shooting and he destroys all three guns with a big hammer, swearing never to hurt another duck, deer, \"or anything else again\". The four ducks then head back toward the lake where they live, before letting the Greggs leave their tree. Then, the Greggs all find themselves returned to normal by magic.\nThe eight-year-old girl comes by the Greggs' farm to see that the Gregg family (now changing their surname to Egg) have fully changed their ways and are now feeding and caring for the birds. As Philip and William tell the girl their entire story, the sound of gunfire in the distance attracts the girl's attention, and she feels the Magic Finger charging up again.\n\n\nAdaptations\n\n\nAudio\nAn unabridged recording of the book read by Roald Dahl himself was released as part of a compilation set by Harper Children Audio. A 1980's version released by WM Collins features Anne Clements as narrator. The 2013 edition of the audiobook featured narration by Kate Winslet and was released on digital audio by Penguin Audio.\n\n\nAnimation\nThe story was adapted into an original video animation (OVA) by Abbey Broadcast Communications in 1990, which was released straight-to-video through Abbey Home Entertainment. It was a faithful adaption of the original story, which was told through Clements' audiobook recordings against animations in the style of Quentin Blake's illustrations. Re-releases from 1997 onwards redubbed Clements' narration with that of actress Caroline Quentin. For its 2005 DVD release, the original narration was reinstated.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Magic Finger title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=536678",
    "text": "The United Party was a political parliamentary party in New Zealand. It was founded in 1927, partly out of the remnants of the Liberal Party, and formed the United Government between 1928 and 1931, and the United–Reform coalition Government between 1931 and 1935. In 1936, it merged with the Reform Party to form the National Party.\n\n\nFoundation\nIn the 1920s the Liberal Party, although previously dominant in New Zealand party politics, seemed in serious long-term decline following the advent of the Reform Party in 1909 and the Labour Party in 1916, and its organisation had decayed to the point of collapse. The United Party represented an unexpected resurgence of the Liberals, and some historians consider it nothing more than the Liberal Party under a new name.\nThe United Party emerged from a faction of the decaying Liberal Party known as \"the National Party\"  (not directly related to the modern National Party, although it may have inspired the name).  George Forbes, a Liberal Party leader, led the faction. In November 1927, Forbes joined the National Party with Albert Davy’s newly formed \"United New Zealand Political Organisation\" outside of parliament. Albert Davy was a well-known and highly successful political party organiser, formerly for the Reform Party, the traditional opponent of the Liberals. The parliamentary National Party changed its name to the United Party in 1928 and Forbes initially continued to led the parliamentary party pending the further amalgamation of former Liberals later in 1928.  Bill Veitch (who led another faction of the Liberals, but who had once been involved with the labour movement) and his parliamentary movement joined with Forbes, Davy and the United Party in 1928. They hoped that the United Party would draw support not only from former Liberals, but from moderates on either the right or left of the Liberals by promoting themselves as a safer alternative than the Labour Party.\nIn September 1928, Forbes and Veitch both contested the leadership of the United Party, but eventually, Joseph Ward won the position. Although Ward, a former Liberal Prime Minister in 1906 – 1912, did not enjoy good health, Davy backed him as a compromise candidate and had invited him to contest the leadership.  Robert Masters was the chairman of the United Party from its formation.\nThe reversal of the party fortunes came largely in Auckland, where the big business group abandoned the Reform Party because of the handling of a licensing bill, and put forward a programme equally appealing to the business community and to the remnants of the Liberal Party. So 42,000 votes and five seats went to United, compared with 8,800 votes and no seats in the previous election.\n\n\nSuccess\n\nIn the 1928 elections, the new United Party performed surprisingly well, winning twenty-seven seats. The Reform Party also had twenty-seven seats, the Labour Party had nineteen, the Country Party had one, and independents held six. The United Party formed a government with the backing of the Labour Party, and Ward became Prime Minister again.\nThe United Party administration did not run particularly smoothly, however. Ward's ill health persisted, and he finally resigned in 1930. His deputy, George Forbes, became Prime Minister, though he had effectively been leading both the party and the government for some time before Ward's formal departure. Following the termination of A. E. Davy as chairman of the United New Zealand Political Organisation in early 1930, E. E. Hammond had become the chairman of United’s organisation outside of parliament.   Hammond who had previously been involved with the Reform Party, later went on to become involved with the New Zealand Legion, before becoming active in the National Political Federation and the New Zealand National Party.  \nAs prime minister and leader of the United Party from May 1930, Forbes faced serious economic problems, including the growing effects of the Great Depression. He did not project an image of activity or leadership — William Downie Stewart Jr, finance spokesman for Reform, privately described Forbes as \"apathetic and fatalistic\", and suggested that although he had \"a rotten job\", Forbes was really simply marking time.\n\n\nCoalition\n\nIn 1931 the United government passed a number of economic measures which appeared unfavourable to workers, and the Labour Party withdrew its support. The United Party continued in office with reluctant support from the Reform Party, which feared that a collapse of government (and thus a general election) would see large gains for Labour. Later the same year, formal coalition talks took place between United, Reform, and Labour, with a \"unity government\" proposed to counter the depression. Labour eventually walked out of the talks, but Reform leader Gordon Coates (pressed by Downie Stewart) eventually agreed to form a coalition between United and Reform. Forbes, backed by dissident members of Reform, won the leadership of the coalition government, but Downie Stewart of Reform became the Minister of Finance.\nIn the 1931 elections, the coalition worked in close co-operation and won fifty-one out of the eighty seats. United and Reform between them had held a few more seats before, but their combined tally exceeded what many had anticipated in light of the economic conditions.  The government did not exhibit great stability, however — particularly strong tensions arose between Coates and Downie Stewart, who clashed over the best response to the country's economic problems. Coates eventually won, and Stewart resigned. Coates, as the new Minister of Finance, became increasingly powerful, and the weary Forbes did not strongly oppose Coates's influence; while Forbes remained Prime Minister, Coates effectively led the government. The economic situation persisted.\nIn the 1935 elections, United and Reform maintained their coalition. Anger at the country's ongoing economic problems remained high, however, and many saw Forbes and Coates as jointly responsible for the situation. In addition, Albert Davy had founded a new \"anti-socialist\" party, the Democrats, which took votes away from the coalition. Forbes, still the nominal leader of the coalition, appeared tired and apathetic. These factors all added up to a decisive defeat of the coalition, which won only 19 seats–including only seven for United–to Labour's 53. Michael Joseph Savage became New Zealand's first Labour Prime Minister.\n\n\nMerger\nUnited and Reform maintained their coalition while in opposition. In 1936 they decided to make the coalition permanent and to merge United and Reform into a single party. The new organisation took the name of \"the National Party\", and – along with Labour – became one of New Zealand's two dominant political parties from that point on.\n\n\nParliamentary Leaders\n\nKey:\n  United\n  Reform\n  Labour\nPM: Prime Minister\nLO: Leader of the Opposition\n\n\nElectoral results\n\n†Total Coalition vote.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\nGustafson, Barry (1986).

    "text": "Malaysia–Russia relations (Malay: Hubungan Malaysia–Rusia; Jawi: هوبوڠن مليسيا–روسيا; Russian: Малайзийско-российские отношения Malayziysko-rossiyskiye otnosheniya) are the bilateral foreign relations between the two countries, Malaysia and Russia. Russia has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur (from April 1968), and Malaysia has an embassy in Moscow (from November 1968).\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nColonial era\n\nAs part of World War I, the Russian cruiser Zhemchug was sunk by the German cruiser SMS Emden off Penang in the British Straits Settlements. Some Malay fishermen risked their own lives to rescue any surviving crewmen from the cruiser.\n\n\nSoviet era\n\nThe Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with Malaysia on 3 April 1967 along with the signing of a trade agreement. Following the opening of official trade relations between the two countries, the Soviet Trade Representation was established in November 1967. In 1970, the first group of Soviet students came to study Malay at the University of Malaya, among them Tatiana Dorofeeva, Tamara Reshetova, Victor A. Pogadaev and Anatoly Voronkov.\n\nTies between the two suffered when Malaysia declared its support for Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen against the Soviet invasion to prop-up the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan throughout the 1980s. Malaysia also joined the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics as part of their opposition of the invasion of a fellow Islamic country. Throughout the Cold War, relations between Malaysia and the Soviet Union were tense over the latter's role in the Vietnam War and Soviet intervention in the Indian Ocean, which Malaysia felt could lead to the fulfillment of the domino theory, as the nation struggled with three communists insurgency itself; the Malayan Emergency, Second Malayan Emergency and the Sarawak Communist Insurgency.\nHowever, relations between the two recovered following the end of the Soviet-Afghan war, and both countries worked to repair diplomatic, economic, and military ties under Mikhail Gorbachev and Mahathir Mohamad. Several Malaysian Prime Ministers have made official visits to Moscow throughout the Cold War, including Tun Abdul Razak in 1972 and Mahathir Mohamad in 1985 and 1987. Diplomatic relations between Malaysia and the Soviet Union were maintained until the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.\n\n\nPost Soviet Union\n\n \nIn the modern times, several visits have been made between leaders of respective countries. Tuanku Ja'afar, the then-Yang di-Pertuan Agong, or King of Malaysia made an unofficial visit to St. Petersburg in May 1997. In 1999, Mahathir made a working visit to the Russian regions of Khabarovsk Krai and Buryatia. Another visit by Mahathir to Moscow was made in 2002. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC Summits) in Brunei (November 2000) and Shanghai (October 2001) and Group of Eight (G8 Summit) in Evian (June 2003), there were informal meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir.\nPutin visited Malaysia twice in 2003 (one as an official visit in August) and to attend the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Summit in October. During his official visit, Putin conferred the Order of Friendship to Mahathir in recognition of his contribution to strengthening the friendly ties between the two countries and to the cause of global stability and inter-religious accord while a contract was signed to supply the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) with 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter aircraft. Another visit from Malaysia was made by Tuanku Sirajuddin in September 2005. Putin participated in the first Russia-ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur and had a bilateral meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in December 2005. Abdullah later made an official visit to Moscow in June 2007. Mahathir considered Russia to become a future rival to the United States and Israel and praised Putin for criticizing and standing up to American and Western interference in other sovereign states.\nIn 2012, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak met Putin during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Russia to expand trade relations and to discover other opportunities for business partnership. Another meeting was held in 2016 with the intention to expand trade, including establishing direct flights and exploring a free trade agreement (FTA) to enhance bilateral trade and tourist arrivals.\nIn 2014, an Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur Malaysia Airlines plane crashed in the Russian-occupied area of Ukraine after it was shot at. The majority of people on board were Malaysians, though there were also other nationalities. No one survived. A few years later, a Dutch court found three Russian agents two Russian nationals and one Ukrainian defector guilty. However, it is unlikely that they will ever serve their sentences.\nOn early August 2019 the Russian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur was one of those affected by two online bomb threats which were posted on Twitter; the other being KL Sentral which is the capital city's transport hub. The aforementioned threats were posted via a hacked account by an individual calling himself \"limzhengyan\"; as a result the Malaysian police has carried out a search on those locations and determined that the threats were phony, although incidentally on the same day an incomplete improvised explosive device was found at the Bukit Damansara area.\nYears later, Mahathir (now out of public office at such point in time) turned against Putin and went on to criticize and condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine after 24 February 2022, stating that \"the Malaysian government cannot be supporting those who would utilize war and aggression as a justification to resolve conflicts between two opposing countries\" and \"Today we have witnessed that Russia has used war to capture and solve problems, we cannot support those who use war as a weapon to a solution,\" he added. \"Any dispute or rivalry between two governments should be resolved through negotiations, courts of law... that is the best way, not war. Russia seems to be doing the opposite when it comes to using the military to resolve their dispute with Ukraine.\"\n\n\nEconomic relations\n\nIn 2012, around 40,000 Russian tourists visited Malaysia, and the Malaysian government expressed its intent to further increase the number of Russian tourists through the establishment of direct flights between the two countries. Trade between the two countries in 2016 valued around US$2.2 billion. On 15 March 2016, a Russian-Malaysian business council was established with the intent to strengthen cooperation on economic, scientific, technological issues and culture.\n\n\nSecurity relations and collaboration in science field\nOn 19 May 2007, Allahyarham Jamaluddin Jarjis then Malaysia's Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation announced that two Malaysian candidates for astronauts (Faiz Khaleed and Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor) will undergo training in Moscow as part of a billion-dollar deal for 18 Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets. These astronauts brought along cancer cells, bacteria and protein for studies in space. One of the two candidates, Sheikh Muszaphar succeeded in the training and was sent to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Angkasawan program for the Malaysian National Space Agency (MNSA) and the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). The mission was a success and Sheikh Muszaphar became the first Malaysian national to travel to space. In 2016, Malaysia acknowledged Russia's strength in the military and aerospace sector and sought their help in the expansion of those sectors in Malaysia. In 2018, Russia set a branch office of the Russian Centre of Science and Culture (RCSC) in Kota Kinabalu to expand the existing co-operation between Malaysia and Russia in the fields of economy, culture and science.\nIn October 2024, corvettes Aldar Tsydenzhapov, Gromkiy and Rezkiy, along with replenishment oiler Pechanga, docked in George Town where the crews attended a ceremony to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the Battle of Penang. The following month in 20 November, the Russian Navy's Project 636.3 Ufa diesel-electric submarine and rescue tug Alatau made a business call at the port of Kota Kinabalu where both the Russian and Malaysian navies are set to conduct the PASSEX joint drills in the South China Sea.\n\n\nPublic opinion\nIn June 2022, a public opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 47% of Malaysians had a favourable view of Russia while 30% of Malaysians had a somewhat unfavourable view of Russia and 20% had a very unfavourable view of Russia, making it the only country surveyed where majority of Malaysian expresses their confidence on Russia and its leader.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nEmbassy of Malaysia in Moscow\nEmbassy of the Russian Federation in Malaysia",

    "title": "Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=10063963",
    "text": "Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary, named after the creek that divides the sanctuary north to south, is a 150-acre (0.61 km2) privately managed wildlife sanctuary located in Mecosta County, Michigan, near the city of Big Rapids. The objective of the sanctuary is to enhance the habitat of the sanctuary for the benefit of the fish and wildlife which live within or migrate through the sanctuary.\n\n\nLand\nThe terrain at Enzo Creek is incredibly diverse. From non-tidal marsh to mature northern hardwoods, the land is fertile and nurtures a healthy vibrant ecosystem.\nThe landscape is rolling in elevation, and no less than 13 soil types are found throughout. Rocky deposits are found throughout Enzo Creek, a result of Michigan's last glacial retreat about 14,000 years ago. It is the sanctuary's diversity of habitat that is the foundation upon which Enzo Creek's wildlife management plan has found success.\nThe mineral and oil composition of Enzo Creek is largely unknown, although areas of Mecosta County are known to have abundant reserves of crude oil.\n\n\nWater\nEnzo Creek's water resources are a key ingredient to its unique ecosystem. \n\nFour highly eutrophic ponds are located on the property. Most are no more than three feet deep, and were formed as a result of beavers damming flowing water. The largest body of water is Townline Lake, which is 73 acres (300,000 m2) in size.  The sanctuary has nearly 1/4 mile frontage on the Southwest shore of the lake.\nHunt Lake is 10 acres (40,000 m2) in size and has an 11-acre (45,000 m2) area of flooded timber at the north end of the lake which is known as Hunt Marsh. Hunt Marsh is a result of this same beaver activity creating the impoundment blocking Enzo Creek, the only outlet to Hunt Lake.  Hunt Lake has a maximum depth of 30 feet (9.1 m), and visibility generally exceeds 5 feet (1.5 m), despite a marl substrate.\nEnzo Creek, the creek for which the sanctuary owes its name, flows South and Easterly and joins the outlet to Townline Lake.  Enzo Creek flows approximately 1.3 miles from its beginning at Hunt Lake before it joins Ryan Creek, which then flows into the Muskegon River watershed.\nBeaver Pipes were installed in 2009 by Enzo Creek's management to help control the water level in Hunt Marsh, which had been steadily growing since 2005.  This method of water control proved to be ineffective as beavers were able to block water passage through the pipes.  The beaver pipes were ultimately removed completely, and a much larger 20\" culvert pipe was installed through the dam and encased with hog wire fencing to prevent beavers from stuffing the pipe full of timber to block water passage.  Over the course of a single year, beavers were able to dam the area around the hog wire fencing and again gain control of the water level.  Work is ongoing to try and reach a permanent solution to water level control on Hunt Lake.\n\nNehmer Lake is also accessible from the sanctuary.  It is approximately 8 acres (32,000 m2) in size, and although shallower than Hunt Lake, it has a littoral zone of flooded timber along its margins.  The maximum depth is unknown.\n\n\nFlora\nThe flora found at Enzo Creek have yet to be comprehensively inventoried, as the project would be a colossal undertaking. Tree types include deciduous species such as pin oak, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, aspen, ash, birch, cherry, apple, sassafras, American hornbeam, ironwood, and walnut trees. Coniferous species include jack pine, red pine, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, arborvitae, Scots pine, and blue spruce.\nSelective harvest of aspen was done in 2003 to improve habitat for ruffed grouse and other upland birds such as the wild turkey. Low impact selective harvest proved to be a successful project.\nSince 2006, several stands of conifers have been planted for future economic timber value and also to provide dense cover for several wildlife species.  Approximately 8,000 red pines were planted in a 2-acre (8,100 m2) stand primarily for future economic timber value and 1500 jack pine were planted in a fallow area with poor soil types suitable for jack pine but not conducive to forage plants to serve as a future area of dense cover for wildlife.\nThere are several other tree species including tamarack larch which is known as a deciduous conifer and hence loses its needles each autumn. Staghorn sumac is abundant in many areas of the sanctuary.\n\nElaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive) was planted in the 1950s under the recommendation of the then Michigan Department of Conservation (now the Michigan Department of Natural Resources), as the shrub was believed to be very beneficial to wildlife. It is now known to be invasive, and an 8-acre (32,000 m2) area was cut back in 2006 and converted to a hayland. \nWildflowers are found in every season except winter.  Cardinal flower, Indian paintbrush, touch-me-not, multiflora rose and trout lily serve only as examples.\nAquatic flora is abundant and diverse.  Wetland species such as narrow leaf cattails, horsetail, and giant reed are abundant.  The Hunt Marsh is covered with duckweed for several months in the summer where patches of white water lily can also be found.  Poison sumac is common in Hunt Marsh. Winterberry (also known as Michigan holly) is a colorful addition to Hunt Marsh in the winter when the marsh's greenery subsides in late fall.  It also provides an abundant forage base for many wild birds.\n\n\nFauna\nThe fauna found at Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary is as diverse as its flora.  It is the abundance of appropriate habitat which makes it possible to view wildlife within the sanctuary.  On any given day, one may see white-tailed deer, fox, bobcat,  wild turkey, cottontail rabbit, squirrels (eastern, red, and fox), coyote, raccoon, porcupine, ruffed grouse, and ring-necked pheasant.\nA black bear sighting is not impossible, as black bear have been observed on the sanctuary on multiple occasions.  Most recently, in May 2023, a black bear became a regular visitor and was observed on trail cameras taking a fondness to a honey bee hive causing several hundred dollars damage and destroying multiple colonies.  In 2007, the Michigan Department  of Natural Resources extended the range for bear hunting to include Mecosta County due in part to their sustainable abundance. [2].\nThe most recent species of interest to be identified at Enzo Creek is the northern flying squirrel as a pair was seen gliding from tree to tree in November 2011.\nThe abundance of wildlife is spectacular at the Sanctuary.  It is the waterfowl habitat that makes Enzo Creek so unique.  In autumn, when waterfowl are migrating, Hunt Marsh and Hunt Lake are home to many species of waterfowl.  Most abundant are wood duck, mallards, Canada geese, and teal. Loons also take up residence on Hunt Lake, and their presence is known by their unique cry at twilight, although the birds prefer Townline Lake (located 600 ft (180 m) to the east of Enzo Creek) due to its size.\nDue to the abundance of waterfowl, Ducks Unlimited conducted extensive research on mallard nesting success at Enzo Creek in 2003.  As part of the study, 60 mallard hens were decoy trapped in the early spring and surgically implanted with transmitters. Hens were followed via telemetry from the time of implantation to either 30 days after their brood hatch, complete brood loss, or death. Data from this study was instrumental in helping Ducks Unlimited revise their management plan for Great Lakes mallard populations.\nIn 2006 one wood duck nesting box was installed at Enzo Creek, and a resident hen successfully hatched two ducklings while taking up residence.  In 2007, two additional nesting boxes were installed to help provide optimal nesting habitat.  In October 2007 a check was made on one of the nesting boxes installed in the spring, and there was no sign of nesting activity.  It is speculated that the abundance of other natural nesting habitat precluded it from use.\nHunt Marsh is also home to the great blue heron, the largest in the heron family with a wing span of seven feet. Kingfishers are observed on a frequent basis as they ambush fish, a staple in their diet.\nHunt Marsh would not exist without the activity of the world's second-largest rodent: the beaver.  Beaver remain very active in the marsh and any novice can identify their trademark \"stump\" left behind.  Muskrat are also abundant and seen traveling throughout the lakes, ponds, marsh and even Enzo Creek.\n\nThe northern river otter is also prevalent on Hunt Lake and Hunt Marsh.  Able to swim for nearly a mile underwater when disturbed, they often seem to disappear without a trace..  When observed, they are without question one of the most amazing creatures to observe as they are often socially playful with one another.  Of special note is the river otter's acute sensitivity to any form of environmental pollution, as it generally vacates any area with tainted water quality very quickly.  Their existence at Enzo Creek is a testament to the water quality within the nature sanctuary\nEnzo Creek is home to the Blanding's turtle, which is threatened and even endangered within its range.  These turtles do not reach sexual maturity until they are 18–20 years old and may live to be as old as 70 years.  \n\nThe common snapping turtle can be found in the spring nesting in sandy areas of the preserve.  Rarely do they pose a threat if encountered in water, but on land they can be very aggressive if disturbed.\nAnother common amphibian is the Blue-spotted salamander which often uses leaf litter and underbrush as a hideout.\nHunt Lake harbors a vibrant fishery.  The northern pike is at the top of the food chain, and considering it is such a small body of water, Hunt's pike are in balance with the forage available in the lake.  Most are in the 3–5 year class, but much older fish are also found. Largemouth bass are also part of the food pyramid, but to a much lesser extent. Bluegill, yellow perch, and emerald shiner make up the bulk of the forage base.  A complete fishery survey had not yet been completed as of 2007.  Strangely, a four-year-old muskellunge was identified in Hunt Lake in 2006, and it unclear if this fish was the sole representative of its species or if a small reproductive population exists.\nNehmer Lake is similar in resources as Hunt Lake.  Hybrid sunfish have been stocked on several occasions. However, their survival in abundance has been curtailed due to predation by northern pike.\nIt is not uncommon to view an American bald eagle soaring low over Hunt Lake or Hunt Marsh. Bald eagles often hunt over the Muskegon River, which is located approximately 1-mile (1.6 km) west of Enzo Creek.  Evidence of nesting activity at Enzo Creek was recently observed with the first sighting of a nest under construction in August 2009.\nIn this same survey, several migratory bufflehead were viewed waddling in a pool below one of Hunt Marsh's several beaver dams.  Bufflehead are arguably one of the most colorful species of waterfowl which pass through Enzo Creek each spring and fall.  En route from the bird's southern winter range to Canada's boreal forest to nest, they are vulnerable to predation by the bald eagle.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

Some versions of the myths describe them as spirits who had died unbaptised or unmarried, or had drowned themselves following an unrequited love.

The women occupy the centre mid-ground of the painting and are lit from high above the left hand of the canvas, presumably by the moon. The source of light throws shadow inconsistently.\nMost of the women are huddled together in a row, while some are at the edge of the bank or alone to the right seemingly lost in their own thoughts. In the left foreground the last of Kramskoi's rusalki is emerging from among the reeds, while in the background one of the women wrings out the water from her hair. The water bank is at the foot of a steep hill and surrounded by deep forest to the right. At the top of the small hill and to the right background is a small, seemingly unoccupied cabin. The subject matter and composition is likely to have been influenced by the work of the Hungarian painter and designer Hans Makart.\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Keiji Inafune (稲船 敬二, Inafune Keiji; born 8 May 1965) is a Japanese video game producer, character designer, game designer, and businessman. In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.\nStarting his career at Capcom in the late 1980s, his job was as an artist and illustrator. The first two games he worked on were the original Street Fighter and Mega Man in 1987. He was then a character designer and planner of the Mega Man series during the NES and Super NES era. For Mega Man X, he created and designed the character Zero.\nInafune then moved onto the position of producer with his first title being Mega Man 8 in 1996. In addition to being the producer for Mega Man X4, the three Mega Man Legends games, the Mega Man Zero series, the Mega Man Battle Network and Mega Man Star Force series and Mega Man ZX and Advent, Inafune was also a producer of the Lost Planet, Dead Rising and Onimusha series. In 2006, he was promoted to Senior Corporate Officer of Research & Development. In 2010, he became Global Head of Production at Capcom.\nHe left Capcom in late 2010, and later founded his own companies Comcept, and Intercept. He also became Representative Director of DiNG, a mobile game studio. Intercept worked on the game Kaio: King of Pirates which was announced in 2011 and cancelled in 2015. While at Comcept, Inafune oversaw work on such games as Mighty No. 9, Soul Sacrifice, and the unreleased Red Ash: The Indelible Legend.  In 2017, Comcept was purchased and became a subsidiary of Level-5, becoming Level-5 Comcept. In March 2025, it was revealed that Inafune left Level-5 after 7 years in the company.\n\n\nEarly life\nInafune was born in Kishiwada, Osaka in 1965. He received a degree in graphic design in 1987 from the Osaka Designers' College.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nEarly\nSoon after graduating, the 22-year-old Inafune joined the Capcom corporation in 1987, in search of a job as an illustrator. Inafune had initially wanted to join Konami, but Capcom was much closer. In many early game credits at Capcom, he is credited under the name \"INAFKING\", which he got by combining the name \"Snufkin\" from the anime series Moomin with his own name. The first two titles Inafune worked on at Capcom was Mega Man (known in Japan as \"Rockman\") for the Famicom and the original Street Fighter for arcades, both of which were released in 1987. For Street Fighter, Inafune drew character portraits for the game.\nFor Mega Man, Inafune designed several minor enemy characters, and also designed the boss character \"Elec Man\", who was the first original game character that Inafune designed. Inafune had tried to design him as if he was a character an American comic series such as Spider-Man or X-Men. Inafune also drew the Japanese box art and promotional illustrations and worked on in-game animations and pixel art. Director Akira Kitamura created the original static pixel art sprite for Rock Man (later called \"Mega Man\" outside of Japan). This was to ensure that the sprite could be properly seen against the game's backgrounds, and could work in the game. After that, the pixel art was handed over to artist Inafune, who created a refined illustration of the character. Inafune refers to this process as \"like a reverse character design\" as it is the opposite of what typically occurs, where artists create concept art which is then translated into game's graphics. During a special event at TGS 2007, Inafune clarified his role in the creation of Mega Man.\n\nI'm often called the father of Mega Man, but actually, his design was already created when I joined Capcom,\" he explained. \"My mentor [Capcom senior member Akira Kitamura], who was the designer of the original Mega Man, had a basic concept of what Mega Man was supposed to look like. So I only did half of the job in creating him.\"\nThe first Mega Man game was released in December 1987, after which sales in both countries were decent, but as Inafune later notes, \"While it did sell more than we had expected, [Rockman 1] wasn't a huge success as far as the numbers go.\"\nAkira Kitamura suggested to create a contest to solicit designs from fans for Robot Masters for Mega Man games. The first game to do this was Mega Man 2 and it was Inafune's job to turn those winning designs into finished professional designs.\nStarting with Mega Man 3, Inafune was not only doing character designs, he was also heavily involved in the game design aspects of the series. However, Inafune considers Mega Man 3 to be one of his least favorite Mega Man games. From an interview with Nintendo Power in the October 2007 issue, Inafune explained that the reason was because of \"...what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game.\" He also stated that the team was forced to put the game out before they thought it was ready and that during the game's production, the developers had lost the main planner, Inafune having to take his position. Inafune concluded, \"I knew that if we had more time to polish it, we could do a lot of things better, make it a better game, but the company (Capcom) said that we needed to release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different.\"\nInafune also designed the original boss characters for the Mega Man titles on the Game Boy. These included Enker from Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, Punk from Mega Man III, and Ballade from Mega Man IV, also known as the \"Mega Man Killers\".\nCapcom set on the development on a new series for the Super NES, Mega Man X, which continued the plot of the original series, but set a darker tone and took place 100 years after the previous storyline. Inafune designed the character Zero for the games as well as two of the bosses: Chill Penguin and Storm Eagle. \"I didn't get to completely design a Mega Man [protagonist] from scratch until Zero (Mega Man X, SNES). Back when the SNES was coming out, I was asked to give Mega Man a redesign, so I created this character. But I realized that this design wouldn't be accepted as Mega Man, so I had another designer create the new Mega Man, and I worked on Zero to release him as the 'other main character' that would steal all the good scenes!\"\nInafune contributed some designs for Mega Man 7, which was released in 1995. He designed the character of Auto, as well as the initial sketches for two new characters named  \"Baroque\" and \"Crush\". These characters were handed over to Hayato Kaji who finished the design, and they became known as Bass and Treble.\n\n\nProducer\nLong time producer Tokuro Fujiwara, departed Capcom. Inafune was then made producer for the next Mega Man title, Mega Man 8 in 1996. After an internal restructure at Capcom, Inafune became the general manager of Capcom Production Studio 2 in 1998. He produced the three-dimensional Mega Man Legends series after receiving requests from Sony to develop a new 3D Mega Man series exclusively for the PlayStation. Although he envisioned high sales and was an ambitious supporter to the development of the game, it was not a massive success and Inafune likens it to a \"clumsy son\". Inafune says it was quite difficult to promote the game, as there was little media interest in yet another Mega Man title. Inafune was a promotion producer for Resident Evil 2, which in contrast to Mega Man Legends, had huge interest and was an easy game to sell.\nOriginally, Inafune had intended to end the series with Mega Man X5, stating, \"I had very little to do with X5. I just told the team to 'finish off the series with this title,' and left it at that. That's why the game itself has a real feel of finality to it.\" Instead, he became co-producer for the new Mega Man game that Inti Creates had been commissioned to develop, and requested that they make Zero the main character. However, Capcom chose to continue the X series without him, extending it to Mega Man X8.\nInafune also developed another series, the samurai-era Japanese themed Onimusha, which has spawned various sequels.\nKeiji Inafune was producer for the Mega Man Battle Network series, which is set outside the continuity of the rest of the Mega Man story lines and introduced role-playing and strategic elements. According to Inafune, he received the basis for creating the series from observing his son. Inafune contributed the Battle Network redesign of Punk from Mega Man III, and he says it took quite a bit of convincing for the artists to let him do it, and even then they made additional changes to Inafune's redesign.\n\n\nSenior Corporate Officer\nIn 2006 Inafune was promoted from corporate officer to senior corporate officer. Inafune and his team's next creation was Dead Rising for the Xbox 360. Dead Rising, initially started as a sequel to Shadow of Rome, with the same team members, before changing story, setting, and time period. The game is a zombie-slaying game heavily influenced by George A. Romero's 1978 movie Dawn of the Dead. It was released by Capcom in the U.S. on August 8, 2006.\nInafune became acquainted with Ben Judd when he was working on Dead Rising. After this, Judd would often act as a translator for Inafune in public events.\nInafune was a producer for Inti Creates' game Mega Man ZX, and the sequel title Mega Man ZX Advent.\nInafune had the idea of going back to the simple gameplay of the original Mega Man series, and was a producer for the game Mega Man 9. The game was developed by Inti-Creates along with Capcom, and Inafune contributed two designs for the project: Splash Woman and Plug Man. The game was followed up by a similar sequel, Mega Man 10 in 2010.\nInafune was a producer for the Dead Rising 2, and opted to hire Canadian developer Blue Castle Games as a developer rather than having it developed in-house at Capcom like the first game was. The game was released in 2010. In addition, he made his director debut in the short film series Zombrex: Dead Rising Sun.\nThe last mainline Street Fighter game was Street Fighter EX3 in 2000, and there was reluctance at Capcom to release another numeric entry in the series. Producer Yoshinori Ono pitched Street Fighter IV to Inafune, who was head of R&D at the time. Inafune approved the project, due to the positive reception to Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting on Xbox Live Arcade and fans interest. Street Fighter IV was released first in arcades in Japan in 2008, and then on home consoles in 2009. The original console version of SFIV went on to sell 3.4 million copies.\nOn April 22, 2010, it was announced that Inafune would be Capcom's Global Head of Production. Inafune stated \"I want to end comments that Capcom games made in Europe aren't really Capcom games ... basically saying that whether games are created in America or Japan or anywhere in the world, I will be the one overlooking it and so it will have that Capcom flavor that fans know and love.\"\n\n\nModern Japanese games\nInafune has voiced various negative views on modern Japanese game developers, stating that they are behind Western developers in innovation. At the 2009 Tokyo Game Show while promoting Dead Rising 2, and speaking through his translator and Capcom employee Judd, Inafune stated \"Personally when I looked around [at] all the different games at the TGS floor, I said 'Man, Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished.'\" He also said \"“I look around Tokyo Games Show, and everyone’s making awful  games; Japan is at least five years behind.”\nIn 2012, Inafune defended Phil Fish's statements criticizing modern Japanese video games, saying: \"It's very severe, but very honest. Unless Japanese people feel embarrassed from the experience of getting harsh comments, saying [new games] could have been better is not an opinion they would take seriously. When they're embarrassed and they feel obliged to change, it would make a difference.\" In 2012 at the Game Developer's Conference in San Francisco, Inafune again disparaged the state of Japanese gaming. He said, \"Back in the day Japanese games were used to winning and were used to success. We celebrated all sorts of victories. However at some point these winners became losers. Not accepting that fact has led to the tragic state of Japanese games today.\"\n\n\nComcept, Intercept, Ding\nOn October 29, 2010, Inafune announced on his blog that he would be leaving Capcom with the intention of \"starting his life over\". He had been with the company for 23 years. In an interview with 4Gamer he stated \"The reason why I'm quitting is basically because I think that the game industry itself must change the way it goes about making games,\". He cited that job security creates complacency among staff, and big budgets with very large staff, as problems with current Japanese game companies.\nOn December 15, 2010, Inafune launched a new company called Comcept, based in Osaka. Comcept was a design and production studio, which does not develop games internally, but rather pairs up with studios to co-develop them, and was to work on media outside of games. In January 2011, he launched another new company called Intercept, based in Tokyo. Intercept was focused on game development.  Inafune's guiding philosophy behind Comcept was to work on multiple games at once, work on ideas they themselves created, and to have flexibility of doing multiple genres. Inafune cites the need for flexibility as being necessary for the company to survive. During his time at Comcept, he was often given the credit of \"Conceptor\" on the games he has worked on.\nIn December 2011, Inafune became Representative Director of DiNg, a smartphone game developer.\nIntercept began work on the game Kaio: King of Pirates, in 2012. Set for a release on the 3DS console, it was a pirate themed game starring loosely based on Journey to the West. The game was cancelled in 2015 by its publisher Marveolous Inc and they lost 461 million yen (roughly US$3.8 million) on the project.\nInafune has made several cameo appearances in games. In the 2011 game Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, a scanned image of Inafune himself makes an appearance as a summon for the main character Nepgear during a special attack. Comcept was a co-developer along with Idea Factory on the otome game Sweet Fuse: At Your Side. The protagonist of Sweet Fuse is Saki Inafune, a fictitious niece of Inafune. Inafune appears in the game with his likeness and name, with his kidnapping serving as a plot device.\nYaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z was a collaboration between Comcept, Team Ninja and Spark Unlimited and it is a spin-off of the Ninja Gaiden series. Released in 2014 it received both poor sales and reviews. Inafune says poor timing is to blame for the sales, as players were transitioning to the PlayStation 4 console, and defends the title saying it had good gameplay.\nOn August 31, 2013, Inafune started a Kickstarter project for a game Comcept and Inti-Creates were working on that is a spiritual successor to Mega Man series, known as Mighty No. 9.\nAfter multiple delays, the game was released in 2016 and was met with a mixed critical reception. A livestream on the Twitch platform was done during the release of the game. Speaking through his agent and translator Judd, Inafune said: \"You know, I want to word this in a way to explain some of the issues that come with trying to make a game of this size on multiple platforms.\" adding \"I'm kind of loath to say this because it's going to sound like an excuse and I don't want to make any excuses. I own all the problems that came with this game and if you want to hurl insults at me, it's totally my fault. I'm the key creator. I will own that responsibility.\" Judd added that he thought the game's problems stemmed from doing all the ports of the game and the base game at the same time, and that they had under-estimated the amount of work the project would require.\nInafune is an advisor for Inflexion Point Capital, who announced in 2014 that they would be giving out seed investments of 100 to 500 thousand to Japanese mobile developers.\nAt Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 it was announced the Inafune was working with Armature Studio to make a new video game for the Xbox One called ReCore. On July 4, 2015 Inafune announced that he was once again using Kickstarter to fund a Mega Man Legends spiritual successor along with an anime based on the game called Red Ash, which failed to reach its funding goal.\n\n\nLevel-5 and Rocket Studio\nIn June 2017, Comcept was purchased by Level-5 and became Level-5 Comcept, with Inafune becoming its chief communications officer. In May 2022, Inafune announced an NFT project called Beastroid inspired by the Mega Man series. \nIn March 2025, Level-5 announced that Inafune left Level-5 Comcept in 2024 with the company being repurposed as the Level-5 Inc. Osaka Office. Inafune then became an executive officer of Rocket Studio.\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nCanceled games\nMega Man Legends 3 – Executive producer\nRed Ash: The Indelible Legend – Executive producer, concept\nKaio: King of Pirates – Project lead\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nInline",

Davies taught at Christ's Hospital in Horsham, Sussex from 1971 to 1974 when he took up a post with the Sports Council for Wales.\n\n\nRugby career\nDavies played club rugby for Cardiff RFC and London Welsh. He captained Cardiff for three seasons in the 1970s, including a 1977–78 Welsh Cup game against Pontypool when he scored four tries (beating his marker and near namesake Gareth Davies on each occasion) to earn his side a 16–11 win.\nHe made his international debut on Saturday, 3 December 1966 against Australia in Cardiff, where Wales lost 14–11. He was to face the Wallabies again in his final appearance for Wales in 1978, this time in Sydney, again a loss. All in all, he was capped 46 times for his country. Davies was switched from his original position of centre to the right wing by Wales coach Clive Rowlands on their 1969 tour of Australia and New Zealand, and thereafter played in that position.\nDavies toured with the British Lions in 1968 and 1971 and was part of the group of Welsh 70s legends, ranking in rugby history alongside Gareth Edwards, Barry John, J. P. R. Williams, Phil Bennett and Bobby Windsor. A superb attacking player, he has been called one of the best wingers rugby has ever seen. Davies is often remembered for a try – one of 20 in 46 Tests – in the 1971 Five Nations match against Scotland. The Scots were leading before Davies scored in the corner in the last minute. Backrower John Taylor then kicked his famous conversion to steal victory.\nInvited to join the 1974 Lions Tour of South Africa, Davies turned the opportunity down on his personal uncomfortable position at the consequences and realities of apartheid.\n\n\nWelsh & Lions Honours summary\nFor Wales: 46 Internationals, of which Wales won 29, lost 14 and drew 3 (points for 758, points against 507). 20 tries, 8 of them before the value of a try was raised to four points in the 1971–72 season (72 points in all).\nFor the British Lions: 5 Internationals of which the Lions won two, lost two and drew one (points for 54, points against 53). Davies scored three tries for the Lions during Test games, all of them on the 1971 tour to New Zealand (9 points).\n\n\nAfter retirement\nAfter retiring as a player, Davies became a journalist, writing on rugby matters for The Times. He sat on Tasker Watkins committee to reform Welsh rugby. He became chairman of the Wales Youth Agency, and in the 2003 New Year Honours he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \"for services to Young People and to Rugby in Wales.\"\nDavies holds Honorary Fellowships from the University of Wales, Lampeter; the University of Wales, Aberystwyth; and Wrexham Glyndŵr University. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from Cardiff University in a graduation ceremony held on 15 July 2008. On 18 July 2008, he received an honorary doctorate from Loughborough University for services to sport and journalism, and has also received an honorary doctorate from Swansea University. He was also appointed a Deputy Lieutenant (DL) of Gwent in 1998.\nIn November 2007 he was announced as the manager of the 2009 British & Irish Lions tour to South Africa. Davies was elected to the post of President of the Welsh Rugby Union in September 2019 and took up the role in November 2019. In October 2023, Davies was replaced as President of the WRU by former Director of Rugby, Terry Cobner. Davies was knighted in the 2025 New Year Honours \"for services to Rugby Union, and to voluntary and charitable service in Wales\".\n\n\nBibliography\nDavies, Gerald (1979).

    "text": "Sergio Martínez vs. Miguel Cotto was a professional boxing match contested on June 7, 2014, for the WBC, The Ring and TBRB middleweight championship.\n\n\nBackground\nAfter making his 6th defence of the middleweight title against Martin Murray in April 2013, Martínez had inactive for more than a year and had two separate surgeries performed on his right knee.\nIn February 2014, it was announced that former 2 division champion Miguel Cotto would move up to middleweight in order to challenge him for the titles on June 7, 2014, at Madison Square Garden. A catchweight of 159 pounds was set for this bout.\nCotto was a 9/5 favourite to win.\n\n\nThe fight\nIn front of 21,090 at the Garden, Cotto would knock Martínez down 3 times in the first round, with Martinez's legs having knee braces on and clearly visible. After the first round however, the champion began to make the fight more competitive with Cotto. He continued to fight back until round nine when Martínez went down once again. Following the ninth round, trainer Pablo Sarmiento decided to call off the fight prior to the tenth round while still in the corner, against the urging of Martínez. According to reports, Sarmiento told Martínez \"Champion, your knees are not responding. Sergio, look at me ... I'm gonna stop this one. Sergio, you are the best for me. You'll always be the best champion, Sergio.\" Throughout the fight, journalists and fans alike, noticed Martínez was unable to bend, flex and support his own weight while moving in the ring. Martínez himself proclaimed that his knee had nothing to do with the outcome of the fight and his struggles were a result of a body shot.\nAt the time of stoppage, all three judges had the fight 90–77 for Cotto. According to CompuBox Stats, Cotto landed 212 if 395 punches thrown and Martinez landed 100 of his 322 thrown.\n\n\nAftermath\nHighlights were shown on regular HBO a week later and averaged 970,000, peaking at 1.126 million. The fight generated $20 million from 350,000 buys on HBO PPV. This was considered a disappointment as HBO projected the fight would do around a 500,000 buyrate. Bob Arum, Cotto's promoter stated the reason for a downfall in PPV buys was simply because there was too many of them. Martinez's promoter Lou DiBella added that there was a lot events that same weekend, which would have impact on the boxing event. The promotion did however make a profit due to the $4.7 million live gate.\nFollowing the bout, Martínez stated that he wanted to continue his boxing career, and expressed his desire to fight against Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. However, on 13 June 2015, Martínez announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 40, stating that both aging and knee injuries were the causes for his decision.\n\n\nUndercard\nConfirmed bouts:\n\n\nBroadcasting\n\n\nReferences",

It is commonly known as \"Damkom\" (short for damouk'ideblobis k'omit'et'i, the Committee for Independence). The committee was responsible for the preparation and guidance of the abortive August Uprising of 1924.\nThe committee was formed early in May 1922 as a result of the negotiations of the Georgian Social Democrats (Mensheviks), a former ruling party in pre-Communist Georgia, with its erstwhile political opposition – the National Democratic Party, the Federalist Party, the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs) and the Skhivi (\"Beam\") Party. Each party was represented by one member in the Damkom (hence the organization's alternative name, the Parity Committee), which was traditionally chaired by a Menshevik. Gogita Paghava was the first chairman; he was shortly succeeded by Nikoloz Kartsivadze, who was arrested by the Soviet secret police, Cheka, on 16 March 1923, and was replaced with Kote Andronikashvili. Throughout its existence, the Secretary of the Damkom was Yason Javakhishvili of the National Democratic Party.\nThe accord signed by the members of the Damkom envisaged the overthrow of the Bolshevik regime through a nationwide uprising, restoration of the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the formation of a coalition government. The committee maintained close contacts with the Government of Georgia-in-exile though its \"Constantinople Bureau\" based in Istanbul, Turkey. The committee set up a military center chaired by the retired general Kote Abkhazi, who was to prepare for a popular insurrection. Several members of the former Menshevik government returned clandestinely from exile, including the former Minister of Agriculture, Noe Khomeriki, as well as the former commander of the People's Guard, Valiko Jugheli.\nThe Georgian Cheka, with recently appointed Deputy Chief Lavrentiy Beria playing a leading role, managed to penetrate the organization and carried out mass arrests. A heavy loss was sustained by the Georgian opposition in February 1923, when the military center was betrayed by Kote Misabishvili, a student member of the National-Democratic party. Fifteen members of the military center were arrested, among them the principal leaders of the resistance movement: Kote Abkhazi, Alexander Andronikashvili, Varden Tsulukidze, Colonel Giorgi Khimshiashvili, Simon Bagration-Mukhraneli, Elizbar Gulisashvili, and Rostom Muskhelishvili; they were executed on 20 May 1923. Khomeriki and Jugheli also fell in the hands of the Cheka and were subsequently shot. After some hesitation, the committee went ahead and laid plans for a general insurrection for 2.00 am 29 August 1924. The plan of the simultaneous uprising miscarried, however, and, through some misunderstanding, the mining town of Chiatura, western Georgia, rose in rebellion a day earlier, on 28 August.\nThe revolt continued for three weeks in several districts of Georgia and was crushed by the Red Army and Cheka forces. The suppression of the uprising was accompanied by large-scale repressions in which several thousands were killed. On 4 September the Cheka discovered the rebels' chief headquarters at the Shio-Mgvime Monastery near the town of Mtskheta, and arrested the leaders of the Damkom, including its chairman Andronikashvili. On the same day, Beria met them in Tiflis, and proposed to issue a declaration urging the partisans to put down their arms. The committee members, tied up and facing death themselves, accepted the proposal on the condition that an order to stop mass executions be given immediately. Beria agreed and the rebels signed the declaration in order to put an end to the bloodshed. The persecutions did not end, however, and the arrested opposition leaders themselves were shortly put to death. By mid-September, most of the Damkom's armed detachments had been destroyed and the uprising defeated.\n\n\nReferences\n\nვალერი ბენიძე (Valeri Benidze) (1991), 1924 წლის აჯანყება საქართველოში (1924 Uprising in Georgia).

    "text": "Sir Ronald Craufurd Ferguson (8 February 1773 – 10 April 1841), was a Scottish officer in the British Army and a Member of Parliament for the constituencies of Dysart Burghs and for Nottingham.\n\n\nBiography\nRonald was second son of William Ferguson Esq., of Raith, Fife, by Jane, daughter of Ronald Craufurd of Restalrig, sister of Margaret, countess of Dumfries, was born in Edinburgh on 8 February 1773. He was brother and heir presumptive to his brother the MP for Kirkcaldy.\nFerguson entered the British Army as an ensign in the 53rd Regiment of Foot on 3 April 1790, and was promoted lieutenant on 24 January 1791. He then paid a long visit to Berlin in order to study the Prussian system of discipline, and on his return he was promoted captain on 19 February 1793.\nIn this year, on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Ferguson's regiment, was despatched to Flanders, where it was brigaded with the 14th and 37th regiments under the command of Major-general Ralph Abercromby, who took particular notice of Ferguson, as a young Scot of singular bodily strength and activity. Ferguson served throughout the campaign of 1793, at the siege of Valenciennes, and in the battles which led to the Frederick, Duke of York's retreat from Dunkirk. In October 1793 the 53rd formed part of the garrison of Nieuwpoort, under the command of Lieutenant-general Sir Charles Grey, and during the constant fighting which took place in front of that town the 53rd was much engaged. Ferguson, who was wounded in the knee, was specially praised in despatches.\nIn the following year Ferguson left Flanders on being promoted major into the 84th Regiment of Foot on 31 May 1794, and on 18 September 1794, though only twenty-one, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and appointed to command the newly raised 2nd battalion of that regiment. He was at once ordered to India, and in 1795 his regiment was one of those which co-operated from India, under Major-general Sir Alured Clarke, in the reduction of the Cape of Good Hope.\nOn his return to India Ferguson was stationed at Cawnpore, and there married Jean, natural daughter of General Sir Hector Munro, in 1798. This marriage greatly increased his wealth and importance, and Ferguson found no difficulty in getting further employment.\nOn his return to England he was promoted colonel on 1 January 1800, and in that year he held a command in Major-general the Hon. Thomas Maitland's attack on Belle Isle, and in Sir James Pulteney's Ferrol Expedition. He was one of the officers who returned home in disgust at Pulteney's refusal to attack Ferrol.\nIn 1804 Ferguson was appointed brigadier-general commanding the York district, and in the following year he took command of the highland brigade, consisting of the 71st, 72nd, and 93rd highlanders, in the expedition sent under Sir David Baird to recapturethe Cape of Good Hope. He performed the difficult task of landing his brigade in the face of the Dutch troops and covering the disembarkation of the rest of the army, and by his conduct in the following engagements he won the repeated thanks of Sir David Baird. He was forced to leave the Cape by severe illness. On his return to England he was elected M.P. for the Dysart burghs in 1806, a seat which he held for twenty-four years.\nOn 25 April 1808 he was promoted major-general and later the same year he was appointed to command a brigade in the army under Sir Arthur Wellesley, destined for the assistance of the Portuguese, and at the landing of the expedition at the mouth of the Mondego he was placed in command of a brigade consisting of the 42nd and 78th regiments.\nAt the battle of Roliça Ferguson's brigade was employed upon the extreme left, and twice turned Laborde's right, after an advance along a difficult mountain road. At the great battle of Vimeiro it was posted on the left of the English army, and Ferguson had just begun to pursue Junot when he was checked by Sir Harry Burrard. Ferguson was spoken of in the highest terms in Sir Arthur Wellesley's despatch, and was thanked in his place in the House of Commons for his services. He also received a gold medal and was gazetted colonel of the Sicilian regiment on 25 January 1809.\nIn the parliamentary session of 1809 he distinguished himself by his speeches against the Frederick, Duke of York in the debates on the Clarke scandal. In spite of this, and of his advanced liberalism, he was nominated to a command in the force sent under Sir David Baird to join Sir John Moore in the Peninsula, but reached Corunna too late to be of any service.\nIn 1810 he was appointed second in command to the army in Cádiz, but was obliged by illness to return to England in a few months. On 4 June 1813 he was promoted lieutenant-general. In 1814 he acted for a short time as second in command to Sir Thomas Graham in Holland, and in the following year he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.\nFerguson never again saw service, but continued to sit for the Dysart Burghs until 1830, and throughout this period of Tory ascendancy, he sought a dilution of the power of the prelates: distinguished himself in the House of Commons by his decided liberalism. He was a consistent supporter of all measures tending to civil and religious liberty, an earnest advocate for Catholic emancipation, and both spoke and voted for the ballot and for triennial parliaments. He also called for a revision of income tax, and encouraged elementary schooling.\nOn 24 March 1828 he was transferred to the colonelcy of the 79th Cameron highlanders, on 22 July 1830 he was promoted general, and in 1831 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath at the coronation of William IV.\nHe was a member of the liberal clubs, the Athenaeum, and Reform Club.  In 1830 he was defeated for the representation of the Dysart burghs by the Tory candidate, Lord Loughborough, the eldest son of General the Earl of Rosslyn; but he was immediately elected for Nottingham, for which place he continued to sit until his death, at 5 Bolton Row, London, on 10 March 1841.  In the previous December he had succeeded to the family estate of Raith, on the death of his elder brother, Robert Ferguson, who had also for many years been a radical M.P., and he was succeeded in all his Scottish estates by his only son, Colonel Robert Ferguson(1802–1868), who sat for the Kirkcaldy Burghs from 1841 to 1862, and took the additional name of Munro on acceding to some of the estates of his grandfather, Sir Hector Munro, 8th Laird of Novar.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Stephens, Henry Morse (1889). \"Ferguson, Ronald Craufurd\".

    "text": "Ernest Joseph Blondlat (2 December 1862 – 22 August 1938) was a French divisional general who participated in World War I. During the war, he was a commander of the 2nd Colonial Army Corps as well as the Moroccan Division.\n\n\nEarly career\nErnest was born on December 2, 1862, as the son of Claude Nicolas and Marie Dumagnon at Charleville-Mézières.\nErnest Blondlat enlisted in the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr as a student of the Class of Egypt from October 29, 1881, to October 1, 1883. He took part in the Sino-French War, the First Franco-Dahomean War and the Second Franco-Dahomean War. Major Blondlat then went to French Madagascar in 1899, where he served under the orders of General Hubert Lyautey. Seriously wounded during the Siege of Androy in October 1901, he later came back from January to April 1902, seizing 4,500 rifles. Blondlat was appointed colonel in 1905 and he commanded Tonkinese units in 1907. In Morocco, from August to September 1912, he commanded the column of the Zaers at the Battle of El-Fedj. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1913.\n\n\nWorld War I\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Blondlat was at the head of the 1st Brigade of the Moroccan Division with many reforms under his command as well as personally knowing all the men within his brigade. He took part in the First Battle of the Marne, fighting with his unit west during the Battle of the Marshes of Saint-Gond. He took command of the Moroccan Division from theSeptember 14, 1914 to June 26, 1915. He obtained two commands while at the 10th Army. In June 1915, he was in command of the 2nd Colonial Army Corps and participated at the head of his unit in the Champagne offensive of September 1915. Still in command of the 2nd Colonial Corps, he participated in the battles of the Somme, Second Aisne and the Battle of Saint-Mihiel.\n\n\nPost-war life\nAfter the Armistice of 11 November 1918 signed, General Blondlat commanded the 1st French Military Region in Lille until October 1919. From April 1921 to December 1924, he was at the head of the troops of French Indochina.\n\n\nGeneral Blondlat's Flight\nIn April 1922, Major General Ernest Blondlat, now the superior commander of the troops of the Indochina soldiers, expressed the wish to go from Saigon to Hanoï by air with six Bréguet 14's. The first stage of Saigon to Quy Nhon was over 595 kilometers with a stopover in Phan Rang, was covered on April 4 aboard three seaplanes from the 2nd Squadron. The second stage of Qui Nhon to Huế was over 400 km with a stopover in Tourane and Lieutenant Dumas took the general to the capital of Annam where he stayed for two days. The third stage of Hué to Hanoï was over 600 km with a stopover in Vinh, involved three land-based Bréguet 14s piloted by François Glaize who took General Blondlat on board. The two men land in the morning of April 8 at the Bach Maï field where they were welcomed by Major General Jean-Paul Sicre, commander of the Annam-Tonkin division. Ernest Blondlat completed the 1,600 km trip in 14 hours with 35 min of flight with an average speed of 110 km/h.\n\n\nAwards\nLegion of Honor\nGrand Officer (June 16, 1920)\nCommander (August 10, 1914)\nOfficer (July 13, 1903)\n\n\nForeign Awards\n Russia: Order of St. George, 4th Class (January 1915)\n United States: Distinguished Service Medal (July 9, 1918)\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Guerra del Golfo (2016) (Spanish for \"Gulf War\") was a major lucha libre, or professional wrestling, event produced by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) that took place on April 17, 2016. The show was the ninth year in a row that IWRG has held a Guerra del Golfo show, which usually takes places in the early spring.\nThe eponymous Guerra del Golfo tournament consists of three matches in total, with two \"qualifying matches\", multi-man steel cage matches where the last person left in the cage is \"punished\" by advancing to the main event of the night. The two losers were then forced to wrestle inside the steel cage under Lucha de Apuestas, or \"bet match\", rules. Astro Jr. lost the last Guerra del Golfo cage match to Dr. Cerebro and thus had to remove his mask and reveal his real name as a result of the loss.\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nBackground\nThe Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has a long-standing history of holding major event focused on a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \"bet match\", rules. In 2005 IWRG created a specific spring-time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \"Gulf War\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico (not the Gulf War in the middle east). The Guerra del Golfo shows featured two \"qualifying\" multi-man steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show. In the final cage match the two wrestlers would wrestle where the loser would be forced to either unmask or, if they are not wearing a mask, have his hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\"The Tower of Terror\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\"War of the Sexes\"), or IWRG Prison Fatal (\"Deadly Prison\") shows.\nThe first two Guerra del Golfo steel cage matches are contested under elimination match rules, which means wrestlers escape the cage by climbing over the top of the steel cage to the floor. The last wrestler in the cage will be put in the final match of the night. Unlike the first two steel cage matches the final match is normally contested under pinfall rules. At the 2012 Guerra del Golfo the final match ended up differently than announced. Oficial Factor and Oficial 911 were supposed to face off one on one, but Factor's teammates Oficial Rayan and Oficial Spartan as well as Oficial 911's teammates Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro all climbed into the cage to turn it into an elimination match. In the end Oficial AK-47 lost the match, despite not originally being in the match.\nThe Guerra del Golfo shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \"Arena Naucalpan\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and is their home arena, with the group rarely venturing outside of Naucalpan. The 2016 Guerra del Golfo show was the tenth IWRG promoted a show under that name, and the ninth year in a row since becoming an annual event from 2008 forwardand the eleventh Guerra del Golfo show owing to IWRG holding two events in 2009. Prior to the 2016 event three wrestlers had lost their masks; Ultra Mega, Tortuguillo Ninja I, and Destroyer, while seven wrestlers were shaved bald; Cerebro Negro, Arlequín Rojo, Chico Che  (twice), Oficial AK-47 (twice), and Danny Casas.\n\n\nStorylines\nThe event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nin 2016 IWRG booked 10 wrestlers for each of the two 2016 La Guerra del Golfo elimination steel cage matches where each wrestler would be forced to defend either their mask or their hair. The first Guerra del Golfo match included Mr. Águila (hair), Astro (mask), Bestia 666 (hair), Apolo Estrada Jr. (hair), Golden Magic (mask), El Hijo del Diablo (hair), Oficial AK-47 (hair), Rafy (mask), Halloween (mask) and Veneno (hair). The other Guerra del Golfo match included Black Terry (hair),  Danny Casas (hair), Damián 666 (hair), Dr. Cerebro (hair), Eterno (hair), El Hijo de Dos Caras (mask), Leo (mask), Máscara Sagrada (mask), Mike (mask) and Oficial Fierro (hair). Super Nova and Canis Lupus were originally scheduled for the show but were replaced by Black Terry and Halloween.\nOf the 20 competitors, two have previously lost a Guerro del Golfo; Oficial AK-47 twice (mask, then hair) and Danny Casas (hair) while Oficial Fierro, El Hijo del Diablo, Ofical Factor and Apolo Estrada Jr. have won a Guerrero del Golfo match. Golden Magic had the most success in IWRG steel cage matches, having won four versions of the El Castillo del Terror match, while Oficial Fierro has lost an El Castillo del Terror match. Oficial Factor lost his mask in the 2012 Prison Fatal cagematch, while Dr. Cerebro won the June 2013 Prison Fatal match. This was the first Lucha de Apuestas match for two of the members of the Tortugas Ninjas group (Mike and Leo) while Rafy successfully defended his mask in the 2015 El Castillo del Terror match. Astral Jr. and former IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion El Hijo de Dos Caras have never been in a Lucha de Apuestas cage match prior to the 2016 Guerra de Golfo.\n\n\nEvent\nIn the first of the qualifying Guerra del Golfo steel cage matches, the young enmascarado (masked wrestler) Astro Jr. as the last man in the cage, forcing him to compete again later in the night. The second steel cage match saw the unmasked Dr. Cerebro was the last man in the cage, forcing him to wrestle against Astral only moments later. In the final match Dr. Cerebro pinned Astro forcing him to unmask and state his actual name, Emanuel Marin Jacome, as the lucha libre traditions dictate. Marin had originally worked as \"Astro Rey Jr.\" and claimed he was the nephew of Alberto Leonel Hernández López, better known as Astro Rey in the 1970s and 1980s and the cousin of the original Astro Rey Jr. Later the name was shortened to simply \"Astro Jr.\" and then \"Astro\", due to objections from Hernández although it is unclear if Astro never gained permission to use the name in the first place or if he had a falling out with Hernández after initially being allowed to use the name. It is not uncommon for wrestlers to use the name and mask of older wrestlers, paying for the name recognition as they pretend to be the son (or daughter) or a well known wrestler.\nOn the undercard the Exótico (male wrestlers in drag) team of Diva Salvaje, Miss Gaviota and Pasion Kristal defeated Los Comandos Elite (Factor, Rayan and Spector), a trio of wrestlers portraying a police riot squad.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nIWRG official website",

    "text": "Local involvement networks (LINks)  were launched by England's National Health Service in April 2008 following the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.  They replaced the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) and patient and public involvement forums and existed in every local authority area with a responsibility for NHS health care and social services.\nThere were 151 LINks and the Government committed £84 million in funding to them until March 2011. They were abolished at the end of March 2013.\n\n\nAbout LINks\nLINks were supposed to ask people what they like and dislike about NHS care services and adult social care services and seek ideas from the public to help improve services. They explored specific issues of concern to the community by collecting feedback from local people. LINks could tell those who commission, provide and manage local services what the community thinks and work with commissioners and providers to improve, amend, reconfigure and supplement services. They also had the power to carry out visits to services to see them at work. They sometimes facilitated  consultation on new or revised commissioning and provision of services.\nLINks had the power to ask health and care commissioners for information about their services and expect a response within 20 days. They issued reports and made recommendations about services with the expectation of a response from commissioners. The power to enter certain services and view the care provided was called Enter & View. LINk members had to undergo training in order to carry out this power. LINks could also refer health & social care matters to the local council’s Overview and Scrutiny Committee if local service providers did not provide a satisfactory response.\nThere was no set structure for a LINk.  Funding came from local councils, who were given money by the Department of Health to finance them. Each LINk was hosted by a \"host organisation\" of paid staff to set up and support the LINk. The host was accountable to the LINk. LINks were independent of the Government. An example of a host organisation is Voluntary Norfolk, the lead partner of a consortium  selected as the host for Norfolk LINk.\nAnyone wanting to have their say on how health and social care services are delivered in their area could become a member of a LINk. The principle was that \"everyone's views matter\", including  individuals, such as carers, service users, community leaders, patient representatives, health and social care professionals (as long as any conflict of interest are appropriately handled or managed), organisations.\nCertain bodies could not be part of a LINk, these include National Health Service trusts, NHS foundation trusts, NHS primary care trusts and strategic health authorities.\nLINks were intended to give people a range of ways to get involved, whether this just taking a few minutes to answer a survey or taking more time to train as a representative who visits services to see how they are run.\nNorfolk LINk's work influencing how myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) services are planned and delivered in Norfolk is an example of how LINks practice.\n\n\nHeathwatch\nIn July 2010 the Government released a White Paper called Liberating the NHS. The White Paper proposed the abolition of LINks and the introduction of Local Healthwatch; this was included in the Health and Social Care Act 2012.  The intention was to strengthen public influence and involvement in health and social care, as well as to remove the ambiguity of the then-current 'hosting' arrangements.\nOriginally scheduled for April 2012, but then delayed until April 2013, it was envisaged that local Healthwatch would build upon the existing functions of LINks to include the provision of information and advice to help people make choices about health and care services as well as the possibility of providing an advocacy service for people making a complaint using the NHS complaints process.\nHealthWatch England was also set up as an independent arm of the Care Quality Commission, with a specific remit to represent at a national level people using health and social care services.  Healthwatch England uses evidence from Local Healthwatch and from carrying out its own work to identify concerns and poorly-performing services. It is then able to recommend to Care Quality Commission that they investigate those services.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Healthwatch :: Home\". Nhs.uk. Retrieved 7 July 2018.",

The album was preceded by a mixtape entitled Write My Wrongs, released on October 14, 2013, which served as a prequel to the album.\n\n\nBackground\nOn September 10, 2013, the pair released a music video for the track \"Combine The Coasts\" from their upcoming mixtape Write My Wrongs. The release was in anticipation for their album Highway Robbery announced for a November release, to be preceded by their mixtape release in October. Guest appearances announced for the project included Freddie Gibbs, Paul Wall, Cormega, Trae Tha Truth, Ampichino and Mob Figaz members Husalah and Rydah J Klyde  On September 17, the cover and tracklist were revealed for Highway Robbery. The album was slated for a November 12 release.\nThe pair had previously collaborated on the tracks \"They Don't Know\" on Tear Gas (2009), \"Real Hood\" on Gobots 2: D-Boy Era (2010), \"Both Coasts\" on The Indictment (2011), \"All Kinds of Em\" on StatikFree (2011), \"Freedom Writers\" on The Sentence (2012), and \"So Many Animals\" on The A.R. Street Album (2012). The first of which having been recorded when the two first met in \"like 2002 or 2003\" when the Jacka reached out to Freeway who was visiting the Bay Area at the time. The Jacka revealed to Vibe, the bulk of their music had been recorded as far back as 2006 and 2008. \"We’ve recorded so much material together that we had to do something with all these songs.\"\nTheir mixtape Write My Wrongs was released on October 14. The mixtape was intended to convey tracks that had not made it on to the album and sneak peaks into the upcoming release. Their aforementioned collaborations also appeared on the mixtape, including remixed versions of \"Real Hood\" and \"So Many Animals\" on new production. The mixtape was mixed and hosted by DJ Child.\nFreeway and The Jacka launched the \"Highway Robbery\" tour in late 2014 which was cut short due to the untimely death of The Jacka in February 2015. The duo performed at The Crocodile in Seattle/Washington in September 2014 with Remy R.E.D as guest Dj. And at Karribbean City in Oaklsnd/California with Dj Quest Live.\n\n\nReception\nHighway Robbery received positive reviews from music critics. Jayson Greene of Pitchfork, referring to the album, stated \"the bulk of the music is low-key, liquid, and unmistakably bluesy. The guests that float through are on the same wavelength.\" Greene praised Freeway's return to form and his chemistry with the Jacka, stating \"he sounds incredible; more importantly, he sounds palpably at home [...] and the Jacka is his most natural partner since Beanie Sigel.\" He rated the album 7.9 out of 10.\nWill Chase of BlackGrooves.org praised the production \"driven by The Jacka’s ear for a diverse range of beats. Familiar Bay Area names like Jeffro, Young L and Traxmillion lay bluesy, lush arrangements incorporating everything from soft synth pads to Middle Eastern percussion to Daft Punk\" supplemented by a diverse guest list which drew upon acts from all over the country. Jeff Baird of PotHolesInMyBlog.com delivered a more mixed reception. \"Freeway and Jacka have an innate ability to resonate with their listeners as they navigate that territory [documenting street life and struggle.] There’s a sense of authority gained when one has endured a similar struggle, and that powers much of the album\" but criticized tracks such as \"Shuckin & Jivin\" and \"Just Remain\" as being \"ill-advised, which drastically hamper the album’s built-up rhythm.\" He rated the album 3.5 out of 5.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\nHighway Robbery\n\n\nWrite My Wrongs\n\n\nReferences",

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=191936",
    "text": "An oil lamp is a lamp used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although their use is less common in modern times. They work in the same way as a candle but with fuel that is liquid at room temperature, so that a container for the oil is required. A textile wick drops down into the oil, and is lit at the end, burning the oil as it is drawn up the wick.\nOil lamps are a form of lighting, and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the Argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used.\nSources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds and kukui) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, or flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, ghee, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, or seal). Camphine, made of purified spirits of turpentine, and burning fluid, a mixture of turpentine and alcohol, were sold as lamp fuels starting in the 1830s as the whale oil industry declined. Sales of both camphene and burning fluid decreased in the late 1800s as other sources of lighting, such as kerosene made from petroleum, gas lighting and electric lighting, began to predominate.\nMost modern lamps (such as fueled lanterns) have been replaced by gas-based or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Oil lamps are currently used primarily for their ambience.\n\n\nComponents\n\nThe following are the main external parts of a terra-cotta lamp:\n\nShoulder\nPouring hole\nThe hole through which fuel is put inside the fuel chamber. The width generally ranges from 0.5–5 cm (0.2–2.0 in). There may be one hole or multiple holes.\nWick hole and the nozzle\nMay be either an opening in the body of the lamp or an elongated nozzle. In some specific types of lamps, there is a groove on the top of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.\nHandle\nLamps can come with a handle. The handle can come in different shapes. The most common is a ring-shaped for the forefinger surmounted by a palmette, on which the thumb is pressed to stabilize the lamp. Other handles can be crescent-shaped, triangular, or oval-shaped. The handleless lamps usually have an elongated nozzle, and sometimes have a lug rising diagonally from the periphery. The lug may act as a small handle where the thumb rests. Some lugs are pierced. It was speculated that pierced lugs were used to place a pen or straw, called the Latin: acus or festuca, with which the wick was trimmed. Others think that the pierced lugs were used to hang the lamp on a metal hook when not in use.\nDiscus\nFuel chamber\nThe fuel reservoir. The mean volume in a typical terra-cotta lamp is 20 cc (20 mL).\n\n\nTypes\nLamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material (clay, silver, bronze, gold, stone, slip), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).\nTypologically, lamps of the Ancient Mediterranean can be divided into seven major categories:\n\nWheel-made\nThis category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simplicity, with little or no decoration, a wide pour-hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced lug. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between the 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.\nVolute, Early Imperial\nWith spiral, scroll-like ornaments called volutes extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the Early Roman period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder, no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.\nHigh Imperial\nThese lamps are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles, short, plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.\nFrog\nThis is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in Egypt and found in the regions around it, between c. 100 and 300 AD. The frog (Heqet) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.\nAfrican Red Slip\nLamps made in North Africa, but widely exported, decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, Christian or Jewish. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole. It is hypothesized that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.\nSlipper\nThese lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the Levant. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD. Decorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.\nFactory lamps\nAlso called German: Firmalampen, these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and two or three bumps on the shoulder. Initially made in factories in Northern Italy and Southern Gaul between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.\n\n\nIn religious contexts\n\n\nJudaism\n\nLamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of \"lighting\" the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.\nThe oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and religion. The Temple Menorah, a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the Chanukah story.\n\n\nChristianity\n\nThere are several references to oil lamps in the New Testament. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Eastern Catholic Churches oil lamps (Greek: kandili, Church Slavonic: lampada) are still used both on the Holy Table (altar) and to illuminate icons on the iconostasis and around the temple (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their icon corner. Traditionally, the sanctuary lamp in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the bishop when the church is consecrated, and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally olive oil. Oil lamps are also referenced as a symbol throughout the New Testament, including in the Parable of the Ten Virgins.\n\n\nHinduism\n\nOil lamps are commonly used in Hindu temples as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of Aarti.\nIn the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.\nA hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu puja ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with ghee. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.\nIn South India, there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals. Some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well.\n\nDeepalakshmi\nA brass lamp with a depiction of goddess Sri Lakshmi over the back piece. They are usually small and have only one wick.\nNilavilakku\nA tall brass or bronze lamp on a stand where the wicks are placed at a certain height.\nPaavai vilakku\nA brass or bronze lamp in the form of a lady holding a vessel with her hands. This type of lamp comes in different sizes, from very small to almost life-size. There are also large stone versions of this lamp in Hindu temples and shrines of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, especially at the base of columns and flanking the entrance of temples. They have only one wick.\nThooku vilakku\nA brass or bronze lamp hanging from a chain, often with multiple wicks.\nNachiarkoil lamp\nAn ornamental brass lamp made of series of diyas, a handicraft product which is exclusively made by the Pather (Kammalar) community in Nachiyar Koil, Tamil Nadu, India.\nWhen the Big Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, was built 1010 AD, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.\n\n\nChinese\n\nOil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (giving them a similar appearance to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.\nSuch lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.\n\n\nHistory\n\nCurved stone lamps were found in places dated to the 10th millennium BC (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300–8000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in Lascaux in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.\n\nSome archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps existed more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500–4500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating to 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that had been used for a long time (Early Bronze Age, Canaanite/Bronze I–IV, c. 3300–2000 BC).\nIt is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.\n\n\nChalcolithic Age (4500–3300 BC)\nThe first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared in the Chalcolithic. These were of the round bowl type.\n\n\nBronze Age (3200–1200 BC)\nBronze Age lamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the shape of the base.\n\n\nIntermediate Bronze Age (EBIV/MBI)\nA design with four spouts for wicks appeared in the Intermediate Bronze Age (2300-2000 BC). Lamps are made from large bowls with flattened bases for stability, and four equally spaced shallow pinches in the rim for wicks, although some lamps with only a single pinch have also been found. The four-spout design evolved to provide sufficient light when fueled with fish or animal oils, which burn less efficiently than olive oil.\n\n\nMiddle Bronze Age lamps (MB)\nThe four-wick oil lamps persist into this period. However, most lamps now have only one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter's wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.\n\n\nLate Bronze Age lamps (LB)\nA more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made, with simple and usually flat bases.\n\n\nIron Age (1200–560 BC)\nDuring the Iron Age, lamp rims become wider and flatter, with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim. The lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution, although some remain similar to lamps from the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.\nIn the later Iron Age, variant forms appear. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.\n\n\nArctic\n\nThe qulliq (seal-oil lamp) provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse population relied almost entirely on seal oil. This lamp was the most important article of furniture for the Inuit, Yupik and other Inuit peoples.\nThe lamps were made of stone and their sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but mostly were elliptical or half-moon shaped. The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or cottongrass and were lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.\n\n\nPersian\nPersian lamps were large, with thin sides and a deep pinch that flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.\n\n\nGreek\nGreek lamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handle-less. Some are with a lug, which may be pierced or not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over so it overlaps in order to make the nozzle, and is then pinched to make the wick hole.\nThey are round in shape and wheel-made.\n\n\nChinese\nThe earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the Warring States period (481–221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame. Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.\n\n\nEarly Roman\n\nProduction of oil lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply in the Early Roman era. Molds began to be used, and lamps were produced in large scale in factories. All lamps are closed in type. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic \"Imperial Type\"—round, with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U-shaped), a closed body, a central disk decorated with reliefs and a filling hole.\n\n\nLate Roman\nLate Roman lamps were of the \"High Imperial\" type. They included more decorations, and were produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appeared during this period. Many different varieties were created.\nFrog type lamps also appeared during this period. These are kidney-shaped, heart-shaped or oval, and feature the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that two identical lamps are seldom found.\n\n\nLate Middle Age\n\nEarly Christian and late antique oil lamps were diverse. One of the most notable ones were Mediterranean sigillata (“African”) lamps. The motifs were largely geometric, vegetative and graphic (monograms), with figural depiction of animals and human figures, often Christ. Those depicting Christ or the Chi Rho often categorized as Hayes Type II.\n\n\nByzantine\nOil lanterns of the Byzantine were slipper-shaped and highly decorative. The multiple-nozzle design continued and most lamps bore handles. Some have complex exteriors.\n\n\nEarly Islamic\n\nThere is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, or fish to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.\nThe early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of a bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Later, they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.\nAn early description of the kerosene lamp comes from 9th-century Baghdad by al-Razi (Rhazes). He referred to it as the Arabic: naffatah in his Kitab al-Asrar ('Book of Secrets').\nIn the transition period, some lamps had Arabic writing. Writing later disappears until the Mamluk period (13th to 15th century AD).\n\n\nIndustrial age\nOil burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.\n\n\nRegional variations\n\n\nLand of Israel/Palestine region\nJerusalem oil lamp: The clay has a characteristic black color because it was burned without oxygen. Usually of high quality.\nDaroma oil lamp\nJerash oil lamp\nNabatean oil lamp\nHerodian oil lamp: Considered to be used mainly by Jews. Wheel-made, rounded, and have a nozzle with concave sides. The lamps are usually not decorated; if there is decoration, it tends to be simple. Very common throughout all of Judea, and some lamps have also been found in Jordan. Date from the 1st century BC to the end of the 1st century AD.\nMenorah oil lamp, seven nozzles: Rare and are associated with Judaism because of the numerical connection with the seven branches or arms of the Menorah.\nSamaritan oil lamp: Characterized by a sealed filling hole, which was to be broken by the buyer. This was probably done to ensure ritual purity. They have a wider spout, and the concavities flanking the nozzle are almost always emphasized with a ladder pattern band. In general, the lamps are uncoated. The decorations are linear or geometric.\nType I: A distinct channel runs from the pouring hole to the nozzle. They have a small knob handle, a ladder pattern around the nozzle and no ornamentation on the bottom of the base.\nType II: Pear-shaped and elongated, with a lined channel that extends from the filling hole to the nozzle. Continued to be used up to the early Muslim period.\nCandle Stick oil lamp: Menorah design on the nozzle and bunch of grapes on the shoulders.\nByzantine oil lamp: The upper parts and their handles are covered with braided patterns. All are made of a dark orange-red clay. A rounded bottom with a distinct X or cross appears inside the circled base.\nEarly Islamic oil lamp: Large knob handle and the channel above the nozzle are the dominant elements of these. The handle is tongue-shaped, and decoration is rich and elegant. The lower parts are extremely broad and the nozzles are pointed.\n\n\nIndia\n\nIn Vedic times, fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later, the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.\nFor Deep Daan, the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best daan ('donation'). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the Shodashopachar Puja) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (moonless) day in the month of Shravan. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality – \"tamaso ma jyotirgamaya\".\nEarlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later, they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya ('fish'), kurma ('tortoise') and other incarnations of god Vishnu. Lamps were also created in the shape of the many emblems of gods, like conch shells or lotuses. Birds such as swans, peacocks, or parrots, and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas ('towers of light') were created.\n\nErecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised brass lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku can be seen. To adapt the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha ('tree of light') was created. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with curvi-linear lines branching out from the base, each holding a lamp. The Deepalakshmi is another common design, where the goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.\nOil lamps also were included in proverbs. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, \"Chiraag tale andhera\", 'the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)', meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (a lamp's container casts a strong shadow).\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBailey, D.

    "summary": "An oil lamp is a lamp used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although their use is less common in modern times. They work in the same way as a candle but with fuel that is liquid at room temperature, so that a container for the oil is required. A textile wick drops down into the oil, and is lit at the end, burning the oil as it is drawn up the wick.\nOil lamps are a form of lighting, and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the Argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used.\nSources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds and kukui) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, or flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, ghee, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, or seal). Camphine, made of purified spirits of turpentine, and burning fluid, a mixture of turpentine and alcohol, were sold as lamp fuels starting in the 1830s as the whale oil industry declined. Sales of both camphene and burning fluid decreased in the late 1800s as other sources of lighting, such as kerosene made from petroleum, gas lighting and electric lighting, began to predominate.\nMost modern lamps (such as fueled lanterns) have been replaced by gas-based or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Oil lamps are currently used primarily for their ambience.",

    "text": "Mucronella is a genus of fungi in the family Clavariaceae. Species in the genus resemble awl-shaped teeth that grow in groups without a common subiculum (supporting layer of mycelium).\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe type species was originally named Hydnum calvum in a collaborative effort by the German botanist Johannes Baptista von Albertini and the American Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1805. Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries transferred the species to the newly described genus Mucronella in 1874.\nMolecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus is monophyletic, and is sister to the remainder of the Clavariaceae, confirming earlier suspicions that the taxa were phylogenetically related. It had previously been placed in the Russulales due to its amyloid spores, and its morphological similarity to some members of genus Hericium.\n\n\nDescription\nFruitbodies of Mucronella species resemble hanging spines; they occur singly, scattered, or in groups. Colors range from white to yellow to orange. Mucronella has a monomitic hyphal system —consisting of only generative hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and club shaped. Basidiospores are usually smooth with thin walls, weakly amyloid, and somewhat hyaline (translucent). Mucronella is the sole genus in the Clavariaceae with amyloid spores, and with the \"hanging spine\" fruitbody morphology.\n\n\nHabitat and distribution\nMucronella species are saprotrophic. Kartar Singh Thind and I.P.S. Khurana identified five species from the northwestern Himalayas, India, in 1974: M. bresadolae, M. calva, M. flava, M. subalpina, and M. pulchra.\n\n\nSpecies\n\nAs of August 2015, Index Fungorum accepts 17 species of Mucronella:\n\nMucronella albidula (Corner) Berthier 1985\nMucronella argentina Speg. 1898 – South America\nMucronella belalongensis P.Roberts 1998 – Brunei\nMucronella brasiliensis Corner 1950 – South America\nMucronella bresadolae (Quél.)

    "text": "Sándor Weöres (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈʃaːndor ˈvørøʃ]; 22 June 1913 – 22 January 1989) was a Hungarian poet and author.\nBorn in Szombathely, Weöres was brought up in the nearby village of Csönge. His first poems were published when he was fourteen, in the influential journal Nyugat (\"West\"), through the acceptance of its editor, the poet Mihály Babits. Weöres attended the University of Pécs, first studying law before moving on to geography and history. He ultimately received a doctorate in philosophy and aesthetics. His doctoral dissertation The Birth of the Poem was published in 1939. It was in 1937 that he made the first of his travels abroad, going first to Manila for a Eucharistic Congress and then visiting Vietnam and India. During World War II Weöres was drafted for compulsory labor, but was not sent to the front. After the end of the war, he returned to Csönge and briefly lived as a farmer.\nIn 1948 Weöres again travelled abroad, living in Italy until 1949. In 1951 he settled in Budapest where he would reside for the rest of his life.\n\n\nWork\nWeöres' translations into Hungarian were wide and varied, including the works of Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko, the Georgian poet Rustaveli, the Slovenian poets Oton Župančič and Josip Murn Aleksandrov. He translated Indian poet Jai dev's poetry Gita Govinda from Sanskrit. He also translated Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Henry VIII, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, the nonsense poems by Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, the complete poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé,. His translation of the Tao Te Ching continues to be the most widely read in Hungary.\n\n\nLegacy\nMany of Weöres' poems have been set to music. Zoltán Kodály composed a choral piece to the text of the 14-year-old poet's poem Öregek (“Old People”). György Ligeti, a friend of the poet, set several poems from Rongyszőnyeg and other books in the composition Síppal, dobbal, nádihegedüvel. Composer Peter Eötvös has composed two pieces, Atlantis and Ima with texts from Weöres' poem Néma zene (\"Silent Music\"), and in 2013 he composed Speaking Drums (Four Poems for Percussion Solo and Orchestra) based on the poems by Sándor Weöres.\nIn 1980 the Hungarian filmmaker Gábor Bódy adapted the poem Psyché to make the epic feature Nárcisz és Psyché.\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nWorks in English\nEternal Moment: Selected Poems by Sandor Weores, 1988\nSelected Poems, 1970\nSelf-portrait: Selected poems by Sándor Weöres, 1991\n\n\nPoetry\nHideg van, 1934\nA kő és az ember, 1935\nA teremtés dicsérete, 1938\nMeduza, 1944\nA szerelem ábécéje, 1946\nElysium, 1946\nGyümölcskosár, 1946\nA fogok tornáca, 1947\nBóbita, 1955\nA hallgatás tornya, 1956\nTarka forgó, 1958\nTűzkút, 1964\nGyermekjátékok, 1965\nMerülő Saturnus, 1968\nZimzizim, 1969\nPsyche, 1972\nTélország, 1972\nPriapos, written in 1950, published posthumously in 2001\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "Sándor Weöres (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈʃaːndor ˈvørøʃ]; 22 June 1913 – 22 January 1989) was a Hungarian poet and author.\nBorn in Szombathely, Weöres was brought up in the nearby village of Csönge. His first poems were published when he was fourteen, in the influential journal Nyugat (\"West\"), through the acceptance of its editor, the poet Mihály Babits. Weöres attended the University of Pécs, first studying law before moving on to geography and history. He ultimately received a doctorate in philosophy and aesthetics. His doctoral dissertation The Birth of the Poem was published in 1939. It was in 1937 that he made the first of his travels abroad, going first to Manila for a Eucharistic Congress and then visiting Vietnam and India. During World War II Weöres was drafted for compulsory labor, but was not sent to the front. After the end of the war, he returned to Csönge and briefly lived as a farmer.\nIn 1948 Weöres again travelled abroad, living in Italy until 1949. In 1951 he settled in Budapest where he would reside for the rest of his life.",

    "text": "Europa riconosciuta (Italian: [euˈrɔːpa rikonoʃˈʃuːta]; meaning \"Europa revealed\" or \"Europa recognized\") is an opera in two acts by Antonio Salieri, designated as a dramma per musica, set to an Italian libretto by Mattia Verazi.\nThe opera takes place in Tyre in Phoenicia and tells a story of love, violence and political discord in ancient times. The central character, Europa, was once the lover of Zeus and helps resolve all disagreements after she discloses her identity – thus the title \"Europa Revealed\". Though a traditional opera seria, the work differentiates itself from several of the typical characteristics of the genre. For example: a murder is seen onstage and an extended finale is used in both acts, a practice more typical of opera buffa. Musically, the opera is quite challenging, requiring four principal singers capable of spanning wide tessituras, sustaining long phrases, and making dextrous leaps. For example, the roles of Europa and Semele go up to a high F sharp above high C a few times.\n\n\nPerformance history\nThe opera was first performed for the inauguration of La Scala on 3 August 1778. The opera was not performed again until 7 December 2004 for the re-opening of La Scala, after the theater had been closed for almost three years for major renovations.  Since the work had not been performed for so long, La Scala had to re-print the score for Europa riconosciuta from scratch, working from the original manuscripts in its library. The premiere of the new Europa riconosciuta was broadcast live on a closed-circuit telecast and in 2017 became available on DVD.\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nSynopsis\nPrincess Europa of Tyre and Prince Isséo are engaged to be married. Their plans to wed are ruined when the king of Crete, Asterio, abducts Europa from her father’s palace and forces her to marry him. Europa's father King Agenore of Tyre, tries to find his daughter but fails. In despair, he leaves his throne to his niece Semele instead of Europa on the condition that Semele must marry the man who kills the first foreigner to enter the nation of Tyre. In this way Europa’s kidnapping will be avenged. After Agenore’s death, Asterio sails from Crete towards Tyre in the hopes of placing Europa on the Tyrian throne.\n\n\nAct I\n\n\nScene 1: A shore on the coast of Tyre\nA major storm devastates Asterio’s fleet and causes his own ship to shipwreck off the coast of Tyre. Asterio, his wife Europa, and their son step off their boat onto the shore and are startled by the appearance of Egisto and his band of armed soldiers. Asterio manages to hide Europa in a cave, but is unable to save himself, his men, and his son from capture. Upon seeing this, Europa emerges from her hiding-place and tries to defend her son. Her efforts fail and she is taken with the rest of the Cretan prisoners to the palace of Tyre by Egisto and his men.\n\n\nScene 2: Semele's royal pavilion\nIsséo has recently returned from a successful attack against the Cypriot rebels. Semele is in love with Isséo and has decided to marry him. She asks Egisto to assemble the grand council so that she can announce the name of the man she has chosen to marry, who will become the next king of Tyre. Meanwhile, Egisto, is determined to grasp the throne for himself and decides to openly challenge his rival.\n\n\nScene 3: Triumphal scene\nIsséo and his soldiers enter the throne room celebrating their victory. Semele informs Isséo of her desire to share the Tyrian throne with him, and then asks him to attend the grand council with her. Isséo refuses Semele's request because he is still in love with Europa, and therefore is not free to love Semele.\n\n\nScene 4: A council chamber in Semele's palace\nThe council members pray for Temide's aid. Semele proclaims that she is prepared to choose the new king. Egisto foils her plan by reminding Semele of her promise to Agenore to marry the man that kills the first foreigner to set foot on Tyrian soil. Egisto produces Asterio in chains and hopes that he can execute Asterio in order that he might marry Semele and become king. Asterio, however, does not cooperate when questioned about his identity and origins. Frustrated, the council decides to interrogate Europa. She astounds everyone by proclaiming herself to be the missing princess of Tyre and rightful heir to the throne. Egisto is furious that his plan to obtain the throne is thwarted, while Isséo is greatly disturbed by Europa's reappearance. Seeing Isséo's response to Europa causes Semele to become full of jealous anger.\n\n\nAct II\n\n\nScene 1: A prison\nAsterio is in prison and is anxiously awaiting the council's decision on his fate. Concurrently, Egisto tries to convince Isséo that Europa may still love him. Europa enters and makes a plea for her family's lives. She does not express her feelings for Isséo but rather tells him that her loyalties are to her family as a wife and mother. Europa offers to relinquish the throne of Tyre to Semele, in exchange for the lives of her husband and son. She further begs Isséo to no longer remember the love they once had – as she herself has already forgotten – and to become king by marrying Semele. Isséo leaves Europa and she falls to the ground in tears.\n\n\nScene 2: A private room in the palace\nSemele is highly jealous of Europa. She informs Isséo that the council has decided to execute the king of Crete and imprison his wife. In response, Isséo tells Semele that Europa no longer claims the throne. Furthermore, Isséo reveals Egisto’s treachery and informs Semele that he will marry her. Semele agrees to stop Asterio’s execution and sends Isséo to disband the proceedings.\n\n\nScene 3: The Temple of Vengeance\nAsterio is about to be executed at the tomb of Agenore. Egisto offers Europa and her son their freedom if they are willing to flee. Europa rejects his offer, proclaiming that she prefers to die with her husband. Asterio begs them to accept Egisto's offer in order that they might live. The priests of Nemesi lead Asterio to the place of sacrifice, but they are interrupted by the emergence of Cretan soldiers. These soldiers are Asterio's men who got lost in the great storm but managed to survive. They have come, unexpectedly, to save Asterio's life. A tumultuous combat ensues between the Cretans and Egisto’s guards. Isséo appears with some of his men and joins the Cretan soldiers in fighting Egisto and his guards.\n\n\nScene 4: A courtyard\nThe Tyrian soldiers have been defeated but Egisto still fights on.  Isséo and Egisto clash in a desperate fight and Egisto is killed. To the relief of Semele, Isséo is not wounded. Meanwhile, Europa is proclaimed the rightful heir to the throne by the people of Tyre. Semele is very upset until Isséo assures her that Europa will keep her promise.\n\n\nScene 5: A ceremonial chamber in the palace\nEuropa is proclaimed the new queen of Tyre, but her one and only act as queen is to marry Isséo and Semele and turn the throne over to them. Isséo and Semele happily accept.\nSynopsis based on Rodney Stringer's translation.\n\n\nRecordings\n2004 performance – Diana Damrau, Desiree Rancatore, Genia Kühmeier, Daniela Barcellona, Giuseppe Sabbatini, La Scala Orchestra, Riccardo Muti Erato, DVD 2017\n\n\nReferences\n\nOther sources\nElena Biggi Parodi, Teatro alla Scala 1778: «Europa riconosciuta» inaugura a Milano l’opera europea, in Salieri sulle tracce di Mozart, Catalogo della Mostra, Milano, Palazzo Reale 2 dicembre 2004-30 gennaio Bärenreiter, 2004, pp. 35–44.

    "text": "Carnivorous Plants of Australia is a three-volume work on carnivorous plants by Allen Lowrie. The three tomes were published in 1987, 1989, and 1998, by University of Western Australia Press.\nAn entirely updated three-volume work by Lowrie was published by Redfern Natural History Productions in December 2013 as Carnivorous Plants of Australia Magnum Opus.\n\n\nContent\nThe first volume deals exclusively with tuberous sundews (genus Drosera). The second is devoted to pygmy sundews, but also includes three tuberous species described since the publication of the first volume, as well as two other sundews that do not fit elsewhere (D. glanduligera and D. hamiltonii). The final volume includes the remaining sundews of Australia, together with native species of Aldrovanda, Byblis, Cephalotus, Nepenthes, and Utricularia. Each species is given a four-page treatment, with one page for a botanical description, one for a line drawing of the author's creation, one for a distribution map, and one for assorted colour photographs.\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nVolume 1\nMartin Cheek reviewed the first volume for the March 1988 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter (CPN). He compared it to Neville Graeme Marchant and Alex George's 1982 treatment of tuberous sundews in Flora Australia (F.A.):\n\nEach plant is very clearly described in a page of text followed by a few interesting paragraphs on its most outstanding features and how to tell it apart from its closest relatives. There follows a full plate of the most superb drawings, far better, more beautiful and comprehensive than the F.A., a distribution map (needless to say, ten times better than F.A.) and outstanding colour plates showing, separately, habit and habitat and a close-up of the flowers.\nCheek identified a number of \"[m]inor errors\" in the text, including the species keys and glossary, but wrote that \"we must not be over critical\". He concluded: \"This book is essential reading as the major reference work on Australian tuberous sundews: buy it.\"\n\n\nVolume 2\nThe second volume was reviewed by Donald Schnell in the March–June 1990 issue of the CPN:\n\nThe descriptions are all excellent, as are the line drawings and range maps. The photos are true to color, sharply printed, and for the most part show what they are intended to.\nSchnell suggested that some of the book's smaller images would benefit from enlargement, finding certain morphological details difficult to discern. He added that \"some might question\" the inclusion of many undescribed taxa and several newly described species of tuberous sundews, the latter appearing somewhat out-of-place in a book otherwise devoted to pygmy sundews.\nMartin Cheek provided a more in-depth review of volume 2 for the September–December 1990 issue of the CPN. He wrote that the book puts all other works on pygmy sundews \"into the shade\", with comprehensive treatment of every species known at the time. Minor criticisms included the \"woolliness\" of certain glossary definitions (which \"has unfortunate consequences in the descriptions that follow\"), issues with the main key, a lack of ranges for many measurements, truncated peduncles in some line drawings, and no mention of bract morphology in the species descriptions. More serious criticism was levelled at the inclusion of numerous informally named taxa and at Lowrie's reliance on original descriptions (without examination of type material) in making certain taxonomic determinations, particularly with respect to the confused D. omissa. Cheek also added: \"For the grower of pygmy Drosera, a major disappointment is that the numerous cultivar names that so many pygmy sundew species, of direct wild origin, have been traded under for 10 years or more [...] are not accounted for, nor mentioned anywhere in the text.\" Summarising, Cheek wrote:\n\nEven in view of the reservations expressed above, the keys, descriptions, maps and illustrations are vastly superior to those of previous authors. The works of Erickson and Marchant & George must now be considered completely out-of-date.\n\n\nVolume 3\nBarry Rice gave a positive appraisal of the third volume in the September 1999 issue of the CPN, writing: \"If you are interested at all in Australian carnivorous plants you should buy this book!\". He continued:\n\nThe descriptive text sections are good and the botanical drawings are well executed and clear, although many of the plates have much blank space that could have been used for additional sketches. (For example, Lowrie unfortunately did not include gemmae sketches for the new pygmy sundews.) The photography is excellent—as in his first two volumes Lowrie skillfully uses depth-of-field and background choices to highlight the plants. The addition of microphotographs is welcome.\nRice wrote that the range maps \"are fine, although not particularly detailed\" and considered the alphabetical arrangement of species, which differed from the first two volumes, \"inconvenient\" at times. Rice pointed out the omission of many Utricularia species (\"only nineteen species are described, even though more than fifty species occur in Australia\") and felt that the four-pages-per-species format was inadequate for treating some of the more \"complicated taxa\", like D. binata, U. dichotoma, and especially D. peltata (of which \"only the Western Australia type was ever mentioned\"—in the first volume).\n\n\nReferences",

It is a cover of the German song \"Und jetzt ist es still\", performed by Horst Winter in 1948, with music written by Austrian composer Hans Lang and German lyrics by Erich Meder. The English lyrics were written by Bert Reisfeld.\nA French title, \"Tout est tranquille\", was performed in 1949 by Ginette Garcin and the Jacques Hélian Orchestra.\n\n\nBjörk version\n\nThe song was covered by Icelandic musician Björk in 1995. It was released by One Little Indian as the third single from her second album, Post (1995) and remains her biggest hit, reaching number four in the UK and spending 15 weeks on the UK Singles Chart. Fueled by the Spike Jonze-directed music video, the single also shot Björk into the spotlight in Australia, where it reached number six. In the United Kingdom the single has been certified as Gold, having sold upwards of 400,000 copies.\n\n\nCritical reception\nJames Masterton for Dotmusic said Björk's version of 'It's Oh So Quiet' \"stands out as one of the most bizarre singles she has ever recorded.\" He described it \"as Icelandic pixie meets the sound of Frank Sinatra to almost perfect effect.\" Alan Jones from Music Week wrote, \"Alternating soft and gentle passages with noisy outbursts on which Bjork squawks and is reinforced by an old-fashioned big band section, this is very much a novelty, but one that works and well.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media stated, \"The big-band-backed 'It's Oh So Quiet' is wonderful (didn't we hear this in Altman's Pret-A-Porter? It isn't included on the soundtrack album).\" \nSimon Williams from NME said in his review of Post, \"It happens about a quarter of the way into 'It's Oh So Quiet'. All is normal in Björkland in terms of mischievous whisperings and wandering noises for the first, ooooh, minute... and then, with nary a mumbled warning, out pours a 20-piece orchestral shriek, the huge scarlet drapes part insolently, and there She is centrestage, gallivanting down the crystallised staircase, shimmying with the choreographed puffins, bellowing through a jazz-tastic wartime standard originally recorded by a Hollywood bombshell of the blonde variety, Betty Hutton, and She is hollering You fall in love, ZING BOOM! The sky up above, ZING BOOM! Is caving in, WOW BAM!.\" \nIn her review of the single, Gill Whyte from Smash Hits gave it a top score of five out of five, writing, \"Uh-oh! Bjönkers is back! With a loonier-than-the-looniest-thing-ever-loonied choon! So, put on your loon shoes and tip-tappety-tap along, 'cos this is a redoing of an old Hollywood musical big band number, with lots of big, bursty, brassy noises, interludes of quiet Ssh, ssh gurglings, and, just when you think it's all over, the Pixie From Planet Shouty screams her wee head off. Literally! Oh-so brilliant.\" Another Smash Hits editor, Gavin Reeve, named it one of two \"top destinations\" of the album, with 'Army of Me'.\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video, directed by Spike Jonze, was shot in San Fernando Valley, California. It is a homage to Hollywood's Technicolor musicals that drew inspiration from Busby Berkeley and Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, as well as Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang. Like Demy, Jonze \"mines the magical from the mundane,\" as he transforms a drab auto shop into the location where Björk dances and sings with a full dance company, an attempt to reflect the \"exuberance\" of her vocal performance. The whispered verse sections of the track are filmed in slow motion, \"much as Tsai's cinematography takes place over an extended timeframe\"; while the shouted musical sections \"reflect back on ordinary or 'lived' reality in a manner that denaturalizes the banal—turning it, more than the fantasy of musical spectacle, into something surreal.\" The music video premiered on MTV during the week ending on August 20, 1995.\n\n\nSynopsis\nThe video begins as Björk emerges from an extremely dirty washroom in an auto shop. She dances along with the auto workers for the first chorus, then emerges from the shop. During the second chorus, she dances tap with a few people outside of the auto shop. Björk continues to walk along the street, dancing with several elderly women and their umbrellas before settling to rest her arms on top of a mailbox for the final verse. The mailbox comes alive and dances along with Björk during this chorus. Björk then runs down the street and into the road, where the rest of the town has decided to join her for one large dance number. The video ends with Björk floating up above the townsfolk and hushing the viewer.\n\n\nAwards\nThe \"It's Oh So Quiet\" video received six nominations for the MTV Video Music Awards for 1996 including Best Female Video, Best Art Direction, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction in a Video, International Viewer's Choice Award — MTV Europe, and Best Choreography in a Video, winning in the latter category. The video was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video - Short Form, losing to \"Scream\" by Michael Jackson and his sister Janet.\nIn October 2007, MuchMoreMusic placed \"It's Oh So Quiet\" as number eight of the Top 40 Most Memorable Music Videos on Listed.\n\n\nTrack listings\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nCertifications\n\n\nRelease history\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nList of \"It's Oh So Quiet\" releases at discogs",

    "text": "Alison Darcy is a research psychologist and technologist. She is the Founder and President of Woebot Health, a company which provides digital therapeutics and behavioural health products.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nDarcy was an undergraduate student in Ireland at the University College Dublin, where she specialised in psychology. After completing her studies, Darcy became interested in computer science, so moved to London to work in an investment bank as a software developer. In 2023, Alison Darcy was named to the TIME100 AI List for her impactful work combining artificial intelligence and mental health through her company, Woebot Health. The investment bank was acquired by a larger bank during the dot com crash, leaving Darcy looking for new options. In particular, she was interested in combining her skills in technology with her talent for psychology, and worked with a charity to support people with eating disorders. At the time there was very little online support for people with mental health conditions, and accessing care was particularly difficult for people in rural communities. Working with one of her colleagues in software development, Darcy built an online support network, providing round-the-clock support to people who needed to talk. She eventually returned to University College Dublin for a graduate degree, and eventually a doctoral research programme in clinical psychology. Her research considered the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioural therapy. After a year in London, Darcy moved to the United States, where she joined Stanford University as a postdoctoral researcher in clinical psychology. At Stanford, she collaborated with Andrew Ng, and became interested in whether artificial intelligence can meaningfully help people with mental health conditions. In her clinical practise, Darcy was increasingly concerned that there was no continuity between leaving in patient care and entering the real world.\n\n\nResearch and career\nDarcy continued to research eating disorders, with a particular focus on anorexia nervosa. She recognised that very few clinicians had the appropriate training to treat patients with the condition. She pioneered the use of online learning methods to train clinicians. She became increasingly aware that to combine technology and psychology she would have to do it outside academia, so left to start her own company.\nIn 2017 Darcy founded Woebot Health, an artificial intelligence powered chatbot that helps users monitor their moods and manage their mental health.  More specifically, Woebot is a dynamic and individualized instrument via which patients can forge a therapeutic connection. It maintains the scalability and agency that define self-help techniques while enhancing (rather than replacing) human healthcare providers and unlocking the therapeutic power associated with guiding. This AI acts like an automatic therapist that has been found to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in two weeks.  The board of Woebot is chaired by Ng. Darcy wants to make mental health services and the trainings of cognitive behavioural therapy accessible to all. In April 2020, Woebot added COVID-19 support, expanding its CBT support to include interpersonal psychotherapy. Following that additional support, Woebot has been suspected to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms within as little as the passage of two weeks.  In the fall of 2023, Darcy was added to the 2023 Time100 AI List, which aims to highlight individuals that have made significant and impactful artificial intelligence advancements. By 2023, $123.5 million dollars had already been made by Woebot, which already had over 1 million users.[1]In late June 2025, Darcy decided to shut down Woebot's therapy chatbot due to regulatory challenges. The bot was unable to keep up with the rate of technological advancement in the AI space. While Darcy did decide to shut the chatbot down, she has found more ways to give back to the field. She has wrote many books when discussing the field, and she serves as a lecturer at Stanford University  \n\n\nSelected publications\nFitzpatrick, Kathleen Kara; Darcy, Alison; Vierhile, Molly (2017). \"Delivering Cognitive Behavior Therapy to Young Adults With Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety Using a Fully Automated Conversational Agent (Woebot): A Randomized Controlled Trial\".

    "text": "The International Military Sports Council (IMSC; French: Conseil International du Sport Militaire, CISM) is an international sports association, established in 1948 and headquartered in Brussels. It is the world's second-largest multi-discipline sports organisation, after the International Olympic Committee, holding more than 20 competitions annually. Under its auspices, soldiers who may previously have met on the battlefield compete on the sports playing field. CISM organises various sporting events, including the Military World Games and World Military Championships, for the armed forces of 140 member countries. The aim of CISM is to promote sport activity and physical education between armed forces as a means to foster world peace. The motto of CISM is \"Friendship through Sport\" and is based on the three pillars: sport, education and solidarity. Since  April 2022, the president of CISM has been Colonel Nilton Gomes Rolim Filho of Brazil.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nBefore the CISM\nIn 1919, in the aftermath of the First World War, the Inter-Allied Games were organised by General John Pershing's Allied Forces Sports Council, bringing together 1500 athletes representing 18 nations, to compete in 24 sports. The event was held in Joinville-le-Pont in France.\nIn May 1946, after the Second World War, the Allied Forces Sports Council was revived by Colonel Henri Debrus and Olympic pentathlete Major Raoul Mollet, and over the weekend of 7–8 September that year, the second Inter-Allied Games took place in Berlin, at the Olympiastadion, venue of the 1936 Olympic Games. The event was also known as the Allied Track and Field Championships, following a similar event in 1945. Twelve nations were due to be represented: Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Great Britain, Poland, Greece, Luxembourg, Holland, Norway, the Soviet Union, the United States and hosts Germany, while reports say that only seven did.\nAmid some rancour, the Allied Forces Sports Council was extinguished in 1947.\n\n\nMain development\nA few months later, taking up they had left off with the Allied Forces Sports Council, Colonel Debrus and Major Mollet founded the CISM, on 18 February 1948. The founding members were Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In 1950, Argentina and Egypt became members. In 1951, the United States joined. In 1952, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and Syria became members, followed two years later by Brazil. Canada came on board in 1985. Then in 1991, with the end of the Cold War, the rival Warsaw Pact organisation Friendly Armies' Sports Committee (SKDA) merged with CISM, heralding the accession of 31 new member countries from the Pact and others associated with the Soviet Bloc. This rapid progress led to recognition by international institutions including the IOC. Prior to 1995, CISM organised 15 to 20 world championships each year. Since 1995, CISM has organised every four years the Military World Games, a multi-sport event.\n\n\nCISM of the Americas\nThe CISM of the Americas Continent is a subordinate organisation that consists of 19 member nations: Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Jamaica, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, United States of America, Uruguay and Venezuela.   There are two liaison offices known as the North American Liaison Office (NALO) and the South American Liaison Office (SALO). The CISM of the Americas Vice President, (Army) Colonel Walter Jander served as one of the four CISM Vice Presidents (2015–2019).\n\n\nCISM honors and awards\n\n\nGoals and organisation\n\n\nSolidarity\nThe CISM Solidarity programme is intended as a means to promote sustainable development to strengthen less privileged CISM member countries, in order to create equal opportunities for all CISM nations to participate in CISM events.\nDeveloped some decades ago, Solidarity is one of the two pillars that guide CISM's activities, and inspired the Olympic solidarity model. CISM's solidarity programme has many components, ranging from organising technical clinics in less privileged countries and transporting athletes to championships, to shipping sports equipment to disadvantaged regions. Member countries may send or invite coaches, based either on CISM membership and \"Friendship through Sport\" or often through bilateral contracts.\nThe establishment of Regional Development Centres (RDC) is a major objective of the CISM support policy. The first step in this direction was taken in 2006 when the CISM African Development Centre (CAD) was founded in Nairobi, Kenya. A further Regional Development Centre was established in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n\nGeneral Assembly\nA General Assembly, on which all member nations are represented, is the supreme authority of CISM.\n\n\nLeadership\n\n\nCISM presidents\n\n\nBoard of directors\n\n\nCISM events\n\n\nMilitary World Games\n\nThe Military World Games are a multisports event organised every four years since 1995.

It is 4 miles (6 km) south of Northampton town centre and 1.5 miles (2 km) by road to the M1 London to Yorkshire motorway junction 15. It lies just off the B526 road (former A50) from Northampton to Newport Pagnell, between Hackleton and Wootton, a former village which has become now a suburb of Northampton. The 2010 population estimate was 51.\nThe village's name means 'Priests' farm/settlement'. The hamlet gave its name to the deanery here.\n\n\nGovernance\nThe village is represented on Hackleton parish council which also covers the nearby villages of Piddington and Horton. It is an \"ancient parish\"; a village or group of villages or hamlets and the adjacent lands which originally they held ecclesiastical functions, but from the 16th century onwards they also acquired civil roles. In 1931 the parish of Preston Deanery had a population of 103. On 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Hackleton.\n\n\nBuildings\n\n\nChurch\n\nThe church was dedicated to St Peter circa 1200, then St Peter and St Paul c.1415. It was a parish church for what was at the time a much larger and later abandoned village. The church is now redundant but cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust. It has a 12th-century west tower with a central pilaster-buttress on each face, a single nave, and a square-ended chancel. A small part of the church is early Norman (11th century) and an even earlier part appears to have an early Viking influence, which is very unusual for the area. The chancel arch is Romanesque.\n\n\nPreston Deanery Hall and other houses\nAround 1940 Preston Deanery consisted of four semi-detached properties, half a dozen farms and Preston Deanery Hall, once inhabited by monks but since converted to a private residence. During the Second World War one of the houses was occupied by a boy and his mother, who worked as a domestic servant at the Hall. The boy went to school in Hackleton. His experiences are described on the BBC People's War website.\n\n\nPreston Green\nFurther urban expansion of Northampton was being planned in October 2008 with another 13,500 houses and additional infrastructure in the rural areas around Grange Park, Quinton and Preston Deanery however the incoming Conservative-LibDem coalition government of the 2010 General Election has abolished this expansion proposal.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Preston Deanery at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "Gonocephalus doriae (Doria's angle-headed lizard) is a species of arboreal lizard in the family Agamidae. The species is endemic to the island of Borneo.\n\n\nEtymology\nG. doriae is named for Marquis Giacomo Doria (1840–1913), an Italian naturalist, botanist, herpetologist and politician, founder of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale in Genoa (now the Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria) and its director from then until his death.\n\n\nDescription\nG. doriae is usually green on top with dark and light flecks and an indistinct wavy grey pattern, and sometimes with large orange patches. The dewlap/gular pouch is yellow with greyish-blue stripes. There is typically a series of transverse bars on the lower flanks and the ventral surface is lighter. There is a pronounced dorsal crest that is as high as the nuchal crest. It grows to an average snout-vent length of around 165 mm (6.5 in).\n\n\nGeographic range\nDoria's angle-headed lizard is found only in the lowland and hill rainforests of Indonesian Borneo and Malaysian Borneo.\n\n\nBehavior\nG. doriae is diurnal and is typically found perched on the side of a tree or sapling. At night, juveniles and young adults can be found sleeping on the tops of branches with their head pointed back towards the trunk. When threatened, it will often open its mouth, but is generally disinclined to bite.\n\n\nDiet\nThe diet of Doria's angle-headed lizard is not recorded, but likely to be primarily arthropods.\n\n\nReproduction\nG. doriae is oviparous. Little is known about clutch sizes.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThere is some dispute over whether Gonocephalus abbottii represents a full species or is actually a subspecies of G. doriae.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBoulenger GA (1885).

He studied at the Western Reserve Academy and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1873 and a Master of Arts in 1875. He also earned a Bachelor of Divinity from the General Theological Seminary in 1876. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Nashotah House in 1890. Taylor married Cora L.

Upon his return to the United States seven months later, he took charge of the missions of Willoughby, Geneva, and Unionville, all near Cleveland. In September 1877, he was involved in mission work at Highland and Clintondale, in Ulster County, New York. He was ordained priest in the Church of the Transfiguration in New York City on September 30, 1877, by Bishop Horatio Potter of New York.

    "text": "King Follett (or Follet; July 26, 1788 – March 9, 1844) was a Mormon elder and a close friend of Joseph Smith. An early convert to the Church of Christ in 1831, he was a police constable and was notably the last prisoner released in the 1838 Mormon War. Shortly after his death, Smith delivered a notable sermon in memory of Follett in which he introduced new teachings to members of the church which Smith founded.\n\n\nBiography\nFollett was born in Winchester, New Hampshire, on July 24 or 26, 1788. His parents were John Follett IV and Hannah (née Oakes) Alexander. He married Louisa Tanner in 1815. The couple had nine children.\nHe later moved with his family to Cuyahoga County, Ohio. There, he heard the Mormon religion preached, and he and Louisa converted and were baptized in the spring of 1831. By 1833, he had settled, along with many members of the Church, in Missouri, and was living with the Whitmer branch, a large extended family living in Jackson County. That year, he moved to Clay County, Missouri. In 1835, he settled in what would become Caldwell County, Missouri. He was ordained a Mormon elder on January 28, 1836, in Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio. Though it is not confirmed, Follett was likely ordained a high priest in April 1837.\nDuring the so-called 1838 Mormon War, Follett participated in the conflict. He was imprisoned for several months at Richmond and later Columbia. After a long delay, he obtained a trial, where he was honorably discharged and was acquitted of the charges against him. He was the last Mormon detainee of the Missouri conflict to be released from prison. In 1839, Follett moved with his family to Nauvoo, Illinois. There, he worked as a police constable for Hancock County, and according to family lore, as a personal bodyguard for Joseph Smith. Follett was a Freemason and an officer in the Nauvoo Legion.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nFollett died on March 9, 1844, in Nauvoo, aged 55. He was killed when a bucket of rocks fell on his head while he was working on a well. Follett was building the walls of the well, and while other men were lowering the tub of rocks, the rope snapped. He was buried on March 10 with Masonic honors. At his funeral, a procession exceeding one mile in length followed his remains to his house.\nAfter his death, Louisa and the children moved to Iowa. There, some of Follett's children became involved with the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (today the Community of Christ). Several others moved to California. One of his sons joined the Mormon Battalion and went on to help establish Mormon settlements in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\n\nKing Follett discourse\n\nFollett's legacy largely lies with his association with the King Follett discourse. The discourse was delivered on April 7, 1844 by Joseph Smith as a commemorative sermon for Follett. Follett's family and friends had requested that Smith speak in his memory. In it, he introduced new theological teachings including the claim that God was once a mortal man, and that mortal men and women can become gods (a concept commonly called divinization) through salvation and exaltation. The discourse is often seen by Mormons as Smith's greatest sermon.\nThe King Follett discourse is the main source of Follett's notability, and some have written that he would be virtually unknown to history without the famous sermon. However, Follett was also a fairly prominent member of the early Mormon community in his own right. In addition, while most deaths in Nauvoo at the time received 1–3 lines in the newspaper, Follett had two lengthy obituaries published in the Nauvoo Neighbor. Follett was also known for being the last Mormon prisoner released in Missouri, and for his friendship with Joseph Smith, but these distinctions are less prominent than his association with the famous discourse.\n\n\nReferences",

It is named after Judge magazine, which was printed there. It covers a site measuring 92 by 158.4 feet (28.0 by 48.3 m). It was designed by McKim, Mead, and White. The building was acquired by the New York Times Company in 1985, upon which it became occupied mostly by the Times Company magazine, Family Circle.\n\n\nHistory\nThe property was owned by the Goelet family. In May 1922, Mary R. and Robert Goelet obtained a $250,000 loan on the establishment from the\nUnion Dime Savings Bank.\nIn 1889 the Judge Building was expanded at the expense of a piano warehouse owned by William Knabe & Company at 112 Fifth Avenue. After May 1, 1889, the warehouse was absorbed by the newer structure.\nAn exhibition of three thousand dolls was put on at the Judge Building beginning on the night of December 15, 1890. It was the first of its kind in the United States and featured a large Albani doll sent from London by Mademoiselle Albani.\nFrom an historic or cultural point of view, the most famous tenant of the Judge Building (top floor) was probably Gianni Bettini (1860-1938).  He introduced (and soon sold) serious musical recording selections by the early 1890s, especially in the field of Opera and Politics - and possessed examples by Sarah Bernhardt and Mark Twain. He was also a prolific inventor, with many patents to his credit, both US and foreign. He also had commercial connections with the major sound recording companies of the time, such as Edison (National), Columbia, and Norcross; he maintained an extensive network of advertising and supply around the World, in machines, accessories, and records. However, his niche business of catering to the Carriage Trade was essentially ended by the development of \"gold-moulding\" in 1902 - the mass production of cylinder records.\nFormer business establishments also located in the Judge Building included the firm of Sackett, Wilhelms & Company (Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing & Publishing Company), which had a printing press there in 1891.\nIn the mid-1980s the New York Historic Districts Council replaced a rotted out cornice made of light-gauge metal sheets with one composed of molded fiberglass. The new cornice projected from the top of the building in a stepped design, with ornamental blocks (dentils) arranged in a prominent row. The original third floor arches were also rebuilt. The arches were lost in 1903, a year in which three floors were added to the structure.\n\n\nReferences",

She is the author of The Science of Star Wars and is the first person documented saying \"May the 4th Be with You,\" which has led to the creation of \"Star Wars Day\" on May 4.\n\n\nEarly life and scientific career\nCavelos began writing science fiction as a child, but wanted to do something that she felt was more important. Inspired by Charlton Heston in Planet of the Apes, Cavelos decided to study astrophysics with the goal of becoming an astronaut. She went on to receive her BS in astronomy from Michigan State University in 1982.\nCavelos first worked as an astrophysicist and mathematician. She taught astronomy at Michigan State University and Cornell University and worked at the Astronaut Training Museum at NASA's Johnson Space Center.\nHowever, she became dissatisfied with working in astronomy. She realized that she liked thinking about big questions, like the creation of the universe, rather than the smaller issues she had to focus on in research or at NASA. Science-fiction also gave her the ability to have freedom to explore ideas and consequences. This love led to her decision to attend American University to earn her MFA in Creative Writing.\n\n\nEditing and writing careers\nCavelos transitioned into the publishing field, working as a senior editor for Bantam Doubleday Dell. While working there, she launched the Abyss imprint, of horror, and Cutting Edge imprint, of noir literary fiction. She also ran the science fiction/fantasy publishing program and edited a wide range of fiction and nonfiction. As an editor, she became known for discovering and nurturing new authors, and won a World Fantasy Award. She worked with authors including  William F. Nolan, Joan Vinge, Robert Anton Wilson, Dennis Etchison, Tanith Lee, Kathe Koja, Poppy Z. Brite, J. M. Dillard, David Wingrove, Barry Gifford, Patrick McCabe, and Peter Dickinson.\nWhile working at Dell, Cavelos contacted J. Michael Straczynski to discuss the novelizations of Babylon 5. She began the novel line with Dell before leaving publishing to focus on her writing career in 1994. After receiving a form letter with an idea for the book, she set aside the novel that she had been writing and wrote a proposal for the Babylon 5 book, which led to The Shadow Within.\nCavelos then wrote the non-fiction books The Science of the X-files, followed by The Science of Star Wars. In The Science of Star Wars, she possibly coined the phrase \"May the 4th Be with You,\" which has led to the creation of \"Star Wars Day\" on May 4.\nCavelos went on to author the Babylon 5 Passing of the Techno-Mages trilogy.\nIn 2004 Cavelos edited The Many Faces of Van Helsing, an anthology of horror and fantasy stories about Abraham Van Helsing written by masters of the genres. The anthology was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award.\nCavelos has continued to teach, shifting her focus from astronomy and mathematics to creative writing. In 1994, she began teaching advanced fiction writing at Saint Anselm College. In 1996, Cavelos and founded Odyssey Writing Workshops Charitable Trust, a nonprofit that helps fiction writers improve their work. In 2015, Cavelos was nominated for a World Fantasy Award for her work as Odyssey director and instructor. In 2024, Cavelos won a Locus Award for \"Fostering Excellence in Craft & Career\".\n\n\nBibliography\nBabylon 5: The Passing of the Techno-Mages – Casting Shadows\nBabylon 5: The Passing of the Techno-Mages – Summoning Light\nBabylon 5: The Passing of the Techno-Mages – Invoking Darkness\nBabylon 5: The Shadow Within\nThe Science of Star Wars (book)\nThe Science of the X-files\nThe Many Faces of Van Helsing\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nJeanne Cavelos official website\nJeanne Cavelos at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database",

It is remembered mostly for its syntax, yet it had many features beyond those of early Lisps.\nEarly Lisps had many limits, including limited data types and slow numerics. Its use of fully parenthesized notation was also considered a problem. The inventor of Lisp, John McCarthy, expected these issues to be addressed in a later version, called notionally Lisp 2. Hence the name Lisp 1.5 for the successor to the earliest Lisp.\nLisp 2 was a joint project of the System Development Corporation and Information International, Inc., and was intended for the IBM built AN/FSQ-32 military computer. Development later shifted to the IBM 360/67 and the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-6. The project was eventually abandoned.\n\n\nBibliography\nAbrahams, Paul W.; Barnett, Jeffrey A.; Book, Erwin; Firth, Donna; Kameny, Stanley L.; Weissman, Clark; Hawkinson, Lowell; Levin, Michael I.; Saunders, Robert A.

    "title": "Burzio's generalization",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=37203527",
    "text": "In generative linguistics, Burzio's generalization is the observation that a verb can assign a theta role (a title used to describe the relationship between the noun phrase and the predicate, such as agent, theme, and goal) to its subject position if and only if it can assign an accusative case to its object. Accordingly, if a verb does not assign a theta role to its subject, then it does not assign accusative case to its object. The generalization is named after Italian linguist Luigi Burzio, based on work published in the 1980s, but the seeds of the idea are found in earlier scholarship.  The generalization can be logically written in the following equation:               \t\n\n                   \t                    \tθ ↔ A\n         Where:  θ = Subject Theta Role\n                 A = Accusative Case\n\nBurzio's generalization has two major consequences:\n\nBurzio's generalization recognizes two classes of intransitive verbs:\nWith unaccusative intransitive verbs (e.g., fall), the single argument bears the theme theta role, and the subject is understood as the undergoer or receiver of the action. For example, in the sentence Emily fell, the subject Emily undergoes the action of falling.\nWith unergative intransitive verbs (e.g., laugh), the single argument bears the agent theta role and is understood as the doer of the action. For example, in the sentence Emily laughed, the subject Emily performs the action of laughing.\nBurzio's generalization establishes a parallel between unaccusative verbs (referred to as ergative verbs by Burzio) and passives, neither of which assign a subject theta role or accusative case.\nBurzio describes the intransitive occurrence of ergative verbs in the generalization that bears his name:\n\n       \"All and only the verbs that can assign a theta-role to the subject can assign Accusative Case to an object.\"\n\n\nTwo Classes of Intransitive Verbs\n\n\nIntransitives\nBurzio's observations led to two separate classes of intransitive verbs. Burzio claimed that intransitives are not homogenous and exemplified this observation with the following data from Italian:\n\nBoth of the verbs in 1a and 1b are classified as intransitives, they take only one argument. However, what led Burzio to claim that the class of intransitives should be further divided was the distribution of the clitic \"ne\" (of-them).\n\nThe different behaviour of these two intransitive verbs led to the hypothesis that the class of verbs known as intransitives were divided.  Burzio argued that due to the grammatical differences between 2a and 2b, the underlying structures of 1a and 1b must be different.\nIn Italian, it is assumed that there is free subject inversion, which means if a subject appears pre-verb, then it will have a post-verb counterpart. The data in (3) demonstrates this assumption:\n\nBurzio classified the subjects such as in 3b as i-subjects (inverted subjects). It turns out that Ne-Cliticization (Ne-Cl) is only possible with a direct object, but upon further observation, Ne-Cl is also possible with i-subjects that are related to a direct object as is the case with inherently passive verbs. A distributional test for unaccusativity is whether or not it can take a Ne-Cl (see distributional tests below)\nThe distribution of \"ne\" and auxiliary \"essere\" motivated the existence of a class of intransitive verbs named labile verbs. This class of verbs, also known as alternating unaccusatives or alternating ambitransitives, can undergo causative alteration to be used in a transitive form; however, the subject of the intransitive form will become the direct object in the transitive sentence, taking on the theme theta role in both. When these alternating verbs are used transitively, they are referred to as causatives as the subject takes the agent role, and when they are used intransitively, they are referred to as anticausatives as the subject takes the theme role.\nThe following flow chart depicts the difference between the two types of intransitive verbs; unaccusative and unergative.  Unaccusative verbs are subdivided into \"pure unaccusatives\" and alternating unaccusatives (unaccusatives that are able to undergo causative alternation such as labile verbs).  For more information on alternating unaccusatives, see causative alternation.\n\n\nMotivation for Burzio's Generalization\nBurzio's generalization stems from two important observations:\n\nWhy, if verbs should assign accusative case to their objects, does the determiner phrase (DP) that is the complement to an unaccusative verb not receive accusative case.\nUnaccusative verbs lack an (agent) theta role \n\n\nAssignment of Theta Role and Case\n\n\nTheta Role Assignment\nTheta roles (or thematic roles) are bundles of Thematic relations. There are certain theta roles that are more commonly assigned to the subject such as agent and theta roles that are more common to the object such as patient or theme. Subjects of unaccusative verbs bear a theta role that is common to objects, which leads to the hypothesis that in the d-structure the Determiner Phrase subject occupies the object position in the syntactic tree.  The following is a theta grid for the Ergative verb fall, which has the argument structure V[DP___]:\nFall\n\nThe Theta Criterion ensures that there is a one-to-one mapping of theta roles to arguments by stating the following:\n\nEach argument is assigned one and only one theta role, and\nEach theta role must be assigned to an argument.\nThis is important in the context of Burzio's generalization because it requires that all arguments must take a theta role and all theta roles must be assigned. This means that if a verb has a theta role to assign it must assign it.\n\n\nTheta Role Assignment (1980's to 2000)\nIn the 1980s, when Burzio was formulating this generalization; it was understood that the verb assigned the theta role to the subject. Since then, in light of new data such as idiom formation, it is now hypothesized that Voice Phrase assigns the theta role to the subject, and not the verb. In this article we have adopted that the verb assigns the theta role as it was when Burzio was formulating his generalization.\n\n\nAssigning Case\n\nBurzio's Generalization is observable in English, German, and many Romance languages due to a common Case system (Nominative/Accusative).  In nominative/accusative languages the subject of both a transitive verb and an intransitive verb are assigned nominative Case,  and only the object DP of a transitive verb will receive accusative Case.  Case assignment is associated with local dependency and feature checking of a DP.  All DP's must check for Case if and only if they are in the specifier or complement position of the Case assigner. The finite T assigns nominative Case to a subject DP in its specifier position. The verb (V) assigns accusative Case to a DP in the complement position.  A preposition can also assign case (Prepositional Case) to a DP in the complement position.\n\n     α assigns case to β if and only if:\n     α is a verb or preposition\n     β is a specifier/complement to α \n\nIn the Italian language, identifying accusative Case has two requirements; the occurrence of third person accusatives like lo, la and accusative forms of me, te for the first and second person pronouns, differing from their nominative equivalents io and tu. He also states that ergative verbs do not have accusative Case and therefore do not assign accusative Case to the object.  Below, the non-argument subject does not succeed at being correlated to a verbal argument.\n\n\nParallel Between Passives and Unaccusative Verbs\n \nBurzio's Generalization builds off of the cross linguistic similarities observed in passives and unaccusatives, where a verb fails to assign a theta role to the subject and cannot assign accusative Case to the object.   These structures all undergo similar DP movement as a way to satisfy Extended Projection Principle and Case Theory. Extended Projection Principle states that all clauses must contain a DP subject and Case Theory states that all DP's must check for Case in the complement or specifier position.  A theta role is not assigned to the subject position because the subject is underlyingly in the object position during theta role assignment (which happens in the d-structure). Therefore, it has a theta role that is typically given to objects, such as \"theme.\" Verbs in these structures cannot assign accusative Case, therefore the DP must move to the empty specifier position of finite Tense (T) in order to fulfill the subject position and check for Case. Once the DP has moved to the specifier position of Tense Phrase (TP), nominative case is assigned to the DP by the T position. This occurs in the s-structure after the DP has moved from the object position.\n\nIt should not be assumed that labile verbs inherently do not have either accusative case or a subject theta role to assign.  This is exemplified in the transitive counterparts of alternating unaccusatives.  The labile verb can act as a transitive and assigns both an agent theta role to the subject and accusative case to the object (see causative alternation) in an example such as, \"John broke the vase.\" Burzio's Generalization refers only to intransitive ergative verbs such as \"fall\" that can not take a direct object like unergatives and alternating unaccusatives. For example, \"The vase fell\" cannot take a direct object (\"*The vase fell the table.\")\nThe generalization now becomes quite clear. In ergative verbs, if the verb does not assign a theta role to its subject (because in the d-structure this position is empty) then it also does not assign accusative case to its object (because this position is empty in the s-structure, due to DP movement). This is observable only in ergative intransitive verbs.\n\n\nDistributional Tests\nThere are two distributional tests that are used to determine if a verb is ergative; there-inversion and Ne-Cliticizaion.  In each corresponding test, \"there\" or \"ne\" is inserted before the verb and the sentence is tested for grammaticality.  Based on the grammaticality of the sentence the class of verb can be determined.\n\n\nThere-inversion\nThere-inversion is a distributional test introducing a different word order by inserting \"there\" before the verb. This insertion forces the object to remain underlyingly in the object position.  Unaccusative verbs such as \"arrive\" will allow this alternative word order whereas unergative verbs such as \"dance\" will not.  An unergative verb will appear to be ungrammatical because the subject is not generated in the object position.\nThe example below is adapted from Andrew Carnie (2013).\n\n   1a) *There danced three men at the palace.\n   1b) ?There arrived three men at the palace.\n\n\nNe-Cliticization\nIn Italian, Ne-Cliticization is a test to check if a verb is ergative. The example below is adapted from Liliane Haegeman.\n\nIn (1a)due is in the object position and therefore it is possible to have the partitive ne. In (1b) dueis the complement to the preposition which results in the partitive ne making the sentence ungrammatical.\n\nIn (2) there is a passive sentences with inverted post-verbal subjects. Ne-cliticization is possible if we assume that post-verbal subjects are in the object position.\n\nErgatives are structurally the same as passives which leads us to expect that ne-cliticization is possible.\n\n\nContrasts to Burzio's Generalization\nContrasts to Burzio's generalization include ergative–absolutive languages, dative case marking, and English existential, raising, and weather verbs. These construction types are similar in that they all violate the bidirectional relationship in Burzio's generalization that exists between the subject theta role and assigning accusative Case to the object.\n\n\nErgative Absolute Languages\n\nThe Case system in ergative-absolutive languages differs from the Romance languages that Burzio's Generalization is based on.  In ergative/absolute system, the same case (absolutive) is assigned to the object of transitive verbs and subject of intransitive verbs.  Ergative case is assigned to the subjects of transitive verbs. Most languages do not strictly follow either Nom/Acc or Erg/Abs case systems but often use a combination of both systems in different circumstances.\nSubject construction types (including passive and ergative constructions), in languages such as Hindi, have verbs that do not assign accusative case to the object yet still acquire theta roles in the subject position.  The inability of the verb to assign Case is evident by the object that undergoes movement to a higher clause to check for Case which is reflected in the agreement with auxiliaries.  The following example is an ergative subject construction that assigns a theta role to the subject position and yet fails to assign Case to the object.\n\n\nDative Case Marking\nIcelandic is an example of a language that uses lexical categories to determine nominal morphology.   Particular verbs known as quirky case require a certain case only on the nominals that have been assigned theta role and will obscure the underlying morphology.   These verbs create unpredictable patterns of dative morphology assignment.\nBelow are two examples from Esther Torrego that show data case is assigned by a quirky case verb, finish. In example 1, the assignment of dative case is unpredictable by the verb as we would expect to see the object taking accusative case. As in example 2, the subject is taking the dative case where normally we would expect to see nominative case.\n\nThese examples show that the assignment of accusative and nominative are undetectable morphologically speaking.\n\n\nVerbs that fail to assign an external theta role\nVerbs with dethematized subject positions, subjects without theta-roles, cannot be embedded by a control predicate in languages such as English, where pronouns cannot be dropped. Prominent examples are existential, raising, and weather verbs, which cannot assign theta-roles to their subject positions but still assign Case to their objects, conflicting with Burzio's generalization. This is because, for example, weather verbs can take the cognate objects. Unergative verbs can assign case to its following position, whereas unaccusative ones cannot.\nThe sentences below exemplify how weather verbs, intransitive unaccusative verbs, with cognate objects can assign Case to their object positions.\n\n  1)It snowed an artificial kind of snow.\n  2)It rained acid rain.\n\n\nAlternative Analyses\n\n\nErgative generalization\nConstruction types that violate the bidirectional relationship in Burzio's generalization (see Hindi example above) provide evidence that a similar generalization can be made for such languages: the absence of a subject theta role implies that ergative case is unassigned. This is sometimes referred to as the ergative generalization or as Marantz's generalization after linguist Alec Marantz, who first proposed it. His generalization states that even when ergative case may go on the subject of an intransitive clause, ergative case will not appear on a derived subject. Marantz suggests this inconsistency in Burzio's generalization is accounted for by independent factors such as Universal Grammar and language specific construction types. Several attempts have been made to unify this generalization with Burzio's in a larger framework.\n\n\nOptimality Theory\n  Burzio's Generalization can be enforced with ranked and inviolable interacting constraints based on Optimality Theory. Markedness and Faithfulness constraints are ranked to select an optimal candidate.  In an optimality-theory (OT) style of analysis, the argument of an ergative intransitive verb can potentially be assigned either nominative (NOM) or accusative case (ACC). A markedness constraint, which ranks ACC above NOM, prevents ACC from surfacing on the subject.  A faithfulness constraint, which prohibits an argument from bearing multiple cases, prevents NOM and ACC from being assigned to the same argument. Case on the argument is ranked highly on the tableau.  In addition, a faithfulness constraint (FAITHLEX, which requires the inherent Case-licensing must be checked) must be ranked highly in the tableau. Constraint definitions: *ACCUSATIVE: assign a violation mark to an unaccusative verb with accusative Case. *NOMINATIVE: assign a violation mark to an unaccusative verb with Nominative Case.\n\n\nNominalization\nBurzio believes that Case absorption of object case removes an agent project from the subject position which can apply from within the VP to the specifier of AP(-able) to the specifier of NP(-ity) to the specifier of the DP. It has been argued that lexical rules obey syntactic constraints and that feature-movement occurs within the lexicon.\n\n\nAbbreviations\n3- Third person\nERG-Ergative\nF- Female\nFUT- Future\nIMPERF- imperfect\nM- Masculine\nPERF - Perfect\nPST- Past\nPTCP- Participle\nPRS- present\nPL- Plural\nSG- Singular\nREMPST- Remote Past\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nBurzio, Luigi (1986).

He impressed the manager against friendlies with Southampton, Atalanta and Lorient; therefore, he was soon included in the starting line-up. On 12 August, Kerkez made his debut against West Ham United in a 1–1 home draw on the first matchday of the 2023–24 Premier League season. He was sent off against Wolverhampton Wanderers and, as a result, he had to miss three matches. Although the club appealed against his red card, the FA rejected it.\n\n\n2024–25 season\n\nKerkez was voted player of the month for August at Bournemouth. On 2 November 2024, he provided two assists, one to Antoine Semenyo and another one to Evanilson, in a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. On 30 November 2024, Kerkez scored his first goal for Bournemouth in a 4–2 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. In November, his goal was voted goal of the month for Bournemouth. On 4 January 2025, he provided an assist to David Brooks in a 1–0 victory over Everton in the 2024–25 Premier League season. On 18 January 2025, he scored the fourth goal in a 4–1 victory over Newcastle United at St James' Park in the 96th minute. Kerkez was voted the player of the month in March for Bournemouth.\nOn 19 June 2025, it was announced that Kerkez was one of six nominees for the PFA Young Player of the Year award.\n\n\nLiverpool\nOn 26 June 2025, Kerkez joined Liverpool on a five-year deal, for a fee believed to be £40m. He played his first official match in a defeat on penalties to Crystal Palace in the 2025 FA Community Shield match at  Wembley Stadium. His debut at Anfield ended with a 4–2 victory over his previous club, Bournemouth, on 15 August 2025. Kerkez started the match then was substituted for Andy Robertson in the 60th minute. On 25 October, he scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 3–2 away defeat against Brentford in the Premier League.\n\n\nInternational career\n\nKerkez was eligible to play for both the Hungary and Serbia national teams. He represented Hungary at both under-17 and under-21 level, before being called up to the Hungary senior team in June 2022, when he was named on the substitutes bench for a 2022–23 UEFA Nations League match against England. On 23 September 2022, Kerkez made his first appearance for Hungary, playing the full match at left wing-back as the team beat Germany 1–0 in Leipzig.\nOn 16 November 2023, Kerkez received a red card in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match against Bulgaria. However, his expulsion did not affect negatively the outcome of the match since Hungary qualified for the UEFA Euro 2024. In an interview, Hungarian captain Dominik Szoboszlai said that Kerkez \"was told in three distinct languages not to do anything stupid\" during the match against Bulgaria.\nOn 14 May 2024, Kerkez was named in Hungary's squad for UEFA Euro 2024. In Hungary's opening match of the tournament against Switzerland, he played 79 minutes before being substituted for Martin Ádám as the team were beaten 3–1 in Cologne. In doing so, he became the youngest player to make an appearance for Hungary at a UEFA European Championship since Zoltán Varga and Ferenc Bene played in the 1964 third-place play-off. He went on to start against both Germany and Scotland as Hungary finished third in Group A.\n\n\nPersonal life\nKerkez said in an interview, published by Nemzeti Sport, that both his Serbian father and his Hungarian grandmother wanted him to represent Hungary. His brother Marko Kerkez is also a professional footballer.\nKerkez was born in Vrbas, Serbia. He speaks Serbian, Hungarian, English and German.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\nAs of match played 9 November 2025\n\n\nInternational\nAs of match played 13 November 2025\n\n\nHonours\nIndividual\n\nPremier League Fan Team of the Season: 2024–25\nThe Athletic Premier League Team of the Season: 2024–25\nPFA Team of the Year: 2024–25 Premier League\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nProfile at the Liverpool F.C. website\nMilos Kerkez at the Hungarian Football Federation (in Hungarian) \nMilos Kerkez – UEFA competition record (archive)",

    "text": "Microinjection is the use of a glass micropipette to inject a liquid substance at a microscopic or borderline macroscopic level.  The target is often a living cell but may also include intercellular space. Microinjection is a simple mechanical process usually involving an inverted microscope with a magnification power of around 200x (though sometimes it is performed using a dissecting stereo microscope at 40–50x or a traditional compound upright microscope at similar power to an inverted model).\nFor processes such as cellular or pronuclear injection the target cell is positioned under the microscope and two micromanipulators—one holding the pipette and one holding a microcapillary needle usually between 0.5 and 5 μm in diameter (larger if injecting stem cells into an embryo)—are used to penetrate the cell membrane and/or the nuclear envelope.  In this way the process can be used to introduce a vector into a single cell. Microinjection can also be used in the cloning of organisms, in the study of cell biology and viruses, and for treating male subfertility through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI,  IK-see).\n\n\nHistory\nThe use of microinjection as a biological procedure began in the early twentieth century, although even through the 1970s it was not commonly used. By the 1990s, its use had escalated significantly and it is now considered a common laboratory technique, along with vesicle fusion, electroporation, chemical transfection, and viral transduction, for introducing a small amount of a substance into a small target.\n\n\nBasic types\nThere are two basic types of microinjection systems.  The first is called a constant flow system and the second is called a pulsed flow system.  In a constant flow system, which is relatively simple and inexpensive though clumsy and outdated, a constant flow of a sample is delivered from a micropipette and the amount of the sample which is injected is determined by how long the needle remains in the cell.  This system typically requires a regulated pressure source, a capillary holder, and either a coarse or a fine micromanipulator.  A pulsed flow system, however, allows for greater control and consistency over the amount of sample injected: the most common arrangement for intracytoplasmic sperm injection includes an Eppendorf \"Femtojet\" injector coupled with an Eppendorf \"InjectMan\", though procedures involving other targets usually take advantage of much less expensive equipment of similar capability.  Because of its increased control over needle placement and movement and in addition to the increased precision over the volume of substance delivered, the pulsed flow technique usually results in less damage to the receiving cell than the constant flow technique.  However, the Eppendorf line, at least, has a complex user interface and its particular system components are usually much more expensive than those necessary to create a constant flow system or than other pulsed flow injection systems.\n\n\nPronuclear injection\n\nPronuclear injection is a technique used to create transgenic organisms by injecting genetic material into the nucleus of a fertilized oocyte.  This technique is commonly used to study the role of genes using mouse animal models.\n\n\nPronuclear injection in mice\nThe pronuclear injection of mouse sperm is one of the two most common methods for producing transgenic animals (along with the genetic engineering of embryonic stem cells).  In order for pronuclear injection to be successful, the genetic material (typically linear DNA) must be injected while the genetic material from the oocyte and sperm are separate (i.e., the pronuclear phase). In order to obtain these oocytes, mice are commonly superovulated using gonadotrophins.   Once plugging has occurred, oocytes are harvested from the mouse and injected with the genetic material.  The oocyte is then implanted in the oviduct of a pseudopregnant animal. While efficiency varies, 10-40% of mice born from these implanted oocytes may contain the injected construct.   Transgenic mice can then be bred to create transgenic lines.\n\n\nSee also\nTransgenesis\nGenetically modified mouse\nBiology: The Unity and Diversity of Life\nNanoinjection\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Captain William Bowie was an early colonist in the Province of Maryland and an American Revolutionary, a member of the Assembly of Freemen, and a delegate to the Annapolis Convention (1774–1776).\n\n\nEarly life\nCaptain William Bowie was the son of John Bowie, Sr. and Mary Mulliken. Bowie was born in about 1721 at the home of his parents, Brookridge a few miles from Nottingham in Prince George's County, Maryland.  His father purchased a large tract of land about two miles from Nottingham for him when he was twenty one years called \"Brooke's Reserve\" which later became known as \"Mattaponi\". Here he erected a large brick house.\nIt is probable that William Bowie commanded one of the militia organizations maintained by the Province though no record of his commission has been discovered.\nIn 1753 he was appointed tobacco inspector for Nottingham and later a justice of the peace, a member of St Paul's vestry, and in 1767 warden of the parish.\nIn 1770 it was rumored that ships were en route from Great Britain loaded with European goods and might soon be expected to reach the Patuxent River.  The inhabitants of Prince George county thought it necessary to  prohibit the landing of these cargoes and called a meeting for April 10, 1770 at Upper Marlboro, selecting representatives to keep an eye upon events and to provide guards at points on the Patuxent where ships were likely to land.  Only the most resolute and responsible citizens were delegated by the people for this purpose and the ones for Patuxent or Nottingham were William Bowie and his brother Allen Bowie.\n\n\nAssembly of Freemen\nWilliam Bowie was a delegate sent from Prince George's County to the Annapolis Convention, June 22, 1774 which passed strong resolutions in favor of upholding the rights of the Province if necessary by force of arms against Great Britain.  In November of the same year a meeting of freeholders was held at Upper Marlboro where a committee was appointed which was instructed to see that the resolutions of the Continental Congress were enforced within Prince George county Among the men selected for this committee were William Bowie and his brother Allen Bowie as well as Walter Bowie and Robert Bowie who were William's sons.\nThe latter was also placed on a committee of correspondence and it was further resolved that Captain William Bowie and Walter Bowie with others are selected as delegates of this county to attend a convention to be held at Annapolis and are authorized to vote in the convention for delegates to attend a congress which will assemble at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the 10th of May the next year.  In June 1775 these representatives met at Annapolis and on July 26, 1775 this convention issued the Declaration of the Association of the Freemen.\nOn September 12, 1775, he and his son Robert were authorized to enroll a company of minutemen, but what further part Bowie took during the Revolution is unclear. \n\n\nPersonal life\nCaptain William Bowie married Margaret Sprigg in 1745.  They had seven children, Elizabeth born in 1746, Walter Bowie, Robert Bowie, William Bowie, Osborn Sprigg Bowie, Ann Bowie, David Bowie and Margaret Sprigg Bowie.\n\n\nTreatment of slaves\nAccording to Parson Rezin Williams, bishop of the United Methodist Church who was enslaved by the Bowie family, slaves at Bowie mostly lived in cabins made of slabs running up and down and crudely furnished.  Working time was from sunrise until sunset.  The slaves had no money to spend and few masters allowed them to indulge in a religious meeting or even learn about the Bible.\n\n\nExternal links\nImage and Text of Proceedings in Maryland Archives\n\n\nReferences",

She represented her country at the Summer Olympics in 2004, 2008 and 2012. She won the silver medal over 60 meters at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships in a time of 6.97 seconds; a subsequent drug test revealed a banned substance in her system and she was stripped of her medal.\nJones-Ferrette competed at the World Championships in Athletics in 2005, 2007 and 2009, but did not reach an event final on any of those occasions. Her first international medal came at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, where she was the 100 m silver medalist. She represented her country at the 2007 Pan American Games. She holds all the US Virgin Islands records for the sprint events from 60 to 400 meters.\n\n\nCareer\nShe grew up on Saint Croix and later moved to the United States on an athletic scholarship. She attended Barton County Community College and was coached by Lance Brauman, who also coached Tyson Gay and Veronica Campbell. She attended the University of Oklahoma and represented the Oklahoma Sooners in the NCAA Championships before graduating in 2003. She made her Olympic debut at the 2004 Athens Olympics, reaching the second round in both the 100 m and 200 m. She was one of only two athletes from the country to compete in the athletics competition that year and was chosen to be the 2004 Olympic flag bearer for the US Virgin Islands.\nShe came fourth in the 100 m at the 2005 CAC Championships and ran at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics later that season, reaching the semi-finals of the 200 m. She also reached the semi-final stage of the 60 m at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships. At the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games she entered both the 100 m and 200 m – she just missed out on a medal in the 200 m, finishing fourth, but was the runner-up in the 100 m, taking the silver medal behind Tahesia Harrigan. In 2007, she competed at the Pan American Games for the first time and was seventh in the women's 100 m final. She reached the 200 m semis for a second time running at the World Championships in Osaka.\nJones-Ferrette represented the US Virgin Islands at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing competing at the 100 metres sprint. In her first round heat she placed third behind Kerron Stewart and Ezinne Okparaebo in a time of 11.41 to advance to the second round. There she failed to qualify for the semi-finals as her time of 11.55 was only the fifth time of her heat, causing elimination.\nShe further improved her 100 and 200 meter national records at the Grande Prêmio Brasil Caixa meeting in May 2009. Breaking both records in just over an hour, she ran 11.18 in the 100 m and 22.49 seconds in the 200 m. She competed at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics but she just missed out on making the 200 metres final. She ended the year with seventh-place finishes in the sprints at the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.\nJones-Ferrette made a strong start to 2010, building up to the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships by running the fastest 60 m time recorded in eleven years. Her time of 6.97 seconds made her the sixth fastest woman over the distance and even she was surprised to have run such a quick time. An absence from competition that summer was later explained when she announced that she and her husband, Stephen Ferrette, were expecting a child. However, on December 16, 2010, it was made public that she was banned from competition for 6 months from April to October of the same year due to a positive test of a banned substance, as well as had her world indoor medal stripped. She stated though that the substance was used to help her fertility.\nShe competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing in 9th in the 200 m and in 14th in the 100 m, not qualifying for either final.\n\n\nCompetition record\n\n\nPersonal bests\n60 meters - 6.97 s (2010) - national record.\n100 meters - 11.07 s (2012) - national record.\n200 meters - 22.46 s (2009) - national record.\n400 meters - 51.47 s (2007) - national record.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nLaVerne Jones-Ferrette at World Athletics \nTilastopaja biography",

That is why the correction to the variance is negative.  The reason why the uncorrected estimate of the variance is an overestimate is that the error is negatively correlated with the observation.  For the uniform distribution, the error is uncorrelated with the observation, so a correction should be +c2/12, which is the variance of the error itself rather than −c2/12.  Thus Sheppard's correction is biased in favor of population distributions in which the error is negatively correlated with the observation.\nThe cumulants of the sum of the grouped variable and the uniform variable are the sums of the cumulants. As odd cumulants of a uniform distribution are zero; only even moments are affected.\nThe second and fourth cumulants of the uniform distribution on (−0.5c, 0.5c) are respectively, c2/12 and −c4/120.\nThe correction to moments can be derived from the relation between cumulants and moments.\n\n\nReferences\nSheppard, W.F.

    "text": "Kristófer Ingi Kristinsson (born 7 April 1999) is an Icelandic professional footballer who plays as a forward for Breiðablik.\n\n\nClub career\n\n\nStjarnan\nA product of the Stjarnan youth academy, Kristófer grew to become an Icelandic youth international while playing for their youth teams. He attracted the interest of Eredivisie club SC Heerenveen, trialling with the side in 2014. At the age of 16, he made his debut as a substitute for Stjarnan's first team during a 3–2 away loss to Keflavík on 9 March 2016 in the Icelandic League Cup.\n\n\nWillem II\nOn 12 July 2016, Kristófer signed a three-year contract with Eredivisie club Willem II, making his league debut on 25 February 2018 during a 1–0 home win over Roda JC Kerkrade, replacing Bartholomew Ogbeche in injury time. He scored his first goal for the club, as well as his first goal in professional football, on 15 September 2018 in a league match against Excelsior, completing Willem II's late comeback by scoring the 2–2 equalizer.\n\n\nGrenoble\nKristófer refused to extend his expiring contract with Willem II in 2019 and, despite interest from PSV Eindhoven, opted to sign with French Ligue 2 club Grenoble on 18 June 2019. He made his debut for the club on 8 November 2019, replacing Florian Raspentino in the 76th minute of a 0–0 draw against Le Mans.\nOne year after joining Grenoble, he would move to PSV after all, when he was sent on a one-season loan to their reserve team Jong PSV competing in the second-tier Eerste Divisie. With eight goals in 32 appearances, Kristófer became the top goalscorer for Jong PSV in the 2020–21 season.\n\n\nSønderjyskE\nOn 25 July 2021, Kristófer signed a three-year contract with Danish Superliga club SønderjyskE. He made his debut for the club the following day, coming off the bench for Jeppe Simonsen in the 77th minute in a 1–0 home win in the league. Kristófer had limited success at the club, scoring no goals in 20 league appearances, as SønderjyskE suffered relegation to the Danish 1st Division in the 2021–22 season. On 1 September 2022, the club confirmed that they had terminated Kristófer's contract after mutual agreement.\n\n\nVVV-Venlo\nOn 5 September 2022, Kristófer joined Eerste Divisie club VVV-Venlo on a one-year contract, with an option for an additional season. He made his debut for VVV against his former club Jong PSV on 16 September, replacing Nick Venema in the 63rd minute of a 1–1 home draw at De Koel. He left VVV at the end of the season, as his contract was not extended.\n\n\nBreiðablik\nOn 4 August 2023, Kristófer joined Breiðablik until the end of 2023. He made his first ever European appearance for Breiðablik on 31 August, replacing Klæmint Olsen in the 75th minute of the play-off round of the UEFA Europa Conference League, which ended in a 1–0 victory over Struga. This win secured Breiðablik becoming the first Icelandic football club to play in the group stage of a major UEFA-organised European competition.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nClub\nAs of match played 28 September 2023\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nKristófer Kristinsson at Soccerway.com\nKristófer Kristinsson at FBref.com\nKristófer Kristinsson at kicker (in German)\nKristófer Kristinsson at Olympedia",

    "text": "Hylaeus modestus, also known as the modest masked bee, is a species of hymenopteran in the family Colletidae. It is found in North America.\n\n\nBehavior\nHylaeus modestus was discovered to have a special secretion that they produce from their Dufour's gland. The secretion has a unique chemical compound containing high concentrations of ethyl esters (ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, ethyl eicosanate, and ethyl docosanate), which provides extra nutrition to the larvae. Adults apply the secretion on the cell walls of their brood chambers, and the larvae feed on the secretions to obtain the energy needed to pupate and become adults before the other bee species out-compete them for resources.\nH. modestus has been found to exhibit gynandromorphism, which is a rare occurrence among bee species. Specifically, the observed specimen demonstrated bilaterally asymmetric male and female characteristics except for the male genitalia.\nIt is a generalist forager, and it nests in stems and cavities.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading",

    "text": "Data collection system (DCS) is a computer application that facilitates the process of data collection, allowing specific, structured information to be gathered in a systematic fashion, subsequently enabling data analysis to be performed on the information. Typically a DCS displays a form that accepts data input from a user and then validates that input prior to committing the data to persistent storage such as a database.\nMany computer systems implement data entry forms, but data collection systems tend to be more complex, with possibly many related forms containing detailed user input fields, data validations, and navigation links among the forms.\nDCSs can be considered a specialized form of content management system (CMS), particularly when they allow the information being gathered to be published, edited, modified, deleted, and maintained. Some general-purpose CMSs include features of DCSs.\n\n\nImportance\nAccurate data collection is essential to many business processes, to the enforcement of many government regulations, and to maintaining the integrity of scientific research.\nData collection systems are an end-product of software development. Identifying and categorizing software or a software sub-system as having aspects of, or as actually being a \"Data collection system\" is very important. This categorization allows encyclopedic knowledge to be gathered and applied in the design and implementation of future systems. In software design, it is very important to identify generalizations and patterns and to re-use existing knowledge whenever possible.\n\n\nTypes\nGenerally the computer software used for data collection falls into one of the following categories of practical application.\n\nSurveys or questionnaires\nData registries\nCase management systems\nPerformance measurement systems\nExams and quizzes\nOnline forms and form filing and reporting systems\n\n\nVocabulary\nThere is a taxonomic scheme associated with data collection systems, with readily-identifiable synonyms used by different industries and organizations. Cataloging the most commonly used and widely accepted vocabulary improves efficiencies, helps reduce variations, and improves data quality.\nThe vocabulary of data collection systems stems from the fact that these systems are often a software representation of what would otherwise be a paper data collection form with a complex internal structure of sections and sub-sections. Modeling these structures and relationships in software yields technical terms describing the hierarchy of data containers, along with a set of industry-specific synonyms.\n\n\nCollection synonyms\nA collection (used as a noun) is the topmost container for grouping related documents, data models, and datasets. Typical vocabulary at this level includes the terms:\n\n\nData model synonyms\nEach document or dataset within a collection is modeled in software. Constructing these models is part of designing or \"authoring\" the expected data to be collected. The terminology for these data models includes:\n\n\nSub-collection or master-detail synonyms\nData models are often hierarchical, containing sub-collections or master–detail structures described with terms such as:\n\n\nData element synonyms\nAt the lowest level of the data model are the data elements that describe individual pieces of data. Synonyms include:\n\n\nData point synonyms\nMoving from the abstract, domain modelling facet to that of the concrete, actual data: the lowest level here is the data point within a dataset. Synonyms for data point include:\n\n\nDataset synonyms\nFinally, the synonyms for dataset include:\n\n\nSee also\nData management\nSurvey data collection\nCase report form\nSafety data sheet\nData mining\nWeb mining\nCrowdsourcing\nCollaborative software\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",

This species is resident in Australia where numbers are believed to be in decline. A subspecies, the Abrolhos painted buttonquail (Turnix varius scintillans), is endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos islands.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe painted buttonquail was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Perdix varia. \n\"Painted buttonquail\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOU).\nTwo subspecies are recognised.\nThe possibly-extinct New Caledonian buttonquail (Turnix novaecaledoniae) of New Caledonia was formerly considered a third subspecies, but was split as a distinct species by the IOC in 2021.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe painted buttonquail is about 19 to 20 cm (7.5 to 7.9 in) long. It is a ground-dwelling bird and is found in grassy forests and woodlands.  It feeds on insects and seeds, and the males incubate the eggs for a fortnight and then care for the young.\nThe female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes.  Her eyes are red, and her crown, face and breast are flecked with white.  Her shoulders are chestnut with thin white streaking above them.  The male is slightly smaller and duller in colour.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe painted buttonquail is native to Australia. Its range extends from Queensland southwards to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A separate population is present in the southwestern part of Western Australia. The subspecies Turnix varius scintillans is endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos islands off the west coast of Australia. \nThe painted buttonquail became established on Rottnest Island around 2002.\n\n\nStatus\nThe painted buttonquail has a wide range. An estimate of the population size has not been made but numbers are suspected to be in decline. It is said to be common in suitable habitat in some areas and uncommon in others. The IUCN has listed it as being of \"Least Concern\".\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Turnix varius at Wikimedia Commons\n Data related to Turnix varius at Wikispecies\nPainted buttonquail (Turnix varius) (Latham, 1801) Avibase 2009",

Their relations have been highly represented with a close diplomatic partnership, with Slovenia being one of the staunch supporters of Georgia's territorial integrity and pro-Western path. Slovenia is a member of the EU, which Georgia applied for in 2022. Both nations are members of the COE. And Slovenia is with Montenegro is Sectoral dialogue partner countries of the BSCE.\n\n\nHistory\nThe diplomatic relations between Georgia and Slovenia were established on 18 January 1993:, less than two years after the independence of both states (Georgia from the USSR and Slovenia from Yugoslavia). Slovenia has consistently supported Georgia's territorial integrity in the face of Russia's military occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2008, Prime Minister Janez Janša of Slovenia stated following a meeting with his Czech and Latvian counterparts in the aftermath of the Russo-Georgian War, We are united on the need to ensure peace, stability, territorial integrity in Georgia and the broader region and to give the region a European perspective.\nSlovenia was one of the several nations to call on Russia to follow its ceasefire obligations during a 2015 Council of Europe meeting and to withdraw its military troops from Abkhazia and South Ossetia. That same year, Slovenia became the 21st member state of the European Union to ratify in a 69–3 vote of its National Assembly the EU-Georgia Association Agreement. Slovenia has consistently voted in favor of the Georgia-sponsored United Nations resolution calling for the return of internally displaced persons to Abkhazia and South Ossetia since 2008.\nBilateral ties have been enhanced by the high amount of high-level meetings and visits between the two countries. While Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili held several meetings with the Slovenian Foreign Affairs Minister, President Giorgi Margvelashvili became the first Georgian head of state to pay an official visit to Slovenia in July 2016, during which bilateral agreements were signed on economic cooperation and visa liberalization and a \"Bench of Friendship\" was inaugurated on Ljubljana's Tbilisi Street.\nOn 26 May 2018, to celebrate the 100 years since the independence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, the Ljubljana Castle was lit up with Georgia's red and white flag colors.\nAs a member of NATO, Slovenia has consistently supported Georgia's attempt to seek closer relations and an ultimate membership with the Organization. Slovenian military experts participated in the 2017 Noble Partner military exercises in Georgia.\nOn 13 June 2019, Slovenia became the 14th country of the Schengen Zone to recognize Georgia as a \"safe country\", highlighting Georgia's political and economic reforms, and thus removing Georgian citizens' right to seek asylum in Slovenia.\nBoth countries' capitals, Ljubljana and Tbilisi, have a sister city partnership, as well as Georgia's Kutaisi and Slovenia's Maribor.\n\n\nDiplomatic missions\n\nGeorgia appointed its first ambassador to Slovenia in 2001, when it accredited its ambassador to Austria to also cover its relations with Ljubljana. Following a short period in 2004 when the Georgian ambassador operated from Georgia itself and then from Slovakia, an embassy of Georgia was opened in 2014 in Slovenia. Notable heads of the mission have been:\n\n2001–2004: Giorgi Arsenishvili (residence in Vienna)\nSlovenia accredited its first ambassador to Georgia in 1999. Until 2007, the Slovenian ambassador resided in Athens. Since then, the ambassador of Slovenia to Ukraine in Kiev has also covered Georgia.\n\n\nBilateral agreements\nGeorgia and Slovenia have signed seven bilateral agreements, including\n\nProtocol on Cooperation between the MFA of Georgia and the MFA of the Republic of Slovenia, signed in April 2002 and enforced since January 2008\nAgreement between the Executive Authority of Georgia and the Government of the Republic of Slovenia on Cooperation in the Fields of Culture, Education, Science, Sport, and Youth, signed in April 2002 and enforced since December 2005\nAgreement between Georgia and the Republic of Slovenia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, signed in December 2012 and enforced since September 2013.\nMemorandum of Understanding between the Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Georgia and Slovenia, signed in 2016.\nTwo more bilateral agreements were signed during Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili's official visit to Slovenia in 2016, notably on economic cooperation and on visa liberalization between Georgia and Slovenia.\n\n\nResident diplomatic missions\nGeorgia has an embassy in Ljubljana.\nSlovenia has a non resident ambassador in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of Georgia\nForeign relations of Slovenia\n\n\nReferences",

Collaboration with other theatre organisations is a feature of the company’s work; since 2010 the company has co-produced every show it has worked on with either a venue or a touring partner.\n\n\nHistory\nPaines Plough was formed over a pint of Paines bitter in the Plough pub in Bolnhurst, Bedford, by writer David Pownall, director John Adams, with the actor Chris Crooks. Their first play Crates on Barrels, written by Pownall for Crooks to perform, opened at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1975. In 1976, the company achieved further success with Pownall’s play, Music to Murder By, leading to a Fringe First and Arts Council funding.\nIn 2019, the joint artistic directors Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett were approached by producer Ellie Keel to co-found an award for female and non-binary playwrights. They launched the Women's Prize for Playwriting together at the end of that year and have continued their support for the prize since then, co-producing the 2021 winners Reasons You Should(n't) Love Me by Amy Trigg and You Bury Me by Ahlam, and the 2022 winner Consumed by Karis Kelly which will tour in 2025.\n\n\nArtistic directors\n\n\nRoundabout\nRoundabout is Paines Plough's touring in-the-round auditorium.

He was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and attended the University of Notre Dame. He was married to Alicia Craig, also an American distance runner.\n\n\nRunning career\n\n\nHigh school\nRyan Shay attended Central Lake High School in Central Lake, Michigan, home of the Trojans, from 1993 to 1997. He won every cross country meet he competed following the third meet of his freshman year (1993), including four consecutive Class-D MHSAA Lower Peninsula (LP) state cross country meets from 1993 to 1996.  He was a three-time consecutive Class D MHSAA LP state champion in the 1600-meter and 3200-meter runs from his sophomore through senior track seasons (1995 through 1997), and also won the Class-D MHSAA LP state title in the 800-meter run as a sophomore. He was also his class valedictorian.\n\n\nCollegiate\nShay continued running as a student-athlete at the University of Notre Dame in the fall of 1997, majoring in economics and competing in both cross country and track. He was a 9-time All-American while competing at Notre Dame. Shay was the first Notre Dame runner to win an NCAA individual title, winning the 10,000-meter run at the 2001 NCAA outdoor meet in a time of 29:05.44.  Shay graduated as the school record holder in both the indoor and outdoor 5,000-meter runs, as well as the 10,000-meter run. He graduated in the top of his class.\n\n\nPost-collegiate/professional\nFollowing college, Shay ran professionally, winning races at various distances, including marathon, half-marathon, 20 km and 15 km. Shay also competed during the 2005 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, finishing 15th in the men's individual race. Shay finished in 23rd place in the 2004 Men's Olympic Marathon Trials.\n\n\nUSA Running Circuit\nShay was a five-time road national champion in the 15 km, 20 km, marathon and twice in the half marathon. In 2003 after winning both the USA Half Marathon Championships and the USA Marathon Championships as well as placing third in the USA 25 km Championships and the USA 5 km Championships Shay was named the 2003 USA Running Circuit Champion. Shay repeated as the USA Running Circuit Champion in 2004 after winning both the USA Half Marathon Championships and the USA 20 km Championships as well as finishing second in the USA 25 km Championships and USA 5 km Championships and placing third at the USA 10 Mile Championships. In 2005 Shay came in second place in the USA Running Circuit Championships standings, third in 2006 and 10th in 2007.\n\n\nDeath\n\nOn November 3, 2007, during the US Olympic marathon trials in New York City, Shay collapsed approximately 5+1⁄2 miles (8.9 km) into the race at 8:06 a.m. He was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8:46 a.m. Doctors at the hospital who examined him reported that he died of heart failure due to cardiac arrhythmia, due to a pre-existing enlarged heart condition.  Autopsy results were initially inconclusive, leading to speculation over other possibilities for his death.\nOn March 18, 2008, Ellen Borakove, the Director of Public Affairs of the New York Chief Medical Examiner's Office released the following statement to Joe Shay, Ryan's father, regarding his final autopsy results:\n\"Cardiac arrhythmia due to cardiac hypertrophy with patchy fibrosis of undetermined etiology.

    "text": "Antonio Manuel Pérez (born 1947) is a businessman from Spain, former CEO of Eastman Kodak Company, based in Rochester, New York, in the United States.\n\n\nEducation\nAn American citizen born in Vigo, Spain, Perez studied electronic engineering, marketing, and business in Spain and France, graduating from the Technical University of Madrid (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid). He subsequently earned an MBA at INSEAD. In 2009, he received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Rochester.\n\n\nPre-Kodak years\nPrior to joining Eastman Kodak, Antonio Pérez spent 25 years working at Hewlett Packard; at the end of this time he was corporate vice president and a member of the company's executive council. In his career, Perez has held a variety of positions in research and development, sales, manufacturing, marketing and management both in Europe and the United States. Immediately prior to joining Kodak, Perez served as an independent consultant for large investment firms, providing counsel on the effect of technology shifts on financial markets. From June 2000 to December 2001, Perez was president and chief executive officer of Gemplus International. Perez served as a director of Schering-Plough Corporation from 2007 through November 2009 and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. from 2004 to 2007.\n\n\nStint at Eastman Kodak\nPérez was named president of Kodak on April 2, 2003. On May 19, 2005 Pérez was named CEO of Kodak after the retirement of Daniel Carp. On January 1, 2006, he became chairman of the company's board of directors.\nUnder Perez, who joined Kodak from Hewlett-Packard in 2003 and became chief executive in 2005, the company tried to reinvent itself by focusing on printers, packaging and work force software. Perez financed those efforts with billions in licensing fees from Kodak's intellectual property, but analysts warned that Kodak was burning through cash too quickly and could eventually run out.\n\n The price of Kodak shares decreased under his leadership from around 25 dollars (in 2005) to less than 1 dollar by September 30, 2011, and the number of Kodak employees has shrunk to about 7,000 in and around Rochester, New York, where Kodak is headquartered. Pérez was named one of the worst CEOs of 2011 by several financial news sources and publications including CNBC and the Motley Fool.\n\n\nKodak bankruptcy\nOn January 19, 2012 Kodak officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, under which the company had until February, 2013 to provide an acceptable restructuring plan.\nIn a video message, Antonio Pérez was quoted as saying, “What everyone should expect from Kodak is business as usual.” Many business critics point out that \"business as usual\" is the problem with the Kodak Business model. They questioned how Kodak would emerge from bankruptcy as a viable company since it has not yet proved that its turnaround strategy, focusing on consumer and commercial printers, can turn a profit.\nShannon Cross, an analyst who has had a sell rating on Kodak since 2001, said the problem for Kodak was that its core businesses had not been making money and the company had been living off licensing fees for intellectual property. “To me it’s not clear that the pieces that will be left at the end make sense as a stand-alone company,” she said. “It’s sad that it happened. It’s not a surprise, the way it’s been managed.”\nIn explaining the bankruptcy, Perez said his turnaround efforts were hurt by the recession, which slowed new business growth and expedited the decline of the film business. He said the objectives of the reorganization included obtaining new financing to shore up confidence in Kodak, selling some of the company's patents and adjusting “legacy” costs – like health care benefits for retirees – to the company's now smaller size.\n“Kodak is taking a significant step toward enabling our enterprise to complete its transformation,” he said in prepared remarks. Under the leadership of Pérez, Eastman Kodak Co. announced on February 9, 2012 that it would stop making digital cameras, pocket video cameras and digital picture frames in a move that would mark the end of an era for the then 120-year-old company.\n\n\nAwards, recognitions, and controversy\nPérez received the 2008 Corporate Distinguished Achievement Award from the B’nai B’rith International for his humanitarian works and services.  In 2009, Pérez received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Rochester during the presidency of Joel Seligman.  Also, in 2009, Antonio Pérez was named one of the Top 10 CEO's \"To Go\", according to 247wallst.com. Criticized for being one of the worst CEO's in the nation, citing the decline of Eastman Kodak during his stint as CEO.\nIn February 2011, Perez was appointed to President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. He is also a founding board member of Change the Equation, a CEO-led initiative to move the U.S. to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\"Kodak names Antonio Perez president, chief operating officer\".

    "text": "Turbonilla almejasensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.\n\n\nDescription\nThe milk-white shell is slender and has an elongate conic shape. Its length measures 8 mm. The 2½ whorls of the protoconch are well rounded, forming a moderately elevated spire, the axis of which is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which the tilted spire is one-fifth immersed.\nThe type specimen has 12 or 13 (the first is probably lost)  whorls in the teleoconch. The early whorls are flattened, the later ones well rounded. All have the summit feebly shouldered. The whorls are ornamented by very regular well rounded axial ribs which become somewhat enfeebled toward the summit. These ribs have a decided protractive slant on the early whorls, while on the middle turns they are vertical, and on the later volutions they have a decidedly retractive slant. Here, too, they are a little less strong and less regular and much more closely spaced. Of these ribs 18 occur upon the first four of the remaining turns, 20 upon the fifth, 22 upon the sixth, 24 upon the seventh, 28 upon the eighth, 34: upon the ninth, 36 upon the tenth, and about 52 upon the last turn. The intercostal spaces are a little narrower than the ribs. They are marked by 15 fairly equal and equally spaced spiral series of pits, which are about as wide as the spaces that separate them. Of these pits the first is about one-twelfth the distance between the first basal line and the peripheral series of pits anterior to the summit. On the body whorl, where the axial ribs become decidedly enfeebled, the combination of the axial and raised spiral sculpture gives to the surface a thimble pitted appearance. The suture of the early whorls is slightly and of the later strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is attenuated. It is marked by the very feeble continuations of the axial ribs, and 12 incised spiral lines, which are of irregular strength and spacing. The aperture is broadly oval. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The inner lip is slightly curved, decidedly oblique, revolute, and appressed to the attenuated base for almost its entire length. It is provided with a strong very oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a very thick callus.\n\n\nDistribution\nThe type specimen of this marine species was found off Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nUSNM Invertebrate Zoology Mollusca Collection\nWorld Register of Marine Species",

    "text": "The Firebird is a type of trumpet with the standard three valves and the addition of a trombone-style slide. It was invented by Maynard Ferguson and Larry Ramirez and remains an exceptionally rare, specialist instrument. They were occasionally produced by Holton.\n\n\nHistory\n\nHybrid or \"duplex\" brass instruments equipped with both a slide and valves were built as early as the 1860s, by instrument makers Besson and Conn.\nJazz trumpet player Maynard Ferguson worked with Holton (now a division of C.G. Conn) to develop the model ST302 trumpet. It was designed by Larry Ramirez, who spoke to Ferguson about a valve/slide trombone that he had designed some 12 years earlier. This led to Ramirez designing a new valve/slide trombone for Ferguson, called the Superbone, in October 1974.\nAfter touring with the Superbone, Ferguson spoke to Ramirez about making a trumpet with the same valve/slide capability. In order to preserve the length of tubing required to make a B♭ trumpet, the slide could only be made with four positions instead of the standard seven on a trombone. The bell was bent up approximately 20 degrees so that the slide could clear it when extended. This instrument was dubbed the “Firebird”, and went into production on or around May 28, 1983 as Model ST303.\nBy 2000, Ramirez came up with a design for a full seven-position Firebird trumpet. The slide was a telescoping slide-within-a-slide assembly that could be extended to twice its length. Only two of these were made—the first was a prototype and the second was made years later when the first was damaged.\n\n\nTechnique\n\nThe Firebird may be played strictly as a valve trumpet, or using the valves and slide in conjunction. With only the first four slide positions available, some lower notes (low F♯, G, A♭, C♯, D, E♭, and the second A♭) require the use of valves. Higher A♭s can be achieved using normally out-of-tune harmonics, since the slide allows for microtuning adjustments.\nThe trumpet may be gripped with either the left hand or the right hand, and the valves may also be operated by either hand, which is facilitated by the presence of two pinky rings on the top. Similarly, the slide may be operated by either hand, giving the player the option to finger the valves with the right hand and operate the slide with the left, or vice versa.\nOther than the slide, the Firebird's playing technique is no different from standard trumpet technique.\n\n\nNotable players\nPopular artists who have used the Firebird on recordings and live performances include:\n\nAxel Dörner\nDon Ellis\nMaynard Ferguson\nLeonel Kaplan\nJames Morrison\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFirebird page (archived) on trumpetstuff.com\nFirebird page on konakkol.com",

    "text": "Laurent Coderre (1931 – 2011) was a Canadian animator, director, and musician based in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\n\nArtistic career\n\n\nMusic, painting and medical drawing\nMusic occupies an important place in the career of Laurent Coderre. He learned the trumpet in Ottawa, then started playing in Toronto bars attending local events. Despite some talent, he refused to pursue a professional career in music and traveled to New York. Here he oscillates between trumpet and painting to pay for his studies and his rent. He returned to Quebec afterwards, where his parents are from, to study at the Montreal School of Fine Arts where he received the first prize in anatomy and sculpture. From there, Laurent Coderre switched to the medical drawing field studying at the University of Montreal. He was the first student in medical design, and spent two years dissecting bodies and working in hospitals.\n\n\nAnimation and Cinema\nIn 1960, Laurent Coderre joined the English animation team of the National Film Board of Canada, where he directed educational films until 1969. His first animations were on scientific films about the Second World War, mental illnesses, psychology, and mathematics. More and more sponsored films were entrusted to him, which allows him to experiment with new animation techniques, especially paper cut. Close to Norman McLaren, he directed Métamorphoses in1968 following a course on English animation given by McLaren. Created in paper cut within three days, Metamorphoses earned him the silver medal at the Venice International Film Festival. Following this first experience as a director, Laurent Coderre continued to exploit the animated paper cut under camera method to createVisual search to accompany a musical frame, a short film on the visualization of the sounds through the color. This film was never produced by the NFB but incited Laurent Coderre to compose music for films - in particular Bill Mason's documentary short film, Blake (1969).\nLaurent Coderre was asked in 1969 to work on the series Contemporary Songs, a series of seven films produced by the NFB based on Quebec music tracks. The song tarmac Flowers by Jean-Pierre Ferland was assigned to Coderre and was created into a short film of the same title. For this film, he uses watercolor on celluloid, a fragile technique but allowing for interesting textures. This four-week short film was awarded the best film prize at the Yortkton International Film Festival and a diploma of honor at the London International Film Festival.\nIn 1971, he made a third film as a director, this time from thousands of linoleum fragments. Zikkaron, a short film which had the artistic intention of \"concretizing the man within the universe\", multiplying the allegorical images symbolizing the cosmos and the first organisms on Earth and the human body. This poetic and philosophical movie stands out from the traditional production of the time, where the cartoon is dominant. Laurent Coderre was following the lead of McLaren who considers Coderre his protege to the National Film Board. Zikkaron received the Grand Prize of the French Film Commission at the Cannes Film Festival of 1972.\nBetween 1973 and 1977, Coderre left aside the production of films to give international conferences and workshops on animated film, while continuing to collaborate on various animation projects. Taking up the subject that was at the origin of Zikkaron (the human condition in the universe), he made two last animated films: Rencontre and Déclin, respectively in 1978 and 1980. He retired from the Office National Film Festival in 1984 to focus solely on painting.\n\n\nFilmography\n1968: Metamorphoses\n1969: The flowers of Macadam (series Contemporary songs )\n1971: Zikkaron\n1978: Meeting\n1980: Decline (Rusting World)\n\n\nReferences",

Occasionally it is used as a dependent variable. MACS levels are stable over time and so they can be used as part of a prognosis for individuals.  Although MACS was not designed for adults, it has been used with a good measure of reliability in young adult populations ranging in ages from 18-24.  Although it has a good level of reliability when used for children between 2 and 5 years of age, there is less evidence for using it with children younger than 2.  Unlike the GMFCS, there are no age bands for the MACS.  Assessment is typically done by asking questions of the parent or therapist of the child to see where the child fits.  MACS has had some studies demonstrating good to excellent inter-rater reliability. As of 2015, the MACS is used worldwide except in Africa. It is not recommended to use the MACS to detect change.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe widespread adoption of the GMFCS inspired the development of the MACS.\n\n\nAlternatives\nAlternative classification systems used for children with CP include:  ABILHAND, AHA, CHEQ, CPQOL, House, MUUL, PedsQLCP, and SHUEE.\n\n\nMini-MACS\nA version of the test for children under the age of four years old, the Mini-MACS, was developed in 2016.  It has similar tiers to the MACS, with descriptions that are more relevant for the toddler age group, and has good inter-rater reliability.\n\n\nSee also\nChildhood development of fine motor skills\nCommunication Function Classification System - a similar system describing communication.\nInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "title": "Legal status of transgender people",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18330",
    "text": "The legal status of transgender people varies significantly around the world. Some countries have enacted laws protecting the rights of transgender individuals, but others have criminalized their gender identity or expression. In many cases, transgender individuals face discrimination in employment, housing, healthcare, and other areas of life.\nA transgender person is someone whose gender identity is not consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth and also with the gender role that is associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. Transsexual is generally considered a subset of transgender, but some transsexual people reject being labelled transgender.\nGlobally, most legal jurisdictions recognize the two traditional gender identities and social roles, man and woman, but tend to exclude any other gender identities and expressions. People assigned male at birth are usually legally recognized as men, and people assigned female at birth are usually legally recognized as women, in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. However, there are some countries which recognize, by law, a third gender. That third gender is often associated with being nonbinary. There is now a greater understanding of the breadth of variation outside the typical categories of \"man\" and \"woman\", and many self-descriptions are now entering the literature, including pangender, genderqueer, polygender, and agender. Medically and socially, the term \"transsexualism\" is being replaced with gender incongruence or gender dysphoria, and terms such as transgender people, trans men, and trans women, and non-binary are replacing the category of transsexual people.\nMany of the issues regarding transgender rights are generally considered a part of family law, especially the issues of marriage and the question of a transgender person benefiting from a partner's insurance or social security.\nThe degree of legal recognition provided to transgender people varies widely throughout the world. Many countries now legally recognize sex reassignments by permitting a change of legal gender on an individual's birth certificate. Many transsexual people have permanent surgery to change their body, gender-affirming surgery or semi-permanently change their body by hormonal means, transgender hormone therapy. The legal status of such healthcare varies. In many countries, some of these modifications are required for legal recognition. In a few, the legal aspects are directly tied to health care; i.e. the same bodies or doctors decide whether a person can move forward in their treatment and the subsequent processes automatically incorporate both matters. In others, these medical procedures are illegal.\nThe Yogyakarta Principles (2006) and Yogyakarta +10 (2017) affirm the right to self-determination and protection from medical abuses for trans and gender-diverse people.\nAccording to one study, opposition to transgender rights was correlated with a preference for obedience and conformity regardless of partisan affiliation.\nIn some jurisdictions, transgender people (who are considered non-transsexual) can benefit from the legal recognition given to transsexual people. In some countries, an explicit medical diagnosis of \"transsexualism\" is (at least formally) necessary. In others, a diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\", or simply the fact that one has established a non-conforming gender role, can be sufficient for some or all of the legal recognition available. The DSM-5 recognizes gender dysphoria as an official diagnosis. Not all transgender or transsexual people feel gender dysphoria or gender incongruence, but in many countries a diagnosis is required for legal recognition, if transgender people are legally recognized at all.\n\n\nLegislative efforts for the recognition of gender identity\n\n\nNational level\n\n\nLegislative efforts against the recognition of gender identity\n\n\nNational level\n\n\nSubnational level\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nBotswana\n\nIn September 2017, the Botswana High Court ruled that the refusal of the Registrar of National Registration to change a transgender man's gender marker was \"unreasonable and violated his constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment\". LGBT activists celebrated the ruling, describing it as a great victory. At first, the Botswana Government announced it would appeal the ruling, but decided against it in December, supplying the trans man in question with a new identity document that reflects his gender identity.\nA similar case, where a transgender woman sought to change her gender marker to female, was heard in December 2017. The High Court ruled that the Government must recognise her gender identity. She dedicated her victory to \"every single trans diverse person in Botswana\".\n\n\nEgypt\n\nTransgender people face significant existing societal stigma against the LGBT+ community in Egypt, a conservative Muslim nation. The procedure for gender reassignment is not illegal in Egypt, however, the complication and stigmatisation has put transgender people through mental and physical assault along with torture, as per Human Rights Watch. Reportedly, the statistics of criminal acts committed against the transgender community have not been available because they have had a history of going unreported.\n\n\nKenya\nIn August 2025, the High Court of Kenya ruled in favor of transgender rights, and ruled that certain rights had been violated against a specific transgender person, \"including freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, equality and non-discrimination, dignity, freedom and security of the person, and privacy were unconstitutional.\" The court ordered the national parliament to implement \"the enactment of the Transgender Protection Rights Act, or, in the alternative, the amendments of the Intersex Persons Bill 2024\".\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThe Constitution of South Africa forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, gender and sexual orientation (amongst other grounds). The Constitutional Court has indicated that \"sexual orientation\" includes transsexuality.\nIn 2003 Parliament enacted the Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act, which allows a transgender person who has undergone medical or surgical gender reassignment to apply to the Department of Home Affairs to have the sex description altered on their birth record. Once the birth record is altered they can be issued with a new birth certificate and identity document, and are considered \"for all purposes\" to be of the new sex.\n\n\nAsia\n\n\nChina\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Peking University, Chinese trans female students face strong discrimination in many areas of education. Sex segregation is found everywhere in Chinese schools and universities: student enrollment (for some special schools, universities and majors), appearance standards (hairstyles and uniforms included), private spaces (bathrooms, toilets and dormitories included), physical examinations, military trainings, conscription, PE classes, PE exams and physical health tests. Chinese students are required to attend all the activities according to their legal gender marker, otherwise they will be punished. It is also difficult to change the gender information of educational attainments and academic degrees in China, even after sex reassignment surgery, which results in discrimination against well-educated trans women.\n\n\nHong Kong\n\nThe Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled that a transsexual woman has the right to marry her boyfriend. The ruling was made on 13 May 2013.\nOn 16 September 2013, Eliana Rubashkyn, a transgender woman claimed that she was discriminated and sexually abused by the customs officers, including being subjected to invasive body searches and denied usage of a female toilet, although Hong Kong officers denied the allegations. After being released, she applied for and was granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), rendering her effectively stateless awaiting acceptance to a third country.\nIn February 2023, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that the government's requirement of full sex reassignment surgery in order to update gender identity on ID cards was unconstitutional and unacceptably burdensome. As of May 2023, the ruling has yet to be implemented.\n\n\nIndia\n\nIn April 2014, the Supreme Court of India declared transgender to be a 'third gender' in Indian law. The transgender community in India (made up of Hijras and others) has a long history in India and in Hindu mythology.\n\nThe Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, was passed by Parliament in November 2019, and came into effect on 11 January 2020. It protects transgender individuals against discrimination in education, employment and healthcare. It recognizes the gender identity of the individual, and there are provisions in the law for a certificate to be issued with their new gender identity.  There have been reservations among some in the transgender community, both regarding the difficulty of obtaining a certificate, and because of lack of awareness and lack of sensitivity to the issue among local public officials. LGBTQ protests against the bill have occurred, with claims that the bill hurts the transgender community instead of helping it.  Protesters noted the provision for certification, but criticized the fact that this would require people to register with the government in order to be recognized as transgender. They also criticized the inequality inherent in the vast differences in punishment for the same crime, such as sexual abuse, committed against violating a transgender or cisgender individual.\n\n\nIran\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, transgender individuals were officially recognized by the government and allowed to undergo sex reassignment surgery.\nOfficially the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa declaring sex reassignment surgery permissible for \"diagnosed transsexuals\". The government provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance, and a sex change is recognised on the birth certificate. Despite this, Iran's transgender people face discrimination in society. Founded in 2007 by Maryam Khatoon Molkara the Iranian Society to Support Individuals with Gender Identity Disorder (انجمن حمایت از بیماران مبتلا به اختلالات هویت جنسی ایران) is Iran's main transsexual organization.\nAdditionally, the Iranian government's response to homosexuality is to pressure lesbian and gay individuals, who are not in fact transsexual, towards sex reassignment surgery. Eshaghian's documentary, Be Like Others, chronicles a number of stories of Iranian gay men who feel transitioning is the only way to avoid further persecution, jail, or execution. Maryam Khatoon Molkara—who convinced Khomeini to issue the fatwa on transsexuality—confirmed that some people who undergo operations are gay rather than transsexual.\n\n\nJapan\n\nOn 10 July 2003, the National Diet of Japan unanimously approved a new law that enables transsexual people to amend their legal sex. It is called 性同一性障害者の性別の取扱いの特例に関する法律 (Act on Special Cases in Handling Gender for People with Gender Identity Disorder) The law, effective on 16 July 2004, however, has controversial conditions which demand the applicants be both unmarried and childless. On 28 July 2004, Naha Family Court in Okinawa Prefecture returned a verdict to a transsexual woman in her 20s, allowing the sex on her family registry record or koseki to be amended from male to female. It is generally believed to be the first court approval under the new law. Since 2018 sex reassignment surgeries are paid for by the Japanese government, which are covered by the Japanese national health insurance as long as patients are not receiving hormone treatment and do not have any other pre-existing conditions. However applicants are required to be at least 20 years old, single, sterile, have no children under 20 (the age of majority in Japan), as well as to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to receive a diagnosis of \"Gender Identity Disorder\", also known as gender dysphoria in western countries. Once completed the patient has to only pay 30% of the surgery costs.\n\n\nMalaysia\n\nThere is no legislation expressly allowing transsexuals to legally change their gender in Malaysia. The relevant legislations are the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1957 and National Registration Act 1959. Therefore, judges currently exercise their discretion in interpreting the law and defining the gender. There are conflicting decisions on this matter. There is a case in 2003 where the court allowed a transsexual to change her gender indicated in the identity card, and granted a declaration that she is a female. However, in 2005, in another case, the court refused to amend the gender of a transsexual in the identity card and birth certificate. Both cases applied the United Kingdom case of Corbett v Corbett in defining legal gender.\n\n\nPakistan\n\nIn Pakistan, some members of the LGBT community have started undergoing acts of sex reassignment surgery to change their sex. There are situations where such cases have caused media attention. A 2008 ruling at Pakistan's Lahore High Court gave permission to Naureen, 28, to have a sex change operation, although the decision was applicable only towards individuals who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\nIn 2009, the Pakistan Supreme Court made a ruling in favor of the transgender community. The landmark ruling stated that as citizens they were entitled to the equal benefit and protection of the law and called upon the Pakistani government to take steps to protect transgender people from discrimination and harassment. Pakistan's chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, was the architect of major extension of rights to Pakistan's transgender community during his term. There are also anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services for transgender or transsexual individuals (known as Khuwaja Sira, formerly hijra, or Third Gender) in Pakistani.\nIn 2018, the Pakistani government passed the Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act which officially established the legal right of transgender people in Pakistan to identify themselves as such and instituted anti-discrimination laws. These include recognition of transgender identity in legal documents such as passports, identity card, and drivers licences, along with prohibiting discrimination in employment, schools, workplaces, public transit, healthcare, etc. The bill also included the right for inheritance in accordance to their chosen gender. Furthermore, the bill obligates the Pakistani government to build protection centers and safe houses for the specific purpose of being used by the transgender community in Pakistan.\n\n\nJordan\n\nThe Court of Cassation, the highest court in Jordan allowed a transsexual woman to change her legal name and sex to female in 2014 after she brought forth medical reports from Australia. The head of the Jordanian Department of civil Status and Passports stated that two to three cases of change of sex reach the department annually, all based on Medical Reports and Court orders.\n\n\nLebanon\n\nIn January 2016, the Court of Appeals of Beirut confirmed the right of a transgender man to change his official papers, granting him access to necessary treatment and privacy. Transgender people are required to undergo sex reassignment surgery in order to change their legal gender.\n\n\nPhilippines\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Philippines Justice Leonardo Quisumbing on 12 September 2008, allowed Jeff Cagandahan, 27, to change his birth certificate, gender and name:We respect respondent's congenital condition and his mature decision to be a male. Life is already difficult for the ordinary person. We cannot but respect how respondent deals with his unordinary state and thus help make his life easier, considering the unique circumstances in this case. In the absence of a law on the matter, the court will not dictate on respondent concerning a matter so innately private as one's sexuality and lifestyle preferences, much less on whether or not to undergo medical treatment to reverse the male tendency due to rare medical condition, congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In the absence of evidence that respondent is an 'incompetent,' and in the absence of evidence to show that classifying respondent as a male will harm other members of society ... the court affirms as valid and justified the respondent's position and his personal judgment of being a male.\nCourt records showed that at age six, he had small ovaries; at 13, his ovarian structure was minimized, he had no breasts and did not menstruate. The psychiatrist testified that \"he has both male and female sex organs, but was genetically female, and that since his body secreted male hormones, his female organs did not develop normally.\" The Philippines National Institutes of Health said \"people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia lack an enzyme needed by the adrenal gland to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.\nThis ruling, however, only applied to cases involving congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other intersex situations. The Philippine Supreme Court has also ruled that Filipino citizens do not have the right to legally change their sex on official documents (driver's license, passport, birth certificate, Social Security records, etc.) if they are transsexual and have undergone sexual reassignment surgery. In 2007, the Court overruled a lower court decision and found that another individual could not legally change name and sex from male to female, as it would have \"serious and wide-ranging legal and public policy consequences,\" citing the institution of marriage in particular.\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIn South Korea, it is possible for transgender individuals to change their legal gender, although it depends on the decision of the judge for each case. Since the 1990s, however, it has been approved in most of the cases. The legal system in Korea does not prevent marriage once a person has changed their legal gender.\nIn 2006, the Supreme Court of Korea ruled that transsexuals have the right to alter their legal papers to reflect their reassigned sex. A trans woman can be registered, not only as female, but also as being \"born as a woman\".\nWhile same-sex marriage is not approved by South Korean law, a transsexual woman obtains the marital status of 'female' automatically when she marries to a man, even if she has previously been designated as \"male\".\nIn 2013 a court ruled that transgender people can change their legal sex without undergoing genital surgery.\n\n\nTaiwan\n\nTransgender people in Taiwan need to undergo genital surgery (removal of primary sex organs) in order to register gender change on both the identity card and the birth certificate. The surgery requires approval of two psychiatrists, and the procedure is not covered by the National Health Insurance. The government conducted public consultations on the elimination of surgery requirements back in 2015, but no concrete changes have been made since then.\nIn 2018, the government unveiled the new chip-embedded identity card, scheduled to be issued in late 2020. Gender will not be explicitly displayed on the physical card, although the second digit of national identification number reveals gender information anyway (\"1\" for male; \"2\" for female). With the inception of new identity card, a third gender option (using digit \"7\" as the second digit of national identification number) will be available to transgender persons alike. However, it raises concerns that the practice could stigmatize transgender persons, instead of respecting their gender identity. Details of the third-gender option policy are yet to be released.\nAfter same-sex marriage law became effective on 24 May 2019, transgender persons could marry a person of the same registered gender.\n\n\nEurope\n\nA majority of countries in Europe give transgender people the right to at least change their first name, most of which also provide a way of changing birth certificates. Several European countries recognize the right of transgender people to marry in accordance with their post-operative sex. Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom all recognize this right. The Convention on the recognition of decisions regarding a sex change provides regulations for mutual recognition of sex change decisions and has been signed by five European countries and ratified by Spain and the Netherlands.\n\n\nFinland\n\nBefore 2023, people wishing to change their legal gender in Finland had to be sterilized or be found infertile. A recommendation from the UN Human Rights Council to eliminate the sterilization requirement was rejected by the Finnish government in 2017. In 2023, Finland changed its gender identity law in 2023 so that it no longer requires sterilization and is instead based on self-identification.\n\n\nFrance\n\nIn France, the change of the first name can be done by registry office or tribunal. The change of sex can be done by tribunal. In both cases there is no need for psychiatric reports or sex reassignment surgery.\n\n\nGermany\n\nIn 1908, Imperial Germany (with the help of sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld and the WhK) issued a very limited number of 'transvestite passes' – transvestite at this time referring to crossdressers as well as transgender and gender non-conforming people – which enabled individuals to dress in clothes which were seen as discordant with their sex. This ended in 1933.\nSince 1980, Germany has a law that regulates the change of first names and legal gender. It is called Gesetz über die Änderung der Vornamen und die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugehörigkeit in besonderen Fällen (de:Transsexuellengesetz – TSG) (Law about the change of first name and determination of gender identity in special cases (Transsexual law – TSG)). Requirements that applicants for a change in gender were infertile post-surgery declared unconstitutional by a supreme court ruling in 2011.\nIn April 2024, the German parliament has passed a self-identification law making it easier for individuals within Germany to legally change gender on documents. It went into legal effect on November 1, 2024.\n\n\nGreece\n\nOn 10 October 2017, the Greek Parliament passed, by a comfortable majority, the Legal Gender Recognition Bill which grants the transgender people in Greece the right to change their legal gender freely by abolishing any conditions and requirements, such as undergoing any medical interventions, sex reassignment surgeries or sterilisation procedures to have their gender legally recognized on their IDs. The bill grants this right to anyone aged 17 and older. Although, individuals aged between 15 and 17 will have access to the legal gender recognition process, but under certain conditions, such as obtaining a certificate from a medical council. The bill was opposed by the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church, the Communist Party of Greece, Golden Dawn and New Democracy.\nThe Legal Gender Recognition Bill followed a 20 July 2016 decision of the County Court of Athens, which ruled that a person who wants to change their legal gender on the Registry Office files is no longer obliged to already have undergone a sex reassignment surgery. This decision was applied by the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\nIn Ireland, it was not possible for a transsexual person to alter their birth certificate until 2015. The High Court took a case by Lydia Foy in 2002 that was turned down, as a birth certificate was deemed to be a historical document.\nOn 15 July 2015 Ireland passed the Gender Recognition Act, which allows legal gender changes without the requirement of medical intervention or assessment by the state. Such change is possible through self-determination for any person aged 18 or over resident in Ireland and registered on Irish registers of birth or adoption. Persons aged 16 to 18 years must secure a court order to exempt them from the normal requirement to be at least 18. At the time, Ireland was one of four legal jurisdictions in the world where people may legally change gender through self-determination.\n\n\nMalta\nMalta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to\n\nThe recognition of their gender identity;\nThe free development of their person according to their gender identity;\nBe treated according to their gender identity and, particularly, to be identified in that way in the documents providing their identity therein; and\nBodily integrity and physical autonomy.\nThis act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that \"person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity.\" The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits \"non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person.\"\n\n\nNordic countries\nThe Nordic model approach to transgender rights emphasizes the human rights of transgender people and is based on legal equality and self-identification, which has been adopted in countries such as Denmark, Greenland, Norway and Iceland. In 2014, the Danish Parliament voted 59–52 to remove the requirement of a mental disorder diagnosis and surgery with irreversible sterilization for transgender people who wish to change their legal gender. A similar act was adopted in Greenland in 2016. In Norway the Gender Recognition Act, that introduced self-identification, was introduced by the Conservative-led government of Erna Solberg and adopted in 2016. The act received widespread support from most political parties, the LGBTIQ+ rights movement and the feminist movement, including the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. Transgender people are also protected against discrimination and hate speech under discrimination and criminal law. Iceland adopted the Gender Autonomy Act that introduced self-identification and a third legal gender option in 2019, which received widespread support, including from the Icelandic Women's Rights Association. The women's rights movement in the Nordic countries strongly supports transgender rights. In 2021 the Icelandic Women's Rights Association in cooperation with the International Alliance of Women organized a forum on how the women's movement could counter \"anti-trans voices.\" Sweden has had a gender identity law since 1972, widely regarded as the first in the world. Since 2013, neither sterilization nor other treatment is required for trans people who need to change their legal sex, but a diagnosis is required. In April 2024, Sweden passed laws coming into effect on 1 July 2025. The minimum age for changing one's legal gender is reduced to 16, and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is no longer required. Surgical procedures  will no longer require the approval of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Finland changed its gender identity law in 2023 so that it no longer requires sterilization and is instead based on self-identification.\n\n\nPoland\n\nThe first milestone sentence in the case of gender shifting was given by Warsaw's Voivode Court in 1964. The court reasoned that it be possible, in face of civil procedure and acting on civil registry records, to change one's legal gender after their genital reassignment surgery had been conducted. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that in some cases, when the attributes of the individual's preferred gender were predominant, it is possible to change one's legal gender even before genital reassignment surgery.\nIn 2011, Anna Grodzka, the first transgender MP in the history of Europe who underwent a genital reassignment operation was appointed. In the Polish Parliamentary Election 2011 she gained 19,337 votes (45,079 voted for her party in the constituency) in the City of Kraków and came sixth in her electoral district (928,914 people, voter turnout 55.75%). Grodzka was reportedly the only transgender person with ministerial responsibilities in the world since 10 November 2011 (as of 2015).\n\n\nPortugal\n\nThe law allows adults aged 18 or older to change their legal gender without any requirements. Persons aged 16 and 17 are able to change gender with parental consent and a psychological opinion, confirming that their decision has been taken freely and without any outside pressure. The law also prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, and bans non-consensual sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on intersex children.\n\n\nRomania\n\nIn Romania it is legal for transgender people to change their first name to reflect their gender identity based on personal choice. Since 1996, it has been possible for someone who has gone through genital reassignment surgery to change their legal gender in order to reflect their post-operative sex. Transgender people then have the right to marry in accordance with their post-operative sex.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made it illegal to discriminate on the ground of anatomical sex in employment, education, and the provision of housing, goods, facilities and services. The Equality Act 2006 introduced the Gender Equality Duty in Scotland, which required public bodies to take seriously the threat of harassment or discrimination against transsexual people in various situations. In 2008 the Sex Discrimination (Amendment of Legislation) Regulations extended existing regulation to outlaw discrimination when providing goods or services to transsexual people. The Equality Act 2010 added \"gender reassignment\" as a \"protected characteristic\".\nThe Gender Recognition Act 2004 effectively granted full legal recognition for binary transgender people. The gender recognition process under the Act does not require applicants to be post-operative but there must be significant medical explanation as to why an individual has not undergone sex reassignment surgery. They need to demonstrate that they have suffered gender dysphoria, have lived as their affirmed gender (i.e. the gender to which they are transitioning) for two years, and intend to continue doing so until death.\n\n\nNorth America\n\n\nCanada\n\nJurisdiction over legal classification of sex in Canada is assigned to the provinces and territories. This includes legal change of gender classification.\nOn 19 June 2017 Bill C-16, after having passed the legislative process in the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of Canada, became law upon receiving Royal Assent which put it into immediate force. The law updated the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include \"gender identity and gender expression\" as protected grounds from discrimination, hate publications and advocating genocide. The bill also added \"gender identity and expression\" to the list of aggravating factors in sentencing, where the accused commits a criminal offence against an individual because of those personal characteristics. Similar transgender laws also exist in all the provinces and territories. Bill C-4 reached Royal assent on December 8, 2021, criminalizing the practice of conversion therapy throughout Canada.\n\n\nMexico\n\nJurisdiction over legal classification of sex in Mexico is assigned to the states and Mexico City. This includes legal change of gender classification.\nOn 13 March 2004, amendments to the Mexico City Civil Code that allow transgender people to change their gender and name on their birth certificates, took effect.\nIn September 2008, the PRD-controlled Mexico City Legislative Assembly approved a law, in a 37–17 vote, making gender changes easier for transgender people.\nOn 13 November 2014, the Legislative Assembly of Mexico City unanimously (46–0) approved a gender identity law. The law makes it easier for transgender people to change their legal gender. Under the new law, they simply have to notify the Civil Registry that they wish to change the gender information on their birth certificates. Sex reassignment surgery, psychological therapies or any other type of diagnosis are no longer required. The law took effect in early 2015. On 13 July 2017, the Michoacán Congress approved (22–1) a gender identity law. Nayarit approved (23–1) a similar law on 20 July 2017.\n\n\nUnited States\n\nOn 15 June 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that for the purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination on the basis of transgender status is also discrimination because of sex.\nRegardless of the legal sex classification determined by a state or territory, the federal government may make its own determination of sex classification for federally issued documents. For instance, the U.S. Department of State requires a medical certification of \"appropriate clinical treatment for transition to the updated gender (male or female)\" to amend the gender designation on a U.S. passport, but sex reassignment surgery is not a requirement to obtain a U.S. passport in the updated gender. This leaves transgender Americans subject to inconsistent regulations when seeking surgery and hormone treatment.\nAs of September 19, 2025, a total of 616 'anti-trans bills' have been considered this year, of which 71 have been passed across 23 states. These bills aim to re-define sex, restrict access to gender affirming care, to education, to sports, to bathrooms, and to marriage and military positions. One such bill is Florida's \"Parental Rights in Education Act\" law, with a stated purpose to \"prohibit classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity.\" introduced by Joe Harding and Dennis Baxley, both members of the Florida House of Representatives that would allow a teacher or school counsellor to be charged with a felony if they support a social transition. Supporting or encouraging a social transition can be as simple as using preferred names or pronouns. The teacher or school counsellor would also need to register as a sex offender if found guilty.\nIn January 2025, Executive Order 14168, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”, was issued by President Donald Trump. The order directs federal agencies to recognize only two sexes—male and female—defined by biological characteristics, removes references to “gender identity” from federal policy, and instructs agencies to align documents and forms accordingly.\n\n\nSouth America\nSouth America has some of the most progressive legislation in the world regarding transgender rights. Bolivia and Ecuador are among the few countries worldwide that offer constitutional protection against discrimination based on gender identity. Transgender persons are allowed to change their name and gender on legal documents in a majority of countries. Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay allow individuals to change their name and gender without undergoing medical treatment, sterilization or judicial permission. In Peru a judicial order is required.\n\n\nArgentina\n\nIn 2012 the Argentine Congress passed the Ley de Género (Gender Law), which allows individuals over 18 to change the gender marker in their DNI (national ID) on the basis of a written declaration only. Argentina thus became the first country to adopt a gender recognition policy based entirely on individual autonomy, without any requirement for third party diagnosis, surgeries or obstacles of any type.\n\n\nBolivia\n\nThe Gender Identity law allows individuals over 18 to legally change their name, gender and photography on legal documents.  No surgeries or judicial order are required. The law took effect on 1 August 2016.\n\n\nBrazil\n\nIn 1971, Dr. Roberto Farina performed the first male-to-female gender-affirming surgery in Brazil.\nChanging legal gender assignment in Brazil is legal according to the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil, as stated in a decision rendered on 17 October 2009.\nAnd in 2008, Brazil's public health system started providing free sexual reassignment operations in compliance with a court order. Federal prosecutors had argued that sexual reassignment surgery was covered under a constitutional clause guaranteeing medical care as a basic right.\nPatients must be at least 18 years old and diagnosed as transsexuals with no other personality disorders, and must undergo psychological evaluation with a multidisciplinary team for at least two years, begins with 16 years old.\nThe national average is of 100 surgeries per year, according to the Ministry of Health of Brazil.\nIn December 2020, a bill was introduced that defines biological sex as the only factor in determining gender.\n\n\nChile\n\nChile bans all discrimination and hate crimes based on gender identity and gender expression. The Gender Identity Law, in effect since 2019, recognizes the right to self-perceived gender identity, allowing people over 14 years to change their name and gender on all official documents without prohibitive requirements. Since 1974, the change of gender had been possible in the country through a judicial process.\n\n\nColombia\n\nSince 2015, a Colombian person may change their legal gender and name manifesting their solemn will before a notary, no surgeries or judicial order required.\n\n\nEcuador\n\nSince 2016, Ecuadorians are allowed to change their birth name and gender identity (instead of the sex assigned at birth) on legal documents and national ID cards. The person who wants to change the word \"sex\" for \"gender\" in the identity card shall present two witnesses to accredit the self-determination of the applicant.\n\n\nPeru\n\nIn Peru transgender persons can change their legal gender and name after complying with certain requirements that may become psychological and psychiatric evaluations, a medical intervention or sex reassignment surgery. A judicial permission is required.\nIn November 2016, the Constitutional Court of Peru determined that transsexuality is not a pathology and recognized the right to gender identity. However, favorable judicial decisions on gender change have been appealed.\n\n\nUruguay\n\nSince 2019, transgender people can self-identify their gender and update their legal name, without approval from a judge after the approval of the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons. The new law creates scholarships for trans people to access education, a monthly pension for transgender people born before 1975 and also requires government services to employ a minimum of 1% of the transgender population. It also now acknowledges the self-identification of non-binary people.\nIn October 2009, lawmakers passed the Gender identity law allowing transgender people over the age of 18 to change their name and legal gender on all official documents. Surgery, diagnosis or hormone therapy were not a requirement but a judicial permission was required.\n\n\nOceania\n\n\nAustralia\n\nBirth certificates are regulated by the states and territories, whereas marriage and passports are matters for federal law. All Australian jurisdictions now recognise the affirmed sex of an individual, with varying requirements. In the landmark case New South Wales Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie [2014] the High Court of Australia held that the Births Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995 (NSW) did not require a person having undergone genital reassignment surgery to identify as either a man or a woman. The ruling permits a gender registration of \"non-specific\".\nPassports are issued in the preferred gender, without requiring a change to birth certificates or citizenship certificates.  A letter is needed from a medical practitioner which certifies that the person has had or is receiving appropriate treatment.\nAustralia was the only country in the world to require the involvement and approval of the judiciary (Family Court of Australia) with respect to allowing transgender children access to hormone replacement therapy. This ended in late 2017, when the Family Court issued a landmark ruling establishing that, in cases where there is no dispute between a child, their parents, and their treating doctors, hormone treatment can be prescribed without court permission.\n\n\nFiji\n\nThe Constitution of Fiji which was promulgated in September 2013 includes a provision banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression.\n\n\nGuam\n\nGender changes are legal in Guam. In order for transgender people to change their legal gender in Guam, they must provide the Office of Vital Statistics a sworn statement from a physician that they have undergone sex reassignment surgery. The Office will subsequently amend the birth certificate of the requester.\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\nCurrently, the Human Rights Act 1993 does not explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender. Whilst it is believed that gender identity is protected under the laws preventing discrimination on the basis of either sex or sexual orientation, it is not known how this applies to those who have not had, or will not have, gender reassignment surgery.\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\nTransgender persons in the Northern Mariana Islands may change their legal gender following sex reassignment surgery and a name change. The Vital Statistics Act of 2006, which took effect in March 2007, states that: \"Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order of the CNMI Superior Court indicating the sex of an individual born in the CNMI has been changed by surgical procedure and whether such individual's name has been changed, the certificate of birth of such individual shall be amended as prescribed by regulation.\"\n\n\nSamoa\n\nIn Samoa crimes motivated by sexual orientation and/or gender identity are criminalized under Section 7(1)(h) of the Sentencing Act 2016.\n\n\nTable and world map of legal status\n Some of the data are provided by Spartacus Gay Travel Index and highlights the legal status of gender identity change and expression.\n\n\nSee also\n\nGender diversity\nGender self-identification\nGender Public Advocacy Coalition—Defunct US advocacy group working to end discrimination and violence caused by gender stereotypes by changing public attitudes, educating elected officials, and expanding human rights\nHuman rights\nLegal Precedent (2009), Right to change legal names female to male and vice versa for people transgender and intersex by the approval of the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador\nLegal recognition of non-binary gender\nLGBT people in prison\nLGBT rights by country or territory—including gender identity/expression\nList of transgender-related topics\nList of transgender-rights organizations\nRight to personal identity\nTransgender asylum seekers\nTransgender inequality\nTransgender rights movement\nTransitioning (transgender)\nYogyakarta Principles\n\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWorks cited\nChow, Melinda.

    "summary": "The legal status of transgender people varies significantly around the world. Some countries have enacted laws protecting the rights of transgender individuals, but others have criminalized their gender identity or expression. In many cases, transgender individuals face discrimination in employment, housing, healthcare, and other areas of life.\nA transgender person is someone whose gender identity is not consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth and also with the gender role that is associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. Transsexual is generally considered a subset of transgender, but some transsexual people reject being labelled transgender.\nGlobally, most legal jurisdictions recognize the two traditional gender identities and social roles, man and woman, but tend to exclude any other gender identities and expressions. People assigned male at birth are usually legally recognized as men, and people assigned female at birth are usually legally recognized as women, in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. However, there are some countries which recognize, by law, a third gender. That third gender is often associated with being nonbinary. There is now a greater understanding of the breadth of variation outside the typical categories of \"man\" and \"woman\", and many self-descriptions are now entering the literature, including pangender, genderqueer, polygender, and agender. Medically and socially, the term \"transsexualism\" is being replaced with gender incongruence or gender dysphoria, and terms such as transgender people, trans men, and trans women, and non-binary are replacing the category of transsexual people.\nMany of the issues regarding transgender rights are generally considered a part of family law, especially the issues of marriage and the question of a transgender person benefiting from a partner's insurance or social security.\nThe degree of legal recognition provided to transgender people varies widely throughout the world. Many countries now legally recognize sex reassignments by permitting a change of legal gender on an individual's birth certificate. Many transsexual people have permanent surgery to change their body, gender-affirming surgery or semi-permanently change their body by hormonal means, transgender hormone therapy. The legal status of such healthcare varies. In many countries, some of these modifications are required for legal recognition. In a few, the legal aspects are directly tied to health care; i.e. the same bodies or doctors decide whether a person can move forward in their treatment and the subsequent processes automatically incorporate both matters. In others, these medical procedures are illegal.\nThe Yogyakarta Principles (2006) and Yogyakarta +10 (2017) affirm the right to self-determination and protection from medical abuses for trans and gender-diverse people.\nAccording to one study, opposition to transgender rights was correlated with a preference for obedience and conformity regardless of partisan affiliation.\nIn some jurisdictions, transgender people (who are considered non-transsexual) can benefit from the legal recognition given to transsexual people. In some countries, an explicit medical diagnosis of \"transsexualism\" is (at least formally) necessary. In others, a diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\", or simply the fact that one has established a non-conforming gender role, can be sufficient for some or all of the legal recognition available. The DSM-5 recognizes gender dysphoria as an official diagnosis. Not all transgender or transsexual people feel gender dysphoria or gender incongruence, but in many countries a diagnosis is required for legal recognition, if transgender people are legally recognized at all.",

    "text": "The Syrian peace process is the ensemble of initiatives and plans to resolve the Syrian civil war. Peace talks were unsuccessful from 2011 until the fall of the Assad regime at the end of 2024. Between December 2024 and March 2025, all major revolutionary factions of the Syrian revolution united to form the Syrian transitional government.\nPlans for a negotiated peace between Ba'athist Syria and the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad were ultimately unsuccessful. They began in 2011 with unsuccessful initiatives by the Arab League, the UN Special Envoy on Syria, Russia and Western powers. The negotiating parties were representatives of the Syrian regime and the Syrian opposition. The Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES) was excluded at the insistence of Turkey. In January 2012 and November 2013, Russia suggested talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and the opposition. In March–May 2012, hopes were raised by a United Nations/Arab League plan coordinated by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In January and February 2014, the Geneva II Conference on Syria took place, organized by then-UN envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi. On 30 October 2015, further talks started in Vienna involving officials from the United States, the European Union, Russia, China, and various regional actors such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and, for the first time, Iran. Peace talks with rebel leadership continued in Astana, Kazakhstan in 2017. The Kazakh officials offered Astana as a neutral venue and \"a natural home\" for peace negotiations on Syria. The latest major effort to bring about an end to the war started in October 2019 in Geneva with the convening of the Syrian Constitutional Committee to draft a new constitution for Syria under the auspices of the United Nations. The Assad regime's refusal to engage in the peace process was rendered moot by 2024 Syrian opposition offensives which toppled the regime in 11 days. \nThe fall of the Assad regime in December 2024 led to the creation of the Syrian transitional government and renewed negotiations for peace between all the revolutionary factions. On 11 December 2024, the Syrian transitional government began negotiations to dissolve all non-state armed groups in the country. The DAANES remained autonomous after the fall of the Assad regime, while its military wing, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), began clashing with the new military, which included former Syrian National Army (SNA) factions. On 29 December 2024, Ahmed al-Sharaa stated in a televised interview that SDF would be integrated into Syria's Ministry of Defense and that negotiations were underway. On 30 January 2025, Abdurrahman Mustafa, head of the Syrian Interim Government (SIG) in northern Syria, congratulated Ahmed al-Sharaa after he declared himself president during the Syrian Revolution Victory Conference. It was also announced that the SIG was to be at the disposal of the transitional government. The transitional government started to deploy its forces into the areas under the SIG control in February, as the SNA started to integrate into the newly formed Syrian Army. Government forces started to dismantle barracks and other military infrastructure in the area. On 12 February 2025, al-Shaara met with representatives of the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Negotiation Commission, including their respective presidents Hadi al-Bahra and Bader Jamous. It was announced that both organizations would dissolve within the new authorities. On 12 February, Minister for Foreign Affairs Asaad al-Shaibani announced that a new government would be formed by 1 March, which \"will represent the Syrian people as much as possible and take its diversity into account\". On 10 March 2025, an agreement was signed to integrate the SDF into the structures of the transitional government.\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nArab League peace plans 2011–2012\n\nIn November 2011–January 2012, the Arab League (AL) twice tried to accomplish an end to Syrian government (and opposition) violence and convince both parties to start talks instead of fighting.\nAfter the Syrian government's agreement to the AL plan of 19 December the AL sent a monitoring mission to Syria. Violence continued and Saudi Arabia on 22 January withdrew its monitors from the mission, and called on Russia, China and all other states to pressure Syria strongly to adhere to the AL peace plan. The Arab League on 28 January 2012 ended its monitoring mission.\n\n\nRussian peace initiatives for Syria\n\n\n2012 'informal talks' proposal\nOn 30 January 2012, the Russian foreign ministry suggested \"informal\" talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition, and said the Syrian authorities had already agreed to the Russian offer.\nAbdel Baset Seda, a member of the Syrian National Council's executive committee, told Reuters that the SNC had not received any formal invitation for such talks, but would decline if one arrived: \"Our position has not changed and it is that there is no dialogue with (President Bashar al-Assad)\".\n\n\nFebruary 2012: offering the removal of Assad\nIn February 2012, Martti Ahtisaari held talks with envoys of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. During those discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, proposed a three-point plan that would bring the Syrian government and opposition to the negotiation table and result in Assad stepping down as president. But, according to Ahtisaari, the US, Britain, and France rejected that proposal, being convinced that fall of Assad's government was inevitable. \"It was an opportunity lost in 2012,\" he said in an interview in September 2015. Other Western diplomats refute Ahtisaari's claims, with one stating, \"I very much doubt the P3 [the US, UK and France] refused or dismissed any such strategy offer at the time. The questions were more to do with sequencing—the beginning or end of process—and with Russia's ability to deliver—to get Assad to step down.\"\n\n\nBrokerage Proposal, 2013\nOn 7 November 2013, Russia again announced it was trying to broker talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition, seeing that the U.S. and Russian negotiators failed to agree on whether or not Assad should be forced out of office. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Bogdanov said, the Moscow talks could focus on humanitarian problems as well on some political issues.\n\n\nFriends of Syria Group, February 2012\n\nIn February 2012, the then French President Nicolas Sarkozy initiated an international \"contact group\" to find a solution for the Syrian conflict, after Russia and China had vetoed a 4 February 2012 UN Security Council resolution. The group held four meetings, all in the year 2012.\n\n\nKofi Annan Peace Plan, March 2012\n\nThe Kofi Annan peace plan (Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League), launched in March 2012, intended to commit both the Syrian government and opposition to a cease fire and commit the Syrian government to initiate deliberations with the opposition on their aspirations and concerns. After Annan on 12 April had assumed that both parties had agreed to a cease fire, the UN already on 1 May had to admit that both parties were violating it.\n\n\nGeneva I, June 2012\nAn \"action group\" conference (now referred to as Geneva I Conference on Syria) was held on Saturday 30 June 2012, in Geneva, initiated by the then UN peace envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, and attended by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, a representative of China, British Foreign Secretary Hague, and Kofi Annan. Mr Annan, issuing a communiqué, said that the conference agreed on the need for a \"transitional government body with full executive powers\" which could include members of the present Syrian government and of the opposition. William Hague said that all five permanent members of the UN Security Council—the US, Russia, China, France and the UK—supported Mr Annan's efforts. Clinton however suggested that Syrian dictator Assad could, in such transitional government, not remain in power, which immediately was contradicted by Lavrov.\nThe Geneva talks were condemned by Ahrar al-Sham leader Hassan Abboud.\n\n\n16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement\nDuring the 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held from 26 to 31 August 2012 in Tehran, Iran and attended by leaders of 120 countries, Iran intended to draw up a new peace resolution aiming to resolve the Syrian civil war. but a consensus was not reached between the leaders.\n\n\nEid al-Adha cease fire attempt, September 2012\n\nLakhdar Brahimi, an Algerian diplomat, appointed on 1 September 2012, as the new UN–Arab League special representative for Syria, appealed on both the Syrian government and the armed opposition to stop the killing during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which fell that year probably on 26 October 2012, and 3 or 4 days after it. Government and most of the opposition groups said 'yes' to his appeal. Yet, according to Brahimi, the lull in the fighting lasted very short, after which both parties accused the other of not having stopped its violence.\n\n\nGeneva II, 2014\n\nThe Geneva II Middle East peace conference was a United Nations-backed international (peace) conference, aimed at bringing Syrian government and opposition together to discuss a transitional government. Lakhdar Brahimi, UN special envoy to Syria, tried to pursue the conference in close cooperation with the U.S. and Russia. It started on 22 January 2014 and ended on 31 January; no agreement was reached.\n\n\nAstana Opposition conference (2015)\nIn early April, Randa Kassis asked the Kazakh President to host talks in Astana. The President Nursultan Nazarbayev accepted the proposal. This initiative has been criticized by some of Syrian Opposition members. \nOn 25—27 May 2015, a number of Syrian Opposition groups convened in Astana, Kazakhstan The Syrian government chose not to attend.\nA second conference was held in Astana on 2–4 October 2015; the assembled Opposition groups adopted a declaration that called for the parliamentary election scheduled for 2016 to be held under the supervision of the international community; Nursultan Nazarbayev was asked to step in as a mediator in the Syrian conflict.\nThe talks were mediated by Kazakh Deputy Foreign Minister Askar Mussinov and Director of the French Centre for Political and Foreign Affairs Fabien Baussart. Mme Gulshara Abdykalikova, the Secretary of State of Kazakhstan opened the talks in Astana.\n\n\nFour Committees Initiative\nThe Four committees initiative is a proposal put forward by United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura on 29 July 2015 as a way to start the peace process in the Syrian civil war. There had been no peace talks on Syria since the Geneva II meetings in early 2014 ended in failure.\n\n\nZabadani Ceasefire Agreement\n\nIn September 2015 Hezbollah, an ally of the Syrian government, announced a six-month truce between the rebel-held town of Zabadani near Damascus and two Shia towns in the north-west of Syria. The deal was reached after mediation from Iran.\n\n\nVienna Process (since October 2015)\n\nOn 23 October 2015, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey met and talked in Vienna, Austria, to find a way to end the Syrian conflict.\nOn 30 October 2015, the first round of the Syria peace talks were held in Vienna with foreign ministers of 20 countries participating: U.S., Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, China, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany and other countries. The ministers agreed on the need of the Syrian government and opposition to start political talks. The second round of the Vienna talks held in mid-November produced an agreement on the need to convene Syrian government and opposition representatives in formal negotiations under UN auspices with a target date of 1 January 2016.\nA day after a meeting of anti-government factions, including Ahrar ash-Sham, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on 10 December produced a statement of principles to guide peace talks with the Syrian government, Syrian president Bashar Assad said he would not negotiate with \"foreign terrorists.\" Russia also rejected the outcome of the meeting in Riyadh, which it said was unrepresentative and included terrorist groups.\nAfter John Kerry visited Moscow where he met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov as well as Vladimir Putin on 15 December, it was announced that on 18 December 2015 world powers would meet in New York to pass a UN resolution endorsing the principles of the Syria peace process.\nOn 18 December 2015, the UN Security Council, having overcome the gridlock on Syria that had persisted since October 2011, unanimously passed Resolution 2254 (2015), endorsing the ISSG's transitional plan that set out a timetable for formal talks and a unity government within six months; the resolution put UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura in charge of organising Syria talks. However, the major powers remained divided on who should represent the Syrian opposition; no mention was made of the future role of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\n\nDecember 2015 Riyadh conference of Syrian opposition groups\n\nOn 10 December 2015, a two-day meeting started in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, aiming at unifying Syria's opposition groups and forming an opposition delegation for the planned negotiations with the Syrian government (see Syria peace talks in Vienna 14 November 2015 meeting).\nSyrian Kurdish factions were not represented at the meeting in Riyadh.\nJabhat al-Nusra had not been invited because of its assumed 'terrorist links' or al-Qaeda ties.\nAn agreement emerged on 12 December: 34 opposition groups and individuals allied themselves as the High Negotiations Committee. This included, among others, Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, but did not include Syrian Kurds and not include some moderate opposition members supported by Russia. Two of the 34 members are women, augmented by a women-only advisory body known as the Women's Consultative Committee.\nFrance announced that the Syrian opposition had reached an agreement and had \"adopted a common program\" in Riyadh. Apart from France and Saudi Arabia, also Turkey and Qatar supported that High Negotiation Committee.\nThe High Negotiation Committee was tasked with identifying 15 individuals willing and able to serve on the official opposition delegation to the Geneva III negotiations, of which 3 were women.\nRussia however said that those gathered in Riyadh did not represent all opposition groups and therefore were not in a position to speak on behalf of the entire Syrian opposition.\n\n\nGeneva III, January 2016\n\nOn Friday, 29 January 2016, a UN Peace Conference for Syria started in Geneva in Switzerland. At the first day, Syrian government and opposition refused to sit in the same room together. On 3 February 2016, UN envoy Staffan de Mistura suspended the peace talks.\nRussian foreign minister Lavrov commented that \"the [Syrian] opposition took a completely unconstructive position and tried to put forward preconditions\".\nRebel commanders were cited as saying they hoped the peace talks' collapse would \"convince their foreign backers, states including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, that it was time to send them more powerful and advanced weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles\".\n\n\nThe Syrian Women's Advisory Board, February 2016\nUN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura announced appointment of a 12-woman advisory body, name the Women's Advisory Board (or \"WAB\" for short) on 2 February 2016. WAB members include opposition, government sympathizers, and Islamist-tending women. The WAB, however, is politically unaffiliated; the board does not participate directly in the negotiations but does advise the UN mediator on all proceedings.\nThe WAB has been criticized for the lack of transparency in member selection, with allegations that it is unrepresentative. The Syrian Women's Network went as far as to withdraw from the WAB based on these critiques.\n\n\nCessation of Hostilities, February 2016\n\nOn 12 February 2016, the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) established an ISSG ceasefire task force, under the auspices of the UN, co-chaired by Russia and the United States, and issued a joint communique saying inter alia: \"An ISSG task force will within one week elaborate modalities for a nationwide cessation of hostilities.\"\nOn 22 February 2016, in Munich, foreign ministers of Russia and the U.S., as co-chairs of the ISSG, announced that they had concluded a deal to seek a nationwide cessation of hostilities in Syria to begin a week later. The deal set out the Terms for a Cessation of Hostilities in Syria. Russia and the U.S. proposed that the cessation of hostilities commence at 00:00 (Damascus time) on 27 February 2016.\nThe ISSG countries are supposed to monitor compliance with the terms of the truce, which was pronounced as of 29 February 2016, when the ISSG task force met in Geneva, to be largely holding.\n\n\nSeptember 2016 cease fire deal\n\nOn 10 September 2016, Russia and U.S. reached a deal on establishing a cease fire between the Syrian Assad government and a US-supported coalition of so-called 'mainstream Syrian opposition rebel groups' including umbrella group 'High Negotiations Committee' (HNC), effective from 12 September, while jointly agreeing to continue attacks on Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (former al-Nusra Front) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\nAfter US-led coalition airstrikes on Syrian Army troops on 17 September, of which the US claimed it was an accident, the Syrian government declared the ceasefire to be over.\n\n\nOctober 2016 Lausanne talks\nOn 15 October, the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and Iran had talks about the Syrian war, in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n\nInitiation of Astana talks, and ceasefire (December 2016)\nIn mid-December 2016, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey agreed to suggest Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, as a new venue for carrying on the Syria peace talks.\nOn 20 December 2016, the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Russia agreed, pursuant to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (Dec. 2015), to hold Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan.\nOn 28 December 2016, Turkey and Russia agreed on a nationwide ceasefire plan for Syria to go into effect at 00:00 on 30 December 2016. The Syrian Democratic Council—representing the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish, Arab and Syriac militias mostly led by YPG—was not invited to the talks. ISIL, the al-Nusra Front, and the YPG were excluded from the ceasefire, and the following rebel groups signed up for the truce:\n\nSham Legion\nAhrar al-Sham\nJaysh al-Islam\nFree Idlib Army\nLevant Front\nJabhat Ahl al-Sham\nHowever, the Ahrar al-Sham spokesman denied having signed the deal.\nThe political efforts by Russia and Turkey were endorsed by the UN Resolution 2336 adopted 31 December 2016.\n\n\nFirst round of Astana talks (January 2017)\n\nOn 23 January 2017, a Syrian opposition delegation that included twelve rebel factions convened with Syria's government delegation, headed by Bashar Jaafari, in Astana for indirect talks titled the International Meeting on Syrian Settlement, sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran. Astana was agreed on as the venue, since it was viewed as neutral by all the parties involved. The opposition side included Mohammed Alloush, the political leader of Jaysh al-Islam, which Russia had proposed designating as a terrorist organisation.\nThe start of talks in Astana was described as the \"Astana-isation\" of the Geneva talks, implying a shift towards the Syrian opposition conducting military operations and away from Syrians with only political influence. The talks took place on 23 and 24 January; the first day ended without the sides reaching an agreement. The \"Astana Process\" talks aimed to support the framework in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and ended on the 24th with an agreement between Iran, Russia, and Turkey to form a joint monitoring body to work to enforce the Resolution 2254 ceasefire.\nAfter the talks in January 2017, Russia offered a draft for a future constitution of Syria, which would inter alia turn the \"Syrian Arab Republic\" into the \"Republic of Syria\", introduce decentralized authorities as well as elements of federalism like \"association areas\", strengthen the parliament at the cost of the presidency, and realize secularism by abolishing Islamic jurisprudence as a source of legislation.\n\n\nGeneva IV, February–March 2017\n\nThe Geneva IV peace talks on Syria were talks between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition under the auspices of the United Nations. The opposition was represented by the High Negotiations Committee, while the government delegation was led by Syria's UN ambassador, Bashar Jaafari. The talks began on 23 February 2017 and concluded on 3 March. The government delegation sought to focus on counter-terrorism while the opposition sought to focus on political transition.\n\n\nFebruary 2017 Astana talks\nTwo days of talks on strengthening the ceasefire regime (see above, Dec. 2016) in the Syrian conflict ended 16 Feb in Astana with the adoption of a document to formalise monitoring of the 29 December 2016, ceasefire agreement (see above). The document will guide the activities of a joint operational group to be formed by Russia, Turkey and Iran that was agreed to be set up during the earlier meeting in January in Astana. The document is also meant to guide confidence-building measures among the opposing sides.\n\n\nMarch 2017 and May 2017 Astana talks: De-escalation zones\n\nThe third round of meetings in Astana held between 14 and 15 March yielded further agreement by all parties to the existing ceasefire agreement. As a result of these talks, Iran joined Turkey and Russia as a guarantor state.\nOn 4 May 2017, at the fourth round of the Astana talks, representatives of Russia, Iran, and Turkey signed a memorandum to establish four \"de-escalation zones\" in Syria. The largest one of those included the Idlib Governorate and adjoining districts of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia Governorates; the other three zones were set up in the northern rebel-controlled parts of the Homs Governorate, the rebel-controlled eastern Ghouta, and along the Jordan–Syria border. In those areas, combat operations would be halted as of 6 May 2017; it also envisaged suspension of flights of military aircraft in those areas, as well as the creation of conditions for humanitarian access, medical assistance, the return of displaced civilians to their homes and the restoration of damaged infrastructure. The memorandum was concluded for six months and could be extended automatically.\nThe deal was not signed by Syrian government or rebel groups; rebel representatives rejected it because it left too many loopholes for the Syrian government to continue bombing civilian areas. The Democratic Union Party stated that the ceasefire zones were \"dividing Syria up on a sectarian basis\".\n\n\nAstana talks, July 2017\nThe fifth round of peace talks initially planned for 5–7 July 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan were moved to 12–15 July 2017. The Astana Process has the support of the UN's Staffan de Mistura who said the Astana talks are making \"clear progress\" to reducing violence in Syria. The Southern Front boycotted these talks.\nAs a precursor to these peace talks, on 9 July 2017 at 0900 GMT, an American-Russian-Jordanian brokered ceasefire commenced, though on 14 July, opposition groups participating in the Quneitra offensive rejected the ceasefire, with clashes resuming across Southern Syria. Besides minor violations from all sides involved, as of 15 July, the ceasefire has held.\n\n\nAstana talks, September 2017\nOn 14 September 2017, representatives of Iran, Russia and Turkey in Astana agreed on the implementation of a fourth \"de-escalation zone\", in the northern governorate of Idlib. Kazakh Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov affirmed Kazakhstan's commitment to serving as a neutral venue for continued peace talks.\n\n\nAstana talks, October 2017\nThe seventh round of the Astana Process on Syrian peace started in Astana with support of both Russia and Iran. The talks maintained previous Astana Process agreements, addressed exchange of detainees, POWs and missing persons. The guarantor states—Russia, Turkey, and Iran—affirmed consensus that a political solution under UN Security Council resolution 2254 should be found.\n\n\nAstana talks, December 2017\nThe eighth round of the Astana Process on Syrian peace started in Astana. The talks aimed at ending the nearly seven-year-long conflict in the country, with the humanitarian crisis in the besieged Eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus at the table.\nThe head of the Syrian Arab Republic delegation called for the \"immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Syrian territory\" including Turkish and US forces.\n\n\nSochi talks, January 2018\nIn January 2018 Russia convened the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi, in which 1,500 delegates participated.\n\n\nAstana talks, March 2018\nThe ninth round of the Astana Process on Syrian peace took place on 16 March 2018. The trilateral ministerial meeting on Syria was to include Iran, Russia and Turkey.\n\n\nIdlib memorandum, September 2018\nOn 17 September 2018 the Russian president Vladimir Putin and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reached an agreement to create a buffer zone in Idlib.\n\n\nNorthern Syria Buffer Zone agreement, August 2019\nOn 7 August 2019, the United States and Turkey reached a deal, which would set up a new demilitarized buffer zone in northern Syria to preempt a potential Turkish invasion of SDF-held Northern Syria.\n\n\nSyrian Constitutional Committee in Geneva, October 2019–present\n\nIn September 2019, Geir Otto Pedersen, United Nations Special Envoy for Syria since 31 October 2018, called for prisoner exchanges as a confidence-building measure between Syrian authorities, opposition groups and civil society groups to take place prior to a planned October 2019 constitution-drafting committee meeting in Geneva. The committee is planned to include 50 people each from government, opposition and civil society, with 15 from each group to work specifically on drafting proposals for a constitution.\nThe Syrian Constitutional Committee officially convened for the first time on 30 October 2019 at the United Nations Office at Geneva.\nThe committee's third session of negotiations, among the 45-member small body, with 15 members from the government, opposition, and civil society, respectively, started in late August 2020. Pedersen stated that he had \"received a 'strong signal of support' from 'key international players' and from \"all sides in the Constitutional Committee\" for the continuation of the peace process. Hadi al-Bahra, one of the opposition leaders, and Ahmad Kuzbari, on behalf of the Syrian government, were co-chairs of the session.\nOn 22 October 2021, yet another round of peace talks failed to reach common ground. No date for the next round was determined.\n\n\nAstana meeting, December 2019\nThe delegations of Turkey, Iran, and Russia arrived in Astana (then named Nur-Sultan), on 10 December 2019 for two days of trilateral talks known as the Astana process.\nThe talks ended without any definitive ceasefire agreement, reportedly due to the anti–government side's refusal to accept new Russian terms regarding control of the Idlib province.\n\n\nAstana Process, July 2021\nThe 16th International High-Level Meeting on Syria within the Astana Process was held in Astana on 7–8 July 2021. Representatives from the Syrian government, Syrian opposition were present, as well as delegations from Iran, Russia, Turkey and others. High representative observers from the UN, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq also attended.\nIn a joint statement, Russia, Iran, and Turkey reaffirmed their stance to oppose separatist plans aimed at undermining a unified Syria.\nThis round of talks focused largely on the humanitarian situation in Syria. All participants called upon the international community and the UN to increase assistance to Syria including infrastructure such as water, food, electricity, schools, and hospitals.\nAll parties also stressed the need to hold the next meeting of the Syrian Constitutional Committee in Geneva as soon as possible.\n\n\n\"Small Group\" meeting, May 2022\nMembers of the \"Small Group\" responsible for writing the constitution, consisting of 15 representatives from the Syrian Government, non-governmental organizations, and the Syrian opposition, met for the eighth round of talks at a Geneva hotel under UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen. There had been a slight breakthrough during the sixth-round meetings in Geneva on October 18–22, when the Syrian Government's delegation co-chair Ahmed Kuzbari sat at the same table for the first time with the co-chair of the opposition Hadi al-Bahra.\n\n\nSyrian opposition offensives and fall of the Assad regime\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition groups launched offensives against Assad government forces in northwestern Syria. This led to the collapse of the Assad government in early December, with Assad fleeing to Russia and being granted political asylum. Conflicts amongst armed groups persisted in Syria as of 11 December 2024.\n\n\nPost-Assad negotiations\n\nOn 24 December 2024, the Syrian caretaker government announced that the country's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa had met with representatives of the various rebel factions and that an agreement had been reached on the dissolution of all the groups and their integration under the supervision of the ministry of defence. The meeting, however, did not include representatives of the Kurdish-led  Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Most factions of the Syrian opposition announced that they would merge under the Ministry of Defense. On 31 December, al-Shaara met with SDF representatives in order to \"lay the foundations for future dialogue\".\nOn 30 January 2025, the Turkish-supported Syrian Interim Government announced that it was placing itself \"at the disposal\" of the new authorities in Damascus. On 4 February, shortly after he formally became president of Syria, al-Shaara visited Turkey and met with president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to discuss, among other issues, the situation of Kurdish-led forces in Syria that Turkey considers to be a security threat. On 12 February, the presidents of the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Negotiation Commission met with al-Sharaa. It was announced that both organizations would dissolve within the new authorities, and that the transitional government would form a preparatory committee for the upcoming National Dialogue Conference.\n\n\n10 March agreement\n\nOn 10 March 2025, the Syrian caretaker government and the SDF signed an agreement to integrate the SDF into state institutions and bring northeastern Syria (AANES) under central government control. The agreement was preceded by months long fighting near the Tishrin Dam between the SDF and Turkish-backed SNA. The deal includes a ceasefire, the merging of military forces, and the return of border crossings, airports, and oil fields to Syrian state authority. According to the deal, Kurdish language rights are, for the first time in Syria, officially recognized. The specific eight points of the deal are:\n\npolitical rights of all Syrians with no religious or ethnic discrimination\nKurdish society as a component of the Syrian state with citizenship and constitutional rights\na ceasefire throughout Syria\nintegration of all AANES civil and military institutions into the Syrian state\nright of return and protection for displaced Syrians\nsupport for the Syrian state against \"Assad regime remnants\" and all other security and territorial threats\nrejection of \"calls for division\" and of hate speech between the components of Syrian society\ncreation of committees to implement the agreement by the end of 2025.\nCommander-in-Chief of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, was reportedly flown by a U.S. helicopter to Damascus to sign the memorandum, underscoring the U.S. role and its 'green light.'\nThe agreement was welcomed by France and the European Council, among others.\n\n\nImplementation and violations\n\nOn 8 April, pro-Turkey forces started reducing their presence in Afrin Region. This was interpreted by Bedran Kurd, a Kurdish official, as step towards point 5, for enabling the return of displaced residents of Afrin. The SDF aimed at having the replacement security forces be mainly local.\nOn 12 April, as part of the deal, national Syrian forces arrived at Tishrin Dam, over which military control had changed several times during the civil war. Plans according to the deal included a joint military force to control the dam, without pro-Turkish factions, and a Kurdish civilian administration. As of May 2025, there have been delays in implementing the agreement.\nPlanned meetings between the SDF and the al-Sharaa government in Paris on 25 July and 9–10 August were cancelled. The al-Sharaa authorities cited the July 2025 southern Syria clashes as a reason for being unable to attend the 25 July meeting and cited the \"Unity Conference for North and East Syria\" held in al-Hasakah as a reason for not attending the 9–10 August meeting. In late August, Hawar News Agency interpreted Turkish pressure as the reason for the al-Sharaa authorities cancelling the August meeting and viewed the negotiation process as having stalled, with no new meetings between the two sides scheduled.\nThe Syrian transitional government engaged in various armed altercations with the Syrian Democratic Forces in the months after the agreement, predominantly in Deir ez-Zor province and near the town of Dayr Hafir. Both sides accused the other of violating the March 10 agreement concerning the integration of the Kurdish armed groups into the new Syrian government. Coinciding with the clashes the Foundation for Defense of Democracies warned of a 'wider conflict' if the US does not remain fully engaged in preventing the collapse of the March agreement.\nOn 21 August 2025, Hawar News Agency reported about \"mass dissatisfaction\" among citizens concerning hate speech in Syria and calls to implement March 10 agreement.\nOn 24 August 2025, the SDF reported that \"armed groups affiliated with the Damascus government\" launched an attack on a military post of the al-Kasra Military Council in the town of al-Junaynah, Deir Ezzor's western countryside, violating the ceasefire.\nOn 15 October, Abdel Hamid al-Muhbash, co-chair of the DAANES negotiating delegation, stated that security and military committees had been created, had visited Damascus for negotiations, and that the negotiations were progressing. A result of the negotiations was the holding of school exams in North and East Syria. The head of the military negotiating committee, Sipan Hemo, stated that the negotiating atmosphere was \"generally positive\" but was limited to \"verbal promises and general hopes, with no clear or written agreements\". Hemo stated that the Transitional Government had not yet created \"genuine trust and safety among Syria's various communities\" with \"serious steps\". He stated that the integration of the SDF into the Syrian armed forces would have to \"be based on mutual respect and partnership – not on the exclusionary or eliminationist views still present among some in Damascus\". Hemo proposed the return of Afrin District residents, compensation for victims, and accountability for the perpetrators of human rights violations as a test of the Transitional Government's willingness to carry out the integration. He stated that the SDF was ready to form \"the core nucleus of the new Syrian army\", given what he viewed as the SDF's ability to coordinate with \"all Syrian communities, including Sunnis, Kurds, Druze, Alawites, Christians,\" and the Transitional Government.\nOn 3 November, the Ministry of Education amended the curriculum to label Kurdish and other languages as “foreign,” with Arabic remaining the sole exception, marking a violation of the March Agreement.\n\n\nSee also\nFederalization of Syria\nInternational reactions to the Syrian Civil War\nList of United Nations resolutions concerning Syria\nList of Middle East peace proposals\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nINFOGRAPHIC: Women's Inclusion in the Syria Peace Talks\nSurvey: Opinions and Current attitudes towards International Agreements on Syria.

    "summary": "The Syrian peace process is the ensemble of initiatives and plans to resolve the Syrian civil war. Peace talks were unsuccessful from 2011 until the fall of the Assad regime at the end of 2024. Between December 2024 and March 2025, all major revolutionary factions of the Syrian revolution united to form the Syrian transitional government.\nPlans for a negotiated peace between Ba'athist Syria and the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad were ultimately unsuccessful. They began in 2011 with unsuccessful initiatives by the Arab League, the UN Special Envoy on Syria, Russia and Western powers. The negotiating parties were representatives of the Syrian regime and the Syrian opposition. The Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES) was excluded at the insistence of Turkey. In January 2012 and November 2013, Russia suggested talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and the opposition. In March–May 2012, hopes were raised by a United Nations/Arab League plan coordinated by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In January and February 2014, the Geneva II Conference on Syria took place, organized by then-UN envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi. On 30 October 2015, further talks started in Vienna involving officials from the United States, the European Union, Russia, China, and various regional actors such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and, for the first time, Iran. Peace talks with rebel leadership continued in Astana, Kazakhstan in 2017. The Kazakh officials offered Astana as a neutral venue and \"a natural home\" for peace negotiations on Syria. The latest major effort to bring about an end to the war started in October 2019 in Geneva with the convening of the Syrian Constitutional Committee to draft a new constitution for Syria under the auspices of the United Nations. The Assad regime's refusal to engage in the peace process was rendered moot by 2024 Syrian opposition offensives which toppled the regime in 11 days. \nThe fall of the Assad regime in December 2024 led to the creation of the Syrian transitional government and renewed negotiations for peace between all the revolutionary factions. On 11 December 2024, the Syrian transitional government began negotiations to dissolve all non-state armed groups in the country. The DAANES remained autonomous after the fall of the Assad regime, while its military wing, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), began clashing with the new military, which included former Syrian National Army (SNA) factions. On 29 December 2024, Ahmed al-Sharaa stated in a televised interview that SDF would be integrated into Syria's Ministry of Defense and that negotiations were underway. On 30 January 2025, Abdurrahman Mustafa, head of the Syrian Interim Government (SIG) in northern Syria, congratulated Ahmed al-Sharaa after he declared himself president during the Syrian Revolution Victory Conference. It was also announced that the SIG was to be at the disposal of the transitional government. The transitional government started to deploy its forces into the areas under the SIG control in February, as the SNA started to integrate into the newly formed Syrian Army. Government forces started to dismantle barracks and other military infrastructure in the area. On 12 February 2025, al-Shaara met with representatives of the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Negotiation Commission, including their respective presidents Hadi al-Bahra and Bader Jamous. It was announced that both organizations would dissolve within the new authorities. On 12 February, Minister for Foreign Affairs Asaad al-Shaibani announced that a new government would be formed by 1 March, which \"will represent the Syrian people as much as possible and take its diversity into account\". On 10 March 2025, an agreement was signed to integrate the SDF into the structures of the transitional government.",

The project has introduced new quartets by Tod Machover, Michael Torke, Kevin Puts, Carter Pann, Roberto Carnevale, Paquito D’Rivera, Chen Yi, Daniel Kellogg, Augusta Read Thomas, Marina Leonardi, Ned Rorem, Jennifer Higdon, and Bernard Rands. With Musical Dim Sum, the Yings have extended their repertoire while celebrating their own cultural heritage by including a selection of short works by Chinese American composers in the framework of a traditional concert.\nThe Ying Quartet teaches actively. It is the quartet-in-residence at the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester and frequently teaches at the Bowdoin International Music Festival in Brunswick, Maine, and at the Aspen Music Festival.",

He is the founder and chief executive officer of DiMassimo Goldstein, a marketing, design and advertising agency based in New York City.\n\n\nCareer\nDiMassimo founded DiMassimo Goldstein, sometimes called DiGo, in 1996. The agency describes itself as using “behavior change marketing to drive growth in brands and businesses that change lives for the better.”\nDiMassimo was previously creative director at the advertising agency Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, and worked at other agencies, including J. Walter Thompson, Chapman Direct Advertising (a former unit of Young & Rubicam), Deutsch Inc. and BBDO.\nIn 2015, DiMassimo Goldstein led a rebranding campaign for Weight Watchers, deemphasizing the counting of calories in favor of the company's newly introduced “Freestyle” program, which emphasized healthy foods.\nIn 1990, at Chapman Direct Advertising, DiMassimo co-led the account for the AT&T Universal Card, a credit card that attracted nearly 19 million customers by promising it would charge users no fees for life. \n\n\nCommentary and media\nDiMassimo is frequently interviewed as a brand expert by news outlets and industry publications. \nIn June 2018, he discussed what President Trump's trade disputes with the European Union could mean for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In 2012 he gave perspective on presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, and the impact that widely publicized claims by his ex-wife about his past behavior would have on his image and chances in that year's Republican primary campaign.  \nDiMassimo has argued that while advertising can be a powerful driver of behavioral and social change, it is becoming increasingly difficult to create influential campaigns in the digital age, when technology has made it easier for companies and brands come in direct contact with consumers.\n\n\nAdvertising campaigns\nClients of DiMassimo Goldstein have included FreshDirect, New York's Bronx Zoo, Jackson Hewitt, Ally,  Proactiv, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and TradeStation.\nIn 2007 DiMassimo and Eric Yaverbaum, a public relations executive, co-founded \"Tappening,\" a social marketing effort to promote the use of tap water and reduce the environmental impact of single-use plastic water bottles. Three years later, DiMassimo and Yaverbaum launched \"Offlining,\" a campaign to encourage people to disengage occasionally from digital distractions.\nIn 2012 DiMassimo and a team from his agency appeared as themselves on “The Pitch,” a reality television series broadcast for two years on the AMC cable network.  The show featured two advertising agencies each week competing for a client's business. On the show, DiMassimo's team won the account of C. Wonder, a women's fashion retailer.\n\n\nWriting\nDiMassimo is a co-author of Inside the Minds: Innovation Unleashed, a book about the creative element in marketing communications.  He wrote the foreword for and is profiled in Passion Brands, a book by business strategist Kate Newlin.  DiMassimo is the co-author, with Eric Yaverbaum, of an e-book, Digital@Speed, which offers strategies for success as a digital marketer. \n\n\nAwards and recognition\nDiMassimo was named a Future 50 CEO by SmartCEO magazine in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The campaign DiMassimo led for the Citi AAdvantage card won an Effie Award for effectiveness from the American Marketing Association.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nDiMassimo Goldstein website\nAdvertising Age Lookbook: DiMassimo Goldstein",

    "text": "The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre is \"one of Europe's leading specialist libraries on migration, race and ethnicity\" open to members of the public,  students and researchers. It increases access to and visibility of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) histories with a growing archive of material relating to the local area. Its sister organisation, the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Education Trust offers advice, training, networking opportunities, project support, exhibitions, publications and events to help community organisations to record and share their heritage. The Centre is part of the University of Manchester and is located in Manchester Central Library, where it is part of the Archives+ partnership. The current head of both the Centre and the Trust is Dr Safina Islam, who was appointed in March 2019.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nAhmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre (AIURRRC)\nThe impetus to create the Centre arose from the need to find a home for the increasingly large personal collection of books and other material about race relations which had been collected since the 1960s by Lou Kushnick OBE, then Professor of Sociology (and subsequently Honorary Professorial Fellow in Race Relations) at the University of Manchester.  In discussion with colleagues, Kushnick considered donating the material to the University of Manchester Library, but decided he would like it to be readily available to people outside the university as well as to students and researchers, envisaging a collection that would \"have huge research value, but also be instrumental in celebrating cultures and combating racism\".  He approached Professor Martin Harris, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester, who agreed to provide rent-free space to support the initiative.\nThe centre was established (as the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Archive) in 1999, with Lou Kushnick as its first director.\nInitially based on the university campus, the Centre had a number of homes, including at the University of Manchester's Sackville Street Building. It moved to its present location in Manchester Central Library when that building reopened following refurbishment in 2014, making access to the Centre by members of the public more readily available than before.\nThe Centre is named after Ahmed Iqbal Ullah, a 13-year-old pupil of Burnage High School in Manchester, who was murdered in a playground incident in 1986. Ullah's death and the public inquiry into it highlighted deficiencies in UK race relations education of the time. The name was adopted for the Centre because Kushnick \"wanted to send a signal\" and aimed for the material to be used \"in outreach programmes to teachers in schools with limited resources [and] a narrow curriculum [to] encourage an environment where all children could flourish\".\nThe Centre and Trust's former Co-Director, Jacquleine Ould-Okojie retired in August 2018. She had been involved in the Centre since its inception and was previously the organisation's Education Coordinator.\n\n\nAhmed Iqbal Ullah Education Trust (AIUET)\nThe Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Education Trust (AIUET) is the charitable trust linked to the AIURRRC. It was created in 2001 and is a registered charity governed by a board of trustees. It functions as the outreach arm of the Centre and delivers a wide range of activities and projects that include:\n\nsupporting heritage projects to identify, collect and archive the histories of BAME communities in the region;\nactivities across schools to promote knowledge and understanding of black history, citizenship and multicultural issues;\nevents and exhibitions that promote knowledge and understanding of black history.\nThe AIUET receives funding from Manchester City Council and the University of Manchester. The funding is governed by a collaboration agreement between the three parties. AIUET has also been successful in securing National Lottery Heritage Fund (NLHF) grants for community heritage projects. These include:\n\nYemeni Roots Salford Lives (2010–2012). A project exploring the history of one of Greater Manchester's oldest communities.\nLegacy of Ahmed (2015–2016). A project exploring the impact of Ahmed's murder, 30 years on. Learning from this project was shared in the published paper Community partnerships and collection development in the Legacy of Ahmed Project\nComing in From the Cold (2017–2021). A project that supports BAME communities across Greater Manchester to develop and archive their heritage projects.  The first phase of this project included an audit of BAME-focused heritage projects and collections in Greater Manchester and a report on the distribution of BAME populations in Greater Manchester.\n\n\nLibrary\n\nThe library has more than 14,780 titles, with subjects ranging from culture, identity, history, politics and local studies. Collections held by the Centre include unique primary resources and extensive secondary resources on the theme of local, national and international race relations and migration. Approximately two-thirds of the library collection is loanable to anyone with a Manchester Libraries card. Reference only material is clearly labelled and can be studied anywhere within the library. Collection highlights include:\n\nMaterials documenting the debates around race and schooling in the UK from the 1960s to the present, as well as teaching materials which are made available to school teachers to enhance their educational activities.\nA wide range of materials relating to the US Civil Rights Movement, including material on the struggle for civil rights stretching from long before the American Civil War to the present day.\nA significant collection of published journals and magazines, including hard-to-find specialist publications.\nThe library of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) was acquired by the Centre when the CRE closed in 2007, and includes extensive historical material documenting the changing issues around race relations in the UK, such as documents relating to inquiries, and reports published by the CRE, Runnymede Trust and other bodies.\n\n\nArchives\nThe Centre is a partner in Archives+ which brings together a number of organisations to provide a holistic range of archive and heritage services from its city centre location in Manchester Central Library.\nThe Centre's Archives include books as well as magazines, reports, posters, photographs, oral histories, personal and organisational papers and ephemera. Highlights are:\n\nSteve Cohen collection.  Cohen was a Manchester-based lawyer and campaigner who helped found the Law Centre in Longsight, Manchester, and the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit. The collection includes publications, newspaper cuttings, banners, posters, badges and t-shirts from more than 70 anti-deportation campaigns fought in Manchester between the 1970s and 1990s.\nRoots Oral History Project.

    "text": "RingSide Steakhouse is a restaurant located in Portland, Oregon, United States.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe RingSide has been one of the city's most famous steakhouses for more than 60 years and, in addition to the original location on West Burnside Street, it has opened a second restaurant on the East side of the Willamette River. The name refers to the establishment's boxing decor theme. In 2010, the restaurant temporarily moved the original location to the Fox Tower while the Burnside location was remodeled. A year later, they opened RingSide Fish House at the Fox Tower location. The east side location at the Glendoveer Golf Course was set to close for a remodel in January 2015.\nThe Glendoveer location reopened as the Ringside Grill. The Ringside Grill's last day of business was August 30, 2017.\nIn late April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, RingSide sold frozen boxes of steak directly to the general public for the first time in 75 years. The move caused a mile-long traffic jam along West Burnside Street, and products sold out in less than 2.5 hours.\nLater in 2020, RingSide filed a lawsuit against their insurer, Cincinnati Financial, for $236,000 for the loss of business and expenses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, Cincinnati Financial sued RingSide seeking a judgement declaring RingSide's revenue losses from lower customer traffic as a result of wildfire smoke were not covered by their policy.\nIn April 2025, a kitchen fire forced the restaurant to close temporarily. It is slated to reopen on August 4.\n\n\nReception\nRingSide has garnered more than 40 regional and national awards throughout its history. Willamette Week readers ranked RingSide first place in the following categories: \"Best Meat-Eater's Palace\" (2004), \"Best Steakhouse\" (2005), and \"Best Steak\" (2006). RingSide was a runner-up in the \"Best Happy Hour\" category of Willamette Week's \"Best of Portland Readers' Poll 2020\". Brooke Jackson-Glidden included the onion rings in Eater Portland's 2024 overview of \"iconic\" Portland dishes. The business was included in Time Out Portland's 2025 list of the city's eighteen best restaurants.\n\n\nSee also\nFood Paradise (season 13)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\n\"RingSide Steakhouse\".

    "text": "Central Library Cape Town is a public library in Cape Town, South Africa. It is one of 102 libraries within the City of Cape Town Library and Information Services.\nCentral Library includes lending and reference services as well as specialised art and music sections. There are 90 plus computers plus free Wi-Fi for library members. The library offers books, CDs, DVDs, audiobooks and magazines for loan. It is the only public library in Cape Town with books in all 11 official languages and also has books in foreign languages.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCentral Library was established in 1954 when the Cape Town City Libraries took over the subscription library of the South African Library. In 1962 the library moved to the Waalburg building in the city centre. In 1982 the library moved again, this time to Cape Town's City Hall The library received two grants from the Carnegie Corporation which allowed the library collections to be significantly improved and extended and a computer centre was established. The City of Cape Town, provided funds for a new library to be established in the Old Drill Hall. Central Library opened in this new permanent site in 2008.\n\n\nHistory\nThere has been a public library in the centre of Cape Town since 1818 when the South African Public Library (SAPL) was established. This was a free library until 1829 when it became a subscription library. \nIn 1952 the Cape Town City Library Service (CTLS) was established to create a free municipal library service for Cape Town. In December 1954, after negotiations, the CTLS took over the subscription library of the South African Public Library, buying the stock and renting the reading room. Central Library was established and opened to the public in January 1955. In 1956 a branch was opened in Long Street which included non-fiction books, children's books and music. \nIn 1962 Central moved from SAPL to SANLAM building, Waal Street. The music section was also moved from Long Street to this building. In 1965 the Central and Long Street branches were amalgamated to form a new and enlarged Central branch. \nApartheid legislation affected the service offered by libraries. The 1953 Reservation of Separate Amenities Act resulted in libraries being designated for specific library groups. In 1969 City Park library was opened and all \"non-white\" members of Central were transferred to City Park Library. However the Central information and Music libraries could still be used by ‘non-white\" members.\n\n\nArt Library\nOne of only two public art libraries in South Africa. The library covers all aspects of arts and crafts and is especially strong in African and South African art; Photography; Fashion and Graphic Design. The library is well used by students and local craftsmen and artists.\nThe art library, as a specialised department within Central, opened in 1965.\n\n\nThe Performing Arts & Music Library\nA music library was included in the Long Street Library when it opened in 1956. The library included gramophone records, sheet music and the Evelyn Fincken Collection and the collection of the Cape Guild of Organists. The first issue of gramophone records in South Africa by a public library was on 5 July 1956 from the Long Street Library.\n\n\nComputing Facilities\n\nThe library is equipped with public-use computers and offers free Wi‑Fi, courtesy of the SmartCape Access Project.\nAdvanced Tech lies the American Corner, including a fully equipped Makerspace for hands-on innovation and incubation, with funding from the US Consulate.  \nAside from technology, the library hosts regular digital literacy workshops, alongside events like coding sessions and Power of Coding programs, some tailored for learners and youth.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nCape Town Central Library, Cape Town government website\nLibrary OPAC, City of Cape Town website",

    "text": "Robert Dinwiddie (1692 – 27 July 1770) was a Scottish colonial administrator who served as the lieutenant governor of Virginia from 1751 to 1758. Since the governors of Virginia remained in Great Britain, he served as the de facto head of the colony of Virginia. Dinwiddie is credited for starting the military career of George Washington.\n\n\nEarly life\nDinwiddie was born at Glasgow before 2 October 1692, the son of Robert Dinwiddie of Germiston and Elizabeth Cumming. His younger brother Lawrence Dinwiddie was later Lord Provost of Glasgow. He was a descendant of the Lordly Dinwiddies of Annandale.\nHe matriculated at the university in 1707 before starting work as a merchant. Joining the British colonial service in 1727, Dinwiddie was appointed collector of the customs for Bermuda.  Following an appointment as surveyor general of customs in southern American ports, Dinwiddie became Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and featured as such in William Makepeace Thackeray's nineteenth-century historical novel The Virginians: A Tale of the Last Century.\n\n\nFrench and Indian War\n\nDinwiddie's actions as lieutenant governor are cited by one historian as precipitating the French and Indian War, commonly held to have begun in 1754. He wanted to limit French expansion in Ohio Country, an area claimed by the Virginia Colony and in which the Ohio Company, of which he was a stockholder, had made preliminary surveys and some small settlements.  This version of history is disputed when one notices that Father Le Loutre's War in Acadia began in 1749 and did not end until the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755.  In fact, Thomas Jefferys, the Royal Geographer of the day, produced a pamphlet out of his Parliamentary testimony that explained the misconduct of the French in what amounted to a Treaty of Utrecht boundary dispute.\n\nIn 1753, Dinwiddie learned the French had built Fort Presque Isle near Lake Erie and Fort Le Boeuf, which he saw as threatening Virginia's interests in the Ohio Valley. In fact, he considered Winchester, Virginia, to be \"Exposed to the enemy\"; Cumberland, Maryland, was only to be fortified the next year.\nDinwiddie sent an eight-man expedition under George Washington to warn the French to withdraw. Washington, then only 21 years old, made the journey in midwinter of 1753–54. Washington arrived at Fort Le Boeuf on 11 December 1753.  Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, commandant at Fort Le Boeuf, a tough veteran of the west, received Washington politely, but rejected his ultimatum.\nJacques Saint-Pierre gave Washington three days hospitality at the fort, and then gave Washington a letter for him to deliver to Dinwiddie.  The letter conveyed to Dinwiddie that he would send Dinwiddie's on to Marquis de Duquesne in Quebec and would meantime maintain his post while he awaited the latter's orders.\n\nIn January 1754, even before learning of the French refusal to decamp, Dinwiddie sent a small force of Virginia militia to build a fort at the forks of the Ohio River, where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers merge to form the Ohio (present-day Pittsburgh). The French quickly drove off the Virginians and built a larger fort on the site, calling it Fort Duquesne, in honour of the Marquis de Duquesne, the then-governor of New France.\n\nDinwiddie named Joshua Fry to the position of Commander-in-Chief of colonial forces. Fry was given command of the Virginia Regiment and was ordered to take Fort Duquesne, then held by the French. During the advance into the Ohio Country, Fry suddenly fell off his horse and died from his injuries on 31 May 1754 at Fort Cumberland, upon which the command of the regiment fell to Washington.\nIn early spring 1754, Dinwiddie sent Washington to build a road to the Monongahela. After having attacked the French at the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington retreated and built a small stockade, Fort Necessity, at a spot then called \"Great Meadows\", by the Youghiogheny River, eleven miles southeast of present-day Uniontown. Here he encountered the French in a skirmish on 3 July 1754 and was forced to surrender. Dinwiddie was subsequently active in rallying other colonies in defense against France and ultimately prevailed upon the British to send General Edward Braddock to Virginia with two regiments of regular troops, in part with a letter to Lord Halifax on 25 October 1754 containing these words:\n\nThe Invas'n and wicked designs of the Fr. on the River Ohio has given me a Continual Uneasiness, w'ch was increased by the supine and unaccountable Obstinacy of the Assemblies of the different Colonies on this Cont't, y't tho' they were convinced of the Progress they had made, and the threat'g Speeches they gave out, they c'd not be roused from their lethargic Indolence, to grant suitable Supplies for conducting an Expedit'n so necessary for their own Safety.\nBraddock met his end at the Battle of Monongahela on 9 July 1755; this unexpected reverse prompted much concern and fear in the colony. Over the next four years, until the defeat of the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec, and Vaudreuil's capitulation before Amherst at Montreal, the fate of the 13 colonies was uncertain and Dinwiddie's administration was marked by frequent disagreements with the Assembly over the financing of the war. In fact, the friction between the government and the Burgesses would eventually develop into the American Revolution.  In January 1758 he left Virginia, to be replaced by Francis Fauquier, and lived in England until his death at Clifton, Bristol.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nDinwiddie County, Virginia, which lies 30 miles south of Richmond, is named in honor of Robert Dinwiddie. Dinwiddie Hall, since 1972 a dormitory at the College of William & Mary, is also named in honor of Robert Dinwiddie.\nDinwiddie retained his links with his alma mater throughout his life: in 1754 he was conferred an honorary degree by the University of Glasgow; and upon his death in 1770 he gave the University of Glasgow Library £100 for the procurement of books.\nRobert Dinwiddie died on 27 July 1770. He is buried in Clifton Parish Church with a monument created by William Tyler RA.\nHe married some time before 1738 Rebecca Auchinleck (or Afflick); together they had two children Rebecca Dinwiddie and Elizabeth Dinwiddie.\nHis official records, which were compiled by the Virginia Historical Society in 1883, are left in five volumes.  They cover the years of his administration of the Virginia colony, from 1751 to 1758. His archival material resides at several places, and some related to the French and Indian War is visible to web browsers. He was the subject of the book Robert Dinwiddie: Servant of the Crown.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

    "text": "The anniversary of the Iranian revolution (Persian: راهپیمایی ۲۲ بهمن) is celebrated on 22 Bahman, which is the 11th month in the Iranian calendar, equivalent to 11 February in the Gregorian calendar.\nIt commemorates the protests that led to the downfall of the Pahlavi dynasty and the installation of the Islamic Revolutionary which is headed by Imam Khomeini. This political celebration is held on the last day of the celebration called the Ten Days of fajr.\n\n\nBackground\n\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, entered Tehran on 1 February 1979 and led an uprising throughout in Iran that resulted in victory after 10 days.\nThe Iranian revolution on 11 February 1979 was caused by the participation of different groups of people. The Pahlavi dynasty officially ended and finally, conditions were prepared to forming the Islamic Republic led by the cleric, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Islamic thoughts and characters had a significant role in the anti monarchic revolution and Khomeini called it as revolution.\n\n\nOriginal event\n\nOn 11 February 1979, after the victory of Iranian revolution hundreds of military personnel and policemen marched toward Azadi Tower. \nOne of their demands was a lack of dependence on the United States and the Soviet Union as dominant powers of that time.\n\n\nAnti-regime protests\nIn 2010, prior to the 31st anniversary of the regime, Iranian authorities executed two young regime opponents, Arash Rahmanipour and Mohammed Reza Ali Zamani. They also prosecuted 16 protesters, 5 of whom were sentenced to execution for being deemed \"enemies of God,\" while an additional 37 individuals were scheduled to stand trial. In response, top opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi condemned the executions and called for protests on the February 11 anniversary of the revolution. The Voice of America (VOA) quoted Joe Stork, The Middle East director at U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, who stated that the regime attempts \"to use the anniversary celebration to \"deflect attention\" from its human rights violations. Also according to the Voice of America, Mousavi and Karoubi stated that the \"majority of the Iranian people want to regain their rights\". According to opposition website, Rahesabz, thousands of anti-government protesters gathered largely in the outskirts of the main area of the celebrations, and chanted \"Death to the Dictator!\". According to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment, had there been no restrictions on their right to assemble, there would have been 5 miilion. During the subsequent protests Iranian security forces fired tear gas at opposition supporters, and Mousavi and Karoubi, who had urged their supporters to remain peaceful, were attacked.\nIn 2023, prior to the 44th  anniversary of the regime, anti-government hackers managed to interrupt the broadcast of Telewebion, a web TV service affiliated with Iranian state TV for 19 seconds. President Ebrahim Raisi's televised address was also disrupted by a 44-second video featuring chants of \"Death to Khamenei\" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic,\" which was shared on Twitter by the hacker group \"Edalate Ali\" (\"The Justice of Ali\"). In the video, the group also called for participation in the nationwide protests and urged Iranians to withdraw their money from official banks. The protests themselves also included calls for the death of the dictator and the end of the theocratic regime. The death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly, was what sparked the widespread demonstrations. According to Hrana rights group, 19,763 protesters were arrested and at least 528 were killed during the protests, 71 of whom were minors. Additional anti-regime mass demonstrations took place worldwide, as thousands  of internationally based Iranians, many of whom relatives of victims of the regime, protested in their countries of residence. In Paris, protesters chanted the slogan \"Woman. Life. Freedom.\" In addition to other anti-regime slogans, and urged the EU to list the Revolutionary Guard as a terror organization and to cut economic ties with Iran. In Los Angeles, thousands of protestors, in solidarity with the people of Iran, called for representatives to support human rights in Iran and for the end of the religion-based government. In Ottawa, approximately 300 people gathered in front of the National Gallery of Canada, and chanted “Democracy for Iran”, denouncing the Islamic Republic and its leader, Ali Khamenei, the message being that they \"don't want the Islamic Republic in Iran\". The demonstrators further called for other countries to follow Canada in designating the IRGC as a terror organization, and to refrain from negotiations with them. Canadian officials expressed support for the demonstrators.\nIn 2024, the 45th anniversary of the regime, there was no call to action which provoked protests, even so many Iranians across Tehran engaged spontaneously in ‘home-chanting’, crying \"Death to the Dictator\" from their homes during the regime's fireworks display. This coincided with other forms of protest as many Iranians boycotted the official rallies commemorating the event, in stark contrast to previous years. Various videos and photos circulating in social media show meager participation in the official events and venues, despite the government's efforts to appeal to the public by softening the enforcement of the compulsory Hijab, and providing recreational activities on the streets. The regime and its media outlets attempted to conceal the minimal turnout, and described the celebrations as being \"Epic\". As in 2023, the 2024 protests were held worldwide, as displaced Iranians gathered in Belgium, Sweden, Australia, Germany, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Denmark to demand justice and action against Human rights violations in Iran.\nIn 2025, the 46th anniversary of the regime, there was a widespread eruption of anti-regime protests across Iran. In contempt of the regime's urges to cry \"Allah o Akbar\" (God is great) from the rooftops, Iranian citizens openly chanted \"death to the dictator\" and “death to Khamenei” in coordinated protests and demonstrations from homes and rooftops in multiple cities. As in 2024, anti-regime chants by many residents in Tehran and other major cities were a response to the government-sponsored fireworks and light displays. According to the Telegraph, \"the public display of anger towards the Tehran regime comes amid escalating tensions within Iran, marked by increasing economic hardship, international isolation, and growing public dissatisfaction with the government's policies, particularly regarding personal freedoms and human rights\". On 13 February 2025, it was reported that for three days after the anniversary of the revolution, recurring protests were held in Dehdasht, with citizens crying chants translated as \"Death to the dictator\", death to the republic of executions” and \"This year is year of blood, Khamenei falls with a thud\", as well as \"This year is the year of blood, Seyed Ali will be overthrown\" in western Kermanshah. As a response security forces of the Islamic Republic dispersed the demonstrations, and reportedly fired shotgun pellets and tear gas at the protesters. As of 13 February 2025, at least 10 protesters were arrested. Although media aligned with the regime suggest that the cause for the protests is \"tribal conflicts\", evidence from the demonstrations themselves reveals them to be focused on economic issues, including record-high inflation and price increase for basic items, recurring power outages and extreme air pollution from industrial centers and power plants, as well as the regime's increased use of capital punishment.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nTimeline of the Iranian revolution\nFajr decade\n\n\nReferences",

    "text": "Li Xun (Chinese: 李恂; died 421), courtesy name Shiru (士如), was the final ruler of China's Western Liang dynasty during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Li Xun tried to hold out against the conquering Northern Liang armies under its prince Juqu Mengxun, after his brother Li Xin's death in 420. He was only able to hold the city of Dunhuang for several months, before Juqu Mengxun successfully sieged the city, and Li Xun committed suicide, which marked the collapse of the Western Liang dynasty.\n\n\nBrief reign\nVery little is known about Li Xun's life, including whether he was the son of his brother Li Xin's mother Princess Dowager Yin.  Under his father Li Gao (Prince Wuzhao) and/or Li Xin, Li Xun successively served as the governor of Jiuquan (酒泉, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu) and Dunhuang Commanderies. His rule of Dunhuang was said to be benevolent and favored by the people. In 420, while trying to attack Northern Liang, Li Xin fell into a trap set by Juqu Mengxun and was killed in battle. Juqu Mengxun then quickly reached the Western Liang capital Jiuquan, and Li Xin's other brothers abandoned Jiuquan and fled to Dunhuang. Once they reached Dunhuang, they and Li Xun, then the governor of Dunhuang, abandoned Dunhuang and fled to the hills north of Dunhuang.\nJuqu Mengxun commissioned Suo Yuanxu (索元緒) to be the governor of Dunhuang.  However, Suo quickly lost favor with the people by being rude, dishonest, and cruel. Some people of Dunhuang, under the leadership of Song Cheng (宋承) and Zhang Hong (張弘), secretly invited Li Xun back to Dunhuang, and in winter 420 he did so, forcing Suo to flee. Song and Zhang offered Li Xun the titles of Champion General (冠軍將軍) and Inspector of Liang Province (涼州刺史), and he changed the era name to signify that Western Liang was still a state. Juqu Mengxun then sent his heir apparent Juqu Zhengde (沮渠政德) to attack Dunhuang, and Li Xun defended the city, refusing to engage Juqu Zhengde.\nHowever, Juqu Mengxun soon arrived, and he built levees to accumulate water around Dunhuang. Li Xun offered to surrender, but Juqu Mengxun refused. At this point, Song Cheng betrayed him and offered the city to Juqu Mengxun. Upon hearing this, Li Xun committed suicide, and Juqu Mengxun slaughtered the city. Western Liang was at its end.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBook of Jin, vol. 87.\nBook of Wei, vol. 99.\nHistory of the Northern Dynasties, vol. 100.\nSpring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, vol. 8.\nZizhi Tongjian, vol. 119.",

    "text": "\"Love a Woman\" is a song recorded by American R&B singer Mary J. Blige featuring Beyoncé from the former's tenth studio album My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1) (2011). It was written by Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Sean Garrett and Menardini Timothee while production was handled by Garrett, Team S. Dot and BridgeTown. Originally written for Beyoncé's fourth studio album 4 (2011), the singer felt that it did not fit with the sound she had created for her album, and she thought that it would be better if she recorded it as a duet with Blige instead.\n\"Love a Woman\" is a down-tempo R&B ballad with live-instrumentation in which Beyoncé and Blige are teaching men about how to love their female partners. It received positive reviews from music critics who mostly praised the chemistry between Beyoncé and Blige on the duet as well as their vocals. Following the release of My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1), the song peaked at number eighty nine on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart based on digital sales.\n\n\nBackground and development\n\n\"Love a Woman\" was written by Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Sean Garrett and Menardini Timothee while production was handled by Garrett. Team S. Dot served as the co-producer of the song while BridgeTown served as the additional producer for it. On November 9, 2011, a snippet of \"Love a Woman\" appeared online. It was officially premiered on November 17, prior to the release of the album. The song was initially recorded by Beyoncé for her fourth studio album 4 (2011), but she thought that it would be a better fit as a duet with Blige. Blige further revealed in an interview that the song was sent to her after Beyoncé thought that it didn't fit her album and it was sent through her A&R people. She further added, \"When the song came, her voice was on it completely and it was just amazing and I wasn't sure that they wanted to give me this record because it was so amazing.\" Blige further spoke about how she started the collaboration with Beyoncé on the song:\n\n\"The song was so amazing I had to be sure, as an artist, that she really was trying to give it to me. I was like 'is she really trying to give me this song, because it's pretty amazing.' They were like 'yes, but she wants to stay on it with you.' And I was like, 'Wow! Beyoncé? Thanks!' And you know I love and respect her to death so I wouldn't pass that chance up.\"\n\nBlige further revealed that the song would be released as a single but was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy at that time adding that, \"whenever she's ready, if she's ever ready, I'm ready and it'll be great.\" During an interview with Rap-Up magazine, Garrett further spoke about the collaboration, saying, \"I initially did the record for Beyoncé and then we just felt it would be an even bigger record with Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige... Both these women are two iconic female figures in the world, and what would be better than putting those two on a record? We felt it would be a really iconic move.\"\n\n\nComposition\n\"Love a Woman\" is a down-tempo soulful R&B ballad with a female empowerment theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, \"So you think you know how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know.\" As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, \"A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance\". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, \"From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no.\" Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R&B production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines \"She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect.\" The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines \"Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…\" with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's \"Off the Wall\" era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths. Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.\n\n\nCritical reception\nRob Markman of MTV News wrote that the singers \"display good chemistry on the song\". The Washington Post's Sarah Godfrey classified \"Love a Woman\" as one of the best tracks on the album adding that \"The ballad, with its cheesy, delightful... R&B production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige.\" Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song \"clearly knows how to love a woman right\". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé \"showcase their powerful pipes\" as they tell their men what they want from a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television wrote that the song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a \"breathtaking duet\". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as \"a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices\". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed \"the soaring nature of the song\", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a \"lesson in love\". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an \"inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I half expected Keith Sweat to jump in\". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, \"'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats. Forget Dr. Phil, MJB and Ms. B is all you need to help you maintain a loving relationship with your partner.\"\nAyanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music commented that Blige and Beyoncé combined their \"superpowers\" in the studio to make the \"forceful ballad\". She further commented, \"The breakdown is where the listener really gets to hear the symmetry of these two powerhouse vocals. Neither diva overpowers the other. Right where [Beyoncé] leaves off, Mary J. picks up. And vice versa... Although either of these R&B divas could carry 'Love a Woman' with no problem, some might say that the song makes more of an impact with their deliveries combined.\nBlige's seasoned soul coupled with Bey's creamy delivery is a mood to behold.\" Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that Beyoncé \"act[s] as a Greek chorus\" to the song. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle noted that \"Love a Woman\" is a soulful, old-school ballad \"that brings out the best in both singers\". Writing that Blige is \"particularly heavy\" on the R&B vibes of the song, Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine further commented that \"without a doubt, it's sure to gain some stream whenever radio DJs catch wind of it. Why? Because 'Love a Woman' features silky production, strong harmonies, and guest vocals from Beyoncé. Yeah, there's no stopping this one.\" Katie Hasty of HitFix commented that \"It's actually a pretty standard list of grievances and explanations, but the real guts of the thing is when the two light up, to bring out the best vocal performances in each other, shooting you straight back to the 1990s.\" Kevin Ritchie of Now gave a mixed review for the song saying that it aims \"for posterity rather than chemistry\". Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly described the duet as \"snoozy\".\n\n\nChart performance\nThe song peaked at number eighty nine on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and spent three weeks in total on that ranking. It also peaked at number 50 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Songs chart.\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nReferences",
    "summary": "\"Love a Woman\" is a song recorded by American R&B singer Mary J. Blige featuring Beyoncé from the former's tenth studio album My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1) (2011). It was written by Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Sean Garrett and Menardini Timothee while production was handled by Garrett, Team S. Dot and BridgeTown. Originally written for Beyoncé's fourth studio album 4 (2011), the singer felt that it did not fit with the sound she had created for her album, and she thought that it would be better if she recorded it as a duet with Blige instead.\n\"Love a Woman\" is a down-tempo R&B ballad with live-instrumentation in which Beyoncé and Blige are teaching men about how to love their female partners. It received positive reviews from music critics who mostly praised the chemistry between Beyoncé and Blige on the duet as well as their vocals. Following the release of My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1), the song peaked at number eighty nine on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart based on digital sales.",

It also occurs in New Guinea. Lignum vitae is Latin for \"wood of life\".\n\n\nDescription\nVitex lignum-vitae is a small to medium tree growing to a height of 30 metres (98.4 ft) and a trunk diameter of 90 cm (2.95 ft). The trunk is creamy or brown, with horizontal lines and fissures. Its bark sheds in small flakes. Flanged or buttressed at the base of larger trees, the bole is irregular in shape.\nJuvenile and coppice leaves are lobed or angled. Mature leaves opposite, simple, shiny and not toothed. The leaves are 5 to 13 cm long, and often broader towards the tip. The leaf stalks are 15 to 25 mm long, hairy and channeled on the upper side. Net veins are visible on the leaf's underside. Small foveolae (raised hairy bumps) appear at the junction of the midrib and larger lateral veins. Branchlets grey and hairy, somewhat four angled in cross section.\nPale purple flowers form on cymes at various times of the year, most often around the month of April. The fruit is a red drupe, 8 to 12 mm in diameter with a round hard capsule inside. The capsule has four cells, each containing a fertile or infertile seed. The fruit ripens in the months of November to April, and is eaten by birds including the green catbird and rose crowned fruit dove.\nRegeneration from seed is remarkably slow and difficult. The fleshy aril should be removed from the fruit capsule. Old fruit is preferred. Roots and shoots may appear after two or more years.\n\n\nReferences\n\nFloyd, A. G. (1989).

    "text": "The Williamtown RAAF Base Group is a heritage-listed group of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) buildings and other items at RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales, Australia. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.\n\n\nHistory\nThe area of the base, on coastal land, was first settled as grants probably initially used for pastoral grazing. Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass was granted 1,120 acres (453 ha) in 1840, preceded by William Harvey's grant of 640 acres (259 ha) in 1839.\nIn the 1880s Snodgrass's original grant was subdivided into small farms for dairy farming. William Harvey's grant had been broken up by the 1860s, also into small farms, at a time when the village area of Williamtown was first established. A school and post office had opened by 1868. By the 1920s the area had become part of the farm district supplying the Raymond Terrace Cooperative Dairy and Produce Company Ltd, set up in 1904.\nRAAF Base Williamtown appears to have grown from the recognition by local authorities in 1938 that Newcastle needed additional airport facilities to relieve pressure on the field at District Park, Broadmeadow. The Willamtown site was selected by the Australian Government and surveyed in August 1939, for the construction of an emergency landing ground prior to the onset of the World War II. An overriding factor was the proximity of Newcastle's steel mills and coal mines. A Hunter Water pumping station was erected in the late 1930s as part of the Tomago Sandbeds Water Supply Scheme, with a separate second pumping station erected to service the base.\nWork began in January 1940 with £22,000 being spent on construction as part of the Government of New South Wales Unemployment Relief Program. Four runways were completed by September 1940. From September 1940 new facilities included a guard house, staff garages, control tower, flight operations room, medical rooms, kitchen, mess, airmen's and flight sergeants' dormitories and a compound for the construction authorities. By mid-December 1940 a total of 62 buildings had been completed in the \"camp area\" in the south-east sector of the aerodrome. The RAAF did not take over the base until February 1941, although Lockheed Hudson bombers had been stationed there as a temporary base for anti-submarine operations.\nThe base was officially opened in February 1941, participating in the Empire Air Training Scheme as a mustering centre for airmen. Landscaping at this time included grassing over the parade ground and tree planting on Townsend Avenue. From September 1941 to February 1942 the base operated as No.2 Recruit Depot, with the aerodrome upgraded to provide for an operational base. In June 1941 5 bomb-dump buildings were erected and by October runways 1 and 3 (of 4) were extended. By November six aircraft dispersal bays had been constructed to the south of the site, each with two shelter hangars.\nFollowing the entry of the United States of America into the War, use of the base was transferred to Southern Area Command (RAAF) in January 1942. Formal administration of the base was taken over by American forces from May 1942 to September 1942. With the departure of the Central Gunnery School, No. 4 Operational Training Unit was raised in October 1942. At its peak, the base had some 888 personnel including 115 from the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). New lecture halls and test facilities, including gas chambers, were erected to complement the four Bellman hangars and five workshop hangars.\nFollowing the end of the War in the Pacific in August 1945, the number of personnel was rapidly reduced. At the end of 1945 the RAAF had 317 mainland and regional airfields. Of these some 12 were considered of strategic importance; Butterworth, Cocos Island, Momote, Darwin, Learmonth, Williamtown, Townsville, Pearce, East Sale, Richmond and Amberley. Willamtown became the peacetime base for the RAAF fighter wing. In August 1946, RAAF Station Williamtown became the base of No. 78 (Fighter) Wing.\nIn November 1948 the School of Land/Air Warfare, a joint services training unit, was established at Williamtown. Two army units, the parachute and air portability training wings, were attached to the School. A parachute tower and armament range were provided. In 1958 the School was renamed the Air Support Unit. In 1976 a new purpose-built facility, for the renamed Australia Joint Warfare Establishment, was completed at Williamtown.\nBetween 1949 and 1951 involvement in the Korean War led to re-equipping with de Havilland Vampire jet fighter aircraft, with Williamtown the focus of RAAF training. Following the introduction of jet aircraft, the base was rebuilt from 1950 as funds became available. New works included a sealed, concrete runway 8,700 feet long at a cost of 750,000 pounds, the first to be constructed during post-war restructuring, and refueling facilities, to accommodate Gloster Meteors and the Sabre jet fighters from 1955, replaced in 1967 by the new Dassault Mirage III. During the 1950s and 1960s works included a new Control Tower (1958–1961), a new parachute tower, new bomb dump buildings, a compound of 16 Nissen Huts, new two-storey brick quarters for non-married officers and a second series of brick sleeping quarters for 532 airmen. As late as 1955 there were still some airmen accommodated in tents. Between 1959 and 1964 a number of Bellman hangars were relocated to the base. In addition 21 brick married quarters and 17 prefabricated married quarters were provided, the first erected west of Medowie Road at the edge of the base. This reflected the policy that homes should be provided for 40% of the established posts at each RAAF base. A modern brick officer's mess, swimming pool, water treatment plant, airmen's mess, ration store, airmen's laundry, NCO accommodation and mess, a chapel and street lighting completed the modernisation program. In 1965 a four-year program resulted in the construction of 3 new hangars, extensions and a new armaments workshop.\nIn 1983 upgrade works commenced at RAAF Base Williamtown to support the new 75 F/A 18 aircraft, which replaced the Mirage by 1989. In 1988 RAAF Butterworth was downgraded, RAAF Base Williamtown becoming the new headquarters for the Tactical Fighter group. New facilities included headquarters buildings, hangars, workshops, stores, medical facilities and a base chapel.\nFrom 1997 new Defence development initiatives, under the Defence Reform Program, have resulted in planned changes to the base.\nThe commercial operation south of the runways, implemented in the 1962–1994 period with the permission of the RAAF, was subsequently leased to the Newcastle Airport organisation in 1992.\n\n\nDescription\nRAAF Base Williamtown buildings are at located at RAAF Base Williamtown, Medowie Road. The site consists of a number of buildings and structures\n\n\nFrom the 1939–1945 period\nBuildings and structures from the 1939–1945 period include:\n\nHenderson Road and the road network for the original camp, comprising Eaton Road, Ford Road and Townsend Avenue west of McNamara Drive.\nparade ground\nBellman hangars\nfour underground fuel tanks\ndispersal taxiway associated with fuel tank\nsections of Runways 1 and 4\nsub station and emergency powerhouse\ntennis courts\npump house\n\n\nFrom the post-war period to c. 1964\nAfter World War II, the base evolved in response to the location of the World War II infrastructure and buildings and the extended main runway of the 1950s, which was the dominant alignment and feature of the site. Buildings and structures from post-World War II period to circa 1964 include:\n\nthe main concrete runway, northern taxiways and hard standing area\nadditional Bellman hangars\nexplosives storage\ncontrol tower\nstores\narmament preparation units\noriginal test butt\nfirst airmen's brick dormitory block\nofficer's dormitories and the officers mess\nairmen's dormitory block\nbrick married quarters\n\n\nWorld War Two\nIn common with the former RAAF Base Fairbairn, Canberra, and other RAAF bases, the Williamtown facility was planned as a series of functional zones on a rectangular road grid, the parade ground forming a focus between the dormitory areas and messes and the workshops and hangars at the intersection of Townsend Avenue and Frost Street. Three prefabricated Bellman hangars are in their original location, defining the original aprons serving Runway No.1. Four underground fuel tanks have survived changes to the runway system as has a small section of the dispersal taxiway associated with a fuel tank and a short section of Runway 4 (1940). The alignments of Runways 1 and 4 are reflected in the intersection and alignment of Knox-Knight and Townsend Avenue.\nThe road network south of Ford Road and west of, and including, McNamara Drive identifies the early camp and operations structures and the major alignments of the early runway system. Characteristically, extant buildings from this period are aligned with the road layout, sub-station and emergency powerhouse, Bellman hangars with sufficient structures and services remaining to illustrate the separation of functions and the wartime functioning of the base. The tennis courts provided for the NCOs and officers and the community hall (located in Williamtown Village) have also survived. The pump house is located within the site, as is the Hunter Water pumping station of the late 1930s, although it is not owned by Defence.\nThe portable Bellman hangar, of which some 123 were made, was designed in England for quick dismantling and erection, and manufactured by Lysaghts of Newcastle. They were steel framed with a low-pitched roof covered with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting. The extension of the door supports beyond the shell of the building allowed maximum access to the usable spaces.\nThe community hall and pump house were erected in the prevailing timber framed weatherboard vernacular style, with corrugated galvanized iron hipped roofs. The community hall features gablets to the main roof.\n\n\nPost War to c. 1964 (pre Mirage 1965)\nThe main concrete runway and northern taxiways defined the focus of operations and built on the underlying planning with the addition of relocated Bellman hangars and new bomb dumps. The steel framed control tower replaced the earlier tower. In addition workshops, stores, explosive storage areas and armament preparation units were added. The original test butt for the early jet fighter aircraft, was constructed in in-situ reinforced concrete.\nThe planning of sealed roads included Townsend, Henderson, Perrin and Knox-Knight Roads and the realigned Medowie Road. Henderson Road follows the original alignment of Medowie Road. The first airmen's brick dormitory block was erected in 1955 followed the alignments of the earlier road system. Noticeably, later dormitory buildings were arranged in a diagonal manner across the blocks. These included the officer's dormitory compound, the officers mess and airmen's brick dormitory blocks in the same area as the wartime camp. These units were erected to replace the hut style accommodation of the wartime and immediate post-war years.\nBrick married quarters were the first new married quarters erected (before 1954). The cottages are simple rectangular units with gabled, tiled roofs and generous windows. The lounge rooms feature gable wall fireplaces and chimneys. The first airmen's brick dormitory block (1955), the transient airmen's sleeping quarters, is H-shaped in plan, and comprises two two-storey gabled, pitched roof blocks with tiled roofs joined by a single storey, linking block. The later two-storey accommodation blocks are also gabled but with colorbond roofing. The first airmen's brick dormitory block features simple timber sash windows, but has some stylistic content in the projecting entrance porch, characteristic of the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n\nComparison\nThe road network for the original camp, comprising Eaton Road, Ford Road and Townsend Avenue west of McNamara Drive, was completed by 1945. Typically, the alignment of wartime and early post war buildings, such as the first airmen's brick dormitory block, was dictated by the road layout. As an operational wartime base from 1939 to 1945 the provision of Bellman hangars (demountable, prefabricated structures) followed established patterns, also used at RAAF Base Amberley which was developed at the same time. The hangar group typically interfaced between workshops and administration and taxiways and runways.\nAlthough individual bases, such as Fairbairn, Darwin, Amberley and Williamtown show differences in the degree of formal planning, they are organized on a similar functional basis, with the social hierarchy of the RAAF clearly reflected in the location, range and type of accommodation provided.\nThe post-war development of RAAF Base Williamtown reinforced the functional planning of the wartime years. Brick accommodation units used at RAAF Base Richmond from 1935 to 1937 were used as models for the two-storey airman's brick dormitory block erected in 1955. The use of prefabricated housing units stemmed from post-war shortages of materials, which impacted on both the Australian Government and the private sector. The early brick and tile houses (the married quarters) clearly follow designs prepared by the Australian Government and used in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Canberra.\n\n\nCondition\nAs at July 2002, all buildings and structures, with the possible exception of redundant underground fuel tanks and early runway remnants, appeared to be maintained in good order.\n\n\nIntegrity\nThe evolving landscape of the base represents three periods:\n\n1939–1945 World War II\n1946–1964 post World War II and the early jet age\n1965–1982 the Mirage jet fighter\nAs at July 2002, the fabric relating to each of these periods or phases remains essentially intact to document changes in the landscape, which continues to express the original planning and layout of the base during the period 1939–1945. In common with operational changes on other RAAF bases, the Bellman hangars have been modified by the addition of extensions and have in most cases been reclad externally, although the structural frames remain intact. Of the in situ hangars, from 1939 to 1945, Hangar 172 is the most intact retaining the original sliding door systems intact. The parade ground is now used for car parking and is also used for small storage buildings.\n\n\nHeritage listing\nRAAF Base Williamtown buildings were listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\n\nCriterion A: Processes\nThe evolving landscape of RAAF Base Williamtown, comprising Henderson Road, the road network of the 1939–1945 camp, 1939–1945 buildings and structures (substation and emergency powerhouse, underground fuel tanks, parade ground, tennis courts, Bellman hangars, and associated taxiways, sections of runways 1 and 4 and the pump house) and post-war structures and buildings (the main runway and northern taxiways and hardstanding, additional Bellman hangars, married quarters, the first airmen's dormitory block, stores,  test butt, armament preparation units, explosives storage, airmen's dormitory blocks, officer's dormitories, and control tower) is important as the operational and training focus for Australia's jet fighter aircraft. These include the Vampire (1949–1955), Sabre (1955–1964), Mirage (1965–1982) and F/A 18 Hornet (1983–present). Australia's involvement in the Korean War (1949–1951) promoted the development of the base, which in 1945, following the World War II (1939–1945), had been one of ten mainland RAAF bases considered strategically important to Australia's defence, as peacetime base for the RAAF fighter wing. In 1988 RAAF Base Williamtown became the Headquarters for the Tactical Fighter Group.\nThe site was selected for the RAAF in August 1939, when the site was surveyed for an emergency landing ground, a significant factor in its selection being its proximity to Newcastle's steel mills and coal mines. The base is also significant for the use of limited resources through the Government of New South Wales Unemployment Relief Program and the completion of four runways in 1940. Officially opened in February 1941, the base is historically significant for its contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme as No. 2 Recruit Depot and as No. 4 Operational Training Unit between 1942 and 1945.\nThe development of the base in the post-war years reinforced the importance of the peacetime role of RAAF Base Williamtown. This strategic role was reinforced in 1950 by the construction of the first concrete runway in Australia. The strategic role was also reflected in the construction of separate married quarters, reflecting the policy that homes should be provided for at least 40% of the established posts. New headquarters buildings and operational facilities, as well as accommodation for airmen and an equivalent investment in recreational facilities and messes, reinforced the strategic, peacetime role of RAAF Base Williamtown. The wartime and postwar development period 1939–1964, which saw the development of the underlying planning and the introduction of jet fighter aircraft, is the primary focus of this assessment.\n\n\nCriterion B: Rarity\nThe main runway (1950) at RAAF Base Williamtown is of exceptional interest as the first concrete runway constructed in Australia, and as the dedicated operational focus of Australia's RAAF Fighter Wing. The Test Butts are of particular importance for their association with the early use of jet fighters by the RAAF.\n\n\nCriterion D: Characteristic values\nThe street layout of the initial \"camp area\", including the grid pattern road layout, the alignment of Medowie Road (Henderson Road), Parade Ground, Bellman Hangars and the northern taxiway areas (including the alignment of runway 1 and part of the dispersal taxiway associated with runways 1 and 4) and the underground fuel tanks, are important in illustrating the principal functional characteristics of RAAF bases developed in the immediate pre-war years and the early years of the World War II. The Bellman hangars as a group, including in particular the World War 2 hangars, are important in illustrating the principal characteristics and uses of this wartime prefabricated hangar, which enabled the rapid development of RAAF facilities on many World War II RAAF bases. The married quarters and two storey accommodation blocks for officers and airmen (including officer's dormitories and the first airmen's brick dormitory block and officers' dormitory compound) are important in illustrating the approach to the provision of permanent, up-to-date brick housing from 1955, during the consolidation of the RAAF's peacetime role. Other buildings important in illustrating the principal characteristics of RAAF facilities developed in the 1950s and 1960s, including overall planning road layout and function, include the officers mess and the new workshops, stores and the armament preparation units.\n\n\nCriterion G: Social value\nRAAF base Williamtown is important to the RAAF and the wider community for its symbolic, cultural and social associations as Australia's dedicated RAAF fighter base.\n\n\nCriterion I: Indigenous tradition\nIndigenous and Natural values of national estate significance exist on this site.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nGraham Brooks and Associates Pty Ltd, Non-Indigenous Heritage Study for Environmental Management Plan, RAAF Base Williamtown, NSW, June 2001.\n\n\nAttribution\n This Wikipedia article was originally based on Williamtown RAAF Base Group, entry number 105639 in the Australian Heritage Database published by the Commonwealth of Australia  2018 under CC-BY 4.0 licence, accessed on {{{accessdate}}}.",

    "text": "Margaret Marian McPartland OBE (née Turner; 20 March 1918 – 20 August 2013), was an English and American jazz pianist, composer, and writer. She was the host of Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz on National Public Radio from 1978 to 2011.\nAfter her marriage to trumpeter Jimmy McPartland in February 1945, she resided in the United States when not travelling throughout the world to perform. In 1969, she founded Halcyon Records, a recording company that issued albums for 10 years. In 2000, she was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master. In 2004, she was given a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement. In 2007, she was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Although known mostly for jazz, she composed other types of music as well, performing her own symphonic work A Portrait of Rachel Carson with the University of South Carolina Symphony Orchestra in 2007. In 2010, she was named a member of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n\nEarly life\nMargaret Marian Turner was born on 20 March 1918 to Frank and Janet (née Payne) Turner in Slough, Buckinghamshire, west of central London, England. She had one younger sibling, a sister, Joyce. She demonstrated early aptitude at the piano, and would later realize that she had perfect pitch. Margaret (Maggie to her family) studied violin from the age of nine, but never took to the instrument. She also trained as a vocalist and received a number of favorable reviews in the local paper. Janet refused to find her daughter a piano teacher until the age of 16, by which time Margaret was already adept at learning songs by ear. This lack of early education meant that Margaret was never a strong reader of notated music, and would always prefer to learn through listening.\nTurner studied at Miss Hammond's School for Young Children from 1924 to 1927, Avonclyffe from 1927 to 1929, Holy Trinity Convent from 1929 to 1933, and finally Stratford House for Girls from 1933 to 1935. There, she met Doris Mackie, a teacher who would be hugely influential on her. Mackie suggested to the Turners that Margaret should apply to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, since she clearly had an aptitude and passion for music. She was accepted in the spring of 1935 on the merit of her \"rampant enthusiasm, God-given faculty, and a dangerous surplus of imagination\" and in spite of the fact that she was \"sadly lacking in technique.\"\n\n\nEarly career (Europe)\nTurner pursued studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where she worked toward a performance degree that would enable her to become a concert pianist, though she also did coursework in vocal performance. She studied with Orlando Morgan, who also taught Myra Hess. Turner's talents for improvisation and composition were recognized early when she won the Wainwright Memorial Scholarship for Composition, the Worshipful Company of Musicians Composition Scholarship, and the Chairman's School Composition Prize in 1936 and 1937. Much to her family's dismay, she developed a love for American jazz and musicians such as Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, Teddy Wilson, and Mary Lou Williams, among others. In 1938, Turner sought out Billy Mayerl at his School of Modern Syncopation to seek lessons, and was convinced to audition for his piano quartet. Despite her family's efforts to keep her at Guildhall, Turner left to join Billy Mayerl's Claviers, a four-piano vaudeville act. There, she elected to perform under the stage name of Marian Page. She promised her family that she would one day return to finish her degree at Guildhall. After the Claviers tour, Marian returned to London in the fall of 1938 and played sporadically for shows and on the Carroll Lewis Show. To avoid conscription during World War II, she volunteered for the Entertainment National Service Association (ENSA), a group that was playing for Allied troops, in fall 1940. In 1944, her friend Zonie Dale recommended that Marian join the United Service Organizations (USO) because they paid more and played with American men.\nWith the USO, Marian went through basic training and was issued a set of combat gear – GI boots, helmet, and uniform. Marian was assigned to a group called the Band Wagon, which followed the Allied forces after the D-Day invasion. In anticipation of wartime demands, Marian learned to play the accordion in the event that there was no piano available with which to play for the troops.\nIn St Vith, Belgium, on 14 October 1944, Marian met a Chicago cornetist named Jimmy McPartland at a jam session. McPartland had volunteered for the army and was serving active duty when his superiors realized that he could do better work as an entertainer, since he was well known among the troops. Jimmy was solicited to put together a sextet to entertain the troops, and invited Marian to join him as their pianist. They soon fell in love, and signed an official US Army marriage document on 14 December 1944. They married on 3 February 1945, in Aachen, Germany, and played at their own military base wedding. Her marriage to an American male automatically gave Marian US citizenship, side by side with her British citizenship. Marian was reluctant to tell her parents of the marriage, and had Jimmy's commanding officer tell them when he had lunch with them in England in early 1945. It was with Jimmy that Marian began her first real training in jazz. Jimmy and Marian did their first recording together on 6 January 1946 in London before leaving for the US. They arrived in New York City on 23 April 1946, and Marian would never live outside of the US again. However, she kept her British citizenship throughout her life.\n\n\nEarly career (Chicago 1946–50 and New York City 1950–62)\nAfter the war, Marian and Jimmy moved to Chicago to be near his family. Jimmy was raised in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago, and was an original member of the Austin High Gang that played Chicago-style Dixieland jazz in the 1920s. In June 1946, Marian made her American debut at the Moose Lodge. Soon, Jimmy's group, which now included Marian, landed a standing gig at the Rose Bowl through the end of 1946. This engagement was followed by ones at Taboo, Capitol Lounge, and finally Brass Rail. Marian flourished in Jimmy's group, and by her association with him. They played at clubs like Blue Note and Silhouette with stars like Billie Holiday.\nDuring their Chicago years, Jimmy and Marian visited France in 1949 for the Paris Jazz Festival. This was semi-important for their association with the European jazz scene, but more significant because it marked the beginning of Marian's writing career. Marian's testimonial about the festival ran in the July 1949 issue of DownBeat.\nIn 1949, the McPartlands settled in Manhattan, living in an apartment in the same building as the Nordstrom Sisters. In 1950, she announced that she would no longer go by her stage name, Marian Page, but would now go by her married name, Marian McPartland. With Jimmy's help and encouragement, Marian started her own trio, which started performing at the newly opened 54th street club called The Embers on 8 May 1951. Here, she learned how to lead her own group, and played with musicians such as Roy Eldridge, Coleman Hawkins, and Terry Gibbs. After trying out different combos, she settled on a trio of piano, bass, and drums that would soon become standard. This gig led to a laudatory DownBeat profile by Leonard Feather, an advocate for women in jazz, who wrote that French fans would be unlikely to accept her because \"She is English, white and a girl--three hopeless strikes against her from the Gallic angle. Yet, if you ask Coleman Hawkins...or any of the other cats...you'll know from their enthusiasm that ...She's a fine, swinging pianist...\" (McPartland sometimes loosely paraphrased Feather as saying \"Oh, she'll never make it: she's English, white and a woman.\") She signed her first record deal without Jimmy in 1951, with Savoy Records.\nOn 2 February 1952, McPartland opened a gig at the Hickory House that continued regularly through November 1962. During her time at the Hickory House, Duke Ellington would often be in the audience. Ellington was influential on McPartland's development as a pianist, and told her she played too many notes, a sentiment she would take to heart. The drummer Joe Morello joined the group in 1953 and was a member of the trio until he departed to join Dave Brubeck's Quartet in late 1956. In December 1953, Bill Crow replaced Vinnie Burke as her bass player. This trio of McPartland, Morello, and Crow would stay together through 1956, and be named Small Group of the Year by Metronome in 1954. The success of this trio would lead to the signing of McPartland to Capitol Records for five albums. The group of McPartland, Crow, and Morello would become McPartland's best-known trio. It has been argued that McPartland never received the acclaim she deserved because she never stayed with any sidemen long enough to develop a unique sound, her 1953-1956 group being the exception to this rule.\nIn 1956, McPartland and Morello began an affair that would continue for almost ten years. In late 1956, Morello's wife discovered their affair, and Brubeck hired Morello away.\nMcPartland continued writing testimonial pieces for journals such as Down Beat after the favorable reception of her first piece in 1949. Toward the end of the 1950s, she began to write about the issue of being a woman in jazz. She questioned \"Can't we women make our own contribution to jazz by playing like women, but still capturing the essential elements of jazz – good beat – good ideas – honesty and true feeling?\"\nIn the 1953–54 season, McPartland appeared as a regular on NBC's Judge for Yourself quiz program emceed by Fred Allen.\n\nIn 1958 a black and white group portrait of 57 notable jazz musicians, including McPartland, was photographed in front of a brownstone in Harlem, New York City. Art Kane, a freelance photographer working for Esquire magazine, took the photo, which was called, \"A Great Day in Harlem\", and it became a well-known image of New York's jazz musicians of the time. Immediately preceding her death in August 2013, she was one of only four of the 57 participating musicians who were still alive. After many years of recording for labels such as Capitol, Savoy, Argo, Sesac, Time, and Dot, in 1969 she founded her own record label, Halcyon Records, before having a long association with the Concord label. Marian and Jimmy divorced in 1972, but they remained close, and remarried in 1991, shortly before Jimmy's death.\n\n\nMid-career (New York City 1962–78)\nAfter McPartland's Hickory House engagement ended, Benny Goodman offered her a spot in his septet for his 1963 tour. It quickly became clear that Goodman did not like her more modern playing style, and she shifted out of the full septet to play exclusively in the trio numbers. The physical and emotional strain of the last few years weighed hard on Marian during the stressful tour, and she checked herself into the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas for two weeks as an outpatient when the tour finished. There, she was referred to Dr. William Benjamin, a psychotherapist who would counsel her for many years.\nMcPartland's counselling with Benjamin eventually led her to a number of important choices, the first being the decision to end her affair with Morello in the spring of 1964. The second was her decision to divorce Jimmy in the summer of 1967, a separation that was made public in December of the same year. Despite their divorce, Marian and Jimmy would remain close friends and eventually remarry weeks before Jimmy's 1991 death.\nIn the late 1960s, McPartland began reviewing albums for DownBeat. During 1966–69, she reviewed 34 albums. Her perspective was unique, because she approached the review from her background as a peer musician. After 1969, she stopped reviewing, but continued to write instructional pieces. In May 1966, she began hosting a weekly radio show called A Delicate Balance that aired for two hours each Saturday. The show began as a traditional program, but soon shifted to include interviews as well. These interviews and connections would prove to be an important precursor to McPartland's Piano Jazz series.\nMarian struggled to connect to the avant-garde jazz of the late 1960s, though she did endeavor to learn and adapt the free jazz style for her own use. She was not in high demand as a performer through the 1960s, and her focus shifted to focus on jazz education. Marian became aware of the need for jazz education when she was convinced to do a workshop at a high school in Rochester, New York, in 1956. She realized that the adolescents were totally unaware of jazz, and utterly enamored with the new rock and roll sweeping the country. In 1964, she began teaching at jazz clinics organized by Clem DeRosa, one of her former drummers. DeRosa was developing a jazz curriculum in the Huntington, New York school district. In 1966, DeRosa received a grant that allowed him to further develop his method, and he moved to the Cold Spring Harbor High School. Through this grant, he was able to pay Marian full-time to teach with him through 1967. McPartland continued to work in jazz education throughout the following decade. One of her most challenging projects was in 1974 when she received a Washington DC grant to teach in poor black neighborhoods. McPartland would be recognized for her work in jazz education in 1986, when she received the Jazz Educator of the Year award. She would continue to teach and judge jazz festivals for young people for the rest of her life.\nDuring an engagement at the Apartment, a New York club, in February 1967 she met Alec Wilder, a man with whom she would develop a great friendship and who would encourage her to write and compose. They encountered each other again when Marian was touring in Rochester and began a collaboration that would become important, though difficult, for both of them. In 1974, Marian recorded an album, Marian McPartland Plays the Music of Alec Wilder, which was released by Halcyon Records.\nAfter many years of recording for labels such as Capitol, Savoy, Argo Records, Sesac, Time, Design, and Dot Records, in 1969 McPartland co-founded her own record label, Halcyon Records. She would later have a long association with the Concord Records label. McPartland founded Halcyon with Sherman Fairchild and Hank O'Neal. They joined with a mind to produce the work of underrated or underrepresented jazz artists. Their first album was Interplay, a McPartland–Linc Milliman (bass) album of duets. Fairchild died in 1971, and McPartland bought out O'Neal in order to maintain the label for self-distribution or other projects. The last Halcyon album was released in 1979.\nBy 1977, McPartland had become a public advocate for women in jazz, and headlined the first Women's Jazz Festival, which took place in Kansas City, 17–19 March 1978. In the late '70s, Marian performed internationally, including appearances in Asia, Europe, South America, and across the United States. McPartland rarely used women in her combos, but she helped many young women find their feet in the jazz business such as Mary Fettig (first female musician in the Stan Kenton band) and Susannah McCorkle.\nMcPartland appears in the 5 December 1977 issue of The New Yorker – Goings on About Town, \"presides over the keyboard in the Bemelmans Bar (at the Carlyle Hotel) Mondays through Saturdays from nine-thirty to one (a.m.).\"  It's likely this was a gig she held for a time in 1977.\nIn 1978, McPartland performed Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. Though the performance was poorly reviewed by most critics, she went on to perform the work with many symphonies across the country. Due to her poor sight-reading skills, she learned the piece principally by ear.\n\n\nLate career (Piano Jazz and on)\n\nIn 1964, Marian McPartland launched a new venture on WBAI-FM (New York City), conducting a weekly radio program that featured recordings and interviews with guests. Pacifica Radio's West Coast stations also carried this series, which paved the way for Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz, a National Public Radio (NPR) series that began recording on 8 October 1978 and premiered on 1 April 1979 on WLTR (South Carolina) and was offered nationally by NPR. McPartland was offered the opportunity primarily on the recommendation of her friend Alec Wilder, who hosted American Popular Song until his health prevented him from continuing the program. Piano Jazz was the longest-running cultural program on NPR, as well as one of the longest-running jazz programs ever produced on public radio. The theme, \"Kaleidoscope\", was an original composition by McPartland. The program featured McPartland at the keyboard with guest performers, usually pianists, but also singers, guitarists, other musicians, and even the author Studs Terkel, who was not a musician. The first show aired 1 April 1979, with guest Mary Lou Williams. Several Piano Jazz programs have been released on CD by Concord Records.\nIn 1984, Piano Jazz received the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. In 1986, it won both the Gabriel Award and the NY Gold Medal Awards.\nShe celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NPR series with a live taping at the Kennedy Center for which Peter Cincotti was the guest. After not having recorded a new show since September 2010, on 10 November 2011, NPR announced that McPartland was stepping down as host of Piano Jazz. She then asked her long-time friend, jazz pianist Jon Weber, to carry on with the show. As a result, Piano Jazz: Rising Stars, an NPR series hosted by Weber, began broadcast on 3 January 2012. Piano Jazz soon returned to the air in repeat broadcasts.\nDue to Marian's increased profile, mostly from the success of Piano Jazz, she began booking increasingly prestigious shows and recording more often. McPartland was beloved for bringing in an underrepresented demographic to jazz clubs. She also used her celebrity to champion young artists and feature them in her combos.\nIn 1979, McPartland received an NEH grant to write a book about women in jazz, focusing specifically on The International Sweethearts of Rhythm. This endeavor was further supported with a 1980 Guggenheim Fellowship. Although she published a provisional essay in June 1980, she struggled to complete her book. In the early '80s, many books were published about the rise of women in jazz, including interviews with many of the same people that she interviewed, thereby reducing the novelty of her own research. She eventually published a collection of 13 essays, All in Good Time, in 1987. She attempted to write her autobiography for many years, with the encouragement of Alec Wilder, but never completed the project.\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nDownBeat honored McPartland with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994.\nMcPartland was awarded a Grammy in 2004, a Trustees' Lifetime Achievement Award, for her work as an educator, writer, and host of NPR Radio's long-running Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz. Although a master at adapting to her guest's musical styles and having a well-known affinity for beautiful and harmonically rich ballads, she also recorded many tunes of her own. Her compositions included \"Ambiance\", \"There'll Be Other Times\", \"With You in Mind\", \"Twilight World\", and \"In the Days of Our Love\".\nJust before her 90th birthday, McPartland composed and performed a symphonic piece, A Portrait of Rachel Carson, to mark the centennial of the environmental pioneer.\nMcPartland was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours, \"For services to jazz and to aspiring young musicians in the USA\".\nMcPartland's encyclopaedic knowledge of jazz standards, highly musical ear, involvement in over 60 years of evolving jazz styles, and rich experience blending with radio guests led to a musical style that was described as \"flexible and complex, and almost impossible to pigeonhole.\" She was known as a harmonically and rhythmically complex and inventive improviser. \"She was never content to be in one place, and always kept improving. She has great ears and great harmonics. Because of her ear, she can go into two or three different keys in a tune and shift with no problem.\"\nMcPartland was also a synesthete, associating different musical keys with colours, stating that \"The key of D is daffodil yellow, B major is maroon, and B flat is blue.\"\nMcPartland died at her home in Port Washington, New York on 20 August 2013. She was 95.\n\n\nDiscography\n\nJazz at Storyville (Savoy, 1951)\nLullaby of Birdland (Savoy, 1952)\nMarian McPartland Trio (Savoy, 1952)\nThe Magnificent Marian McPartland at the Piano (Savoy,

The lake contains many fish, but primarily Bluegill, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch. The Lake is considered mesotrophic.\nBush Lake is near Hyland Lake Park Reserve.\n\n\nHistory\nWhen European settlement of the area began in the mid-19th century, the contemporary Bush Lake water body was a bay in Andersons Lake, now an interconnected series of lakes (each of which are also former bays) called the Anderson Lakes. By as early as 1890, there existed a distinct water body referred to as Bush Lake.\n\n\nRecreational Facilities\nBush Lake is a popular destination in the summer for recreation. The facilities are split between 2 parks, one on the east side of the lake and the other on the west side. Beach and swimming access is from East Bush Lake Park while canoe and boat access is from West Bush Lake Park. West Bush Lake Park also offers canoe and kayak storage. Additionally, both parks offer public restrooms, picnic shelters, fishing piers, volleyball courts, and playgrounds. A multi-use path connects the two parks along the southern edge of the lake. In the past, a daily parking fee was required for users parking at East Bush Lake Park during the summer but since 2020, it has been free for all users. While boats are allowed on Bush Lake, motors are limited to 6 horsepower.\n\n\nReferences\n\nCity of Bloomington:Bush Lake Beach\n\n\nExternal links\nMinnesota Department of Natural Resources report on Bush Lake",

    "text": "Nikki Jean Finke (December 16, 1953 – October 9, 2022) was an American blogger, journalist, publisher and writer. She also was the founder, editor-in-chief and president of Deadline Hollywood, a website with original content consisting of reporting and commentary on the business of the entertainment industry by her and other show business journalists. She founded and was the chief executive officer of Hollywood Dementia LLC and its website, HollywoodDementia.com, for showbiz short fiction.\n\n\nEarly life\nFinke was born at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, on December 16, 1953, the younger of two daughters born to Jewish parents, Robert and Doris Finke. She was raised in the affluent village of Sands Point, New York, on Long Island.\nFinke was educated at Buckley Country Day School and the Hewitt School, before attending Wellesley College, where she studied political science and was the editor-in-chief of the college newspaper.\n\n\nCareer\nFinke's first job after Wellesley was in New York congressman Ed Koch's Washington, D.C. office. She decided to become a reporter after seeing how Koch and his staff would show deference to reporters.\nIn 1975, Finke joined the Associated Press (AP) and covered Koch's successful 1977 New York City mayoral campaign. She then worked on the AP's foreign desk at the New York City headquarters, Baltimore, Boston, Moscow and London. Finke later worked for The Dallas Morning News. She joined the staff of Newsweek as a correspondent in Washington and Los Angeles, then at the Los Angeles Times as a staff writer, covering entertainment and features. Finke became the West Coast Editor for The New York Observer, and then New York, where she penned Hollywood business columns. She also wrote for The New York Times, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, The Washington Post, Salon, Premiere and Los Angeles.\nFinke joined the New York Post in 2001, but was fired in early 2002, after she reported that The Walt Disney Company was destroying documents related to a licensing dispute. She then sued Disney and the Post for $10 million, alleging the companies had colluded to suppress coverage of the story; she received an out-of-court settlement. Afterward, LA Weekly hired her and began running her column \"Deadline Hollywood\". In 2006, she began the Deadline (Deadline Hollywood Daily until September 2009) blog as a daily online version of her weekly column. She described it as her \"forum to break news about the infotainment industry.\"\nThe New York Times described Finke as \"a digital-age Walter Winchell\" with an \"in your face\" writing style, who is \"feared by [Hollywood] executives\". Deadline became a key information portal during the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, tripling her readership; according to the Times: \"Finke's Web site has become a critical forum for Hollywood...But it [is the] strike that may have finally solidified her position as a Hollywood power broker\". Finke claimed to have worked \"almost around the clock\" during the strike; in 2009, the Los Angeles Times noted her announcement of a five-day vacation.\nIn 2008, Finke was named on Elle's 25 most influential women in Hollywood list, and to the Heeb 100. In 2009, she sold Deadline to Jay Penske's Mail.com Media Corp, reportedly for $14 million, under an agreement by which she would continue as the editor-in-chief and President of the website which would feature her reporting and commentary.\nOn November 5, 2013, Deadline Hollywood announced Nikki Finke's departure. On June 12, 2014, she launched NikkiFinke.com. On August 3, 2015, she launched HollywoodDementia.com as a site for showbiz short fiction written by her and other insiders. The New York Times said: \"Ms. Finke finds herself facing a daunting new chapter in her career: a plan to leave journalism and write and publish fiction about the entertainment industry\". Finke said \"There's a lot of truth in fiction\", and added \"There are things I am going to be able to say in fiction that I can't say in journalism right now\".\nOn May 11, 2016, Deadline printed Finke's remembrance at how she founded Deadline Hollywood on the occasion of the website's ten-year anniversary. \"When I started Deadline Hollywood Daily, as it was called way back in 2006, I needed a quicker way to report breaking entertainment news than my weekly newspaper column. So I bought the URL DeadlineHollywoodDaily.com for 14 bucks and change. I didn't set out to be a disruptor. Or an internet journalist who created something out of nothing that put the Hollywood trades back on their heels, and today, under Penske Media ownership, is a website worth $100+ million. Or a woman with brass balls, attitude and ruthless hustle, who told hard truths about the moguls and who accurately reported scoops first.\"\n\n\nReception\nIn 2006, Finke's LA Weekly columns won First Place in the Alternative Weekly Awards in the category of \"Media Reporting/Criticism, Circulation >50,000\". In 2007, Finke won the Los Angeles Press Club's Southern California Journalism Award for \"Entertainment Journalist of the Year\", with the judges commenting: \"Reading Nikki Finke's salaciously candid coverage of Hollywood and its inhabitants almost feels like a guilty pleasure.

    "text": "Why Don't Students Like School?: A Cognitive Scientist Answers Questions About How the Mind Works and What It Means for the Classroom is a 2009 educational psychology book by Daniel T. Willingham, published by Jossey-Bass. The work applies cognitive science research to classroom teaching practices, presenting nine principles about how students think and learn. Willingham, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, wrote the book to bridge the gap between cognitive psychology research and practical teaching methods.\n\n\nSummary\nIn Why Don't Students Like School? Willingham's explores the intersection between cognitive science and educational practice. He seeks to clarify why students often struggle to engage with schoolwork and outlines cognitive principles that educators can leverage to improve student learning and enjoyment of school. Central to Willingham’s thesis is the idea that the human brain is not primarily designed for thinking but rather to avoid it. Thinking is characterized as slow, effortful, and uncertain, which leads individuals to rely on memory and previously learned strategies to navigate most situations.  Willingham asserts that people do enjoy thinking when the cognitive challenges they face are within their abilities to solve. The satisfaction of successfully resolving a cognitive challenge can motivate further learning and engagement.\nWillingham emphasizes that student curiosity and willingness to engage cognitively depend greatly on the level of challenge presented. If problems are perceived as too easy or too difficult, students lose interest or become frustrated. The ideal cognitive task is described as one that is challenging yet achievable, generating feelings of satisfaction upon successful completion. This understanding is crucial for educators aiming to craft effective classroom experiences. One prominent issue addressed in the book is the reliance on rote memorization in education, often criticized as ineffective or superficial. However, Willingham argues that factual knowledge is essential to higher-order cognitive processes like critical thinking and problem-solving. Without a solid foundation of background knowledge, students struggle to understand and engage deeply with new information. The book encourages an educational approach that integrates the teaching of factual knowledge with skills development.\nWillingham also explores specific educational topics through the lens of cognitive science, such as standardized testing, abstract concept comprehension, and differentiated instruction. He argues that standardized tests, despite their perceived shortcomings, can effectively measure foundational knowledge necessary for advanced cognitive skills. He discusses why students often remember information presented through television or visual media better than classroom lectures, attributing this difference to the cognitive mechanisms engaged by narrative and visual imagery.\nThe book addresses the difficulties students face in understanding abstract ideas, suggesting that educators make abstract concepts concrete through examples and analogies. Willingham proposes instructional practices such as deliberate and thoughtful drilling to promote automaticity of foundational skills, freeing cognitive resources for more complex problem-solving tasks.\nAnother important topic covered is the adjustment of teaching strategies to accommodate different types of learners. Willingham critiques common misconceptions about learning styles, arguing that rather than categorizing students, educators should focus on varying instructional approaches to enhance engagement and understanding universally.\nIn response to the challenges posed by technological integration in education, Willingham dedicates significant attention to evaluating educational technologies. He advises educators to critically assess new technologies by considering their proven effectiveness, cost, ease of use, and their alignment with pedagogical goals. This approach seeks to prevent reliance on technology as a panacea and instead promotes its purposeful integration.\nThe final chapters of the book reflect on how educators can support slower learners effectively. Willingham emphasizes the importance of understanding cognitive limitations, differentiating instruction carefully, and fostering an inclusive classroom environment that acknowledges and accommodates varied learning paces.\n\n\nReception\nThe book received positive reviews from major publications and educational journals. The Wall Street Journal wrote that \"Mr. Willingham's answers apply just as well outside the classroom. Corporate trainers, marketers and, not least, parents—anyone who cares about how we learn—should find his book valuable reading.\" The New York Times referenced the book's discussion of educational practices, noting Willingham's analysis of how \"drilling often conjures up images of late-19th-century schoolhouses, with students singsonging state capitals in unison without much comprehension of what they have learned.\"\nLauren Vega O'Neil, reviewing the book for the educational publication \"Learning and the Brain,\" noted that Willingham \"successfully reaches his goal of providing fundamental cognitive principles that are true in the laboratory and the classroom\" and praised his analyses as \"pragmatic and profound.\" Academic reviewers in the Journal of Legal Studies Education highlighted the book's central premise that \"learning requires thinking\" and its contribution to understanding how to create effective classroom environments.\nThe book has been translated into thirteen languages and is considered among the most influential education books of the 21st century, alongside works by E.D. Hirsch and Doug Lemov. A second edition was published in 2021, updating research on intelligence and adding new material on technology in education while maintaining the original's core principles.\n\n\nReferences",

It was established in 1972 to promote local modern art and artistic craftsmanship. Situated in a privileged location, it was replaced in 2010 by a tower building with residential and commercial facilities.\n\n\nHistory and artistic importance\nWith political support by former president Julius Nyerere, Nyumba ya Sanaa was founded by the US-American Maryknoll Sister Jean Pruitt in 1972 as a place to support local artists by organizing workshops, exhibitions and sale of their works. The centre also staged dance and music exhibitions and was a popular visitor attraction in Dar es Salaam.\nPainter and sculptor George Lilanga, one of the most famous and internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artists, began his career at the centre. Parts of the building, as well as its main entrance gates, were decorated by Lilanga. After it was destroyed to make room for a modern business tower, sculptures of shetani figures that were included in these gates were bought and restored by a German collector. They are documented in the book George Lilanga: The Doors of Nyumba ya Sanaa. Other notable Tanzanian artists who worked at Nyumba ya Sanaa included Augustino Malaba, Patrick Francis Imanjama, or Robino Ntila.\nAt the end of 2016, Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania, USA, presented a traveling  exhibition from Syracuse University Art Galleries, entitled Nyumba Ya Sanaa: Works from the Maryknoll Collection with artworks by 22 Tanzanian artists - including prints, drawings, watercolors, sculptures, and textiles, that were donated by the Maryknoll Sisters. Some of the artists featured were George Lilanga, Augustino Malaba, Robino Ntila, Chanuo Maundu, Patrick Francis Imanjama, Dastan Nyedi and Edward Francis Kiiza.\n\n\nSee also\nCulture of Tanzania\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFurther reading\nKamphausen, Peter-Andreas / Hamburg Mawinga Collection (2021).

The film was released on July 28, 1995.\nIn the film, a systems analyst with few personal contacts learns that all records about her life have been deleted, that her house has also been emptied, she must now find a way to reclaim her original identity.\n\n\nPlot\nUnited States Under Secretary of Defense Michael Bergstrom commits suicide after being informed that he has tested positive for HIV.\nAngela Bennett is a freelance systems analyst worker in Venice, Los Angeles. Her relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother, who is institutionalized with Alzheimer's disease and often forgets who she is. Angela's co-worker Dale, in San Francisco, sends her a floppy disk of the band website \"Mozart's Ghost\" with a backdoor labeled \"π\" that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called \"Gatekeeper\" sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg. Angela and Dale agree to meet the next morning, as he is planning on taking his own plane, but the navigation system in Dale's private aircraft malfunctions and the plane crashes, killing him.\nAngela travels to Cozumel, Mexico, on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin. After seducing Angela, Devlin pays a mugger to steal her purse. He chases the mugger, catches him, and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting the mugger dead.The robber takes Angela out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Angela's dinghy collides with rocks. She is unconscious in the hospital for three days.\nWhen Angela wakes up, she finds that the disk was ruined by the sun and all records of her life have been deleted. Because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity. Angela's Social Security number is now assigned to a \"Ruth Marx\", for whom Devlin has entered an arrest record. When Angela calls her own desk at Cathedral Software, an impostor answers and offers her old life back in exchange for the disk. She contacts the only other person who knows her by sight, psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion. He checks her into a hotel, offers to contact a friend at the FBI, and arranges to have her mother moved for her safety.\nUsing her knowledge of the backdoor and a password found in Devlin's wallet, Angela logs into the Bethesda Naval Hospital's computers and learns that Under Secretary of Defense Bergstrom, who had opposed Gatekeeper's use by the federal government, was murdered by altering the results of his HIV test, leading to a misdiagnosis. Fellow hacker \"Cyberbob\" connects π with the \"Praetorians\", a group of cyberterrorists linked to recent computer failures around the country. Angela and Cyberbob plan to meet, but the Praetorians intercept their online chat. Angela escapes from Devlin, who is revealed to be a contract killer for the cyberterrorists, but the Praetorians kill Champion by tampering with pharmacy and hospital computer records. After Angela is arrested by the California Highway Patrol, a man identifying himself as Champion's FBI friend frees her from jail. She realizes he is an impostor and escapes again, resulting in the impostor's death in a car crash.\nNow wanted for murder and thought to be Ruth Marx, Angela hitchhikes to Cathedral's office where, using her impostor's computer, she connects the cyberterrorists to Gregg Microsystems and uncovers their scheme: once the Praetorians sabotage an organization's computer system, Gregg sells Gatekeeper to it and gains unlimited access through the backdoor. Angela emails evidence of the backdoor and Gregg's involvement with the Praetorians to the FBI from the Moscone Center and tricks Devlin into releasing a virus into Gregg's mainframe, destroying Gatekeeper and undoing the erasure of her identity. During a battle on the catwalks of the convention center, Devlin accidentally kills the Angela impostor from Cathedral Software, but Angela ambushes him, causing him to fall to his death. Angela regains her identity, home, and life. She then reunites with her mother, and the conspiracy is exposed, with Gregg being arrested by the FBI.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\nIn October 1994, Bullock committed to filming The Net from mid-January through April 10, 1995. The Net was filmed in San Francisco's Moscone Center on Thursday, January 5, 1995, during Macworld as well as at Washington, D.C., locations in April 1995.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nBox office\nWith an estimated budget of $22 million and a release date of July 28, 1995, The Net grossed $50.7 million in the United States and Canada. Including foreign markets, the film grossed $110.6 million worldwide.\n\n\nCritical response\nBased on 58 reviews, it has an average score of 5.3 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes with 43% of critics giving positive reviews. The site's consensus states: \"The premise isn't without potential and Sandra Bullock is as likable as ever, but The Net lacks sufficient thrills – or plausible plot points – to recommend catching.\" Metacritic, using a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, describing The Net as basically an update of an Alfred Hitchcock trope (\"Innocent Person Wrongly Accused\"), which was in parts contrived but carried by Bullock's naturalistic performance. \nOwen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, complimented Sandra Bullock's performance, saying, \"Bullock pulls you into the movie. Her overripe smile and clear, imploring eyes are sometimes evocative of Julia Roberts\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\nSequel and spin-off TV series\nA sequel named The Net 2.0, starring Nikki DeLoach as Hope Cassidy and directed by Charles Winkler, son of Irwin Winkler, was announced in February 2005.

During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, she aided internees and prisoners of war by supplying them with urgently needed medical supplies, food, clothing and other items. General Jonathan M. Wainwright personally awarded her the Medal of Freedom in 1947 for her efforts during the war.\n\n\nEarly life\nNancy Belle Craft was born in Keokuk County, Iowa to Elijah J. Craft and Nancy J. Meyers Craft. Her father was an itinerant farm worker and moved his family to Kansas by covered wagon in 1885. At the age of sixteen, Nancy married John G. Norton and became a homemaker and mother. They settled in Lincoln County, Kansas and three children were born to the couple, Mamie Belle Norton (1888-1985), Clement Wilbur Norton (1893-1957) and Victor Kenneth Norton (1904-1907). Nancy divorced sometime after the passing of their third child and moved with her two remaining children to Manhattan, Kansas by 1910. Both mother and daughter eventually decided to become educators and moved to Seattle, Washington to receive training. Nancy worked the first year while Mamie attended school and the following year roles were reversed. They did this until each completed the program.\n\n\nCareer\nDuring 1923, both Nancy and Mamie were hired by the U.S. government to be educators at schools in the Philippines. At that time, education in the Philippines was under close examination by the Measurement and Research Division of Public Schools and by the Monroe Commission, which were initiated by the Philippine legislature. Nancy and Mamie arrived right before recommendations from the commission were implemented. Within the first few years of living on the island of Luzon, Mamie met and married fellow educator Roscoe E. Lautzenhiser and began a family of her own. During the next eighteen years, both mother and daughter lived and worked in and near Manila.\n\n\nWorld War II\nWhen the Japanese occupation of the Philippines began in 1942, Nancy Belle Norton, her daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, Elizabeth, were swept up in the aftermath. Because of her age (69) and sleight appearance (less than 100lbs) Nancy was not considered a serious threat by Japanese authorities. The other members of her family were sent to Santo Tomas Internment Camp with other American civilians and foreign nationals that were imprisoned there. Her house, located near Manila, was confiscated by Japanese authorities and Filipino friends offered their own homes for shelter during the following two and a half years.\nAfter witnessing the plight of American P.O.W.s and learning about the conditions under which her family was held, Nancy, eventually known as “Miss Nancy Belle” by P.O.W.s and internees, decided to do what she could to help them. Due to her freedom, selflessness and persistence she was able to successfully persevere while dealing with Japanese authorities at the following camps: Bilibid, Pasay, Santo Tomas, Clark Field, Cabanatuan and other locations she attempted to enter. The supplies and food that she brought by kalesa made captivity survivable for hundreds of individuals. \nOne of many post war testimonials about “Miss Nancy Belle” was offered by Army Chaplain Perry O. Wilcox, who was held at Bilibid Internment / P.O.W. Camp. He wrote that she would “plead and argue and resist the opposition of the Japanese authorities until they gave way and let her bring in what she had brought… She never tired and never gave up.” \nAfter U.S. forces landed at Leyte in 1944, Nancy was sent by Japanese authorities to Santo Tomas to live with her family. By planting a victory garden in the camp and contributing its produce to the food pantry she continued to aid others until the liberation of Santo Tomas by Filipino guerillas and elements of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division on February 3, 1945.\n\n\nPost-War life\nNancy Belle Craft Norton returned to the U.S. in 1946. During a simple ceremony at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in April 1947, General Jonathan M. Wainwright presented her with the highest citation that could be given to a civilian by the U.S. government, the Medal of Freedom. Before and after the presentation, dozens of former internees and prisoners of war related their knowledge of the good deeds performed by “Miss Nancy Belle” in the Philippines. During the following decade, Nancy lived with relatives on the west coast of the U.S. and during her final years she received care at a nursing home near San Diego, California. \n\n\nDeath\nAfter suffering from a series of medical issues and a fall, which caused her left hip to break, Nancy Belle Craft Norton died at the age of 91 in a San Diego hospital on December 1, 1963.\n\n\nExternal links\nFind a Grave memorial\n\n\nReferences",

He was Shaykh of Instruction, leader of the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa, founder of the Murabitun World Movement and author of numerous books on Islam, Sufism and political theory. Born in Scotland, he was a playwright and actor before he converted to Islam in 1967 with the Imam of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez, Morocco.\n\n\nEarly life\nIan Dallas was born in Scotland in 1930 of a Highland family. He was a descendant of the literary critic and writer E. S. Dallas. He traveled extensively to Greece, France and Italy. \nHe spent his young adulthood working as a playwright and TV dramatist, having studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1954, he adapted The Face of Love from Troilus and Cressida, which aired on the BBC; a subsequent theatrical staging was the first major stage role for Albert Finney. He worked at the BBC through the mid-1960s; among his other adaptations were film or theatrical versions of Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, Arthur Rimbaud's A Season in Hell, Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time, and Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude. In 1963, he had a small role in Federico Fellini's film 8½ as \"Il partner della telepata\". \nIn the 1960s, Dallas was part of the bohemian \"Swinging London\" scene, befriending many figures in art, music, and film. He had an affair with the actress Vivien Leigh, seventeen years his senior, and was a close confidant of Edith Piaf. Among his friends was the guitarist Eric Clapton; Dallas gave Clapton a copy of The Story of Layla and Majnun by the 12th-century Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, which led Clapton to write the song \"Layla\", performed by his group Derek and the Dominos.\n\n\nConversion\nAs-Sufi converted to Islam in 1967 in Fes, Morocco as Abdalqadir, witnessed by Abdalkarim Daudi, the Imam Khatib of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, and Alal al-Fasi. He then joined the Darqawi order as a student of Muhammad ibn al-Habib. He travelled to Morocco and Algeria with his Shaykh and was further instructed in Sufism by Sidi Hamud ibn al-Bashir of Blida and Sidi Fudul al-Huwari as-Sufi of Fes.\n\n\nTeaching\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi advocated adherence to the Maliki school of Islamic law, which he considered the original legal school of Islam, the tradition of the people of Medina as recorded by Malik ibn Anas, since he considered this the primal formulation of Islamic society and a necessity for the re-establishment of Islam in the current age.\nAbdalqadir was responsible for the establishment of the Ihsan Mosque in Norwich, Norfolk, England,  and the Jumu'a Mosque of Cape Town.\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi taught that suicide terrorism is forbidden under Islamic law, that its psychological pattern stems from nihilism, and that it \"draws attention away from the fact that capitalism has failed.\" He stated that Britain was on \"the edge of terminal decline\" and that only Britain's Muslim population could \"revitalise this ancient realm\". He wrote extensively on the importance of monarchy and personal rule. He regarded the face veil (or niqab) of Muslim women as un-Islamic, describing it as an \"evil Hinduisation of women\".\nIn 2006, he issued a fatwa, following a visit and speech given by Pope Benedict XVI in Germany. In his Fatwa Concerning the Deliberations of Pope Benedict XVI in Germany, he stated that \"in my opinion, Pope Benedict XVI is guilty of insulting the Messenger of Allah\". He was an early mentor of American Sufi scholar, Hamza Yusuf.\n\n\nMurabitun World Movement\nIn February 2014 he distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, \"So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham\". The other major condition of a correct Zakat, he argued, is the existence of personal rule, or Amirate, since Zakat is, by Qur'anic injunction, accepted rulings and established practice, taken by the leader, not given as a voluntary sadaqa.\n\n\nDeath\nAs-Sufi died on 1 August 2021 in Cape Town, South Africa at the age of 91.\n\n\nAuthorship\nThe author of more than 20 books and several essays and articles, As-Sufi's books include:\n\nThe Book of Strangers, (State Univ of New York Press, 1972, ISBN 978-0-88706-990-1)\nThe Way of Muhammad, an existential exposition of the pillars of Islam from the perspective of Sufism (Diwan Press, 1975, OCLC 16373203)\nIndications From Signs, (Diwan Press, June 1980, ISBN 978-0-906512-12-8)\nThe Hundred Steps (Portobello Press, ISBN 978-1-874216-04-9)\nQur'anic Tawhid, (Diwan Press, 1981, ISBN 978-0-906512-14-2)\nLetter to An African Muslim, (Diwan Press, 1981, ISBN 0-906512-13-1)\nKufr – An Islamic Critique, (Diwan Press, 1982, ASIN: B0007C6U32)\nRoot Islamic Education, written on the school of the people of Madinah under the leadership of Imam Malik (Madinah Press, June 1993, ISBN 978-1-874216-05-6)\nOedipus and Dionysus (Freiburg Verlag, 1992, ISBN 1-874216-02-9)\nThe Sign of the Sword, an examination on the judgements on jihād in the light of classical works of fiqh, particularly al-Qawanin al-fiqhiyyah of Ibn Juzayy al-Kalbi, relating it to the contemporary situation and the global dominance of world banking and usury finance.

    "text": "Frederick Walter Robinson (nickname Doc Robbie) (1888–1971) was an Australian academic at the University of Queensland. He was the founder of the university's Fryer Library and one of the instigators of the John Oxley Library (now part of the State Library of Queensland).\n\n\nEarly life\nFrederick Walter Robinson was born in Sydney, Australia in 1888, the son of Joseph Kitson Robinson and his wife Jenny Horne. He was educated at Sydney Boys' High School and the University of Sydney, where he took his B.A with Honours in 1909 and M.A. with Honours graduating in 1910. He won prizes and scholarships in English and classics including the Cooper travelling scholarship, which he used to study at the University of Jena, Germany. He was awarded his Ph.D., magna cum laude, for his thesis in German on Roman history. He returned to Australia where he was an assistant professor and taught modern languages at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1913.\n\n\nWorld War I Service\nAfter World War I broke out, Robinson organised courses in intelligence at Duntroon until he enlisted in September 1915. Influenced by his religious upbringing and the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill', he joined the 8th Field Ambulance, Australian Army Medical Corps, Australian Imperial Force. He was commissioned and promoted honorary captain. From January 1917 Robinson served as intelligence officer with the 5th Division. He was mentioned in dispatches. In July 1918 he was appointed to the Australian Corps School in France and the Education Service School in Cambridge. He became assistant director of education, A.I.F. depots in Britain.\nRobinson married Catherine Campbell Robertson-Glasgow, a voluntary hospital worker on May 14, 1919 in London, and they returned to Australia and his work at Duntroon. He had developed an admiration for the city of Canberra and his book, Canberra's First Hundred Years (1924) reflected that respect.\n\n\nMove to Queensland\nIn 1923, Robinson accepted a position as lecturer in English and German at the University of Queensland. As a young lecturer in the 1920s under the auspices of the English and Modern Languages Association of Queensland, Robinson led a group of university and school teachers of English to conduct a local version of Henry Newbolt's report on the teaching of English in England.\nThe Report on the teaching of English in secondary schools in Queensland, published in October 1927, was the result of four years of characteristically methodical work by Robinson, involving the collation of responses to detailed questionnaires sent to every secondary school in Queensland as well as a considered response to some of the key issues – such as the relative importance of literary and language studies – raised by Newbolt.\nRobinson served briefly as a Major in intelligence work during World War II and then mainly as a censor for the war effort. He was promoted to associate professor of English  in 1946, due to J.D. Story's cautious management of the university. Robinson retired as head of department in 1958 and the university awarded him an honorary doctorate of letters in 1968.\n\n\nLegacy\nRobinson died in 1971. He was survived by his wife and four children. He had been chairman of the John Oxley Memorial Committee, which led to the development of the State Library of Queensland and had inspired the founding of the Fryer Memorial Library of Australian Literature. The original library was stored in a cedar, glass-fronted bookcase in his university office and this cabinet remains on show within the Duhig Building. Thirty-three of his boxes of papers, correspondence and letters are held in the Fryer Library, documenting his work within Queensland and in supporting the establishment of the university at St Lucia.\n\n\nPublications\nRobinson, Frederick Walter (1957), The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Brisbane, University of Queensland Press\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nGreat Britain.

She is remembered for having been the cellmate of Sophie Scholl in the Gestapo headquarters in the Wittelsbacher Palais of Munich before Scholl's execution.\n\n\nLife\nElse Gebel was born in Augsburg. She grew up together with her two brothers, Willy and Arno. She had a close relationship with Willy and both of them shared an apartment until 1935. Gebel's mother died when Else was aged 20. The three siblings were critical of Nazism. Until Kristallnacht pogrom, which occurred on 9–10 November 1938, Gebel worked as chief secretary for the Jewish merchant Max Uhlfelder in Munich. Uhlfelder's department store was destroyed during Kristallnacht, and Uhlfelder himself was arrested and brought to the Dachau concentration camp. Gebel however was able to avoid bringing attention to herself. Until her own arrest, she worked at the Diamalt company which produced malt extract for bakeries.\nGebel and her brother Willy were members of the Aufbruch working team, and later of the communist resistance group led by Beppo Römer and Robert Uhrig. On 20 June 1944, she was sentenced to one year and four months of forced labour in jail, and had to work as a bookkeeper for the Nazi administration.\nDuring her pre-trial custody, Gebel came to know the resistance fighter Sophie Scholl after Scholl's arrest on 18 February 1943, befriended her and engaged her in conversation. Sophie Scholl, her brother Hans and their friend Christoph Probst were sentenced to death and hurriedly executed on 22 February 1943.\nAfter World War II, Gebel kept many memories of her cellmate, which were presented in film in Fünf letzte Tage (1982) and Sophie Scholl – The Final Days (2005).
